# ยง 601.9   NEPA submission schedule for applications governed by the Commemorative Works Act.

(a) *Timing of NEPA compliance.* When, pursuant to the Commemorative Works Act, the National Park Service (NPS) or the General Services Administration (GSA) submits an application to the Commission for approval of a site and design for a commemorative work, NPS or GSA shall be required to comply with NEPA and submit the NEPA documentation timed to coincide with the Commission's review stages as set forth in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.


(b) *Concept site review.* (1) The NEPA Scoping Process shall have been initiated by NPS or GSA before the appropriate agency submits an application to the Commission for concept site review. Available NEPA documentation for all concept sites shall be included in the application to facilitate effective Commission concept review.


(2) The Commission shall provide comments to NPS or GSA on the multiple sites to assist the applicant in selecting a preferred site.


(c) *Concept design review for preferred sites.* (1) The NEPA Public Scoping Process shall have been initiated before NPS or GSA submits an application to the Commission for concept design review. Available NEPA documentation shall be included in the application to facilitate effective Commission concept review.


(2) The Commission shall provide comments to NPS or GSA on the preferred site(s) and the concept designs for each site to facilitate selection of a preferred site and refinement of the memorial design for that site. The Commission may establish guidelines for the applicant to follow in preparing its preliminary and final commemorative work design to avoid, minimize or mitigate environmental impacts including adverse effects on historic properties. If the Commission imposes guidelines to avoid, minimize or mitigate adverse impacts, the applicant shall address the guidelines in its Environmental Document.


(d) *Preliminary site and design review.* (1) NPS or GSA shall have issued or published its Draft Environmental Document for the site selection process and the memorial design and shall have initiated the requisite public comment period before the applicant submits an application for preliminary site and design approval. The NEPA information shall be provided to the Commission to facilitate the Commission's preliminary review and the provision of meaningful Commission comments and directions.


(2) The Commission shall take an action on the preliminary site and design and provide comments to the applicant on the preliminary design to assist the applicant's preparation of a final design.


(e) *Final site and design review.* (1) At the time NPS or GSA submits an application to the Commission for final site and design review, the determination (FONSI or ROD) resulting from the Environmental Document shall be submitted by the applicant in a form consistent with its NEPA regulations. As a Cooperating Agency, NCPC may co-sign the applicant's FONSI or ROD following final Commission approval if co-signing is consistent with the applicant's NEPA regulations. Alternatively, NCPC may prepare and sign its own independent document in accordance with the requirements of ยง 601.16(a) or ยง 601.25(a) through (c).


(2) If at the time of final review, the Commission denies the NPS or GSA project and requests changes thereto, the applicant shall proceed in a manner consistent with applicable law. The Federal Agency applicant may pursue, among others, the option of revising the project in a manner responsive to the Commission's comments. If the Federal Agency pursues this option, it shall review and consider the need for possible changes to its Environmental Document and its FONSI or ROD. Upon resubmission of a revised application for final review, the applicant shall submit a revised Environmental Document and a revised FONSI or ROD if in its judgement revised documents are necessary. If NCPC and the applicant disagree regarding the need for a revised Environmental Document and FONSI or ROD, the parties shall work together to resolve their differences. The final decision regarding the need for a revised Environmental Document and a revised FONSI or ROD shall be made by the Commission's Executive Committee.
