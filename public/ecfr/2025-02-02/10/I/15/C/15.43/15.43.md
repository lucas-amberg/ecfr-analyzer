# § 15.43   Reasons for compromising a claim.

A claim may be compromised for one or more of the reasons set forth below:


(a) The full amount cannot be collected because:


(1) The debtor is unable to pay the full amount within a reasonable time; or


(2) The debtor refuses to pay the claim in full and the Government is unable to enforce collection in full within a reasonable time by enforced collection proceedings.


(b) There is a real doubt concerning the Government's ability to prove its case in Court for the full amount claimed, either because of the legal issues involved or a bona fide dispute as to the facts.


(c) The cost of collecting the claim does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount. The NRC shall apply this reason for compromise in accordance with the guidance in 31 CFR 902.2. 


(d) The NRC shall determine the debtor's inability to pay, the Government's ability to enforce collection, and the amounts that are acceptable in compromise in accordance with the FCCS, 31 CFR part 902. 


(e) Compromises payable in installments are discouraged, but, if necessary, must be in the form of a legally enforceable agreement for the reinstatement of the prior indebtedness less sums paid thereon. The agreement also must provide that in the event of default—


(1) The entire balance of the debt becomes immediately due and payable; and


(2) The Government has the right to enforce any security interest.
