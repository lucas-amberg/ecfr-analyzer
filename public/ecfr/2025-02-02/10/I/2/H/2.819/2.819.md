(a) The Commission may deny an application for a standard design certification if an applicant fails to respond to a request for additional information within 30 days from the date of the request, or within such other time as may be specified.


(b) If the Commission denies an application because the applicant has failed to respond in a timely fashion to a request for additional information, the NRC will publish in the _Federal Register_ a notice of denial and will notify the applicant with a simple statement of the grounds of denial. If a notice of receipt of application, advance notice of proposed rulemaking, or notice of proposed rulemaking for a standard design certification was published on the NRC Web site, then the notice of action on the denial will also be published on the NRC Web site.
