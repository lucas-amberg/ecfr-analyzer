# Appendix G to Part 20—Requirements for Transfers of Low-Level Radioactive Waste Intended for Disposal at Licensed Land Disposal Facilities and Manifests


A waste generator, collector, or processor who transports, or offers for transportation, low-level radioactive waste intended for ultimate disposal at a licensed low-level radioactive waste land disposal facility must prepare a Manifest (OMB Control Numbers 3150-0164, -0165, and -0166) reflecting information requested on applicable NRC Forms 540 (Uniform Low-Level Radioactive Waste Manifest (Shipping Paper)) and 541 (Uniform Low-Level Radioactive Waste Manifest (Container and Waste Description)) and, if necessary, on an applicable NRC Form 542 (Uniform Low-Level Radioactive Waste Manifest (Manifest Index and Regional Compact Tabulation)). NRC Forms 540 and 540A must be completed and must physically accompany the pertinent low-level waste shipment. Upon agreement between shipper and consignee, NRC Forms 541 and 541A and 542 and 542A may be completed, transmitted, and stored in electronic media with the capability for producing legible, accurate, and complete records on the respective forms. Licensees are not required by NRC to comply with the manifesting requirements of this part when they ship:


(a) LLW for processing and expect its return (*i.e.*, for storage under their license) prior to disposal at a licensed land disposal facility;


(b) LLW that is being returned to the licensee who is the “waste generator” or “generator,” as defined in this part; or


(c) Radioactively contaminated material to a “waste processor” that becomes the processor's “residual waste.”


For guidance in completing these forms, refer to the instructions that accompany the forms. Copies of manifests required by this appendix may be legible carbon copies, photocopies, or computer printouts that reproduce the data in the format of the uniform manifest.


NRC Forms 540, 540A, 541, 541A, 542 and 542A, and the accompanying instructions, in hard copy, may be obtained by writing or calling the Office of the Chief Information Officer, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, telephone (301) 415-7232, or by visiting the NRC's Web site at *http://www.nrc.gov* and selecting forms from the index found on the home page.


This appendix includes information requirements of the Department of Transportation, as codified in 49 CFR part 172. Information on hazardous, medical, or other waste, required to meet Environmental Protection Agency regulations, as codified in 40 CFR parts 259, 261 or elsewhere, is not addressed in this section, and must be provided on the required EPA forms. However, the required EPA forms must accompany the Uniform Low-Level Radioactive Waste Manifest required by this chapter.


As used in this appendix, the following definitions apply:


*Chelating agent* has the same meaning as that given in § 61.2 of this chapter.


*Chemical description* means a description of the principal chemical characteristics of a low-level radioactive waste.


*Computer-readable medium* means that the regulatory agency's computer can transfer the information from the medium into its memory.


*Consignee* means the designated receiver of the shipment of low-level radioactive waste.


*Decontamination facility* means a facility operating under a Commission or Agreement State license whose principal purpose is decontamination of equipment or materials to accomplish recycle, reuse, or other waste management objectives, and, for purposes of this part, is not considered to be a consignee for LLW shipments.


*Disposal container* means a container principally used to confine low-level radioactive waste during disposal operations at a land disposal facility (also see “high integrity container”). Note that for some shipments, the disposal container may be the transport package.


*EPA identification number* means the number received by a transporter following application to the Administrator of EPA as required by 40 CFR part 263.


*Generator* means a licensee operating under a Commission or Agreement State license who (1) is a waste generator as defined in this part, or (2) is the licensee to whom waste can be attributed within the context of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985 (e.g., waste generated as a result of decontamination or recycle activities).


*High integrity container* (HIC) means a container commonly designed to meet the structural stability requirements of § 61.56 of this chapter, and to meet Department of Transportation requirements for a Type A package.


*Land disposal facility* has the same meaning as that given in § 61.2 of this chapter.


*NRC Forms 540, 540A, 541, 541A, 542, and 542A* are official NRC Forms referenced in this appendix. Licensees need not use originals of these NRC Forms as long as any substitute forms are equivalent to the original documentation in respect to content, clarity, size, and location of information. Upon agreement between the shipper and consignee, NRC Forms 541 (and 541A) and NRC Forms 542 (and 542A) may be completed, transmitted, and stored in electronic media. The electronic media must have the capability for producing legible, accurate, and complete records in the format of the uniform manifest.


*Package* means the assembly of components necessary to ensure compliance with the packaging requirements of DOT regulations, together with its radioactive contents, as presented for transport.


*Physical description* means the items called for on NRC Form 541 to describe a low-level radioactive waste.


*Residual waste* means low-level radioactive waste resulting from processing or decontamination activities that cannot be easily separated into distinct batches attributable to specific waste generators. This waste is attributable to the processor or decontamination facility, as applicable.


*Shipper* means the licensed entity (*i.e.*, the waste generator, waste collector, or waste processor) who offers low-level radioactive waste for transportation, typically consigning this type of waste to a licensed waste collector, waste processor, or land disposal facility operator.


*Shipping paper* means NRC Form 540 and, if required, NRC Form 540A which includes the information required by DOT in 49 CFR part 172.


*Source material* has the same meaning as that given in § 40.4 of this chapter.


*Special nuclear material* has the same meaning as that given in § 70.4 of this chapter.


*Uniform Low-Level Radioactive Waste Manifest* or *uniform manifest* means the combination of NRC Forms 540, 541, and, if necessary, 542, and their respective continuation sheets as needed, or equivalent.


*Waste collector* means an entity, operating under a Commission or Agreement State license, whose principal purpose is to collect and consolidate waste generated by others, and to transfer this waste, without processing or repackaging the collected waste, to another licensed waste collector, licensed waste processor, or licensed land disposal facility.


*Waste description* means the physical, chemical and radiological description of a low-level radioactive waste as called for on NRC Form 541.


*Waste generator* means an entity, operating under a Commission or Agreement State license, who (1) possesses any material or component that contains radioactivity or is radioactively contaminated for which the licensee foresees no further use, and (2) transfers this material or component to a licensed land disposal facility or to a licensed waste collector or processor for handling or treatment prior to disposal. A licensee performing processing or decontamination services may be a “waste generator” if the transfer of low-level radioactive waste from its facility is defined as “residual waste.”


*Waste processor* means an entity, operating under a Commission or Agreement State license, whose principal purpose is to process, repackage, or otherwise treat low-level radioactive material or waste generated by others prior to eventual transfer of waste to a licensed low-level radioactive waste land disposal facility.


*Waste type* means a waste within a disposal container having a unique physical description (*i.e.*, a specific waste descriptor code or description; or a waste sorbed on or solidified in a specifically defined media).
