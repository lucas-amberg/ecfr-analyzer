# § 20.1202   Compliance with requirements for summation of external and internal doses.

(a) If the licensee is required to monitor under both §§ 20.1502 (a) and (b), the licensee shall demonstrate compliance with the dose limits by summing external and internal doses. If the licensee is required to monitor only under § 20.1502(a) or only under § 20.1502(b), then summation is not required to demonstrate compliance with the dose limits. The licensee may demonstrate compliance with the requirements for summation of external and internal doses by meeting one of the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this section and the conditions in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.


(b) *Intake by inhalation.* If the only intake of radionuclides is by inhalation, the total effective dose equivalent limit is not exceeded if the sum of the deep-dose equivalent divided by the total effective dose equivalent limit, and one of the following, does not exceed unity:


(1) The sum of the fractions of the inhalation ALI for each radionuclide, or


(2) The total number of derived air concentration-hours (DAC-hours) for all radionuclides divided by 2,000, or


(3) The sum of the calculated committed effective dose equivalents to all significantly irradiated 
1 organs or tissues (T) calculated from bioassay data using appropriate biological models and expressed as a fraction of the annual limit.


(c) *Intake by oral ingestion.* If the occupationally exposed individual also receives an intake of radionuclides by oral ingestion greater than 10 percent of the applicable oral ALI, the licensee shall account for this intake and include it in demonstrating compliance with the limits.


(d) *Intake through wounds or absorption through skin.* The licensee shall evaluate and, to the extent practical, account for intakes through wounds or skin absorption.
