(c)(1) Has completed 60 hours of training and experience, including a minimum of 8 hours of classroom and laboratory training, in basic radionuclide handling techniques applicable to the medical use of unsealed byproduct material for uptake, dilution, and excretion studies. The training and experience must include—


(i) Classroom and laboratory training in the following areas— 


(A) Radiation physics and instrumentation; 


(B) Radiation protection; 


(C) Mathematics pertaining to the use and measurement of radioactivity; 


(D) Chemistry of byproduct material for medical use; and 


(E) Radiation biology; and 


(ii) Work experience, under the supervision of an authorized user who meets the requirements in §§ 35.57, 35.190, 35.290, 35.390, or equivalent Agreement State requirements, involving—

(B) Performing quality control procedures on instruments used to determine the activity of dosages and performing checks for proper operation of survey meters; 


(C) Calculating, measuring, and safely preparing patient or human research subject dosages; 


(D) Using administrative controls to prevent a medical event involving the use of unsealed byproduct material; 


(E) Using procedures to contain spilled byproduct material safely and using proper decontamination procedures; and 


(F) Administering dosages of radioactive drugs to patients or human research subjects; and 




(2) Has obtained written attestation that the individual has satisfactorily completed the requirements in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and is able to independently fulfill the radiation safety-related duties as an authorized user for the medical uses authorized under § 35.100. The attestation must be obtained from either:
