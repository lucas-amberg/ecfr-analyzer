# Appendix N to Part 52—Standardization of Nuclear Power Plant Designs: Combined Licenses To Construct and Operate Nuclear Power Reactors of Identical Design at Multiple Sites


The Commission's regulations in part 2 of this chapter specifically provide for the holding of hearings on particular issues separately from other issues involved in hearings in licensing proceedings, and for the consolidation of adjudicatory proceedings and of the presentations of parties in adjudicatory proceedings such as licensing proceedings (§§ 2.316 and 2.317 of this chapter).


This appendix sets out the particular requirements and provisions applicable to situations in which applications for combined licenses under subpart C of this part are filed by one or more applicants for licenses to construct and operate nuclear power reactors of identical design (“common design”) to be located at multiple sites.

1. Except as otherwise specified in this appendix or as the context otherwise indicates, the provisions of subpart C of this part and subpart D of part 2 of this chapter apply to combined license applications subject to this appendix.


2. Each combined license application submitted pursuant to this appendix must be submitted as specified in § 52.75 and 10 CFR 2.101. Each application must state that the applicant wishes to have the application considered under 10 CFR part 52, appendix N, and must list each of the applications to be treated together under this appendix.


3. Each application must include the information required by §§ 52.77, 52.79, and 52.80(a), *provided however*, that the application must identify the common design, and, if applicable, reference a standard design certification under subpart B of this part, or the use of a reactor manufactured under subpart F of this part. The final safety analysis report for each application must either incorporate by reference or include the final safety analysis of the common design, including, if applicable, the final safety analysis report for the referenced design certification or the manufactured reactor.

4. Each combined license application submitted pursuant to this appendix must contain an environmental report as required by § 52.80(b), and which complies with the applicable provisions of 10 CFR part 51, *provided, however,* that the application may incorporate by reference a single environmental report on the environmental impacts of the common design.


5. Upon a determination that each application is acceptable for docketing under 10 CFR 2.101, each application will be docketed and a notice of docketing for each application will be published in the _Federal Register,_ in accordance with 10 CFR 2.104, *provided, however,* that the notice must state that the application will be processed under the provisions of 10 CFR part 52, appendix N, and subpart D of part 2 of this chapter. As the discretion of the Commission, a single notice of docketing for multiple applications may be published in the _Federal Register._

6. The NRC staff shall prepare draft and final environmental impact statements for each of the applications under part 51 of this chapter. Scoping under 10 CFR 51.28 and 51.29 for each of the combined license applications may be conducted simultaneously and joint scoping may be conducted with respect to the environmental issues relevant to the common design.


If the applications reference a standard design certification, then the environmental impact statement for each of the applications must incorporate by reference the design certification environmental assessment. If the applications do not reference a standard design certification, then the NRC staff shall prepare draft and final supplemental environmental impact statements which address severe accident mitigation design alternatives for the common design, which must be incorporated by reference into the environmental impact statement prepared for each application. Scoping under 10 CFR 51.28 and 51.29 for the supplemental environmental impact statement may be conducted simultaneously, and may be part of the scoping for each of the combined license applications.


7. The ACRS shall report on each of the applications as required by § 52.87. Each report must be limited to those safety matters for each application which are not relevant to the common design. In addition, the ACRS shall separately report on the safety of the common design, *provided, however,* that the report need not address the safety of a referenced standard design certification or reactor manufactured under subpart F of this part.


8. The Commission shall designate a presiding officer to conduct the proceeding with respect to the health and safety, common defense and security, and environmental matters relating to the common design. The hearing will be governed by the applicable provisions of subparts A, C, G, L, N, and O of part 2 of this chapter relating to applications for combined licenses. The presiding officer shall issue a partial initial decision on the common design.
