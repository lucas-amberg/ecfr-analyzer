# ยง 54.31   Issuance of a renewed license.

(a) A renewed license will be of the class for which the operating license or combined license currently in effect was issued.


(b) A renewed license will be issued for a fixed period of time, which is the sum of the additional amount of time beyond the expiration of the operating license or combined license (not to exceed 20 years) that is requested in a renewal application plus the remaining number of years on the operating license or combined license currently in effect. The term of any renewed license may not exceed 40 years.


(c) A renewed license will become effective immediately upon its issuance, thereby superseding the operating license or combined license previously in effect. If a renewed license is subsequently set aside upon further administrative or judicial appeal, the operating license or combined license previously in effect will be reinstated unless its term has expired and the renewal application was not filed in a timely manner.


(d) A renewed license may be subsequently renewed in accordance with all applicable requirements.
