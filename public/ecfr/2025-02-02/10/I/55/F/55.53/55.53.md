# § 55.53   Conditions of licenses.

Each license contains and is subject to the following conditions whether stated in the license or not:


(a) Neither the license nor any right under the license may be assigned or otherwise transferred. 


(b) The license is limited to the facility for which it is issued.


(c) The license is limited to those controls of the facility specified in the license.


(d) The license is subject to, and the licensee shall observe, all applicable rules, regulations, and orders of the Commission.


(e) If a licensee has not been actively performing the functions of an operator or senior operator, the licensee may not resume activities authorized by a license issued under this part except as permitted by paragraph (f) of this section. To maintain active status, the licensee shall actively perform the functions of an operator or senior operator on a minimum of seven 8-hour or five 12-hour shifts per calendar quarter. For non-power reactors, the licensee shall actively perform the functions of an operator or senior operator for a minimum of four hours per calendar quarter.


(f) If paragraph (e) of this section is not met, before resumption of functions authorized by a license issued under this part, an authorized representative of the facility licensee shall certify the following:


(1) That the qualifications and status of the licensee are current and valid; and


(2) That the licensee has completed a minimum of 40 hours of shift functions under the direction of an operator or senior operator as appropriate and in the position to which the individual will be assigned. The 40 hours must have included a complete tour of the plant and all required shift turnover procedures. For senior operators limited to fuel handling under paragraph (c) of this section, one shift must have been completed. For non-power reactors, a minimum of six hours must have been completed.


(g) The licensee shall notify the Commission within 30 days about a conviction for a felony.


(h) The licensee shall complete a requalification program as described by § 55.59.


(i) The licensee shall have a biennial medical examination.


(j) The licensee shall not consume or ingest alcoholic beverages within the protected area of power reactors, or the controlled access area of utilization facilities licensed under 10 CFR part 50 that are not power reactors. The licensee shall not use, possess, or sell any illegal drugs. The licensee shall not perform activities authorized by a license issued under this part while under the influence of alcohol or any prescription, over-the-counter, or illegal substance that could adversely affect his or her ability to safely and competently perform his or her licensed duties. For the purpose of this paragraph, with respect to alcoholic beverages and drugs, the term “under the influence” means the licensee exceeded, as evidenced by a confirmed test result, the lower of the cutoff levels for drugs or alcohol contained in subparts E, F, and G of part 26 of this chapter, or as established by the facility licensee. The term “under the influence” also means the licensee could be mentally or physically impaired as a result of substance use including prescription and over-the-counter drugs, as determined under the provisions, policies, and procedures established by the facility licensee for its fitness-for-duty program, in such a manner as to adversely affect his or her ability to safely and competently perform licensed duties.


(k) Each licensee at power reactors shall participate in the drug and alcohol testing programs established pursuant to 10 CFR part 26. Each licensee at utilization facilities licensed under 10 CFR part 50 that are not power reactors shall participate in any drug and alcohol testing program that may be established for that facility.


(l) The licensee shall comply with any other conditions that the Commission may impose to protect health or to minimize danger to life or property.
