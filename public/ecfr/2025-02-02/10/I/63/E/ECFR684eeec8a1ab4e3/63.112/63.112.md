# § 63.112   Requirements for preclosure safety analysis of the geologic repository operations area.

The preclosure safety analysis of the geologic repository operations area must include: 


(a) A general description of the structures, systems, components, equipment, and process activities at the geologic repository operations area; 


(b) An identification and systematic analysis of naturally occurring and human-induced hazards at the geologic repository operations area, including a comprehensive identification of potential event sequences; 


(c) Data pertaining to the Yucca Mountain site, and the surrounding region to the extent necessary, used to identify naturally occurring and human-induced hazards at the geologic repository operations area; 


(d) The technical basis for either inclusion or exclusion of specific, naturally occurring and human-induced hazards in the safety analysis; 


(e) An analysis of the performance of the structures, systems, and components to identify those that are important to safety. This analysis identifies and describes the controls that are relied on to limit or prevent potential event sequences or mitigate their consequences. This analysis also identifies measures taken to ensure the availability of safety systems. The analysis required in this paragraph must include, but not necessarily be limited to, consideration of— 


(1) Means to limit concentration of radioactive material in air; 


(2) Means to limit the time required to perform work in the vicinity of radioactive materials; 


(3) Suitable shielding; 


(4) Means to monitor and control the dispersal of radioactive contamination; 


(5) Means to control access to high radiation areas or airborne radioactivity areas; 


(6) Means to prevent and control criticality; 


(7) Radiation alarm system to warn of significant increases of radiation levels, concentrations of radioactive material in air, and increased radioactivity in effluents; 


(8) Ability of structures, systems, and components to perform their intended safety functions, assuming the occurrence of event sequences; 


(9) Explosion and fire detection systems and appropriate suppression systems; 


(10) Means to control radioactive waste and radioactive effluents, and permit prompt termination of operations and evacuation of personnel during an emergency; 


(11) Means to provide reliable and timely emergency power to instruments, utility service systems, and operating systems important to safety if there is a loss of primary electric power; 


(12) Means to provide redundant systems necessary to maintain, with adequate capacity, the ability of utility services important to safety; and 


(13) Means to inspect, test, and maintain structures, systems, and components important to safety, as necessary, to ensure their continued functioning and readiness. 


(f) A description and discussion of the design, both surface and subsurface, of the geologic repository operations area, including— 


(1) The relationship between design criteria and the requirements specified at § 63.111(a) and (b); and 


(2) The design bases and their relation to the design criteria.
