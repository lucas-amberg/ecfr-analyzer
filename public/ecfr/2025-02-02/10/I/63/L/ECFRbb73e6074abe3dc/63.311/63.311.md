(a) DOE must demonstrate, using performance assessment, that there is a reasonable expectation that the reasonably maximally exposed individual receives no more than the following annual dose from releases from the undisturbed Yucca Mountain disposal system:


(1) 0.15 mSv (15 mrem) for 10,000 years following disposal; and


(2) 1.0 mSv (100 mrem) after 10,000 years, but within the period of geologic stability.
