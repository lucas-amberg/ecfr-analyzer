(i) An evaluation showing that the maximum dose to a member of the public offsite due to a release of radioactive materials would not exceed 1 rem effective dose equivalent or an intake of 2 milligrams of soluble uranium, or 


(ii) An emergency plan for responding to the radiological hazards of an accidental release of special nuclear material and to any associated chemical hazards directly incident thereto.


(2) One or more of the following factors may be used to support an evaluation submitted under paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section: 


(i) The radioactive material is physically separated so that only a portion could be involved in an accident; 


(ii) All or part of the radioactive material is not subject to release during an accident or to criticality because of the way it is stored or packaged;


(iii) In the case of fires or explosions, the release fraction would be lower than 0.001 due to the chemical or physical form of the material; 


(iv) The solubility of the material released would reduce the dose received; 


(v) The facility design or engineered safety features in the facility would cause the release fraction to be lower than 0.001; 


(vi) Operating restrictions or procedures would prevent a release large enough to cause a member of the public offsite to receive a dose exceeding 1 rem effective dose equivalent; or 


(vii) Other factors appropriate for the specific facility. 


(3) Emergency plans submitted under paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section must include the following information: 


(i) *Facility description.* A brief description of the licensee's facility and area near the site. 


(ii) *Types of accidents.* An identification of each type of radioactive materials accident for which protective actions may be needed.

A control point must be established. The notification and coordination must be planned so that unavailability of some personnel, parts of the facility, and some equipment will not prevent the notification and coordination. The licensee shall also commit to notify the NRC operations center immediately after notification of the appropriate offsite response organizations and not later than one hour after the licensee declares an emergency.

Participation of offsite response organizations in biennial exercises although recommended is not required. Exercises must use accident scenarios postulated as most probable for the specific site and the scenarios shall not be known to most exercise participants. The licensee shall critique each exercise using individuals not having direct implementation responsibility for the plan. Critiques of exercises must evaluate the appropriateness of the plan, emergency procedures, facilities, equipment, training of personnel, and overall effectiveness of the response. Deficiencies found by the critiques must be corrected.

(2) Each application for such a license must include the first four categories of information contained in the applicant's safeguards contingency plan. (The first four categories of information, as set forth in appendix C to part 73 of this chapter, are Background, Generic Planning Base, Licensee Planning Base, and Responsibility Matrix.) The fifth category of information, Procedures, does not have to be submitted for approval.


(3) The licensee shall retain a copy of this safeguards contingency plan as a record until the Commission terminates each license obtained by this application or any application for renewal of a license and retain each change to the plan as a record for three years after the date of the change.


(k) Each application for a license to possess or use at any site or contiguous sites subject to licensee control, special nuclear material of moderate strategic significance or 10 kg or more of special nuclear material of low strategic significance as defined under § 70.4, other than a license for possession or use of this material in the operation of a nuclear power reactor licensed pursuant to part 50 of this chapter, must include a physical security plan that demonstrates how the applicant plans to meet the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), (f), and (g) of § 73.67 of this chapter, as appropriate.
