# § 71.33   Package description.

The application must include a description of the proposed package in sufficient detail to identify the package accurately and provide a sufficient basis for evaluation of the package. The description must include—


(a) With respect to the packaging— 


(1) Classification as Type B(U), Type B(M), or fissile material packaging; 


(2) Gross weight; 


(3) Model number; 


(4) Identification of the containment system; 


(5) Specific materials of construction, weights, dimensions, and fabrication methods of—


(i) Receptacles; 


(ii) Materials specifically used as nonfissile neutron absorbers or moderators; 


(iii) Internal and external structures supporting or protecting receptacles; 


(iv) Valves, sampling ports, lifting devices, and tie-down devices; and 


(v) Structural and mechanical means for the transfer and dissipation of heat; and 


(6) Identification and volumes of any receptacles containing coolant. 


(b) With respect to the contents of the package— 


(1) Identification and maximum radioactivity of radioactive constituents; 


(2) Identification and maximum quantities of fissile constituents; 


(3) Chemical and physical form; 


(4) Extent of reflection, the amount and identity of nonfissile materials used as neutron absorbers or moderators, and the atomic ratio of moderator to fissile constituents; 


(5) Maximum normal operating pressure; 


(6) Maximum weight; 


(7) Maximum amount of decay heat; and 


(8) Identification and volumes of any coolants.
