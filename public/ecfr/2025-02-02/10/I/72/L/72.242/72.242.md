(d) Each certificate holder shall submit a written report to the NRC within 30 days of discovery of a design or fabrication deficiency, for any spent fuel storage cask which has been delivered to a licensee, when the design or fabrication deficiency affects the ability of structures, systems, and components important to safety to perform their intended safety function. The written report shall be sent to the NRC in accordance with the requirements of ยง 72.4. The report shall include the following:


(1) A brief abstract describing the deficiency, including all component or system failures that contributed to the deficiency and corrective action taken or planned to prevent recurrence;


(2) A clear, specific, narrative description of what occurred so that knowledgeable readers familiar with the design of the spent fuel storage cask, but not familiar with the details of a particular cask, can understand the deficiency. The narrative description shall include the following specific information as appropriate for the particular event:


(i) Dates and approximate times of discovery;


(ii) The cause of each component or system failure, if known;


(iii) The failure mode, mechanism, and effect of each failed component, if known;

(v) The method of discovery of each component or system failure;


(vi) The manufacturer and model number (or other identification) of each component that failed during the event;


(vii) The model and serial numbers of the affected spent fuel storage casks;


(viii) The licensees that have affected spent fuel storage casks;


(3) An assessment of the safety consequences and implications of the deficiency. This assessment shall include the availability of other systems or components that could have performed the same function as the components and systems that were affected;


(4) A description of any corrective actions planned as a result of the deficiency, including those to reduce the probability of similar occurrences in the future;
