# § 74.4   Definitions.

As used in this part:


*Abrupt loss* means a loss occurring in the time interval between consecutive sequential performances of a material control test which is designed to detect anomalies potentially indicative of a loss of strategic special nuclear material from a specific unit of SSNM (*i.e.*, a quantity characterized by a unique measurement) introduced into a process.


*Accessible location* means a process location at which SSNM could be acquired without leaving evidence of the acquisition, *i.e.*, without tools or other equipment to obviously violate the integrity of the containment. 


*Act* means the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (68 Stat. 919), including any amendments thereto.


*Active inventory* means the sum of additions to inventory, beginning inventory, ending inventory, and removals from inventory, after all common terms have been excluded. Common terms are any material values which appear in the active inventory calculation more than once and come from the same measurement.


*Additions to material in process* means: (1) Receipts that are opened, except for receipts opened only for sampling and subsequently maintained under tamper-safing; (2) opened sealed sources; and (3) material removed from process for nonconformance with chemical or physical specifications that is subsequently reprocessed, measured for contained SSNM, and reintroduced to process. 


*Alarm Threshold* means a predetermined quantity of SSNM calculated from the specified probability of detection for a given loss and the standard deviation associated with a material control test. An alarm threshold serves to trigger a response action.


*Batch* means a portion of source material or special nuclear material handled as a unit for accounting purposes at a key measurement point and for which the composition and quantity are defined by a single set of measurements. The source material or special nuclear material may be in bulk form or contained in a number of separate items.


*Beginning inventory (BI)* means the book inventory quantity at the beginning of an inventory period, and is the reconciled physical inventory entered into the books as an adjusted inventory at the completion of the prior inventory period. 


*Bias* means the deviation of the expected value of a random variable from the corresponding correct or assigned value.


*Calibration* means the process of determining the numerical relationship between the observed output of a measurement system and the value, based upon reference standards, of the characteristic being measured. 


*Category IA material* means SSNM directly useable in the manufacture of a nuclear explosive device, except if: 


(1) The dimensions are large enough (at least two meters in one dimension, greater than one meter in each of two dimensions, or greater than 25cm in each of three dimensions) to preclude hiding the item on an individual; 


(2) The total weight of an encapsulated item of SSNM is such that it cannot be carried inconspicuously by one person (*i.e.,* at least 50 kilograms gross weight); or 


(3) The quantity of SSNM (less than 0.05 formula kilograms) in each container requires protracted diversions to accumulate five formula kilograms. 


*Category IB material* means all SSNM material other than Category IA. 


*Commission* means the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or its duly authorized representatives.


*Continuous process* means a unit process in which feed material must be introduced in a systematic manner in order to maintain equilibrium conditions. 


*Controlled access area* means any temporarily or permanently established area which is clearly demarcated, access to which is controlled, and which affords isolation of the material or persons within it.


*DOE* means the U.S. Department of Energy or its duly authorized representatives.


*Effective kilograms of special nuclear material* means:


(1) For plutonium and uranium-233 their weight in kilograms;


(2) For uranium with an enrichment in the isotope U
235 of 0.01 (1 percent) and above, its element weight in kilograms multiplied by the square of its enrichment expressed as a decimal weight fraction; and


(3) For uranium with an enrichment in the isotope U
235 below 0.01 (1 percent), its element weight in kilograms multiplied by 0.0001.


*Element* means uranium or plutonium. 


*Estimate* means a specific numerical value arrived at by the application of an estimator. 


*Estimator* means a function of a sample measurement used to estimate a population parameter.


*Fissile isotope* means: (1) Uranium U-233, or (2) uranium-235 by enrichment category, (3) plutonium-239, and (4) plutonium-241.


*Formula kilogram* means SSNM in any combination in a quantity of 1000 grams computed by the formula, grams = (grams contained U-235) + 2.5 (grams U-233 + grams plutonium).


*Formula quantity* means strategic special nuclear material in any combination in a quantity of 5,000 grams or more computed by the formula, grams = (grams contained U
235) + 2.5 (grams U
233 + grams plutonium).


*Government agency* means any executive department, commission, independent establishment, corporation, wholly or partly owned by the United States of America, which is an instrumentality of the United States, or any board, bureau, division, service, office, officer, authority, administration, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government.


*High enriched uranium* means uranium enriched to 20 percent or greater in the isotope uranium-235.


*Inventory difference (ID)* means the arithmetic difference obtained by subtracting the quantity of SNM tabulated from a physical inventory from the book inventory quantity. Book inventory quantity is equivalent to the beginning inventory (BI) plus additions to inventory (A) minus removals from inventory (R), while the physical inventory quantity is the ending inventory (EI) for the material balance period in question (as physically determined). Thus mathematically, ID = (BI + A−R) −EI or ID = BI + A−R−EI
