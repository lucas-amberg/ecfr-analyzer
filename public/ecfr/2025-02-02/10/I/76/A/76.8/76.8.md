# ยง 76.8   Information collection requirements: OMB approval not required.

The information collection requirements contained in this part of limited applicability apply to a wholly-owned instrumentality of the United States and affect fewer than ten respondents. Therefore, Office of Management and Budget clearance is not required pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 *et seq.*).
