(2) A plan of actions and schedules for achieving compliance; and


(3) A justification for continued operation with adequate safety and safeguards.


(c) Any relevant information concerning deviations from the published Environmental Impact Statement, Environmental Assessments, or environmental permits under which the plants currently operate from which the Commission can prepare an environmental assessment related to the compliance plan.


(d) A quality assurance program that meets the requirements of § 76.93.


(e) Technical safety requirements in accordance with § 76.87. A summary statement of the bases or reasons for the requirements, other than those covering administrative controls, must also be included in the application, but will not be considered part of the technical safety requirements.


(f) An emergency plan that meets the requirements of § 76.91.


(g) A compliance status report that includes the status of various State, local and Federal permits, licenses, approvals, and other entitlements, as described in § 51.45(d) of this chapter. The report must include environmental and effluent monitoring data.


(h) A fundamental nuclear material control plan which describes the measures used to control and account for special nuclear material that the Corporation uses, possesses, or has access to. The plan must describe, as appropriate:


(1) How formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material will be controlled and accounted for in accordance with the relevant requirements of subpart E;


(2) How special nuclear material of moderate strategic significance will be controlled and accounted for in accordance with the relevant requirements of subpart E; and


(3) How special nuclear material of low strategic significance will be controlled and accounted for in accordance with the relevant requirements of subpart E.


(i) A transportation protection plan which describes the measures used to protect shipments of special nuclear material of low strategic significance in accordance with the relevant requirements of subpart E when in transit offsite.


(j) A physical protection plan which describes the measures used to protect special nuclear material that the Corporation uses, possesses, or has access to at fixed sites. The plan must describe, as appropriate:


(1) How formula quantities of special nuclear material will be protected against both theft and radiological sabotage in accordance with the relevant requirements of subpart E;


(2) How special nuclear material of moderate strategic significance will be protected in accordance with the relevant requirements of subpart E;


(3) How special nuclear material of low strategic significance will be protected in accordance with the relevant requirements of subpart E; and


(4) The measures used to protect special nuclear material while in transit between protected areas, all of which are located on a single fixed site under the control of the applicant. The level of protection afforded the material while in transit may not be less than that afforded the same material while it was within the protected area from which transit began.


(k) A plan describing the facility's proposed security procedures and controls as set forth in § 95.15(b) of this chapter for protection of classified matter.


(l)(1) In response to a written request by the Commission, each applicant for a certificate and each recipient of a certificate shall submit facility information, as described in § 75.10 of this chapter, on IAEA Design Information Questionnaire forms and site information on DOC/NRC Form AP-A and associated forms;


(2) As required by the Additional Protocol, shall submit location information described in § 75.11 of this chapter on DOC/NRC Form AP-1 and associated forms; and


(3) Shall permit verification thereof by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA); and shall take other action as may be necessary to implement the US/IAEA Safeguards Agreement, as described in Part 75 of this chapter.


(m) A description of the program, as appropriate, for processing, management, and disposal of mixed and radioactive wastes and depleted uranium generated by operations. This description must be limited to processing, management, and disposal activities conducted during operation of the facilities while under lease to the Corporation. The application must also include a description of the waste streams generated by enrichment operations, annual volumes of depleted uranium and waste expected, identification of radioisotopes contained in the waste, physical and chemical forms of the depleted uranium and waste, plans for managing the depleted uranium and waste, and plans for ultimate disposition of the waste and depleted uranium before turnover of the facilities to the Department of Energy under the terms of the lease agreement between the United States Enrichment Corporation and the Department.


(n) A description of the funding program to be established to ensure that funds will be set aside and available for those aspects of the ultimate disposal of waste and depleted uranium, decontamination and decommissioning, relating to the gaseous diffusion plants leased to the Corporation by the Department of Energy, which are the financial responsibility of the Corporation. The Corporation shall establish financial surety arrangements to ensure that sufficient funds will be available for the ultimate disposal of waste and depleted uranium, and decontamination and decommissioning activities which are the financial responsibility of the Corporation. The funding mechanism, such as prepayment, surety, insurance, or external sinking fund, must ensure availability of funds for any activities which are required to be completed both before or after the return of the gaseous diffusion facilities to the department of Energy in accordance with the lease between the Department and the Corporation. The funding program must contain a basis for cost estimates used to establish funding levels and must contain means of adjusting cost estimates and associated funding levels over the duration of the lease. The funding program need not address funding for those aspects of decontamination and decommissioning of the gaseous diffusion plants assigned to the Department of Energy under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. The Corporation should address the adequacy of the financing mechanism selected in its periodic application for certification.
