# § 95.37   Classification and preparation of documents.

(a) *Classification.* Classified information generated or possessed by a licensee, certificate holder, or other person must be appropriately marked. Classified material which is not conducive to markings (e.g., equipment) may be exempt from this requirement. These exemptions are subject to the approval of the CSA on a case-by-case basis. If a person or facility generates or possesses information that is believed to be classified based on guidance provided by the NRC or by derivation from classified documents, but which no authorized classifier has determined to be classified, the information must be protected and marked with the appropriate classification markings pending review and signature of an NRC authorized classifier. This information shall be protected as classified information pending final determination.


(b) *Classification consistent with content.* Each document containing classified information shall be classified Secret or Confidential according to its content. NRC licensees, certificate holders, or other persons subject to the requirements of 10 CFR part 95 may not make original classification decisions.


(c) *Markings required on face of documents.* (1) For derivative classification of classified National Security Information: 


(i) Derivative classifications of classified National Security Information must contain the identity of the source document or the classification guide, including the agency and office of origin, on the “Derived From” line and its classification date. If more than one source is cited, the “Derived From” line should indicate “Multiple Sources.” The derivative classifier shall maintain the identification of each source with the file or record copy of the derivatively classified document.


(ii) Declassification instructions. When marking derivatively classified documents, the “DECLASSIFY ON” line must carry forward the declassification instructions as reflected in the original document. If multiple sources are used, the instructions will carry forward the longest duration. 


(iii) An example of the marking stamp is as follows: 


(2) For Restricted Data documents: 


(i) *Identity of the classifier.* The identity of the classifier must be shown by completion of the “Derivative Classifier” line. The “Derivative Classifier” line must show the name of the person classifying the document and the basis for the classification. Dates for downgrading or declassification do not apply. 


(ii) *Classification designation (e.g., Secret, Confidential) and Restricted Data.* NOTE: No “Declassification” instructions will be placed on documents containing Restricted Data. 


(d) *Placement of markings.* The highest classification marking assigned to a document must be placed in a conspicuous fashion in letters at the top and bottom of the outside of the front covers and title pages, if any, and first and last pages on which text appears, on both bound and unbound documents, and on the outside of back covers of bound documents. The balance of the pages must be marked at the top and bottom with: 


(1) The overall classification marking assigned to the document; 


(2) The highest classification marking required by content of the page; or 


(3) The marking UNCLASSIFIED if they have no classified content. 


(e) *Additional markings.* (1) If the document contains any form of Restricted Data, it must bear the appropriate marking on the first page of text, on the front cover and title page, if any. For example: “This document contains Restricted Data as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Unauthorized disclosure subject to Administrative and Criminal Sanctions.” 


(2) *Limitation on reproduction or dissemination.* If the originator or classifier determines that reproduction or further dissemination of a document should be restricted, the following additional wording may be placed on the face of the document: 


(f) *Portion markings.* In addition to the information required on the face of the document, each classified document is required, by marking or other means, to indicate clearly which portions are classified (e.g., paragraphs or pages) and which portions are not classified. The symbols (S) for Secret, (C) for Confidential, (U) for Unclassified, or (RD) for Restricted Data may be used immediately preceding or following the text to which it applies, except that the designation must follow titles or subjects. (Portion marking of paragraphs is not required for documents containing Restricted Data.) If this type of portion marking is not practicable, the document must contain a description sufficient to identify the classified information and the unclassified information. 


(g) *Transmittal document.* If a document transmitting classified information contains no classified information or the classification level of the transmittal document is not as high as the highest classification level of its enclosures, then the document must be marked at the top and bottom with a classification at least as high as its highest classified enclosure. The classification may be higher if the enclosures, when combined, warrant a higher classification than any individual enclosure. When the contents of the transmittal document warrants a lower classification than the highest classified enclosure(s) or combination of enclosures or requires no classification, a stamp or marking such as the following must also be used on the transmittal document: 


(h) *Classification challenges.* Licensees, certificate holders, or other persons in authorized possession of classified National Security Information who in good faith believe that the information's classification status (*i.e.*, that the document), is classified at either too high a level for its content (overclassification) or too low for its content (underclassification) are expected to challenge its classification status. Licensees, certificate holders, or other persons who wish to challenge a classification status shall—


(1) Refer the document or information to the originator or to an authorized NRC classifier for review. The authorized classifier shall review the document and render a written classification decision to the holder of the information.


(2) In the event of a question regarding classification review, the holder of the information or the authorized classifier shall consult the NRC Division of Facilities and Security, Information Security Branch, for assistance.


(3) Licensees, certificate holders, or other persons who challenge classification decisions have the right to appeal the classification decision to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel.


(4) Licensees, certificate holders, or other persons seeking to challenge the classification of information will not be the subject of retribution.


(i) *Files, folders or group of documents.* Files, folders, binders, or groups of physically connected documents must be marked at least as high as the highest classified document which they contain. 


(j) *Drafts and working papers.* Drafts of documents and working papers which contain, or which are believed to contain, classified information must be marked as classified information. 


(k) *Classification guidance.* Licensees, certificate holders, or other persons subject to this part shall classify and mark classified matter as National Security Information or Restricted Data, as appropriate, in accordance with classification guidance provided by the NRC as part of the facility clearance process.
