# § 205.370   Applicability.

Sections 202(c) and 202(d) of the Federal Power Act are applicable to any “entity” which owns or operates electric power generation, transmission or distribution facilities. An “entity” is a private or public corporation (utility), a governmental agency, a municipality, a cooperative or a lawful association of the foregoing. Under this section, the DOE has the authority to order the temporary connection of facilities, or the generation or delivery of electricity, which it deems necessary to alleviate an emergency. Such orders shall be effective for the time specified and will be subject to the terms and conditions the DOE specifies. The DOE retains the right to cancel, modify or otherwise change any order, with or without notice, hearing, or report. Requests for action under these regulations will be accepted from any “entity,” State Public Utility Commission, State Energy Agency, or State Governor. Actions under these regulations also may be initiated by the DOE on its own motion. Orders under this authority may be made effective without prior notice.
