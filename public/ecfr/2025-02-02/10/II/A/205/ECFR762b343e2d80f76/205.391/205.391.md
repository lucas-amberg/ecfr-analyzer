(a) An emergency order will expire no later than 15 days after its issuance. The Secretary may reissue an emergency order for subsequent periods, not to exceed 15 days for each such period, provided that the President, for each such period, issues and provides to the Secretary a written directive or determination that the grid security emergency for which the Secretary intends to reissue an emergency order continues to exist or that the emergency measures continue to be required.


(b) The Secretary may rescind an emergency order after finding that the grid security emergency for which that order was issued has ended, and that protective or mitigation measures required by that order have been sufficiently taken.


(c) An entity or entities subject to an emergency order issued under this subpart may, at any time, request termination of the emergency order by demonstrating, in a petition to the Secretary, that the emergency no longer exists and that protective or mitigation measures required by the order have been sufficiently taken.
