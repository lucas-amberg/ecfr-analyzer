# ยง 205.323   Transferability.

(a) Neither a permit issued by the ERA pursuant to Executive Order 10485, as amended, nor the facility shall be transferable or assignable. Provided written notice is given to the ERA within 30 days, the authorization may continue in effect temporarily in the event of the involuntary transfer of the facility by operation of law (including transfers to receivers, trustees, or purchases under foreclosure or judicial sale). This continuance is contingent on the filing of an application for a new permit and may be effective until a decision is made thereon.


(b) In the event of a proposed voluntary transfer of the facility, the permittee and the party to whom the transfer would be made shall file a joint application with the ERA pursuant to this paragraph, setting forth information as required by ยง 205.320 *et seq.,* together with a statement of reasons for the transfer. The application shall be accompanied by a filing fee pursuant to ยง 205.326.


(c) No substantial change shall be made in any facility authorized by permit or in the operation thereof unless or until such change has been approved by the ERA.


(d) Permits may be modified or revoked without notice by the President of the United States, or by the Administrator of the ERA after public notice.
