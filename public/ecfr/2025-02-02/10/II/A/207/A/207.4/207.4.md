(a) Information obtained by the DOE under authority of ESECA shall be available to the public in accordance with the provisions of part 202 of this chapter. Upon a showing satisfactory to the Administrator by any person that any energy information obtained under this subpart from such person would, if made public, divulge methods or processes entitled to protection as trade secrets or other proprietary information of such person, such information, or portion thereof, shall be deemed confidential in accordance with the provisions of section 1905 of title 18, United States Code; except that such information, or part thereof, shall not be deemed confidential pursuant to that section for purposes of disclosure, upon request, to (1) any delegate of the DOE for the purpose of carrying out ESECA or the EPAA, (2) the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Interior, the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Power Commission, or the General Accounting Office, when necessary to carry out those agencies' duties and responsibilities under ESECA and other statutes, and (3) the Congress, or any Committee of Congress upon request of the Chairman. 


(b) Whenever the Administrator requests reports of energy information under this subpart, he may specify (in the rule, order or questionnaire or other means by which he has requested such reports) the nature of the showing required to be made in order to satisfy DOE that certain energy information contained in such reports warrants confidential treatment in accordance with this section. He shall, to the maximum extent practicable, either before or after requesting reports, by ruling or otherwise, inform respondents providing energy information pursuant to this subpart of whether such information will be made available to the public pursuant to requests under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).
