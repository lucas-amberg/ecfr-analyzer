If it appears that the use of assistance pursuant to DPA section 101(c) creates or threatens to create a conflict with priorities and allocation support provided in connection with the national defense pursuant to DPA section 101(a), DOE will work with the DOC and other claimant agencies affected by the conflict to reschedule deliveries or otherwise accommodate the competing demands. If acceptable solutions cannot be agreed upon by the claimant agencies DHS will attempt to resolve the conflicts.
