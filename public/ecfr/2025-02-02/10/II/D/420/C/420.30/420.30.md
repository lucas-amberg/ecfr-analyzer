(e) The purposes of the special project activities are: 


(1) To utilize States to accelerate deployment of energy efficiency, renewable energy, and alternative transportation fuel technologies; 


(2) To facilitate the commercialization of emerging and underutilized energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies; and
