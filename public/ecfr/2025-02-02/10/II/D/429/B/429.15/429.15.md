# § 429.15   Room air conditioners.

(a) *Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.* (1) The requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to room air conditioners; and


(2) For each basic model of room air conditioners, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that—


(i) Any represented value of estimated annual operating cost, energy consumption or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:


(A) The mean of the sample, where:


(B) The upper 97
1/2 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:



(ii) Any represented value of the combined energy efficiency ratio (CEER) (determined in § 430.23(f)(3) for each unit in the sample) or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:


(A) The mean of the sample, where:


(B) The lower 97
1/2 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:



(3) The cooling capacity of a basic model is the mean of the measured cooling capacities for each tested unit of the basic model, as determined in § 430.23(f)(1) of this chapter. Round the cooling capacity value to the nearest hundred.


(4) The electrical power input of a basic model is the mean of the measured electrical power inputs for each tested unit of the basic model, as determined in § 430.23(f)(2) of this chapter. Round the electrical power input to the nearest ten.


(5) Round the value of CEER for a basic model to one decimal place.


(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of § 429.12 are applicable to room air conditioners; and


(2) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following public product-specific information: The combined energy efficiency ratio in British thermal units per Watt-hour (Btu/Wh)), cooling capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h), and the electrical power input in watts (W).


(3) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report for a variable-speed room air conditioner basic model must include supplemental information and instructions in PDF format that include—


(i) The mean measured cooling capacity for the units tested at each additional test condition (*i.e.,* respectively, the mean of Capacity_2_, Capacity_3_, and Capacity_4_, each expressed in Btu/h and rounded to the nearest 100 Btu/h, as determined in accordance with section 4.1.2 of appendix F of subpart B of part 430 of this chapter);


(ii) The mean electrical power input at each additional test condition (respectively, the mean of Power_2_, Power_3_, and Power_4_, each expressed in W and rounded to the nearest 10 W, as determined in accordance with section 4.1.2 of appendix F of subpart B of part 430 of this chapter); and


(iii) All additional testing and testing set up instructions (*e.g.,* specific operational or control codes or settings) necessary to operate the basic model under the required conditions specified by the relevant test procedure.
