# § 429.19   Dishwashers.

(a) *Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.* (1) The requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to dishwashers; and


(2) For each basic model of dishwashers, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that—


(i) Any represented value of estimated annual operating cost, energy or water consumption or other measure of energy or water consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:


(A) The mean of the sample, where:


Or,


(B) The upper 97
1/2 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:



(ii) Any represented value of the energy or water factor or other measure of energy or water consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:


(A) The mean of the sample, where:


Or,


(B) The lower 97
1/2 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:



(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of § 429.12 are applicable to dishwashers; and




(2) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following public product-specific information: The estimated annual energy use in kilowatt hours per year (kWh/yr), the water consumption in gallons per cycle, and the capacity in number of place settings.








(3) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following additional product-specific information—


(i) The presence of a soil sensor, and if yes, the number of cycles required to reach calibration;


(ii) The water inlet temperature used for testing in degrees Fahrenheit ( °F);


(iii) The cycle selected for the energy test and whether that cycle is soil-sensing if testing is performed using appendix C1 to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter and the cycles selected for the sensor heavy response, sensor medium response, and sensor light response and whether these cycles are soil-sensing if testing is performed using appendix C2 to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter;


(iv) The options selected for the energy test if testing is performed using appendix C1 to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter and the options selected for the sensor heavy response, sensor medium response, and sensor light response if testing is performed using appendix C2 to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter;


(v) The average cleaning index for the sensor heavy response, sensor medium response, and sensor light response cycles if testing is performed using appendix C2 to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter (*see* section 5.1 of appendix C2 for the calculation of per-cycle cleaning index for each test cycle);


(vi) Indication of whether Cascade Complete Powder or Cascade with the Grease Fighting Power of Dawn was used as the detergent formulation. When certifying dishwashers, other than water re-use dishwashers, according to appendix C1 to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter:


(A) Before July 17, 2023, Cascade Complete Powder detergent may be used as the basis for certification in conjunction with the detergent dosing methods specified in either section 2.5.2.1.1 or section 2.5.2.1.2 of appendix C1. Cascade with the Grease Fighting Power of Dawn detergent may be used as the basis for certification only in conjunction with the detergent dosing specified in section 2.5.2.1.1 of appendix C1.


(B) Beginning July 17, 2023, Cascade Complete Powder detergent may be used as the basis for certification of newly certified basic models only in conjunction with the detergent dosing method specified in section 2.5.2.1.2 of appendix C1. Cascade with the Grease Fighting Power of Dawn detergent may be used as the basis for certification only in conjunction with the detergent dosing specified in section 2.5.2.1.1 of appendix C1. Manufacturers may maintain existing basic model certifications made prior to July 17, 2023, consistent with the provisions of paragraph (b)(3)(vi)(A) of this section.


(vii) The presence of a built-in water softening system, and if yes, the energy use in kilowatt hours and the water use in gallons required for each regeneration of the water softening system, the number of regeneration cycles per year, and data and calculations used to derive these values;


(viii) Whether the product is a water re-use system dishwasher, and if yes, the energy use in kilowatt hours and water use in gallons required for a drain out event, the energy use in kilowatt hours and water use in gallons required for a clean out event, the number of drain out events per year, the number of clean out events per year, the water fill volume to calculate detergent dosage in gallons, and data and calculations used to derive these values, as applicable; and


(ix) The presence of a built-in reservoir, and if yes, the manufacturer-stated reservoir capacity in gallons, the prewash fill water volume in gallons and the main wash fill water volume in gallons if testing is performed using appendix C1 to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter, and the reservoir water consumption in gallons per cycle.






(c) *Reported values.* Values reported pursuant to this subsection must be rounded as follows:


(1) The represented value of estimated annual energy use to the nearest kilowatt hour per year.


(2) The represented value of water consumption to the nearest 0.1 gallon per cycle.
