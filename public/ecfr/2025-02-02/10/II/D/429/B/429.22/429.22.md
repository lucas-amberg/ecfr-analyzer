# § 429.22   Direct heating equipment.

(a) *Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.* (1) The requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to direct heating equipment; and


(2) (i) For each basic model of direct heating equipment (not including furnaces) a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that—


(A) Any represented value of estimated annual operating cost, energy consumption or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:


(*1*) The mean of the sample, where:


Or,


(*2*) The upper 97
1/2 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:



(B) Any represented value of the fuel utilization efficiency or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:


(*1*) The mean of the sample, where:


Or,


(*2*) The lower 97
1/2 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:



(ii) In calculating the measures of energy consumption for each unit tested, use the design heating requirement corresponding to the mean of the capacities of the units of the sample.


(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of § 429.12 are applicable to direct heating equipment; and


(2) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following public product-specific information: Direct heating equipment, the annual fuel utilization efficiency (AFUE) in percent (%), the mean input capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h), and the mean output capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h).
