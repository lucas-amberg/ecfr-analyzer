# § 429.24   Pool heaters.

(a) *Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.* (1) The requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to pool heaters; and




(2) For each basic model of pool heater, randomly select and test a sample of sufficient size to ensure that any represented value of the thermal efficiency or integrated thermal efficiency, as applicable, or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:




(i) The mean of the sample, where:


Or,


(ii) The lower 97
1/2 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:


(3) When certifying integrated thermal efficiency, the represented value for input capacity of a gas-fired pool heater basic model reported in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section must be the mean of the input capacities measured for each tested unit of the basic model, as determined in accordance with the test procedure in appendix P of subpart B of part 430 of this chapter.




(4) When certifying integrated thermal efficiency, the represented value of active electrical power of an electric pool heater basic model reported in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section must be the mean of the electrical power measured for each tested unit of the basic model, as determined in accordance with the test procedure in appendix P of subpart B of part 430 of this chapter.






(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of § 429.12 are applicable to pool heaters; and




(2) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), include in each certification report the following public product-specific information:


(i) For gas-fired pool heaters: the input capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h) and either the thermal efficiency as a percentage (%) (when certifying compliance with the energy conservation standards specified at § 430.32(k)(1) of this chapter) or the integrated thermal efficiency as a percentage (%) (when certifying compliance with the energy conservation standards specified at § 430.32(k)(2) of this chapter), as applicable.


(ii) For electric pool heaters (when certifying compliance with the energy conservation standards specified at § 430.32(k)(2) of this chapter): the integrated thermal efficiency in percent (%) and the active electrical power in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h).




(c) *Reported values.* Round reported values pursuant to this subsection as follows:


(1) Integrated thermal efficiency for gas-fired pool heaters to the nearest tenth of one percent;


(2) Integrated thermal efficiency for electric pool heaters to the nearest one percent;


(3) Input capacity of a gas-fired pool heater to the nearest 1,000 Btu/h; and


(4) Active electrical power of an electric pool heater to the nearest 100 Btu/h.
