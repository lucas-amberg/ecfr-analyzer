# § 429.25   Television sets.

(a) *Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.* (1) The requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to televisions; and


(2) For each basic model of television, samples shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that—


(i) Any represented value of power consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:


(A) The mean of the sample, where:


(B) For on mode power consumption, the upper 95 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:


(C) For standby mode power consumption and power consumption measurements in modes other than on mode, the upper 90 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.10, where:


(ii) Any represented annual energy consumption of a basic model shall be determined by applying the AEC calculation in section 4 of appendix H to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter to the represented values of power consumption as calculated pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.


(iii) *Rounding requirements.* The represented value of power consumption and the represented annual energy consumption shall be rounded as follows:




(A) For power consumption in the on and standby modes, the represented value shall be rounded according to the requirements specified in sections 4.1 and 4.3 of appendix H to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter.




(B) For annual energy consumption, the represented value shall be rounded according to the requirements specified in section 3.4 of appendix H to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter.




(b) [Reserved]
