# ยง 429.27   General service fluorescent lamps.

(a) *Determination of Represented Value.* Each manufacturer must determine represented values, which include certified ratings, for each basic model by testing, in accordance with the following sampling provisions.


(1) Units to be tested.


(i) When testing, use a sample comprised of production units. The same sample of units must be tested and used as the basis for representations for rated wattage, average lamp efficacy, color rendering index (CRI), and correlated color temperature (CCT).


(ii) For each basic model, randomly select and test a sample of sufficient size, but not less than 10 units, to ensure that represented values of average lamp efficacy are less than or equal to the lower of:


(A) The arithmetic mean of the sample: or,


(B) The lower 95 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by .97, where:


(2) Any represented values of measures of energy efficiency or energy consumption for all individual models represented by a given basic model must be the same.


(3) Represented values of CCT, CRI and rated wattage must be equal to the arithmetic mean of the sample.


(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of ยง 429.12 apply to general service fluorescent lamps; and


(2) Pursuant to ยง 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following public product-specific information: The testing laboratory's ILAC accreditation body's identification number or other approved identification assigned by the ILAC accreditation body, average lamp efficacy in lumens per watt (lm/W), rated wattage in watts (W), CCT in Kelvin (K), and CRI.


(c) *Rounding Requirements.* (1) Round rated wattage to the nearest tenth of a watt.


(2) Round average lamp efficacy to the nearest tenth of a lumen per watt.


(3) Round CCT to the nearest 100 kelvin (K).


(4) Round CRI to the nearest whole number.
