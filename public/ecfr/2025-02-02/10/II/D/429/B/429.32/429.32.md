# § 429.32   Ceiling fans.

(a) *Determination of represented value.* Manufacturers must determine the represented value, which includes the certified rating, for each basic model of ceiling fan by testing, in conjunction with the following sampling provisions:


(1) The requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to ceiling fans; and


(2) For each basic model of ceiling fan, a sample of sufficient size must be randomly selected and tested to ensure that—


(i) Any represented value of the efficiency or airflow is less than or equal to the lower of:


(A) The mean of the sample, where:


And *x
* is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and x_i_ is the i
th sample; or


(B) The lower 90 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.9, where:


And *x
* is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t_0.90_ is the t statistic for a 90% one-tailed confidence interval with n−1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A to subpart B); and


(ii) Any represented value of the wattage is greater than or equal to the higher of:


(A) The mean of the sample, where:


And *x
* is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and x_i_ is the i
th sample; or


(B) The upper 95 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.1, where:


And *x
* is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t_0.95_ is the t statistic for a 95% one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A to this subpart); and


(3) For each basic model of ceiling fan,


(i) Any represented value of blade span, as defined in section 1.4 of appendix U to subpart B of part 430, is the mean of the blade spans measured for the sample selected as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, rounded to the nearest inch;


(ii) Any represented value of blade revolutions per minute (RPM) is the mean of the blade RPM measurements measured for the sample selected as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, rounded to the nearest RPM;


(iii) Any represented value of blade edge thickness is the mean of the blade edge thicknesses measured for the sample selected as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, rounded to the nearest 0.01 inch;


(iv) Any represented value of the distance between the ceiling and the lowest point on the fan blades is the mean of the distances measured for the sample selected as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, rounded to the nearest quarter of an inch;


(v) Any represented value of tip speed is pi multiplied by represented value of blade span divided by twelve multiplied by the represented value of RPM, rounded to the nearest foot per minute; and


(vi) Any represented value of airflow (CFM) at high speed, including the value used to determine whether a ceiling fan is a highly-decorative ceiling fan as defined in section 1.10 of appendix U to subpart B of part 430, is determined pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(i) and rounded to the nearest CFM.


(4) To determine representative values of airflow, energy use, and estimated yearly energy cost of an LSSD or VSD ceiling fan basic model, use the following provisions.


(i) Airflow. Determine the represented value for airflow by calculating the weighted-average airflow of an LSSD or VSD ceiling fan basic model at low and high fan speed as follows:


(ii) Energy Use. Determine represented value for energy use by calculating the weighted-average power consumption of an LSSD or VSD ceiling fan basic model at low and high fan speed as follows:


(iii) Estimated Yearly Energy Cost. Determine the represented value for estimated yearly energy cost of an LSSD or VSD ceiling fan basic model at low and high fan speed as follows:


(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of § 429.12 are applicable to ceiling fans; and


(2) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following public product-specific information:


(i) For all ceiling fans: Blade span (in), and the number of speed control settings.


(ii) For small-diameter ceiling fans: A declaration of whether the ceiling fan is a multi-head ceiling fan, and the ceiling fan efficiency (CFM/W).


(iii) For large-diameter ceiling fans: Ceiling fan energy index (CFEI) for high speed, and 40 percent speed or the nearest speed that is not less than 40 percent speed.


(3) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following additional product-specific information:


(i) For all ceiling fans: A declaration that the manufacturer has incorporated the applicable design requirements.


(ii) For small-diameter ceiling fans: Standby power, blade edge thickness (in), airflow (CFM) at high speed, and blade revolutions per minute (RPM) at high speed.


(iii) For low-speed small-diameter ceiling fans: The distance (in) between the ceiling and the lowest point on the fan blades (in both hugger and standard configurations for multi-mount fans).


(c) *Rounding requirements.* Any represented value of ceiling fan efficiency, as described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, must be expressed in cubic feet per minute per watt (CFM/W) and rounded to the nearest whole number. Any represented value of ceiling fan energy index, as described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, must be expressed in CFEI and rounded to the nearest hundredth.
