# § 429.44   Commercial water heating equipment.

(a) For residential-duty commercial water heaters, all represented values must be determined in accordance with § 429.17.


(b) *Determination of represented values for all types of commercial water heaters except residential-duty commercial water heaters.* Manufacturers must determine the represented values, which includes the certified ratings, for each basic model of commercial water heating equipment except residential-duty commercial water heaters, either by testing, in conjunction with the applicable sampling provisions, or by applying an AEDM as set forth in § 429.70.


(1) *Units to be tested.* If the represented value for a given basic model is determined through testing:


(i) The general requirements of § 429.11 apply; and


(ii) A sample of sufficient size must be randomly selected and tested to ensure that:


(A) Any represented value of energy consumption or other measure of energy use of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values must be greater than or equal to the higher of:


(*1*) The mean of the sample, where:


And, x
 is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and x_i_ is the ith sample; or,


(*2*) The upper 95-percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:


And x
 is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t_0.95_ is the t statistic for a 95-percent one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A to subpart B of this part). And,


(B) Any represented value of energy efficiency or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values must be less than or equal to the lower of:


(*1*) The mean of the sample, where:


And, x
 is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and x_i_ is the ith sample; or,


(*2*) The lower 95-percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:


And x
 is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t_0.95_ is the t statistic for a 95-percent one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A to subpart B of this part).


(2) *Alternative efficiency determination methods.* In lieu of testing, a represented value of efficiency or consumption for a basic model must be determined through the application of an AEDM pursuant to the requirements of § 429.70 and the provisions of this section, where:


(i) Any represented value of energy consumption or other measure of energy use of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values must be greater than or equal to the output of the AEDM and less than or equal to the Federal standard for that basic model; and


(ii) Any represented value of energy efficiency or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values must be less than or equal to the output of the AEDM and greater than or equal to the Federal standard for that basic model.


(3) *Rated input.* The rated input for a basic model reported in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section must be the maximum rated input listed on the nameplate for that basic model.
