# ยง 429.45   Automatic commercial ice makers.

(a) *Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.* (1) The requirements of ยง 429.11 are applicable to automatic commercial ice makers; and


(2) For each basic model of automatic commercial ice maker selected for testing, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that any represented value of energy use, condenser water use, or other measure of consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:






(i) The mean of the sample, where:


And, x
 is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and x_i_ is the i_th_ sample; or,




(ii) The upper 95 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.10, where:


(3) The harvest rate of a basic model is the mean of the measured harvest rates for each tested unit of the basic model, based on the same tests to determine energy use and condenser water use, if applicable. Round the mean harvest rate to the nearest pound of ice per 24 hours (lb/24 h) for harvest rates above 50 lb/24 h; round the mean harvest rate to the nearest 0.1 lb/24 h for harvest rates less than or equal to 50 lb/24 h.


(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of ยง 429.12 are applicable to automatic commercial ice makers; and


(2) Pursuant to ยง 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following public product-specific information: The energy use in kilowatt hours per 100 pounds of ice (kWh/100 lb), the condenser water use in gallons per 100 pounds of ice (gal/100 lb), the harvest rate in lb/24 h, the type of cooling, and the equipment type.


(3) For reporting, round harvest rate to the nearest 1 lb/24 h for harvest rates above 50 lb/24 h; round condenser water use to the nearest 1 gal/100 lb; and round energy use to the nearest 0.01 kWh/100 lb.
