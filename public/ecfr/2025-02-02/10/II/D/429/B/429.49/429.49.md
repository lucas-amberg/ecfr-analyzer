# § 429.49   Traffic signal modules and pedestrian modules.

(a) *Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.* (1) The requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to traffic signal modules and pedestrian modules; and


(2) For each basic model of traffic signal module or pedestrian module selected for testing, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that—


(i) Any represented value of estimated maximum and nominal wattage or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:


(A) The mean of the sample, where:


(B) The upper 95 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.10, where:



(ii) Any represented value of the energy efficiency or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:


(A) The mean of the sample, where:


(B) The lower 95 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.90, where:



(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of § 429.12 are applicable to traffic signal modules and pedestrian modules; and


(2) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following public product-specific information: The maximum wattage at 74 degrees Celsius (°C) in watts (W), the nominal wattage at 25 degrees Celsius (°C) in watts (W), and the signal type.
