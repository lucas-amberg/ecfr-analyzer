# § 429.52   Refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machines.

(a) *Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.* (1) The requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machine; and


(2) For each basic model of refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machine selected for testing, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that—


(i) Any represented value of energy consumption or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:


(A) The mean of the sample, where:


(B) The upper 95 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.10, where:



(ii) Any represented value of the energy efficiency or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:


(A) The mean of the sample, where:


(B) The lower 95 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.90, where:



(3) The representative value of refrigerated volume of a basic model reported in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be the mean of the refrigerated volumes measured for each tested unit of the basic model and determined in accordance with the test procedure in § 431.296.


(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of § 429.12 are applicable to refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machine; and


(2) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report must include the following additional public, equipment-specific information:


(i) When using appendix A of subpart Q of part 431of this chapter, the daily energy consumption in kilowatt hours per day (kWh/day), the refrigerated volume (V) in cubic feet (ft
3), whether testing was conducted with payment mechanism in place and operational, and, if applicable, the lowest application product temperature in degrees Fahrenheit ( °F), if applicable.


(ii) When using appendix B of subpart Q of part 431of this chapter, the daily energy consumption in kilowatt hours per day (kWh/day), the refrigerated volume (V) in cubic feet (ft
3), whether testing was conducted with payment mechanism in place and operational, whether testing was conducted using an accessory low power mode, whether rating was based on the presence of a refrigeration low power mode, and, if applicable, the lowest application product temperature in degrees Fahrenheit ( °F).
