# § 429.67   Air-cooled, three-phase, small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 British thermal units per hour and air-cooled, three-phase, variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 British thermal units per hour.

(a) *Applicability.* (1) For air-cooled, three-phase, small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h and air-cooled, three-phase, variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h subject to standards in terms of seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) and heating seasonal performance factor (HSPF), representations with respect to the energy use or efficiency, including compliance certifications, are subject to the requirements in § 429.43 of this title as it appeared in the 10 CFR parts 200-499 edition revised as of January 1, 2021.


(2) For air-cooled, three-phase, small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h and air-cooled, three-phase, variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h subject to standards in terms of seasonal energy efficiency ratio 2 (SEER2) and heating seasonal performance factor 2 (HSPF2) metrics, representations with respect to the energy use or efficiency, including compliance certifications, are subject to the requirements in this section. If manufacturers choose to certify compliance with any standards in terms of SEER2 and HSPF2 prior to the applicable compliance date for those standards, the requirements of this section must be followed.


(b) *Determination of Represented Value*—(1) *Required represented values.* Determine the represented values (including SEER2, HSPF2, cooling capacity, and heating capacity, as applicable) for the individual models/combinations (or “tested combinations”) specified in table 1 to this paragraph (b)(1).


(2) *Refrigerants.* (i) If a model of outdoor unit (used in a single-split, multi-split, multi-circuit, multi-head mini-split, and/or outdoor unit with no match system) is distributed in commerce and approved for use with multiple refrigerants, a manufacturer must determine all represented values for that model using each refrigerant that can be used in an individual combination of the basic model (including outdoor units with no match or “tested combinations”). This requirement may apply across the listed categories in table 1 to paragraph (b)(1) of this section. A refrigerant is considered approved for use if it is listed on the nameplate of the outdoor unit. If any of the refrigerants approved for use is HCFC-22 or has a 95 °F midpoint saturation absolute pressure that is ±18 percent of the 95 °F saturation absolute pressure for HCFC-22, or if there are no refrigerants designated as approved for use, a manufacturer must determine represented values (including SEER2, HSPF2, cooling capacity, and heating capacity, as applicable) for, at a minimum, an outdoor unit with no match. If a model of outdoor unit is not charged with a specified refrigerant from the point of manufacture or if the unit is shipped requiring the addition of more than two pounds of refrigerant to meet the charge required for testing per Section 5.1.8 of AHRI 210/240-2023 (incorporated by reference, see § 429.4) (unless either {a} the factory charge is equal to or greater than 70 percent of the outdoor unit internal volume multiplied by the liquid density of refrigerant at 95 °F or {b} an A2L refrigerant is approved for use and listed in the certification report), a manufacturer must determine represented values (including SEER2, HSPF2, cooling capacity, and heating capacity, as applicable) for, at a minimum, an outdoor unit with no match.


(ii) If a model is approved for use with multiple refrigerants, a manufacturer may make multiple separate representations for the performance of that model (all within the same individual combination or outdoor unit with no match) using the multiple approved refrigerants. In the alternative, manufacturers may certify the model (all within the same individual combination or outdoor unit with no match) with a single representation, provided that the represented value is no more efficient than its performance using the least-efficient refrigerant. A single representation made for multiple refrigerants may not include equipment in multiple categories or equipment subcategories listed in table 1 to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(3) *Limitations for represented values of individual combinations.* Paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section explains the limitations for represented values of individual combinations (or “tested combinations”).


(i) *Multiple product classes.* Models of outdoor units that are rated and distributed in individual combinations that span multiple product classes must be tested, rated, and certified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section as compliant with the applicable standard for each product class.


(ii) Reserved.


(4) *Requirements.* All represented values under paragraph (b) of this section must be based on testing in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section or the application of an AEDM or other methodology as allowed in paragraph (d) of this section.


(c) *Units tested*—(1) *General.* The general requirements of § 429.11 apply to air-cooled, three-phase, small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h, and air-cooled, three-phase, variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h; and


(2) *Sampling plans and represented values.* For individual models (for single-package systems) or individual combinations (for split-systems, including “tested combinations” for multi-split, multi-circuit, and multi-head mini-split systems) with represented values determined through testing, each individual model/combination (or “tested combination”) must have a sample of sufficient size tested in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart. For heat pumps (other than heating-only heat pumps), all units of the sample population must be tested in both the cooling and heating modes and the results used for determining all representations. The represented values for any individual model/combination must be assigned such that:


(i) *SEER2 and HSPF2.* Any represented value of the energy efficiency or other measure of energy consumption for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:


(A) The mean of the sample, where:


(B) The lower 90 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:


(ii) *Cooling Capacity and Heating Capacity.* The represented values of cooling capacity and heating capacity must each be a self-declared value that is:


(A) Less than or equal to the lower of:


(*1*) The mean of the sample, where:


(*2*) The lower 90 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:


(B) Rounded

 according to:


(*1*) The nearest 100 Btu/h if cooling capacity or heating capacity is less than 20,000 Btu/h,


(*2*) The nearest 200 Btu/h if cooling capacity or heating capacity is greater than or equal to 20,000 Btu/h but less than 38,000 Btu/h, and


(*3*) The nearest 500 Btu/h if cooling capacity or heating capacity is greater than or equal to 38,000 Btu/h and less than 65,000 Btu/h.


(d) *Determination of represented values*—(1) *All basic models except outdoor units with no match and multi-split systems, multi-circuit systems, and multi-head mini-split systems.* For every individual model/combination within a basic model, either—


(i) A sample of sufficient size, comprised of production units or representing production units, must be tested as complete systems with the resulting represented values for the individual model/combination obtained in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section; or


(ii) The represented values of the measures of energy efficiency or energy consumption through the application of an AEDM in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and § 429.70.


(2) *Outdoor units with no match.* All models of outdoor units with no match within a basic model must be tested with a model of coil-only indoor unit meeting the requirements of Section 5.1.6.2 of AHRI 210/240-2023. Models of outdoor units with no match may not be rated with an AEDM, other than to determine the represented values for models using approved refrigerants other than the one used in testing.


(3) *For multi-split systems, multi-circuit systems, and multi-head mini-split systems.* The following applies:


(i) For each non-SDHV basic model, at a minimum, a manufacturer must test the model of outdoor unit with a “tested combination” composed entirely of non-ducted indoor units. For any models of outdoor units also sold with models of ducted indoor units, a manufacturer must test a second “tested combination” composed entirely of ducted indoor units (in addition to the non-ducted combination). The ducted “tested combination” must comprise the highest static variety of ducted indoor unit distributed in commerce (*i.e.,* conventional, mid-static, or low-static).


(ii) If a manufacturer chooses to make representations of a variety of a basic model (*i.e.,* conventional, low static, or mid-static) other than a variety for which a representation is required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section the manufacturer must conduct testing of a tested combination according to the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.


(iii) For basic models that include mixed combinations of indoor units (*i.e.,* combinations that are comprised of any two of the following varieties—non-ducted, low-static, mid-static, and conventional ducted indoor units), the represented value for the mixed combination is the mean of the represented values for the individual component combinations as determined in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) and (d)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.


(iv) For each SDHV basic model distributed in commerce by an OUM, the OUM must, at a minimum, test the model of outdoor unit with a “tested combination” composed entirely of SDHV indoor units. For each SDHV basic model distributed in commerce by an ICM, the ICM must test the model of indoor unit with a “tested combination” composed entirely of SDHV indoor units, where the outdoor unit is the least efficient model of outdoor unit with which the SDHV indoor unit will be paired. The least efficient model of outdoor unit is the model of outdoor unit in the lowest SEER2 combination as certified by the outdoor unit manufacturer. If there are multiple outdoor unit models with the same lowest SEER2 represented value, the indoor coil manufacturer may select one for testing purposes.


(v) For basic models that include SDHV and an indoor unit of another variety (*i.e.,* non-ducted, low-static, mid-static, and conventional ducted), the represented value for the mixed SDHV/other combination is the mean of the represented values for the SDHV and other tested combination as determined in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) and paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (ii) of this section.


(vi) All other individual combinations of models of indoor units for the same model of outdoor unit for which the manufacturer chooses to make representations must be rated as separate basic models, and the provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) and (d)(3)(i) through (v) of this section apply.


(e) *Alternative efficiency determination methods.* In lieu of testing, represented values of efficiency or consumption may be determined through the application of an AEDM pursuant to the requirements of § 429.70(l) and the provisions of this section.


(1) *Energy efficiency.* Any represented value of the SEER2, HSPF2, or other measure of energy efficiency of an individual model/combination for which consumers would favor higher values must be less than or equal to the output of the AEDM but no less than the standard.


(2) *Cooling capacity.* The represented value of cooling capacity of an individual model/combination must be no greater than the cooling capacity output simulated by the AEDM.


(3) *Heating capacity.* The represented value of heating capacity of an individual model/combination must be no greater than the heating capacity output simulated by the AEDM.


(f) *Certification reports.* This paragraph specifies the information that must be included in a certification report.


(1) The requirements of § 429.12; and


(2) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), for each individual model (for single-package systems) or individual combination (for split-systems, including outdoor units with no match and “tested combinations” for multi-split, multi-circuit, and multi-head mini-split systems), a certification report must include the following public equipment-specific information:
