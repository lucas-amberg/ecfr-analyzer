# § 429.73   Department of Energy recognition of nationally recognized certification programs for electric motors, including dedicated-purpose pool pump motors.

(a) *Petition.* For a certification program to be classified by the Department of Energy as being nationally recognized in the United States for the purposes of §§ 429.64 and 429.65, the organization operating the program must submit a petition to the Department requesting such classification, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section and § 429.75. The petition must demonstrate that the program meets the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) *Evaluation criteria.* For a certification program to be classified by the Department as nationally recognized, it must meet the following criteria:


(1) It must have satisfactory standards and procedures for conducting and administering a certification system, including periodic follow up activities to assure that basic models of electric motors continue to conform to the efficiency levels for which they were certified, and for granting a certificate of conformity;


(2) For certification of electric motors, including dedicated-purpose pool pump motors, it must be independent (as defined at § 429.2) of electric motor (including dedicated-purpose pool pump motor) manufacturers, importers, distributors, private labelers or vendors for which it is providing certification;


(3) It must be qualified to operate a certification system in a highly competent manner; and


(4) In the case of electric motors subject to requirements in subpart B of part 431 of this subchapter, the certification program must have expertise in the content and application of the test procedures at § 431.16 of this subchapter and must apply the provisions at §§ 429.64 and 429.70(j); or


(5) In the case of dedicated-purpose pool pump motors subject to requirements in subpart Z of part 431 of this subchapter, the certification program must have expertise in the content and application of the test procedures at § 431.484 of this subchapter and must apply the provisions at §§ 429.65 and 429.70(k).


(c) *Petition format.* Each petition requesting classification as a nationally recognized certification program must contain a narrative statement as to why the program meets the criteria listed in paragraph (b) of this section, must be signed on behalf of the organization operating the program by an authorized representative, and must be accompanied by documentation that supports the narrative statement. The following provides additional guidance as to the specific criteria:


(1) *Standards and procedures.* A copy of the standards and procedures for operating a certification system and for granting a certificate of conformity should accompany the petition.


(2) *Independent status.* The petitioning organization must describe how it is independent (as defined at § 429.2) from electric motor, including dedicated-purpose pool pump motor manufacturers, importers, distributors, private labelers, vendors, and trade associations.


(3) *Qualifications to operate a certification system.* Experience in operating a certification system should be described and substantiated by supporting documents within the petition. Of particular relevance would be documentary evidence that establishes experience in the application of guidelines contained in the ISO/IEC Guide 65, “General requirements for bodies operating product certification systems” (referenced for guidance only, *see* § 429.3), ISO/IEC Guide 27, “Guidelines for corrective action to be taken by a certification body in the event of either misapplication of its mark of conformity to a product, or products which bear the mark of the certification body being found to subject persons or property to risk” (referenced for guidance only, *see* § 429.3), and ISO/IEC Guide 28, “General rules for a model third-party certification system for products” (referenced for guidance only, *see* § 429.3), as well as experience in overseeing compliance with the guidelines contained in the ISO/IEC Guide 25, “General requirements for the competence of calibration and testing laboratories” (referenced for guidance only, *see* § 429.3).


(4) *Expertise in test procedures*—(i) *General.* This part of the petition should include items such as, but not limited to, a description of prior projects and qualifications of staff members. Of particular relevance would be documentary evidence that establishes experience in applying guidelines contained in the ISO/IEC Guide 25, “General Requirements for the Competence of Calibration and Testing Laboratories” (referenced for guidance only, *see* § 429.3), and with energy efficiency testing of the equipment to be certified.


(ii) *Electric motors subject to requirements in subpart B of part 431 of this subchapter.* The petition should set forth the program's experience with the test procedures detailed in § 431.16 of this subchapter and the provisions in §§ 429.64 and 429.70(j).


(iii) *Dedicated-purpose pool pump motors subject to requirements in subpart Z of part 431 of this subchapter.* The petition should set forth the program's experience with the test procedures detailed in § 431.484 of this subchapter and the provisions in §§ 429.65 and 429.70(k).


(d) *Disposition.* The Department will evaluate the petition in accordance with § 429.75, and will determine whether the applicant meets the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section for classification as a nationally recognized certification program.


(e) *Periodic evaluation.* Within one year after publication of any final rule regarding electric motors, a nationally recognized certification program must evaluate whether they meet the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section and must either submit a letter to DOE certifying that no change to its program is needed to continue to meet the criteria in paragraph (b) or submit a letter describing the measures implemented to ensure the criteria in paragraph (b) are met. A certification program will continue to be classified by the Department of Energy as being nationally recognized in the United States until DOE concludes otherwise.
