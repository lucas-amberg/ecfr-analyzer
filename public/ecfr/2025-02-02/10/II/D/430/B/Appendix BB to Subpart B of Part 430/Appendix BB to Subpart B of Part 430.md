# Appendix BB to Subpart B of Part 430—Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Input Power, Lumen Output, Lamp Efficacy, Correlated Color Temperature (CCT), Color Rendering Index (CRI), Power Factor, Time to Failure, and Standby Mode Power of Integrated Light-Emitting Diode (LED) Lamps




1. *Scope:* This appendix specifies the test methods required to measure input power, lumen output, lamp efficacy, CCT, CRI, power factor, time to failure, and standby mode power for integrated LED lamps.


2.1. The definitions specified in section 1.3 of IES LM-79-08 except section 1.3(f) (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3) apply.


2.2. *Initial lumen output* means the measured lumen output after the lamp is initially energized and stabilized using the stabilization procedures in section 3 of this appendix.


2.3. *Interval lumen output* means the measured lumen output at constant intervals after the initial lumen output measurement in accordance with section 4 of this appendix.


2.4. *Rated input voltage* means the voltage(s) marked on the lamp as the intended operating voltage. If not marked on the lamp, assume 120 V.


2.5. *Test duration* means the operating time of the LED lamp after the initial lumen output measurement and before, during, and including the final lumen output measurement, in units of hours.


2.6. *Time to failure* means the time elapsed between the initial lumen output measurement and the point at which the lamp reaches 70 percent lumen maintenance as measured in section 4 of this appendix.


In cases where there is a conflict, the language of the test procedure in this appendix takes precedence over IES LM-79-08 (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3).


3.1.1. Establish the ambient conditions, power supply, electrical settings, and instrumentation in accordance with the specifications in sections 2.0, 3.0, 7.0, and 8.0 of IES LM-79-08 (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3), respectively.


3.1.2. Position an equal number of integrated LED lamps in the base-up and base-down orientations throughout testing; if the position is restricted by the manufacturer, test units in the manufacturer-specified position.


3.1.3. Operate the integrated LED lamp at the rated voltage throughout testing. For an integrated LED lamp with multiple rated voltages including 120 volts, operate the lamp at 120 volts. If an integrated LED lamp with multiple rated voltages is not rated for 120 volts, operate the lamp at the highest rated input voltage. Additional tests may be conducted at other rated voltages.


3.1.4. Operate the lamp at the maximum input power. If multiple modes occur at the same maximum input power (such as variable CCT or CRI), the manufacturer can select any of these modes for testing; however, all measurements described in sections 3 and 4 of this appendix must be taken at the same selected mode. The test report must indicate which mode was selected for testing and include detail such that another laboratory could operate the lamp in the same mode.


3.2. Test Method, Measurements, and Calculations


3.2.1. The test conditions and setup described in section 3.1 of this appendix apply to this section 3.2.


3.2.2. Stabilize the integrated LED lamp prior to measurement as specified in section 5.0 of IES LM-79-08 (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3). Calculate the stabilization variation as [(maximum—minimum)/minimum] of at least three readings of the input power and lumen output over a period of 30 minutes, taken 15 minutes apart.


3.2.3. Measure the input power in watts as specified in section 8.0 of IES LM-79-08.


3.2.4. Measure the input voltage in volts as specified in section 8.0 of IES LM-79-08.

3.2.10. Determine power factor for AC-input lamps by dividing measured input power by the product of the measured input voltage and measured input current.
