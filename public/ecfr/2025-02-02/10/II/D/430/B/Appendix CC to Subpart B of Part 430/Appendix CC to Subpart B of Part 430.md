This appendix covers the test requirements used to measure the energy performance of single-duct and dual-duct portable air conditioners, as defined at 10 CFR 430.2.




*Combined-duct* means the condenser inlet and outlet air streams flow through separate ducts housed in a single duct structure.


*Combined energy efficiency ratio* means the energy efficiency of a portable air conditioner as measured in accordance with this test procedure in Btu per watt-hours (Btu/Wh) and determined in section 5.4 of this appendix.


*Cooling mode* means a mode in which a portable air conditioner either has activated the main cooling function according to the thermostat or temperature sensor signal, including activating the refrigeration system, or has activated the fan or blower without activating the refrigeration system.


*Dual-duct* means drawing some or all of the condenser inlet air from outside the conditioned space through a duct attached to an adjustable window bracket, potentially drawing additional condenser inlet air from the conditioned space, and discharging the condenser outlet air outside the conditioned space by means of a separate duct attached to an adjustable window bracket.


*Full compressor speed (full)* means the compressor speed at which the unit operates at full load test conditions, when using user controls with a unit thermostat setpoint of 75 °F to achieve maximum cooling capacity.


*Inactive mode* means a standby mode that facilitates the activation of an active mode or off-cycle mode by remote switch (including remote control), internal sensor, or timer, or that provides continuous status display.


*Low compressor speed (low)* means the compressor speed specified by the manufacturer, at which the unit operates at low load test conditions (*i.e.,* Test Condition C and Test Condition E in Table 2 of this appendix, for a dual-duct and single-duct portable air conditioner, respectively), such that the measured cooling capacity at this speed is no less than 50 percent and no greater than 60 percent of the measured cooling capacity with the full compressor speed at full load test conditioners (*i.e.,* Test Condition A and Test Condition C in Table 2 of this appendix, for a dual-duct and single-duct portable air conditioner, respectively).


*Off-cycle mode* means a mode in which a portable air conditioner:


(a) Has cycled off its main cooling or heating function by thermostat or temperature sensor signal;


(b) May or may not operate its fan or blower; and


(c) Will reactivate the main function according to the thermostat or temperature sensor signal.


*Off mode* means a mode that may persist for an indefinite time in which a portable air conditioner is connected to a mains power source, and is not providing any active mode, off-cycle mode, or standby mode function. This includes an indicator that only shows the user that the portable air conditioner is in the off position.


*Seasonally adjusted cooling capacity* means the amount of cooling provided to the indoor conditioned space, measured under the specified ambient conditions, in Btu/h,


*Seasonally adjusted cooling capacity, full* means the amount of cooling provided to the indoor conditions space, measured under the specified ambient conditions when the unit compressor is operating at full speed at each condition, in Btu/h.


*Single-duct* means drawing all of the condenser inlet air from the conditioned space without the means of a duct, and discharging the condenser outlet air outside the conditioned space through a single duct attached to an adjustable window bracket.


*Single-speed* means incapable of automatically adjusting the compressor speed based on detected conditions.


*Standby mode* means any mode where a portable air conditioner is connected to a mains power source and offers one or more of the following user-oriented or protective functions which may persist for an indefinite time:


(a) To facilitate the activation of other modes (including activation or deactivation of cooling mode) by remote switch (including remote control), internal sensor, or timer; or


(b) Continuous functions, including information or status displays (including clocks) or sensor-based functions. A timer is a continuous clock function (which may or may not be associated with a display) that provides regular scheduled tasks (*e.g.,* switching) and that operates on a continuous basis.


*Theoretical comparable single-speed* means a hypothetical single-speed unit that would have the same cooling capacity and electrical power input as the variable-speed unit under test, with no cycling losses considered, when operating with the full compressor speed and at the test conditions in Table 1 of this appendix.


*Variable-speed* means capable of automatically adjusting the compressor speed based on detected conditions.






3.1 Active mode.




3.1.1 *Test conduct.* The test apparatus and instructions for testing portable air conditioners in cooling mode and off-cycle mode must conform to the requirements specified in section 4, “Definitions” and section 7, “Tests,” of ANSI/AHAM PAC-1-2015, except as otherwise specified in this appendix. Measure duct heat transfer and infiltration air heat transfer according to sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 of this appendix, respectively.




3.1.1.1 *Duct setup.* Use all ducting components provided by or required by the manufacturer and no others. Ducting components include ducts, connectors for attaching the duct(s) to the test unit, sealing, insulation, and window mounting fixtures. Do not apply additional sealing or insulation. For combined-duct units, the manufacturer must provide the testing facility an adapter that allows for the individual connection of the condenser inlet and outlet airflows to the test facility's airflow measuring apparatuses. Use that adapter to measure the condenser inlet and outlet airflows for any corresponding unit.




3.1.1.2 *Single-duct evaporator inlet test conditions.* When testing single-duct portable air conditioners, maintain the evaporator inlet dry-bulb temperature within a range of 1.0 °F with an average difference within 0.3 °F.


3.1.1.3 *Condensate Removal.* Set up the test unit in accordance with manufacturer instructions. If the unit has an auto-evaporative feature, keep any provided drain plug installed as shipped and do not provide other means of condensate removal. If the internal condensate collection bucket fills during the test, halt the test, remove the drain plug, install a gravity drain line, and start the test from the beginning. If no auto-evaporative feature is available, remove the drain plug and install a gravity drain line. If no auto-evaporative feature or gravity drain is available and a condensate pump is included, or if the manufacturer specifies the use of an included condensate pump during cooling mode operation, then test the portable air conditioner with the condensate pump enabled. For units tested with a condensate pump, apply the provisions in Section 7.1.2 of ANSI/AHAM PAC-1-2015   if the pump cycles on and off.


3.1.1.4 *Unit Placement.* There shall be no less than 3 feet between any test chamber wall surface and any surface on the portable air conditioner, except the surface or surfaces of the portable air conditioner that include a duct attachment. The distance between the test chamber wall and a surface with one or more duct attachments is prescribed by the test setup requirements in Section 7.3.7 of ANSI/AHAM PAC-1-2015.


3.1.1.5 *Electrical supply.* Maintain the input standard voltage at 115 V ±1 percent. Test at the rated frequency, maintained within ±1 percent.




3.1.1.6 *Duct temperature measurements.* Install any insulation and sealing provided by the manufacturer. For a dual-duct or single-duct unit, adhere four thermocouples per duct, spaced along the entire length equally, to the outer surface of the duct. Measure the surface temperatures of each duct. For a combined-duct unit, adhere sixteen thermocouples to the outer surface of the duct, spaced evenly around the circumference (four thermocouples, each 90 degrees apart, radially) and down the entire length of the duct (four sets of four thermocouples, evenly spaced along the entire length of the duct), ensuring that the thermocouples are spaced along the entire length equally, on the surface of the combined duct. Place at least one thermocouple preferably adjacent to, but otherwise as close as possible to, the condenser inlet aperture and at least one thermocouple on the duct surface preferably adjacent to, but otherwise as close as possible to, the condenser outlet aperture. Measure the surface temperature of the combined duct at each thermocouple. Temperature measurements must have an error no greater than ±0.5 °F over the range being measured.






3.1.2 *Control settings.* For a single-speed unit, set the controls to the lowest available temperature setpoint for cooling mode, as described in section 4.1.1 of this appendix. For a variable-speed unit, set the thermostat setpoint to 75 °F to achieve the full compressor speed and use the manufacturer instructions to achieve the low compressor speed, as described in section 4.1.2 of this appendix. If the portable air conditioner has a user-adjustable fan speed, select the maximum fan speed setting. If the unit has an automatic louver oscillation feature and there is an option to disable that feature, disable that feature throughout testing. If the unit has adjustable louvers, position the louvers parallel with the air flow to maximize air flow and minimize static pressure loss. If the portable air conditioner has network functions, that an end-user can disable and the product's user manual provides instructions on how to do so, disable all network functions throughout testing. If an end-user cannot disable a network function or the product's user manual does not provide instruction for disabling a network function, test the unit with that network function in the factory default configuration for the duration of the test.








3.2.1 *Installation requirements.* For the standby mode and off mode testing, install the portable air conditioner in accordance with Paragraph 5.2 of IEC 62301, referring to Annex D of that standard as necessary. Disregard the provisions regarding batteries and the determination, classification, and testing of relevant modes.


3.2.2 *Electrical energy supply.*

3.2.2.1 *Electrical supply.* For the standby mode and off mode testing, maintain the input standard voltage at 115 V ±1 percent. Maintain the electrical supply at the rated frequency ±1 percent.




3.2.2.2 *Supply voltage waveform.* For the standby mode and off mode testing, maintain the electrical supply voltage waveform indicated in, Paragraph 4.3.2 of IEC 62301, referring to Annex D of that standard as necessary.








3.2.3 *Standby mode and off mode wattmeter.* The wattmeter used to measure standby mode and off mode power consumption must meet the requirements specified in Paragraph 4.4 of IEC 62301, using a two-tailed confidence interval and referring to Annex D of that standard as necessary.




3.2.4 *Standby mode and off mode ambient temperature.* For standby mode and off mode testing, maintain room ambient air temperature conditions as specified in Section 4, Paragraph 4.2 of IEC 62301 (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3).


4.1.1 *Single-Speed Cooling Mode Test.* For single-speed portable air conditioners, measure the indoor room cooling capacity and overall power input in cooling mode in accordance with sections 7.1.b and 7.1.c of ANSI/AHAM PAC-1-2015, respectively, including the references to sections 5.4, 7.3, 7.6, 7.7, and 11 of ASHRAE 37-2009. Determine the test duration in accordance with section 8.7 of ASHRAE 37-2009, including the reference to section 9.2 of the same standard, referring to Figure 12 and the Figure 12 Notes of ANSI/AMCA 210 to determine placement of static pressure taps, and including references to ASHRAE 41.1-1986 and ASHRAE 41.6-1994. Disregard the test conditions in Table 3 of ANSI/AHAM PAC-1-2015. Instead, apply the test conditions for single-duct and dual-duct portable air conditioners presented in Table 1 of this appendix. For single-duct units, measure the indoor room cooling capacity, Capacity_SD_, and overall power input in cooling mode, P_SD_, in accordance with the ambient conditions for test condition 1.C, presented in Table 1 of this appendix. For dual-duct units, measure the indoor room cooling capacity and overall power input twice, first in accordance with ambient conditions for test condition 1.A (Capacity_95_, P_95_), and then in accordance with test condition 1.B (Capacity_83_, P_83_), both presented in Table 1 of this appendix. For the remainder of this test procedure, test combined-duct single-speed portable air conditioners following any instruction for dual-duct single-speed portable air conditioners, unless otherwise specified.


4.1.2 *Variable-Speed Cooling Mode Test.* For variable-speed portable air conditioners, measure the indoor room cooling capacity and overall power input in cooling mode in accordance with sections 7.1.b and 7.1.c of ANSI/AHAM PAC-1-2015, respectively, including the references to sections 5.4, 7.3, 7.6, 7.7, and 11 of ASHRAE 37-2009, except as detailed below. Determine the test duration in accordance with section 8.7 of ASHRAE 37-2009, including the reference to section 9.2 of the same standard. Disregard the test conditions in Table 3 of ANSI/AHAM PAC-1-2015. Instead, apply the test conditions for single-duct and dual-duct portable air conditioners presented in Table 2 of this appendix. For a single-duct unit, measure the indoor room cooling capacity and overall power input in cooling mode twice, first in accordance with the ambient conditions and compressor speed settings for test condition 2.D (Capacity_SD_Full_, P_SD_Full_), and then in accordance with the ambient conditions for test condition 2.E (Capacity_SD_Low_, P_SD_Low_), both presented in Table 2 of this appendix. For dual-duct units, measure the indoor room cooling capacity and overall power input three times, first in accordance with ambient conditions for test condition 2.A (Capacity_95_Full_, P_95_Full_), second in accordance with the ambient conditions for test condition 2.B (Capacity_83_Full_, P_83_Full_), and third in accordance with the ambient conditions for test condition 2.C (Capacity_83_Low_, P_83_Low_), each presented in Table 2 of this appendix. For the remainder of this test procedure, test combined-duct variable-speed portable air conditioners following any instruction for dual-duct variable-speed portable air conditioners, unless otherwise specified. For test conditions 2.A, 2.B, and 2.D, achieve the full compressor speed with user controls, as defined in section 2.13 of this appendix. For test conditions 2.C and 2.E, set the required compressor speed in accordance with instructions the manufacturer provided to DOE.
