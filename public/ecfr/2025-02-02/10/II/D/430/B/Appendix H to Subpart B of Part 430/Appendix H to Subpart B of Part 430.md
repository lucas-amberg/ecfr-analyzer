# Appendix H to Subpart B of Part 430—Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Power Consumption of Television Sets


DOE incorporated by reference in § 430.3, ANSI/CTA-2037-D in its entirety. However, only enumerated provisions of ANSI/CTA-2037-D are applicable to this appendix, as follows:


(a) Section 5 as referenced in section 2 of this appendix;


(b) Sections 6 and 8 through 11 as referenced in section 3 of this appendix;


(c) Section 7 as referenced in sections 3 and 4 of this appendix; and


(d) Annex A as referenced in section 4 of this appendix.


This appendix covers the test requirements used to measure the energy and power consumption of television sets that have a diagonal screen size of at least fifteen inches; and are powered by mains power (including TVs with auxiliary batteries but not TVs with main batteries).


2.1. *Definitions.* The following terms are defined according to section 5.1 of ANSI/CTA-2037-D.


2.2. *Symbol usage.* The symbols and abbreviations in section 5.2 of ANSI/CTA-2037-D apply to this test procedure.


Determine the dynamic luminance and on mode and standby mode power consumption of TVs by following the procedure specified in sections 6 through 11 of ANSI/CTA-2037-D.


Calculate the on mode power consumption, dynamic luminance, standby mode power consumption, and annual energy consumption as specified in Annex A of ANSI/CTA-2037-D. The following additional requirements are also applicable.


4.1. Round on mode power value as specified in Annex A of ANSI/CTA-2037-D.


4.2. Round dynamic luminance to the nearest tenth.


4.3. Round standby mode power as specified in section 7.1.2 of ANSI/CTA-2037-D.


4.4. Round annual energy consumption as specified in Annex A of ANSI/CTA-2037-D.
