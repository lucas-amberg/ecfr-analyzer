3.1 *Active mode.* Perform the following test methods for conventional cooking tops and the conventional cooking top component of a combined cooking product.


3.1.1 *Test vessel and water load selection.*

3.1.1.1 *Conventional electric cooking tops.*

3.1.1.1.1 For cooking zones, measure the size of each cooking zone as specified in Section 6.3.2 of IEC 60350-2, not including any specialty cooking zones as defined in section 1 of this appendix. For circular cooking zones on smooth cooking tops, the cooking zone size is determined using the outer diameter of the printed marking, as specified in Section 6.3 of IEC 60350-2. For open coil cooking zones, the cooking zone size is determined using the widest diameter of the coil, see Figure 3.1.1.1. For non-circular cooking zones, the cooking zone size is determined by the measurement of the shorter side or minor axis. For cooking areas, determine the number of cooking zones as specified in Section 6.3.1 of IEC 60350-2.


3.1.1.1.2 Determine the test vessel diameter in millimeters (mm) and water load mass in grams (g) for each measured cooking zone. For cooking zones, test vessel selection is based on cooking zone size as specified in Table 3 in Section 5.6.1.5 of IEC 60350-2. For cooking areas, test vessel selection is based on the number of cooking zones as specified in Annex A of IEC 60350-2. If a selected test vessel (including its lid) cannot be centered on the cooking zone due to interference with a structural component of the cooking top, the test vessel with the largest diameter that can be centered on the cooking zone shall be used. The allowable tolerance on the water load weight is ±0.5 g.


3.1.1.2 *Conventional gas cooking tops.*

3.1.1.2.1 Record the nominal heat input rate for each cooking zone, not including any specialty cooking zones as defined in section 1 of this appendix.


3.1.1.2.2 Determine the test vessel diameter in mm and water load mass in g for each measured cooking zone according to Table 3.1 of this appendix. If a selected test vessel cannot be centered on the cooking zone due to interference with a structural component of the cooking top, the test vessel with the largest diameter that can be centered on the cooking zone shall be used. The allowable tolerance on the water load weight is ±0.5 g.


3.1.2 *Unit Preparation.* Before the first measurement is taken, all cooking zones must be operated simultaneously for at least 10 minutes at maximum power. This step shall be conducted once per product.


3.1.3 *Gas burner adjustment.* Prior to active mode testing of each tested burner of a conventional gas cooking top, the burner heat input rate must be adjusted, if necessary, to within 2 percent of the nominal heat input rate of the burner as specified by the manufacturer. Prior to ignition and any adjustment of the burner heat input rate, the conventional cooking top must achieve the product temperature specified in section 2.5 of this appendix. Ignite and operate the gas burner under test with the test vessel and water mass specified in section 3.1.1 of this appendix. Measure the heat input rate of the gas burner under test starting 5 minutes after ignition. If the measured input rate of the gas burner under test is within 2 percent of the nominal heat input rate of the burner as specified by the manufacturer, no adjustment of the heat input rate shall be made.


3.1.3.1 *Conventional gas cooking tops with an adjustable internal pressure regulator.* If the measured heat input rate of the burner under test is not within 2 percent of the nominal heat input rate of the burner as specified by the manufacturer, adjust the product's internal pressure regulator such that the heat input rate of the burner under test is within 2 percent of the nominal heat input rate of the burner as specified by the manufacturer. Adjust the burner with sufficient air flow to prevent a yellow flame or a flame with yellow tips. Complete section 3.1.4 of this appendix while maintaining the same gas pressure regulator adjustment.


3.1.3.2 *Conventional gas cooking tops with a non-adjustable internal pressure regulator or without an internal pressure regulator.* If the measured heat input rate of the burner under test is not within 2 percent of the nominal heat input rate of the burner as specified by the manufacturer, remove the product's internal pressure regulator, or block it in the open position, and initially maintain the gas pressure ahead of all controls of the unit under test approximately equal to the manufacturer's recommended manifold pressure. Adjust the gas supply pressure such that the heat input rate of the burner under test is within 2 percent of the nominal heat input rate of the burner as specified by the manufacturer. Adjust the burner with sufficient air flow to prevent a yellow flame or a flame with yellow tips. Complete section 3.1.4 of this appendix while maintaining the same gas pressure regulator adjustment.


3.1.4 *Per-cooking zone energy consumption test.* Establish the test conditions set forth in section 2 of this appendix. Turn off the gas flow to the conventional oven(s), if so equipped. The product temperature must meet the specifications in section 2.5 of this appendix.


3.1.4.1 *Test vessel placement.* Position the test vessel with water load for the cooking zone under test, selected and prepared as specified in section 3.1.1 of this appendix, in the center of the cooking zone, and as specified in Annex C to IEC 60350-2.


3.1.4.2 *Overshoot test.* Use the test methods set forth in Section 7.5.2.1 of IEC 60350-2 to determine the target turndown temperature for each cooking zone, Tc_target_, in degrees Celsius, as follows.


If T_70_ is within the tolerance of 70 ± 0.5 °C, the target turndown temperature is the highest of 80 °C and the calculated Tc_target_, rounded to the nearest integer. If T_70_ is outside of the tolerance, the overshoot test is considered invalid and must be repeated after allowing the product to return to ambient conditions.


3.1.4.3 *Potential simmering setting pre-selection test.* The potential simmering setting for each cooking zone may be determined using the potential simmering setting pre-selecting test. If a potential simmering setting is already known, it may be used instead of completing sections 3.1.4.3.1 through 3.1.4.3.4 of this appendix.


3.1.4.3.1 Use the test vessel with water load for the cooking zone under test, selected, prepared, and positioned as specified in sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.4.1 of this appendix. The temperature of the conventional cooking top is not required to meet the specification for the product temperature in section 2.5 of this appendix for the potential simmering setting pre-selection test. Operate the cooking zone under test with the lowest available power setting. Measure the energy consumption for 10 minutes ±2 seconds.


3.1.4.3.2 Calculate the power density of the power setting, j, on a conventional electric cooking top, Qe_j_, in watts per square centimeter, as:


3.1.4.3.3 Calculate the power density of the power setting, j, on a conventional gas cooking top, Qg_j_, in Btu/h per square centimeter, as:


3.1.4.3.4 Repeat the measurement for each successively higher power setting until Qe_j_ exceeds 0.8 W/cm
2 for conventional electric cooking tops or Qg_j_ exceeds 4.0 Btu/h·cm
2 for conventional gas cooking tops.


For conventional cooking tops with rotating knobs for selecting the power setting, the selection knob shall be turned to the maximum power setting in between each test, to avoid hysteresis. The selection knob shall be turned in the direction from higher power to lower power to select the power setting for the test. If the appropriate power setting is passed, the selection knob shall be turned to the maximum power setting again before repeating the power setting selection.


Of the last two power settings tested, the potential simmering setting is the power setting that produces a power density closest to 0.8 W/cm
2 for conventional electric cooking tops or 4.0 Btu/h·cm
2 for conventional gas cooking tops. The closest power density may be higher or lower than the applicable threshold value.


3.1.4.4 *Simmering test.* The product temperature must meet the specifications in section 2.5 of this appendix at the start of each simmering test. For each cooking zone, conduct the test method specified in Section 7.5.2 of IEC 60350-2, using the potential simmering setting identified in section 3.1.4.3 of this appendix for the initial simmering setting used in Section 7.5.2.2 of IEC 60350-2.


For conventional cooking tops with rotating knobs for selecting the power setting, the selection knob shall be turned in the direction from higher power to lower power to select the potential simmering setting for the test, to avoid hysteresis. If the appropriate setting is passed, the test is considered invalid and must be repeated after allowing the product to return to ambient conditions.


3.1.4.5 *Evaluation of the simmering test.* Evaluate the test conducted under section 3.1.4.4 of this appendix as set forth in Section 7.5.4.1 of IEC 60350-2 according to Figure 3.1.4.5 of this appendix. If the measured turndown temperature, Tc, is not within -0.5 °C and +1 °C of the target turndown temperature, Tc_target_, the test is considered invalid and must be repeated after allowing the product to return to ambient conditions.


3.2 *Standby mode and off mode power.* Establish the standby mode and off mode testing conditions set forth in section 2 of this appendix. For products that take some time to enter a stable state from a higher power state as discussed in Section 5, Paragraph 5.1, Note 1 of IEC 62301 (Second Edition), allow sufficient time for the product to reach the lower power state before proceeding with the test measurement. Follow the test procedure as specified in Section 5, Paragraph 5.3.2 of IEC 62301 (Second Edition) for testing in each possible mode as described in sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 of this appendix. For units in which power varies as a function of displayed time in standby mode, set the clock time to 3:23 at the end of an initial stabilization period, as specified in Section 5, Paragraph 5.3 of IEC 62301 (First Edition). After an additional 10-minute stabilization period, measure the power use for a single test period of 10 minutes +0/−2 seconds that starts when the clock time first reads 3:33. Use the average power approach described in Section 5, Paragraph 5.3.2(a) of IEC 62301 (First Edition).


3.2.1 If the product has an inactive mode, as defined in section 1 of this appendix, measure the average inactive mode power, P_IA_, in watts.


3.2.2 If the product has an off mode, as defined in section 1 of this appendix, measure the average off mode power, P_OM_, in watts.


3.3 *Recorded values.*

3.3.1 *Active mode.*

3.3.1.1 For a conventional gas cooking top tested with natural gas, record the natural gas higher heating value in Btu per standard cubic foot, H_n_, as determined in section 2.2.2.1 of this appendix for the natural gas supply, for each test. For a conventional gas cooking top tested with propane, record the propane higher heating value in Btu per standard cubic foot, H_p_, as determined in section 2.2.2.2 of this appendix for the propane supply, for each test.
