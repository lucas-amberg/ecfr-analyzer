Use propane having a specific gravity between 1.522 and 1.574 and a higher heating value within ±5 percent of 2,500 Btu per standard cubic foot. Determine the actual higher heating value in Btu per standard cubic foot for the propane to be used in the test. If the burner cannot be adjusted to obtain a heat input rate of within ±2 percent of the hourly Btu rating specified by the manufacturer on the nameplate of the unit or in the I&O manual, as required by section 2.4.1 of this appendix, maintain the gas supply to the unit under test at an inlet test pressure immediately ahead of all controls at any value within the range specified on the nameplate of the unit or in the I&O manual that results in a heat input rate of within ±2 percent of the hourly Btu rating specified by the manufacturer on the nameplate of the unit or in the I&O manual.


*2.3.3 Other test gas.* For vented heaters fueled by other test gases, use test gases with characteristics as described in Table 3 of Section 5.2 of ANSI Z21.86-2016. Use gases with a measured higher heating value within ±5 percent of the values specified in Table 3 of Section 5.2 of ANSI Z21.86-2016. Determine the actual higher heating value of the gas used in the test with an error no greater than one percent.


*2.3.4 Oil supply.* For an oil-fueled vented heater, use No. 1 fuel oil (kerosene) for vaporizing-type burners and either No. 1 or No. 2 fuel oil, as specified by the manufacturer in the I&O manual provided with the unit, for mechanical atomizing type burners. Use test fuel conforming to the specifications given in Tables 2 and 3 of Section 8.2.2.3.1 of ASHRAE 103-2017. Measure the higher heating value of the test fuel within ±1 percent.


*2.3.5 Electrical supply.* For auxiliary electric components of a vented heater, maintain the electrical supply to the test unit within ±1 percent of the nameplate voltage for the entire test cycle. If a voltage range is used for nameplate voltage, maintain the electrical supply within ±1 percent of the mid-point of the nameplate voltage range.


*2.4**Burner adjustments.*

*2.4.1 Gas burner adjustments.* Adjust the burners of gas-fueled vented heaters to their maximum Btu ratings at the test pressure specified in section 2.3 of this appendix. Correct the burner volumetric flow rate to 60 °F (15.6 °C) and 30 inches of mercury barometric pressure, set the fuel flow rate to obtain a heat rate of within ±2 percent of the hourly Btu rating specified by the manufacturer on the nameplate of the unit or in the I&O manual, as measured after 15 minutes of operation, starting with all parts of the vented heater at room temperature. Set the primary air shutters in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations on the nameplate of the unit or in the I&O manual to give a good flame at this adjustment. Do not allow the deposit of carbon during any test specified herein. If a vent limiting means is provided on a gas pressure regulator, have it in place during all tests.


For gas-fueled heaters with modulating controls, adjust the controls to operate the heater at the maximum fuel input rate. Set the thermostat control to the maximum setting. Start the heater by turning the safety control valve to the “on” position. In order to prevent modulation of the burner at maximum input, place the thermostat sensing element in a temperature control bath which is held at a temperature below the maximum set point temperature of the control.


For gas-fueled heaters with modulating controls, adjust the controls to operate the heater at the reduced fuel input rate. Set the thermostat control to the minimum setting. Start the heater by turning the safety control valve to the “on” position. If ambient test room temperature is above the lowest control set point temperature, initiate burner operation by placing the thermostat sensing element in a temperature control bath that is held at a temperature below the minimum set point temperature of the control.


*2.4.2 Oil burner adjustments.* Adjust the burners of oil-fueled vented heaters to give the CO_2_ reading recommended by the manufacturer and an hourly Btu input, during the steady-state performance test described below, which is within ±2 percent of the heater manufacturer's specified hourly Btu input rating on the nameplate of the unit or in the I&O manual. On units employing a power burner, do not allow smoke in the flue to exceed a No. 1 smoke during the steady-state performance test as measured by the procedure in ASTM D2156-09 (R2018). If, on units employing a power burner, the smoke in the flue exceeds a No. 1 smoke during the steady-state test, readjust the burner to give a lower smoke reading, and, if necessary, a lower CO_2_ reading, and start all tests over. Maintain the average draft over the fire and in the flue during the steady-state performance test at that recommended by the manufacturer within ±0.005 inches of water gauge. Do not make additional adjustments to the burner during the required series of performance tests. The instruments and measuring apparatus for this test are described in Section 6 and shown in Figure 8 of ASHRAE 103-2017. Calibrate instruments for measuring oil pressure so that the error is no greater than ±0.5 psi.


*2.5 Circulating air adjustments.*

2.11.2 For equipment that has multiple automatic thermostat control modes, test in the default mode (or similarly named mode identified for normal operation) as defined by the manufacturer in its I&O manual. If a default mode is not defined in the I&O manual, test in the mode in which the equipment operates as shipped from the manufacturer.


3.1 *Steady-state testing.*

3.1.1 *Gas fueled vented home heating equipment (including direct vent systems).* Set up the vented heater as specified in sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 of this appendix. The draft diverter shall be in the normal open condition and the stack shall not be insulated. (Insulation of the stack is no longer required for the vented heater test.) Begin the steady-state performance test by operating the burner and the circulating air blower, on units so equipped, with the adjustments specified by sections 2.4.1 and 2.5 of this appendix, until steady-state conditions are attained as indicated by three successive readings taken 15 minutes apart with a temperature variation of not more than ±3 °F (1.7 C) in the stack gas temperature for vented heaters equipped with draft diverters or ±5 °F (2.8 C) in the flue gas temperature for vented heaters equipped with either draft hoods or direct vent systems. The measurements described in this section are to coincide with the last of these 15 minute readings.


On units employing draft diverters, measure the room temperature (T_RA_) as described in section 2.9 of this appendix and measure the steady-state stack gas temperature (T_S,SS_) using the nine thermocouples located in the 5 foot test stack as specified in section 2.6.1 of this appendix. Secure a sample of the stack gases in the plane where T_S,SS_ is measured or within 3.5 feet downstream of this plane. Determine the concentration by volume of carbon dioxide (X_CO2S_) present in the dry stack gas. If the location of the gas sampling differs from the temperature measurement plane, there shall be no air leaks through the stack between these two locations.


On units employing draft hoods or direct vent systems, measure the room temperature (T_RA_) as described in section 2.9 of this appendix and measure the steady-state flue gas temperature (T_F,SS_), using the nine thermocouples located in the flue pipe as described in section 2.6.1 of this appendix. Secure a sample of the flue gas in the plane of temperature measurement and determine the concentration by volume of CO_2_ (X_CO2F_) present in dry flue gas. In addition, for units employing draft hoods, secure a sample of the stack gas in a horizontal plane in the five foot test stack located one foot from the test stack inlet; and determine the concentration by volume of CO_2_ (X_CO2S_) present in dry stack gas.


Determine the steady-state heat input rate (Qin) including pilot gas by multiplying the measured higher heating value of the test gas by the steady-state gas input rate corrected to standard conditions of 60 °F and 30 inches of mercury. Use measured values of gas temperature and pressure at the meter and the barometric pressure to correct the metered gas flow rate to standard conditions.


After the above test measurements have been completed on units employing draft diverters, secure a sample of the flue gases at the exit of the heat exchanger(s) and determine the concentration of CO_2_ (X_CO2F_) present. In obtaining this sample of flue gas, move the sampling probe around or use a sample probe with multiple sampling ports in order to assure that an average value is obtained for the CO_2_ concentration. For units with multiple heat exchanger outlets, measure the CO_2_ concentration in a sample from each outlet to obtain the average CO_2_ concentration for the unit. A manifold (parallel connected sampling tubes) may be used to obtain this sample.


For heaters with single-stage thermostat control (wall mounted electric thermostats), determine the steady-state efficiency at the maximum fuel input rate as specified in section 2.4 of this appendix.


For gas fueled vented heaters equipped with either two stage control or step-modulating control, determine the steady-state efficiency at the maximum fuel input rate and at the reduced fuel input rate, as specified in section 2.4.1 of this appendix.


For manually controlled gas fueled vented heaters with various input rates, determine the steady-state efficiency at a fuel input rate that is within ±5 percent of 50 percent of the maximum rated fuel input rate as indicated on the nameplate of the unit or in the manufacturer's installation and operation manual shipped with the unit. If the heater is designed to use a control that precludes operation at other than maximum rated fuel input rate (single firing rate) determine the steady state efficiency at the maximum rated fuel input rate only.


*3.1.2 Oil-fueled vented home heating equipment (including direct vent systems).* Set up and adjust the vented heater as specified in sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3.4 of this appendix. Begin the steady-state performance test by operating the burner and the circulating air blower, on units so equipped, with the adjustments specified by sections 2.4.2 and 2.5 of this appendix, until steady-state conditions are attained as indicated by a temperature variation of not more than ±5 °F (2.8 °C) in the flue gas temperature in three successive readings taken 15 minutes apart. The measurements described in this section are to coincide with the last of these 15 minutes readings.


For units equipped with power burners, do not allow smoke in the flue to exceed a No. 1 smoke during the steady-state performance test as measured by the procedure described in ASTM D2156-09 (R2018). Maintain the average draft over the fire and in the breeching during the steady-state performance test at that recommended by the manufacturer ±0.005 inches of water gauge.


Measure the room temperature (T_RA_) as described in section 2.9 of this appendix. Measure the steady-state flue gas temperature (T_F,SS_) using nine thermocouples (or five, as applicable) located in the flue pipe as described in section 2.6.2 of this appendix. From the plane where T_F,SS_ was measured, collect a sample of the flue gas and determine the concentration by volume of CO_2_ (X_CO2F_) present in dry flue gas. Measure and record the steady-state heat input rate (Q_in_).


For manually controlled oil fueled vented heaters, determine the steady-state efficiency at a fuel input rate that is within ±5 percent of 50 percent of the maximum fuel input rate; or, if the design of the heater is such that the fuel input rate cannot be set to ±5 percent of 50 percent of the maximum rated fuel input rate, determine the steady-state efficiency at the minimum rated fuel input rate as measured in section 3.1.2 of this appendix for manually controlled oil fueled vented heaters.


3.1.3 *Auxiliary Electric Power Measurement.* Allow the auxiliary electrical system of a gas or oil vented heater to operate for at least five minutes before recording the maximum auxiliary electric power measurement from the wattmeter. Record the maximum electric power (P_E_) expressed in kilowatts. For vented heaters with modulating controls, the recorded (P_E_) shall be maximum measured electric power multiplied by the following factor (R). For two stage controls, R = 1.3. For step modulating controls, R = 1.4 when the ratio of minimum-to-maximum fuel input is greater than or equal to 0.7, R = 1.7 when the ratio of minimum-to-maximum fuel input is less than 0.7 and greater than or equal to 0.5, and R = 2.2 when the ratio of minimum-to-maximum fuel input is less than 0.5.


*3.2 Jacket loss measurement.* Conduct a jacket loss test for vented floor furnaces. Measure the jacket loss (L_j_) in accordance with ASHRAE 103-2017 Section 8.6, applying the provisions for furnaces and not the provisions for boilers.


3.3 *Measurement of the off-cycle losses for vented heaters equipped with thermal stack dampers.* Unless specified otherwise, the thermal stack damper should be at the draft diverter exit collar. Attach a five foot length of bare stack to the outlet of the damper. Install thermocouples as specified in section 2.6.1 of this appendix.


For vented heaters equipped with single-stage thermostats, measure the off-cycle losses at the maximum fuel input rate. For vented heaters equipped with two stage thermostats, measure the off-cycle losses at the maximum fuel input rate and at the reduced fuel input rate. For vented heaters equipped with step-modulating thermostats, measure the off-cycle losses at the reduced fuel input rate.


Allow the vented heater to heat up to a steady-state condition. Feed a tracer gas at a constant metered rate into the stack directly above and within one foot above the stack damper. Record tracer gas flow rate and temperature. Measure the tracer gas concentration in the stack at several locations in a horizontal plane through a cross-section of the stack at a point sufficiently above the stack damper to ensure that the tracer gas is well mixed in the stack.


Continuously measure the tracer gas concentration and temperature during a 10-minute cool-down period. Shut the burner off and immediately begin measuring tracer gas concentration in the stack, stack temperature, room temperature, and barometric pressure. Record these values as the midpoint of each one-minute interval between burner shut-down and ten minutes after burner shut-down. Meter response time and sampling delay time shall be considered in timing these measurements.


3.4 *Measurement of the effectiveness of electro-mechanical stack dampers.* For vented heaters equipped with electro-mechanical stack dampers, measure the cross sectional area of the stack (A_s_), the net area of the damper plate (A_o_), and the angle that the damper plate makes when closed with a plane perpendicular to the axis of the stack (Ω). The net area of the damper plate means the area of the damper plate minus the area of any holes through the damper plate. 


3.5 *Pilot light measurement.*

3.5.1 Measure the energy input rate to the pilot light (Q_P_) with an error no greater than 3 percent for vented heaters so equipped.


3.5.2 For manually controlled heaters where the pilot light is designed to be turned off by the user when the heater is not in use, that is, turning the control to the OFF position will shut off the gas supply to the burner(s) and to the pilot light, the measurement of Q_P_ is not needed. This provision applies only if an instruction to turn off the unit is provided on the heater near the gas control valve (e.g. by label) by the manufacturer.


3.6 *Optional procedure for determining* D_p′_ D_F′_ and D_s_*for systems for all types of vented heaters.* For all types of vented heaters, D_p′_ D_F′_ and D_S_ can be measured by the following optional cool down test. 


Conduct a cool down test by letting the unit heat up until steady-state conditions are reached, as indicated by temperature variation of not more than 5 °F (2.8 °C) in the flue gas temperature in three successive readings taken 15 minutes apart, and then shutting the unit off with the stack or flue damper controls by-passed or adjusted so that the stack or flue damper remains open during the resulting cool down period. If a draft was maintained on oil fueled units in the flue pipe during the steady-state performance test described in section 3.1 of this appendix, maintain the same draft (within a range of −.001 to + .005 inches of water gauge of the average steady-state draft) during this cool down period.


Measure the flue gas mass flow rate (m_F,OFF_) during the cool down test described above at a specific off-period flue gas temperature and corrected to obtain its value at the steady-state flue gas temperature (T_F,SS_), using the procedure described below.


Within one minute after the unit is shut off to start the cool down test for determining D_F_, begin feeding a tracer gas into the combustion chamber at a constant flow rate of V_T_, and at a point which will allow for the best possible mixing with the air flowing through the chamber. (On units equipped with an oil fired power burner, the best location for injecting this tracer gas appears to be through a hole drilled in the air tube.) Periodically measure the value of V_T_ with an instantaneously reading flow meter having an accuracy of ±3 percent of the quantity measured. Maintain V_T_ at less than 1 percent of the air flow rate through the furnace. If a combustible tracer gas is used, there should be a delay period between the time the burner gas is shut off and the time the tracer gas is first injected to prevent ignition of the tracer gas. 


Between 5 and 6 minutes after the unit is shut off to start the cool down test, measure at the exit of the heat exchanger the average flue gas temperature, T*_F,Off_. At the same instant the flue gas temperature is measured, also measure the percent volumetric concentration of tracer gas C_T_ in the flue gas in the same plane where T*_F,Off_ is determined. Obtain the concentration of tracer gas using an instrument which will result in an accuracy of ±2 percent in the value of C_T_ measured. If use of a continuous reading type instrument results in a delay time between drawing of a sample and its analysis, this delay should be taken into account so that the temperature measurement and the measurement of tracer gas concentration coincide. In addition, determine the temperature of the tracer gas entering the flow meter (T_T_) and the barometric pressure (P_B_).


The rate of the flue gas mass flow through the vented heater and the factors D_P_, D_F_, and D_S_ are calculated by the equations in sections 4.5.1 through 4.5.3 of this appendix.


3.6.1 *Procedure for determining (*D_F and_ D_P_) *of vented home heating equipment with no measurable airflow.* On units whose design is such that there is no measurable airflow through the combustion chamber and heat exchanger when the burner(s) is off (as determined by the test procedure in section 3.6.2 of this appendix), D_F_ and D_P_ may be set equal to 0.05.


3.6.2 *Test Method to Determine Whether the Use of the Default Draft Factors (*D_F and_ D_P_) *of 0.05 is Allowed.* Manufacturers may use the following test protocol to determine whether air flows through the combustion chamber and heat exchanger when the burner(s) is off using a smoke stick device. The default draft factor of 0.05 (as allowed per section 3.6.1 of this appendix) may be used only for units determined pursuant to this protocol to have no air flow through the combustion chamber and heat exchanger.


3.6.2.1 *Test Conditions.* Wait for two minutes following the termination of the vented heater's on-cycle.


3.6.2.2 *Location of Test Apparatus*

3.6.2.2.1 After all air currents and drafts in the test chamber have been minimized, position the operable smoke stick/pencil as specified, based on the following equipment configuration: for horizontal combustion air intakes, approximately 4 inches from the vertical plane at the termination of the intake vent and 4 inches below the bottom edge of the combustion air intake, or for vertical combustion air intakes, approximately 4 inches horizontal from vent perimeter at the termination of the intake vent and 4 inches down (parallel to the vertical axis of the vent). In the instance where the boiler combustion air intake is closer than 4 inches to the floor, place the smoke device directly on the floor without impeding the flow of smoke.


3.6.2.2.2 Monitor the presence and the direction of the smoke flow.


3.6.2.3 *Duration of Test.* Continue monitoring the release of smoke for no less than 30 seconds.


3.6.2.4 *Test Results*

3.6.2.4.1 During visual assessment, determine whether there is any draw of smoke into the combustion air intake.


3.6.2.4.2 If absolutely no smoke is drawn into the combustion air intake, the vented heater meets the requirements to allow use of the default draft factor of 0.05.


3.6.2.4.3 If there is any smoke drawn into the intake, use of default draft factor of 0.05 is prohibited. Proceed with the methods of testing as prescribed in section 3.6 of this appendix, or select the appropriate default draft factor from Table 1.


3.7 *Measurement of electrical standby mode and off mode power.*

3.7.1 *Standby power measurements.* With all electrical auxiliaries of the vented heater not activated, measure the standby power (P_W,SB_) in accordance with the procedures in IEC 62301 (Second Edition) (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3), except that section 2.9, *Room ambient temperature,* and the voltage provision of section 2.3.5, *Electrical supply,* of this appendix shall apply in lieu of the IEC 62301 (Second Edition) corresponding sections 4.2, *Test room,* and 4.3, *Power supply.* Clarifying further, the IEC 62301 (Second Edition) sections 4.4, *Power measuring instruments,* and section 5, *Measurements,* shall apply in lieu of section 2.8, *Energy flow instrumentation,* of this appendix.

The recorded standby power (P_W,SB_) shall be rounded to the second decimal place, and for loads greater than or equal to 10W, at least three significant figures shall be reported.


3.7.2 *Off mode power measurement.* If the unit is equipped with a seasonal off switch or there is an expected difference between off mode power and standby mode power, measure off mode power (P_W,OFF_) in accordance with the standby power procedures in IEC 62301 (Second Edition) (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3), except that section 2.9, *Room ambient temperature,* and the voltage provision of section 2.3.5, *Electrical supply,* of this appendix shall apply in lieu of the IEC 62301 (Second Edition) corresponding sections 4.2, *Test room,* and 4.3, *Power supply.* Clarifying further, the IEC 62301 (Second Edition) sections 4.4, *Power measuring instruments,* and section 5, *Measurements,* shall apply in lieu of section 2.8, *Energy flow instrumentation,* of this appendix. Measure the wattage so that all possible off mode wattage for the entire appliance is recorded, not just the off mode wattage of a single auxiliary. If there is no expected difference in off mode power and standby mode power, let P_W,OFF_ = P_W,SB_, in which case no separate measurement of off mode power is necessary. The recorded off mode power (P_W,OFF_) shall be rounded to the second decimal place, and for loads greater than or equal to 10W, at least three significant figures shall be reported.


3.8 *Condensing vented heaters—measurement of condensate under steady-state and cyclic conditions.* Attach condensate drain lines to the vented heater as specified in the manufacturer's I&O manual provided with the unit. The test unit shall be level prior to all testing. A continuous downward slope of drain lines from the unit shall be maintained. The drain lines must facilitate uninterrupted flow of condensate during the test. The condensate collection container must be glass or polished stainless steel to facilitate removal of interior deposits. The collection container shall have a vent opening to the atmosphere, be dried prior to each use, and be at room ambient temperature. The humidity of the room air shall at no time exceed 80 percent relative humidity. For condensing units not designed for collecting and draining condensate, drain lines must be provided during testing that meet the criteria set forth in this section 3.8. Units employing manual controls and units not tested under the optional tracer gas procedures of sections 3.3 and 3.6 of this appendix shall only conduct the steady-state condensate collection test.


3.8.1 *Steady-state condensate collection test.* Begin steady-state condensate collection concurrently with or immediately after completion of the steady-state testing of section 3.1 of this appendix. The steady-state condensate collection period shall be 30 minutes. Condensate mass shall be measured immediately at the end of the collection period to minimize evaporation loss from the sample. Record fuel input during the 30-minute condensate collection steady-state test period. Measure and record fuel higher heating value (HHV), temperature, and pressures necessary for determining fuel energy input (Q_c,ss_). The fuel quantity and HHV shall be measured with errors no greater than ±1 percent. Determine the mass of condensate for the steady-state test (M_c,ss_) in pounds by subtracting the tare container weight from the total container and condensate weight measured at the end of the 30-minute condensate collection test period. The error associated with the mass measurement instruments shall not exceed ±0.5 percent of the quantity measured.


For units with step-modulating or two stage controls, the steady-state condensate collection test shall be conducted at both the maximum and reduced input rates.


*3.8.2 Cyclic condensate collection tests.* If existing controls do not allow for cyclical operation of the tested unit, install control devices to allow cyclical operation of the vented heater. Run three consecutive test cycles. For each cycle, operate the unit until flue gas temperatures at the end of each on-cycle, rounded to the nearest whole number, are within 5 °F of each other for two consecutive cycles. On-cycle and off-cycle times are 4 minutes and 13 minutes respectively. Control of ON and OFF operation actions shall be within ±6 seconds of the scheduled time. For fan-type vented heaters, maintain circulating air adjustments as specified in section 2.5 of this appendix. Begin condensate collection at one minute before the on-cycle period of the first test cycle. Remove the container one minute before the end of each off-cycle period. Measure condensate mass for each test-cycle. The error associated with the mass measurement instruments shall not exceed ±0.5 percent of the quantity measured.


Record fuel input during the entire test period starting at the beginning of the on-time period of the first cycle to the beginning of the on-time period of the second cycle, from the beginning of the on-time period of the second cycle to the beginning of the on-time period of the third cycle, etc., for each of the test cycles. Record fuel HHV, temperature, and pressure necessary for determining fuel energy input, Q_C_. Determine the mass of condensate for each cycle, M_C_, in pounds. If at the end of three cycles, the sample standard deviation is less than or equal to 20 percent of the mean value for three cycles, use total condensate collected in the three cycles as M_C_; if not, continue collection for an additional three cycles and use the total condensate collected for the six cycles as M_C_. Determine the fuel energy input, Q_C_, during the three or six test cycles, expressed in Btu.


For units with step-modulating controls, conduct the cyclic condensate collection test at reduced input rate only. For units with two-stage controls, conduct the cyclic condensate collection test at both maximum and reduced input rates unless the balance-point temperature (T_C_) as determined in section 4.1.10 of this appendix O is equal to or less than the typical outdoor design temperature of 5 °F (-5 °C), in which case, conduct testing at the reduced input rate only.
