2.1. Where ANSI C82.2 (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3) references ANSI C82.1, use ANSI C82.1 (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3) for testing low-frequency ballasts and use ANSI C82.11 (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3) for testing high-frequency ballasts. In addition when applying ANSI C82.2, use the standards ANSI C78.375A, ANSI C78.81-2016, ANSI C82.1, ANSI C82.11, ANSI C82.13, ANSI C82.3, ANSI C82.77, and ANSI C78.901-2016 (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3) instead of the normative references in ANSI 82.2. Specifications in referenced standards that are recommended, that “shall” or “should” be met, or that are not clearly mandatory, are mandatory. In cases where there is a conflict between any industry standard(s) and this appendix, the language of the test procedure in this appendix takes precedence over the industry standard(s).


2.2.1. All instruments must meet the specifications of section 9 of ANSI C78.375A.


2.2.2. *Power Analyzer.* In addition to the specifications in section 9 of ANSI C78.375A, the power analyzer must have a maximum 100 pF capacitance to ground and frequency response between 40 Hz and 1 MHz.

2.3.1. Connect the ballast to a main power source and to the fluorescent lamp(s) as specified in this section. Ensure the ballast is connected to fluorescent lamp(s) according to any manufacturer's wiring instructions on or sold with each unit (including those provided online). To test a low-frequency ballast, follow ANSI C82.1 but disregard section 5.3 of ANSI C82.1. To test a high-frequency ballast, follow ANSI C82.11 but disregard sections 5.3.1 and 5.13 and Annex D of ANSI C82.11.


2.3.2. In the test setup, all wires used in the apparatus, including any wires from the ballast to the lamps and from the lamps to the measuring devices, must meet the following specifications:


2.3.2.1. Use the wires provided by the ballast manufacturer and only the minimum wire length necessary to reach both ends of each lamp. If the wire lengths supplied with the ballast are too short to reach both ends of each lamp, add the minimum additional wire length necessary to reach both ends of each lamp, using wire of the same wire gauge(s) as the wire supplied with the ballast. If no wiring is provided with the ballast, use 18 gauge or thicker wire.


2.3.2.2. Keep wires loose. Do not shorten or allow bundling of any wires. Separate all wires from each other, and ground them to prevent parasitic capacitance.


2.3.3. Test each ballast with only one fluorescent lamp type. Select the one type of fluorescent lamp for testing as follows:


2.3.3.1. Each fluorescent lamp must meet the specifications of a reference lamp as defined by ANSI C82.13, be seasoned at least 12 hours, and be stabilized as specified in 2.5.2.1 of this appendix. Test each reference lamp with a reference ballast that meets the criteria of ANSI C82.3. For low frequency ballasts that operate:

2.3.4.3. *Lamp Arc Current.* Position a current probe on each fluorescent lamp according to Figure 1 of this section for rapid- and programmed-start ballasts; Figure 2 of this section for instant-start ballasts operating SP lamps; and Figure 3 of this section for instant-start ballasts operating MBP, mini-BP, and RDC lamps.


For the lamp arc current measurement, set the full transducer ratio in the power analyzer to match the current probe to the power analyzer.


2.4.1. Establish and maintain test conditions for testing fluorescent lamp ballasts in accordance with sections 3 and 4 of ANSI C82.2.


2.4.2. *Room Temperature and Air Circulation.* Maintain the test area at 25 ±1 °C, with minimal air movement as defined in section 4 of ANSI C78.375A.


2.4.3. *Input Voltage.* For any ballast designed and marketed for operation at only one input voltage, test at that specified voltage. For any ballast that is neither a residential ballast nor a sign ballast but is designed and marketed for operation at multiple voltages, test the ballast at 277 V ±0.1%.

2.6.2. Calculate Power Factor (PF) as follows (do not round values of input power, input voltage, and input current prior to calculation):


3.1. The measurement of standby mode power is required to be performed only if a manufacturer makes any representations with respect to the standby mode power use of the fluorescent lamp ballast. When there is a conflict, the language of the test procedure in this appendix takes precedence over IEC 62301 (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3). Specifications in referenced standards that are not clearly mandatory are mandatory. Manufacturer's instructions, such as “instructions for use” referenced in IEC 62301 mean the manufacturer's instructions that come packaged with or appear on the unit, including on a label. It may include an online manual if specifically referenced (*e.g.,* by date or version number) either on a label or in the packaged instructions. Instructions that appear on the unit take precedence over instructions available electronically, such as through the internet.


3.2.1. Take all measurements with instruments as specified in section 2.2 of this appendix. Fluorescent lamp ballasts that are designed and marketed for connection to control devices must be tested with all commercially available compatible control devices connected in all possible configurations. For each configuration, a separate measurement of standby power must be made in accordance with section 3.4 of this appendix.


3.2.2. Connect each ballast to the maximum number of lamp(s) as specified in section 2.3 (specifications in 2.3.3.1 are optional) of this appendix. Note: ballast operation with reference lamp(s) is not required.


3.3.1. Establish and maintain test conditions in accordance with section 2.4 of this appendix.


3.4.1. Turn on all of the lamps at full light output.


3.4.2. Send a signal to the ballast instructing it to have zero light output using the appropriate ballast communication protocol or system for the ballast being tested.


3.4.3. Stabilize the ballast prior to measurement using one of the methods as specified in section 5 of IEC 62301.


3.4.4. Measure the standby mode energy consumption in watts using one of the methods as specified in section 5 of IEC 62301.
