# Appendix S to Subpart B of Part 430—Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Water Consumption of Faucets and Showerheads




In § 430.3, DOE incorporated by reference the entire standard for ASME A112.18.1; however, only enumerated provisions of ASME A112.18.1 apply to this appendix, as follows. In cases in which there is a conflict, the language of the test procedure in this appendix takes precedence over the referenced test standard. Treat precatory language in ASME A112.18.1 as mandatory.


0.1 ASME A112.18.1:


(a) Section 5.4 “Flow rate,” including Figure 3 but excluding Table 1 and excluding sections 5.4.2.3.1(a) and (c), 5.4.2.3.2(b) and (c), and 5.4.3, as specified in section 2.1 and 2.2 of this appendix;


(b) Section 5.4.2.2(c), as specified in section 3.1 of this appendix.


(c) Section 5.4.2.2(d), as specified in sections 2.2 and 3.2 of this appendix.


0.2 [Reserved]


This appendix covers the test requirements to measure the hydraulic performance of faucets and showerheads.


2.1. Faucets—Measure the water flow rate for faucets, in gallons per minute (gpm) or liters per minute (L/min), or gallons per cycle (gal/cycle) or liters per cycle (L/cycle), in accordance with the test requirements specified in section 5.4, Flow Rate, of ASME A112.18.1. Record measurements at the resolution of the test instrumentation. Round each calculation to the same number of significant digits as the previous step. Round the final water consumption value to one decimal place for non-metered faucets, or two decimal places for metered faucets.


2.2. Showerheads—Measure the water flow rate for showerheads, in gallons per minute (gpm) or liters per minute (L/min), in accordance with the test requirements specified in section 5.4, Flow Rate, of ASME A112.18.1. Record measurements at the resolution of the test instrumentation. Round each calculation to the same number of significant digits as the previous step. Round the final water consumption value to one decimal place. If using the time/volume method of section 5.4.2.2(d), position the container to ensure it collects all water flowing from the showerhead, including any leakage from the ball joint.


When measuring flow rate upstream of a showerhead or faucet using a fluid meter (or equivalent device) as described in section 5.4.2.2(c) of ASME A112.18.1, ensure the fluid meter (or equivalent device) meets the following additional requirements. First, ensure the fluid meter is rated for the flow rate range of the product being tested. Second, when testing showerheads or non-metering faucets, ensure that the fluid meter has a resolution for flow rate of at least 0.1 gallons (0.4 liters) per minute. When testing a metering faucet, ensure that the fluid meter has a resolution for flow rate of at least 0.01 gallons (0.04 liters) per minute. Third, verify the fluid meter is calibrated in accordance with the manufacturer printed instructions.


There are several additional requirements when measuring flow rate downstream of a showerhead or faucet as described in section 5.4.2.2(d) of ASME A112.18.1 to measure flow rate. First, ensure the receiving container is large enough to contain all the water for a single test and has an opening size and/or a partial cover such that loss of water from splashing is minimized. Second, conduct the time/volume test for at least one minute, with the time recorded via a stopwatch with at least 0.1-second resolution. Third, measure and record the temperature of the water using a thermocouple or other similar device either at the receiving container immediately after recording the mass of water, or at the water in the supply line anytime during the duration of the time/volume test. Fourth, measure the mass of water to a resolution of at least 0.01 lb. (0.005 kg) and normalize it to gallons based on the specific gravity of water at the recorded temperature.
