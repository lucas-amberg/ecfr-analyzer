# Appendix W to Subpart B of Part 430—Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Compact Fluorescent Lamps




1. Scope:


1.1. Integrated compact fluorescent lamps.


1.1.1. This appendix specifies the test methods required to measure the initial lamp efficacy, lumen maintenance at 1,000 hours, lumen maintenance at 40 percent of lifetime, time to failure, power factor, correlated color temperature (CCT), color rendering index (CRI), and start time of an integrated compact fluorescent lamp.


1.1.2. This appendix describes how to conduct rapid cycle stress testing for integrated compact fluorescent lamps.


1.1.3. This appendix specifies test methods required to measure standby mode energy consumption applicable to integrated CFLs capable of operation in standby mode (as defined in § 430.2), such as those that can be controlled wirelessly.


1.2. Non-integrated compact fluorescent lamps.


1.2.1. This appendix specifies the test methods required to measure the initial lamp efficacy, lumen maintenance at 40 percent of lifetime, time to failure, CCT, and CRI for non-integrated compact fluorescent lamps.


2. Definitions:


2.1. *Ballasted adapter* means a ballast that is not permanently attached to a compact fluorescent lamp, has no consumer-replaceable components, and serves as an adapter by incorporating both a lamp socket and a lamp base.


2.2. *Hybrid compact fluorescent lamp* means a compact fluorescent lamp that incorporates one or more supplemental light sources of different technology.


2.3. *Initial lamp efficacy* means the lamp efficacy (as defined in § 430.2) at the end of the seasoning period, as calculated pursuant to section 3.2.2.9 of this appendix.


2.4. *Integrated compact fluorescent lamp* means an integrally ballasted compact fluorescent lamp that contains all components necessary for the starting and stable operation of the lamp, contains an ANSI standard base, does not include any replaceable or interchangeable parts, and is capable of being connected directly to a branch circuit through a corresponding ANSI standard lamp-holder (socket).


2.5. *Labeled wattage* means the highest wattage marked on the lamp and/or lamp packaging.


2.6. *Lumen maintenance* means the lumen output measured at a given time in the life of the lamp and expressed as a percentage of the measured initial lumen output.


2.7. *Measured initial input power* means the input power to the lamp, measured at the end of the lamp seasoning period, and expressed in watts (W).


2.8. *Measured initial lumen output* means the lumen output of the lamp measured at the end of the lamp seasoning period, expressed in lumens (lm).


2.9. *Non-integrated compact fluorescent lamp* means a compact fluorescent lamp that is not an integrated compact fluorescent lamp.


2.10. *Percent variability* means the result of dividing the difference between the maximum and minimum values by the average value for a contiguous set of separate time-averaged light output values spanning the specified time period. For a waveform of measured light output values, the time-averaged light output is computed over one full cycle of sinusoidal input voltage, as a moving average where the measurement interval is incremented by one sample for each successive measurement value.


2.11. *Power factor* means the measured input power (watts) divided by the product of the measured RMS input voltage (volts) and the measured RMS input current (amps).


2.12. *Rated input voltage* means the voltage(s) marked on the lamp as the intended operating voltage or, if not marked on the lamp, 120 V.


2.13. *Start plateau* means the first 100 millisecond period of operation during which the percent variability does not exceed 5 percent.


2.14. *Start time* means the time, measured in milliseconds, between the application of power to the compact fluorescent lamp and the beginning of the start plateau.


2.15. *Time to failure* means the time elapsed between first use and the point at which the compact fluorescent lamp (for a hybrid CFL, the primary light source) ceases to produce measurable lumen output.


3. Active Mode Test Procedures


3.1. General Instructions.


3.1.1. In cases where there is a conflict, the language of the test procedure in this appendix takes precedence over any materials incorporated by reference.


3.1.2. Maintain lamp operating orientation throughout seasoning and testing, including storage and handling between tests.


3.1.3. Season CFLs prior to photometric and electrical testing in accordance with sections 4, 5, 6.1, and 6.2.2.1 of IES LM-54-12 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3). Season the CFL for a minimum of 100 hours in accordance with section 6.2.2.1 of IES LM-54-12. During the 100 hour seasoning period, cycle the CFL (operate the lamps for 180 minutes, 20 minutes off) as specified in section 6.4 of IES LM-65-14 (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3).


3.1.3.1. Unit operating time during seasoning may be counted toward time to failure, lumen maintenance at 40 percent of lifetime of a compact fluorescent lamp (as defined in § 430.2), and lumen maintenance at 1,000 hours if the required operating cycle and test conditions for time to failure testing per section 3.3.1 of this appendix are satisfied.


3.1.3.2. If a lamp breaks, becomes defective, fails to stabilize, exhibits abnormal behavior (such as swirling), or stops producing light prior to the end of the seasoning period, the lamp must be replaced with a new unit. If a lamp exhibits one of the conditions listed in the previous sentence after the seasoning period, the lamp's measurements must be included in the sample. Record number of lamps replaced, if any.


3.1.4. Conduct all testing with the lamp operating at labeled wattage. This requirement applies to all CFLs, including those that are dimmable or multi-level.


3.1.5. Operate the CFL at the rated input voltage throughout testing. For a CFL with multiple rated input voltages including 120 volts, operate the CFL at 120 volts. If a CFL with multiple rated input voltages is not rated for 120 volts, operate the CFL at the highest rated input voltage.


3.1.6. Test CFLs packaged with ballasted adapters or designed exclusively for use with ballasted adapters as non-integrated CFLs, with no ballasted adapter in the circuit.


3.1.7. Conduct all testing of hybrid CFLs with all supplemental light sources in the lamp turned off, if possible. Before taking measurements, verify that the lamp has stabilized in the operating mode that corresponds to its primary light source.


3.2. Test Procedures for Determining Initial Lamp Efficacy, Lumen Maintenance, CCT, CRI, and Power Factor.


Determine initial lamp efficacy, lumen maintenance at 40 percent of lifetime of a compact fluorescent lamp (as defined in in § 430.2), CCT, and CRI for integrated and non-integrated CFLs. Determine lumen maintenance at 1,000 hours and power factor for integrated CFLs only.
