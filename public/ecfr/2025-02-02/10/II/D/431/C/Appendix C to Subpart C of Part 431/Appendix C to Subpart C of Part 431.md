1.1. Determination of Daily Energy Consumption. Determine the daily energy consumption of each buffet table or preparation table with a self-contained condensing unit by conducting the test procedure set forth in ASTM F2143-16 section 3, “Terminology,” section 6.1, “Analytical Balance Scale,” section 6.2, “Pans,” section 7, “Reagents and Materials,” section 9.6, “Preparation of Apparatus”, section 10.1, “General” (section 10.1.1 only), section 10.2, “Pan Thermocouple Placement,” section 10.5, “Test” (sections 10.5.5 and 10.5.6 only), section 11.4, “Energy Consumption” (section 11.4.1 only), and section 11.5, “Production Capacity,” with additional instructions as described in the following sections.


1.2. Test Conditions. Ambient conditions and instrumentation for testing shall be as specified in the “Chamber conditions” and “Electricity supply and consumption of unit under test and components metered separately” portions of appendix A to ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata and measured according to section 6.1 of ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata and the specifications in appendix A of ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata. The “highest point” of the buffet table or preparation table shall be determined as the highest point of the open-top refrigerated area of the buffet table or preparation table, without including the height of any lids or covers. The geometric center of the buffet table or preparation table is: for buffet tables or preparation tables without refrigerated compartments, the geometric center of the top surface of the open-top refrigerated area; and for buffet tables or preparation tables with refrigerated compartments, the geometric center of the door opening area for the refrigerated compartment.


1.3. Test Setup. Install the buffet table or preparation table according to sections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 of ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata.


1.4. Test Load.


1.4.1. Pan Loading. Fill pans with distilled water to within 0.5 in. of the top edge of the pan. For pans that are not configured in a horizontal orientation, only the lowest side of the pan is filled to within 0.5 in. of the top edge of the pan with distilled water.


1.4.2. Refrigerated Compartments. Measure the temperature of any refrigerated compartment(s) as specified in section 9.6 of ASTM F2143-16. The thermocouples for measuring compartment air temperature shall be in thermal contact with the center of a 1.6-oz (45-g) cylindrical brass slug with a diameter and height of 0.75 in. The brass slugs shall be placed at least 0.5 in from any heat-conducting surface.


1.5. Stabilization and Test Period. Prepare the unit for testing and conduct two test periods to determine stability according to sections 7.1 through 7.5 of ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata, excluding sections 7.2.1, 7.2.2, 7.3.1, 7.3.2, 7.3.3, and 7.3.4. The preparation period under section 7.2 of ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata includes loading the test unit pans with distilled water and adjusting the controls to maintain the desired performance.


1.5.1. Test Periods A and B. Conduct two test periods, A and B, as specified in section 7.3 of ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata (excluding sections 7.3.1, 7.3.2, 7.3.3, and 7.3.4). The 24-hour test periods shall begin with an 8-hour active period as specified in section 10.5.5 of ASTM F2143-16. Following the active period, the remaining 16 hours of the test period shall be a standby period with the pans remaining in place, any pan covers in the closed position, and with no additional door openings.


1.5.2. Stability. Average pan temperatures shall be used to determine stability, as specified in section 7.5 of ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata, rather than average test simulator temperatures.


1.5.3. Data Recording. For each test period, record data as specified in section 10.1.1 of ASTM F2143-16, except record wet-bulb temperature rather than relative humidity. Rather than voltage, current, and power as specified in section 10.1.1 of ASTM F2143-16, record the electrical supply potential and frequency and energy consumption as specified in appendix A of ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata.


1.6. Target Temperatures.


1.6.1. Average Pan Temperature. The average of all pan temperature measurements during the test period shall be 38 °F ±2 °F. If the unit under test is not able to be operated at this average temperature range, test the unit at the lowest application product temperature (LAPT), as defined in § 431.62. For units equipped with a thermostat, LAPT is measured at the lowest thermostat setting of the unit (for units that are only able to operate at temperatures above the specified test temperature) or the highest thermostat setting of the unit (for units that are only able to operate at temperatures below the specified test temperature).


1.6.2. Average Compartment Temperature. The average of all compartment temperature measurements during the test period shall be 38 °F ±2 °F. If the unit under test is not capable of maintaining both average pan temperature and average compartment temperature within the specified range, the average compartment temperature shall be the average temperature necessary to maintain average pan temperature within the specified range. If the unit is tested at the LAPT for the average pan temperature, as described in section 1.6.1 of this appendix, the average compartment temperature is the average of all compartment temperature measurements at that control setting.


2.1. Pan Volume. Determine pan volume according to section 11.5 of ASTM F2143-16.


2.2. Refrigerated Volume. Determine the volume of any refrigerated compartments according to section 3.2.17 and appendix C of AHRI 1200-2023. The refrigerated volume excludes the volume occupied by pans loaded in the open-top display area for testing.


2.3. Pan Display Area. Determine the pan display area based on the total surface area of water in the test pans when filled to within 0.5 in. of the top edge of the pan, or for test pans that are not configured in a horizontal orientation, when the lowest side of the pan is filled to within 0.5 in. of the top edge of the pan with water.
