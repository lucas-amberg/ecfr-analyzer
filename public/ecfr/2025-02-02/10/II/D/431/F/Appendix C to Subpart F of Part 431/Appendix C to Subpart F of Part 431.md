# Appendix C to Subpart F of Part 431—Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Water-Source Heat Pumps




DOE incorporated by reference in § 431.95, the entire standard for ISO 13256-1:1998. To the extent there is a conflict between the terms or provisions of a referenced industry standard and this appendix, the appendix provisions control.


Determine the energy efficiency ratio (EER) and coefficient of performance (COP) in accordance with ISO 13256-1:1998.


Section 3 of this appendix provides additional instructions for determining EER and COP.


The only additional specifications that may be used in setting up the basic model for testing are those set forth in the installation and operation manual shipped with the unit. Each unit should be set up for test in accordance with the manufacturer installation and operation manuals. Sections 3.1 through 3.2 of this appendix provide specifications for addressing key information typically found in the installation and operation manuals.


3.1. If a manufacturer specifies a range of superheat, sub-cooling, and/or refrigerant pressure in its installation and operation manual for a given basic model, any value(s) within that range may be used to determine refrigerant charge or mass of refrigerant, unless the manufacturer clearly specifies a rating value in its installation and operation manual, in which case the specified rating value must be used.


3.2. The airflow rate used for testing must be that set forth in the installation and operation manuals being shipped to the commercial customer with the basic model and clearly identified as that used to generate the DOE performance ratings. If a rated airflow value for testing is not clearly identified, a value of 400 standard cubic feet per minute (scfm) per ton must be used.
