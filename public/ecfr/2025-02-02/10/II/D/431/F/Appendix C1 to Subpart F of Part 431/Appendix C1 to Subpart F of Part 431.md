(16) 3.2.24 (Hot Gas Bypass),


(17) 3.2.27 (Integrated Energy Efficiency Ratio),


(18) 3.2.28 (Low-static Heat Pump),


(19) 3.2.35 (Power Correction Capacitors),


(20) 3.2.36 (Powered Exhaust Air Fan),


(21) 3.2.37 (Powered Return Air Fan),


(22) 3.2.38 (Process Heat Recovery/Reclaim Coils/Thermal Storage),


(23) 3.2.40 (Published Rating),


(24) 3.2.42 (Refrigerant Reheat Coils),


(25) 3.2.43 (Single Package Heat Pumps),


(26) 3.2.44 (Sound Traps/Sound Attenuators),


(27) 3.2.45 (Split System Heat Pump),


(28) 3.2.51 (Steam/Hydronic Heat Coils),


(29) 3.2.53 (UV Lights),


(30) 3.2.54 (Ventilation Energy Recovery System),


(31) 3.2.55 (Water/Brine to Air Heat Pump Equipment), and

(1) 6.5 (Residential Cooling Capacity and Efficiency),


(2) 6.6 (Residential Heating Capacity and Efficiency),


(3) 6.7 (Test Data vs Computer Simulation),


(4) 6.8 (Rounding and Precision),


(5) 6.9 (Uncertainty), and


(6) 6.10 (Verification Testing),


(e) Section 7 Minimum Data Requirements for Published Ratings is inapplicable


(f) Section 8 Operating Requirements is inapplicable,


(g) Section 9 Marking and Nameplate Data is inapplicable,


(h) Section 10 Conformance Conditions is inapplicable,


(i) Appendix B References—Informative is inapplicable,


(j) Sections D.1 (Purpose), D.2 (Configuration Requirements), and D.3 (Optional System Features) of Appendix D Unit Configuration For Standard Efficiency Determination—Normative are inapplicable, and


(k) Appendix F Example of Determination of Fan and Motor Efficiency for Non-standard Integrated Indoor Fan and Motors—Informative is inapplicable.


(a) Section 1 Purpose is inapplicable.


(b) Section 2 Scope is inapplicable.


(c) Section 4 Classification is inapplicable.


Determine integrated energy efficiency ratio (IEER) and heating applied coefficient of performance (ACOP) in accordance with this appendix and the applicable sections of AHRI 600-2023, ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009, and Melinder 2010. Representations of AEER, EER, and COP may optionally be made.


Section 3 of this appendix provides additional instructions for testing. In cases where there is a conflict, the language of this appendix takes highest precedence, followed by AHRI 600-2023, followed by ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009. Any subsequent amendment to a referenced document by the standard-setting organization will not affect the test procedure in this appendix, unless and until the test procedure is amended by DOE. Material is incorporated as it exists on the date of the approval, and a notification of any change in the incorporation must be published in the _Federal Register_.


When testing a water-source heat pump that includes any of the features listed in table 1 to this appendix, test in accordance with the setup and test provisions specified in table 1 to this appendix.
