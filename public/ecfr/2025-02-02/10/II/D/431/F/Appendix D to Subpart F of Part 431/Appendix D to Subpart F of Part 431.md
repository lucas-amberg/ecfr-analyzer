# Appendix D to Subpart F of Part 431—Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Variable Refrigerant Flow Multi-Split Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps (Other Than Air-Cooled With Rated Cooling Capacity Less Than 65,000 Btu/h)


DOE incorporated by reference in § 431.95, the entire standard for ANSI/AHRI 1230-2010. However, enumerated provisions of ANSI/AHRI 1230-2010, as listed in this section 1, are excluded. To the extent there is a conflict between the terms or provisions of a referenced industry standard and the CFR, the CFR provisions control.


(a) Section 5.1.2—Manufacturer involvement.


(b) Section 6.6—Verification testing and uncertainty is inapplicable as specified in section 2.2 of this appendix.


2. *General.* Determine the energy efficiency ratio (EER) and coefficient of performance (COP) (as applicable) in accordance with ANSI/AHRI 1230-2010.


3. *Optional break-in period.* Manufacturers may optionally specify a “break-in” period, not to exceed 20 hours, to operate the equipment under test prior to conducting the test method specified in this appendix. A manufacturer who elects to use an optional compressor break-in period in its certification testing should record this period's duration as part of the information in the supplemental testing instructions under 10 CFR 429.43.


4. *Refrigerant line length corrections.* For test set-ups where it is physically impossible for the laboratory to use the required line length listed in Table 3 of the ANSI/AHRI 1230-2010, then the actual refrigerant line length used by the laboratory may exceed the required length and the following cooling capacity correction factors are applied:


5. *Additional provisions for equipment set-up.* The only additional specifications that may be used in setting up the basic model for test are those set forth in the installation and operation manual shipped with the unit. Each unit should be set up for test in accordance with the manufacturer installation and operation manuals. Sections 5.1 through 5.3 of this appendix provide specifications for addressing key information typically found in the installation and operation manuals.


5.1. If a manufacturer specifies a range of superheat, sub-cooling, and/or refrigerant pressure in its installation and operation manual for a given basic model, any value(s) within that range may be used to determine refrigerant charge or mass of refrigerant, unless the manufacturer clearly specifies a rating value in its installation and operation manual, in which case the specified rating value must be used.


5.2. The airflow rate used for testing must be that set forth in the installation and operation manual being shipped to the commercial customer with the basic model and clearly identified as that used to generate the DOE performance ratings. If a rated airflow value for testing is not clearly identified, a value of 400 standard cubic feet per minute (scfm) per ton must be used.


5.3. The test set-up and the fixed compressor speeds (*i.e.,* the maximum, minimum, and any intermediate speeds used for testing) should be recorded and maintained as part of the test data underlying the certified ratings that is required to be maintained under 10 CFR 429.71.


6. *Manufacturer involvement in assessment or enforcement testing.* A manufacturer's representative will be allowed to witness assessment and/or enforcement testing for variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps. The manufacturer's representative will be allowed to inspect and discuss set-up only with a DOE representative. During testing, the manufacturer's representative may adjust only the modulating components that are necessary to achieve steady-state operation in the presence of a DOE representative. Only previously documented specifications for set-up as specified under sections 4 and 5 of this appendix will be used.
