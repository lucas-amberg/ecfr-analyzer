# Appendix E1 to Subpart F of Part 431—Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Computer Room Air Conditioners


1. *Incorporation by Reference*

DOE incorporated by reference in § 431.95 the entire standards for AHRI 1360-2022, ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009, and ANSI/ASHRAE 127-2020. However, as listed in sections 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 of this appendix, only certain enumerated provisions of AHRI 1360-2022 and ANSI/ASHRAE 127-2020 are applicable, and only certain enumerated provisions of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 are not applicable. To the extent that there is a conflict between the terms or provisions of a referenced industry standard and the CFR, the CFR provisions control.


1.1 AHRI 1360-2022:


(a) The following sections of Section 3. Definitions—3.1 (Expressions of Provision), 3.2.2 (Air Sampling Device(s)), 3.2.7 (Computer and Data Processing Room Air Conditioner), 3.2.22 (Indoor Unit), 3.2.25 (Manufacturer's Installation Instruction), 3.2.27 (Net Sensible Cooling Capacity), 3.2.28 (Net Total Cooling Capacity), 3.2.37 (Standard Air) and 3.2.38 (Standard Airflow) are applicable.


(b) Section 5. Test Requirements, is applicable.


(c) The following sections of Section 6. Rating Requirements—6.1-6.3, 6.5 and 6.7 are applicable.


(d) Appendix C. Standard Configurations—Normative, is applicable.


(e) Section D2 of Appendix D. Non-Standard Indoor Fan Motors for CRAC units, is applicable.


(f) Appendix E. Method of Testing Computer and Data Processing Room Air Conditioners—Normative, is applicable.


(g) Appendix F. Indoor and Outdoor Air Condition Measurement—Normative is applicable.


1.2 ANSI/ASHRAE 127-2020:


(a) Appendix A—Figure A-1, Test duct for measuring air flow and static pressure on downflow units, is applicable.


(b) [Reserved].


1.3 ASHRAE 37-2009:


(a) Section 1 Purpose is inapplicable.


(b) Section 2 Scope is inapplicable.


(c) Section 4 Classification is inapplicable.


*2. General.* Determine the net sensible coefficient of performance (NSenCOP), in accordance with AHRI 1360-2022, ANSI/ASHRAE 127-2020, and ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009. In cases where there is a conflict between these sources, the language of this appendix takes highest precedence, followed by AHRI 1360-2022, followed by ANSI/ASHRAE 127-2020, followed by ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009. Any subsequent amendment to a referenced document by a standard-setting organization will not affect the test procedure in this appendix, unless and until this test procedure is amended by DOE. Material is incorporated as it exists on the date of the approval, and notification of any change in the incorporation will be published in the _Federal Register_.


3. *Test Conditions*

3.1. *Test Conditions for Certification.* When testing to certify to the energy conservation standards in § 431.97, test using the “Indoor Return Air Temperature Standard Rating Conditions” and “Heat Rejection/Cooling Fluid Standard Rating Conditions” conditions, as specified in Tables 3 and 4 of AHRI 1360-2022, respectively.


4. *Set-Up and Test Provisions for Specific Components.* When testing a unit that includes any of the features listed in Table 4.1 of this appendix, test in accordance with the set-up and test provisions specified in Table 4.1 of this appendix.
