# Appendix F1 to Subpart F of Part 431—Uniform Test Method for the Measurement of Energy Consumption of Air-Cooled, Three-Phase, Small Commercial Package Air Conditioning and Heating Equipment With a Cooling Capacity of Less Than 65,000 Btu/h and Air-Cooled, Three-Phase, Variable Refrigerant Flow Multi-Split Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps With a Cooling Capacity of Less Than 65,000 Btu/h


1. *Incorporation by Reference.* DOE incorporated by reference in § 431.95, the entire standard for AHRI 210/240-2023 and ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009. However, certain enumerated provisions of AHRI 210/240-2023 and ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009, as set forth in this section 1, are inapplicable. To the extent there is a conflict between the terms or provisions of a referenced industry standard and the CFR, the CFR provisions control. Any subsequent amendment to a referenced document by the standard-setting organization will not affect the test procedure in this appendix, unless and until the test procedure is amended by DOE.


1.1. AHRI 210/240-2023:


(a) Section 6 Rating Requirements—6.1 Standard Ratings—6.1.8 Tested Combinations or Tested Units


1.2. ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009:


2. *General.* Determine the seasonal energy efficiency ratio 2 (SEER2) and heating seasonal performance factor 2 (HSPF2) (as applicable) in accordance with AHRI 210/240-2023 and ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009. Sections 3 and 4 to this appendix provide additional instructions for determining SEER2 and HSPF2.


3. *Energy Measurement Accuracy.* The Watt-hour (W⋅h) measurement system(s) shall be accurate within ± 0.5 percent or 0.5 W⋅h, whichever is greater, for both ON and OFF cycles. If two measurement systems are used, then the meters shall be switched within 15 seconds of the start of the OFF cycle and switched within 15 seconds prior to the start of the ON cycle.


4. *Cycle Stability Requirements.* Conduct three complete compressor OFF/ON cycles. Calculate the degradation coefficient CD for each complete cycle. If all three CD values are within 0.02 of the average CD then stability has been achieved, and the highest CD value of these three shall be used. If stability has not been achieved, conduct additional cycles, up to a maximum of eight cycles total, until stability has been achieved between three consecutive cycles. Once stability has been achieved, use the highest CD value of the three consecutive cycles that establish stability. If stability has not been achieved after eight cycles, use the highest CD from cycle one through cycle eight, or the default CD, whichever is lower.
