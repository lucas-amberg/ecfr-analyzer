5.2.1.3. Initiate operation at the rated pump flow rate and measure the outlet water temperature. If the outlet water temperature is maintained at 120 °F ± 5 °F with no variation in excess of 2 °F over a three-minute period, as required by section 8.7.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE 118.1-2012, skip to section 5.3 of this appendix.


5.2.1.4. If the outlet water temperature condition as specified in section 8.7.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE 118.1-2012 is not achieved, adjust the water flow rate over the range of the pump's capacity. If, after varying the water flow rate, the outlet water temperature is maintained at 120 °F ± 5 °F with no variation in excess of 2 °F over a three-minute period, as required by section 8.7.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE 118.1-2012, skip to section 5.3 of this appendix.


5.2.1.5. If, after adjusting the water flow rate within the range that is achievable by the pump, the outlet water temperature condition as specified in section 8.7.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE 118.1-2012 is still not achieved, then change the supply water temperature to 110 °F ± 1 °F and repeat the instructions from sections 5.2.1.2 and 5.2.1.4 of this appendix.


5.2.1. 6. If the outlet water temperature condition cannot be met, then a test procedure waiver is necessary to specify an alternative set of test conditions.


5.2.2. For direct geo-exchange, indoor water-source, ground-source closed-loop, and ground water-source CHPWHs use the following steps:


5.2.2.1. Set the condenser supply water temperature to 110 °F ± 1 °F. The water pressure must not exceed the maximum working pressure rating for the equipment under test.

5.2.2.3. Follow the steps specified in section 8.7.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE 118.1-2012 to obtain an outlet water temperature of 120 °F ± 5 °F with no variation in excess of 2 °F over a three-minute period.


5.3. Conduct the test as per section 9.1.1, “Full Input Rating,” of ANSI/ASHRAE 118.1-2012. The flow rate, “FR,” referred to in section 9.1.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE 118.1-2012 is the flow rate of water through the CHPWH expressed in gallons per minute obtained after following the steps in section 5.2 of this appendix. Use the evaporator side rating conditions specified in section 4.6 of this appendix to conduct the test as per section 9.1.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE 118.1-2012.


5.4. Calculate the COP_h_ of the CHPWH according to section 10.3.1 of the ANSI/ASHRAE 118.1-2012 for the “Full Capacity Test Method.” For all calculations, time differences must be expressed in minutes.
