1. *General.* In cases where there is a conflict, the language of the test procedure in this appendix takes precedence over ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 32.1-2022.


1.1 *Definitions.* In addition to the definitions specified in Section 3, “Definitions,” of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 32.1-2022, the following definitions are also applicable to this appendix.


*Accessory low power mode* means a state in which a beverage vending machine's lighting and/or other energy-using systems are in low power mode, but that is not a refrigeration low power mode. Functions that may constitute an accessory low power mode may include, for example, dimming or turning off lights, but does not include adjustment of the refrigeration system to elevate the temperature of the refrigerated compartment(s).


*External accessory standby mode* means the mode of operation in which any external, integral customer display signs, lighting, or digital screens are connected to main power; do not produce the intended illumination, display, or interaction functionality; and can be switched into another mode automatically with only a remote user-generated or an internal signal.


*Low power mode* means a state in which a beverage vending machine's lighting, refrigeration, and/or other energy-using systems are automatically adjusted (without user intervention) such that they consume less energy than they consume in an active vending environment.


*Lowest application product temperature* means either:


(a) For units that operate only at temperatures above the integrated average temperature specified in Table 1 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 32.1-2022, the lowest integrated average temperature a given basic model is capable of maintaining so as to comply with the temperature stabilization requirements specified in section 7.2.2.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 32.1-2022; or


(b) For units that operate only at temperatures below the integrated average temperature specified in Table 1 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 32.1-2022, the highest integrated average temperature a given basic model is capable of maintaining so as to comply with the temperature stabilization requirements specified in section 7.2.2.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 32.1-2022.


*Refrigeration low power mode* means a state in which a beverage vending machine's refrigeration system is in low power mode because of elevation of the temperature of the refrigerated compartment(s). To qualify as low power mode, the unit must satisfy the requirements described in section 2.3.2.1 of this appendix.


1.2 [Reserved]


2. *Test Procedure.* Conduct testing according to section 4, “Instruments”; section 5, “Vendible Capacity”; section 6, “Test Conditions”; section 7.1, “Test Procedures—General Requirements” (except Section 7.1.2 “Functionality” and section 7.1.5.1 “Beverage Temperature Test Packages”); and section 7.2, “Energy Consumption Test” (except section 7.2.2.6) of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 32.1-2022, except as described in the following sections.


2.1. *Lowest Application Product Temperature.* If a refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machine is not capable of maintaining an integrated average temperature of 36 °F (±1 °F) during the 24-hour test period, the unit must be tested at the lowest application product temperature, as defined in section 1.1 of this appendix.


2.2. *Equipment Installation and Test Setup.* Except as provided in this section 2.2 of this appendix, the test procedure for energy consumption of refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machines shall be conducted in accordance with the methods specified in sections 7.1 through 7.2.2.7 under “Test Procedures” of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 32.1-2022.


2.2.1. *Equipment Loading.* Configure refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machines to hold the maximum number of standard products.


2.2.1.1. *Non-Beverage Shelves.* Any shelves within the refrigerated compartment(s) for non-beverage merchandise only shall not be loaded for testing.


2.2.1.2. *Standard Products.* The standard product shall be standard 12-ounce aluminum beverage cans filled with a liquid with a density of 1.0 grams per milliliter (“g/mL”) ±0.1 g/mL at 36 °F. For product storage racks that are not capable of vending 12-ounce cans, but are capable of vending 20-ounce bottles, the standard product shall be 20-ounce plastic bottles filled with a liquid with a density of 1.0 g/mL ±0.1 g/mL at 36 °F. For product storage racks that are not capable of vending 12-ounce cans or 20-ounce bottles, the standard product shall be the packaging and contents specified by the manufacturer in product literature as the standard product (*i.e.,* the specific merchandise the refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machine is designed to vend).


2.2.1.3. *Standard Test Packages.* A standard test package is a standard product, as specified in section 2.2.1.2 of this appendix, altered to include a temperature-measuring instrument at its center of mass.


2.2.2. *Sensor Placement.* The integrated average temperature of next-to-vend beverages shall be measured in standard test packages in the next-to-vend product locations specified in section 7.1.5.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 32.1-2022. Do not run the thermocouple wire and other measurement apparatus through the dispensing door; the thermocouple wire and other measurement apparatus must be configured and sealed so as to minimize air flow between the interior refrigerated volume and the ambient room air. If a manufacturer chooses to employ a method other than routing thermocouple and sensor wires through the door gasket and ensuring the gasket is compressed around the wire to ensure a good seal, then it must maintain a record of the method used in the data underlying that basic model's certification pursuant to 10 CFR 429.71.


2.2.3. *Vending Mode Test Period.* The vending mode test period begins after temperature stabilization has been achieved, as described in section 7.2.2.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 32.1-2022 and continues for 18 hours for equipment with an accessory low power mode or for 24 hours for equipment without an accessory low power mode. For the vending mode test period, equipment with energy-saving features that cannot be disabled shall have those features set to the most energy-consuming settings, except for as specified in section 2.2.4 of this appendix. In addition, all energy management systems shall be disabled. Provide, if necessary, any physical stimuli or other input to the machine needed to prevent automatic activation of low power modes during the vending mode test period.


2.2.4. *Accessory Low Power Mode Test Period.* For equipment with an accessory low power mode, the accessory low power mode may be engaged for 6 hours, beginning 18 hours after the temperature stabilization requirements established in section 7.2.2.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 32.1-2022 have been achieved, and continuing until the end of the 24-hour test period. During the accessory low power mode test, operate the refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machine with the lowest energy-consuming lighting and control settings that constitute an accessory low power mode. The specification and tolerances for integrated average temperature in Table 2 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 32.1-2022 still apply, and any refrigeration low power mode must not be engaged. Provide, if necessary, any physical stimuli or other input to the machine needed to prevent automatic activation of refrigeration low power modes during the accessory low power mode test period.


2.2.5. *Accessories.* Unless specified otherwise in this appendix or ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 32.1-2022, all standard components that would be used during normal operation of the basic model in the field and are necessary to provide sufficient functionality for cooling and vending products in field installations (*i.e.,* product inventory, temperature management, product merchandising (including, e.g., lighting or signage), product selection, and product transport and delivery) shall be in place during testing and shall be set to the maximum energy-consuming setting if manually adjustable. Components not necessary for the inventory, temperature management, product merchandising (e.g., lighting or signage), product selection, or product transport and delivery shall be de-energized. If systems not required for the primary functionality of the machine as stated in this section cannot be de-energized without preventing the operation of the machine, then they shall be placed in the lowest energy-consuming state. Components with controls that are permanently operational and cannot be adjusted by the machine operator shall be operated in their normal setting and consistent with the requirements of sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 of this appendix. The specific components and accessories listed in the subsequent sections shall be operated as stated during the test, except when controlled as part of a low power mode during the low power mode test period.


2.2.5.1. *Payment Mechanisms.* Refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machines shall be tested with no payment mechanism in place, the payment mechanism in place but de-energized, or the payment mechanism in place but set to the lowest energy-consuming state, if it cannot be de-energized. A default payment mechanism energy consumption value of 0.20 kWh/day shall be added to the primary rated energy consumption per day, as noted in section 2.3 of this appendix.


2.2.5.2. *Internal Lighting.* All lighting that is contained within or is part of the internal physical boundary of the refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machine, as established by the top, bottom, and side panels of the equipment, shall be placed in its maximum energy-consuming state.


2.2.5.3. *External Customer Display Signs, Lights, and Digital Screens.* All external customer display signs, lights, and digital screens that are independent from the refrigeration or vending performance of the refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machine must be disconnected, disabled, or otherwise de-energized for the duration of testing. Customer display signs, lighting, and digital screens that are integrated into the beverage vending machine cabinet or controls such that they cannot be de-energized without disabling the refrigeration or vending functions of the refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machine or modifying the circuitry must be placed in external accessory standby mode, if available, or their lowest energy-consuming state. Digital displays that also serve a vending or money processing function must be placed in the lowest energy-consuming state that still allows the money processing feature to function.


2.2.5.4. *Anti-sweat or Other Electric Resistance Heaters.* Anti-sweat or other electric resistance heaters must be operational during the entirety of the test procedure. Units with a user-selectable setting must have the heaters energized and set to the most energy-consumptive position. Units featuring an automatic, non-user-adjustable controller that turns on or off based on environmental conditions must be operating in the automatic state. Units that are not shipped with a controller from the point of manufacture, but are intended to be used with a controller, must be equipped with an appropriate controller when tested.


2.2.5.5. *Condensate Pan Heaters and Pumps.* All electric resistance condensate heaters and condensate pumps must be installed and operational during the test. Prior to the start of the test, including the 24-hour period used to determine temperature stabilization prior to the start of the test period, as described in section 7.2.2.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 32.1-2022, the condensate pan must be dry. For the duration of the test, including the 24-hour time period necessary for temperature stabilization, allow any condensate moisture generated to accumulate in the pan. Do not manually add or remove water from the condensate pan at any time during the test. Any automatic controls that initiate the operation of the condensate pan heater or pump based on water level or ambient conditions must be enabled and operated in the automatic setting.


2.2.5.6. *Illuminated Temperature Displays.* All illuminated temperature displays must be energized and operated during the test the same way they would be energized and operated during normal field operation, as recommended in manufacturer product literature, including manuals.


2.2.5.7. *Condenser Filters.* Remove any nonpermanent filters provided to prevent particulates from blocking a model's condenser coil.


2.2.5.8. *Security Covers.* Remove any devices used to secure the model from theft or tampering.


2.2.5.9. *General Purpose Outlets.* During the test, do not connect any external load to any general purpose outlets available on a unit.


2.2.5.10. *Crankcase Heaters and Other Electric Resistance Heaters for Cold Weather.* Crankcase heaters and other electric resistance heaters for cold weather must be operational during the test. If a control system, such as a thermostat or electronic controller, is used to modulate the operation of the heater, it must be activated during the test and operated in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.


2.2.5.11. *Refrigerant Leak Mitigation Controls.* Any refrigerant leak mitigation controls that are independent from the refrigeration or vending performance of the refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machine must be disconnected, disabled, or otherwise de-energized for the duration of testing. Refrigerant leak mitigation controls that are integrated into the refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machine cabinet or controls such that they cannot be de-energized without disabling the refrigeration or vending functions of the refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machine or modifying the circuitry must be placed in external accessory standby mode, if available, or their lowest energy-consuming state.


2.3. *Determination of Daily Energy Consumption.* The daily energy consumption shall be equal to the primary rated energy consumption per day (ED), in kWh, determined in accordance with the calculation procedure in section 7.2.3.1, “Calculation of Daily Energy Consumption,” of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 32.1-2022 plus the default payment mechanism energy consumption value from section 2.2.5.1 of this appendix, if applicable. In section 7.2.3.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 32.1-2022, the energy consumed during the test shall be the energy measured during the vending mode test period and accessory low power mode test period, as specified in sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 of this appendix, as applicable.


2.3.1. *Refrigeration Low Power Mode.* For refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machines with a refrigeration low power mode, multiply the value determined in section 2.3 of this appendix by 0.97 to determine the daily energy consumption of the unit tested. For refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machines without a refrigeration low power mode, the value determined in section 2.3 of this appendix is the daily energy consumption of the unit tested.


2.3.1.1. *Refrigeration Low Power Mode Validation Test Method.* This test method is not required for the certification of refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machines. To verify the existence of a refrigeration low power mode, initiate the refrigeration low power mode in accordance with manufacturer instructions contained in product literature and manuals, after completion of the 6-hour low power mode test period. Continue recording all the data specified in section 7.2.2.3 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 32.1-2022 until existence of a refrigeration low power mode has been confirmed or denied. The refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machine shall be deemed to have a refrigeration low power mode if either:


(a) The following three requirements have been satisfied:


(1) The instantaneous average next-to-vend beverage temperature must reach at least 4 °F above the integrated average temperature or lowest application product temperature, as applicable, within 6 hours.


(2) The instantaneous average next-to-vend beverage temperature must be maintained at least 4 °F above the integrated average temperature or lowest application product temperature, as applicable, for at least 1 hour.


(3) After the instantaneous average next-to-vend beverage temperature is maintained at or above 4 °F above the integrated average temperature or lowest application product temperature, as applicable, for at least 1 hour, the refrigerated beverage vending machine must return to the specified integrated average temperature or lowest application product temperature, as applicable, automatically without direct physical intervention.


(b) The compressor does not cycle on for the entire 6-hour period, in which case the instantaneous average beverage temperature does not have to reach 4 °F above the integrated average temperature or lowest application product temperature, as applicable, but, the equipment must still automatically return to the integrated average temperature or lowest application product temperature, as applicable, after the 6-hour period without direct physical intervention.


2.3.2. *Calculations and Rounding.* In all cases, the daily energy consumption must be calculated with raw measured values and the final result rounded to units of 0.01 kWh/day.


3. *Determination of Refrigeration Volume and Surface Area.*

3.1. *Refrigerated Volume.* Determine the “refrigerated volume” of refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machines in accordance with section 5.3, “Refrigerated Volume,” and Appendix C, “Measurement of Volume,” of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 32.1-2022 including the referenced methodology in section 4, “Method for Computing Refrigerated Volume of Refrigerators, Refrigerator-Freezer, Wine Chillers, and Freezers,” of AHAM HRF-1-2016. For combination vending machines, the “refrigerated volume” does not include any non-refrigerated compartment(s).


3.2. *Determination of Surface Area.* (*Note:* This section is not required for the certification of refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machines.) Determine the surface area of each beverage vending machine as the length multiplied by the height of outermost surface of the beverage vending machine cabinet, measured from edge to edge excluding any legs or other protrusions that extend beyond the dimensions of the primary cabinet. Determine the transparent and non-transparent areas on each side of a beverage vending machine as the total surface area of material that is transparent or is not transparent, respectively.
