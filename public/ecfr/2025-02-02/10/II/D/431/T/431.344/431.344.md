# § 431.344   Test procedure for measuring and determining energy efficiency of compressors.

(a) *Scope.* This section is a test procedure that is applicable to a compressor that meets the following criteria:


(1) Is an air compressor;


(2) Is a rotary compressor;


(3) Is not a liquid ring compressor;


(4) Is driven by a brushless electric motor;


(5) Is a lubricated compressor;


(6) Has a full-load operating pressure greater than or equal to 75 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) and less than or equal to 200 psig;


(7) Is not designed and tested to the requirements of the American Petroleum Institute Standard 619, “Rotary-Type Positive-Displacement Compressors for Petroleum, Petrochemical, and Natural Gas Industries;”


(8) Has full-load actual volume flow rate greater than or equal to 35 cubic feet per minute (cfm), or is distributed in commerce with a compressor motor nominal horsepower greater than or equal to 10 horsepower (hp); and


(9) Has a full-load actual volume flow rate less than or equal to 1,250 cfm, or is distributed in commerce with a compressor motor nominal horsepower less than or equal to 200 hp.


(b) *Testing and calculations.* Determine the applicable full-load package isentropic efficiency (η_isen,FL_), part-load package isentropic efficiency (η_isen,PL_), package specific power, maximum full-flow operating pressure, full-load operating pressure, full-load actual volume flow rate, and pressure ratio at full-load operating pressure using the test procedure set forth in appendix A of this subpart.
