Where HI 40.6-2021 refers to “pump,” the term refers to the “bare pump,” as defined in § 431.462. Also, for the purposes of applying this appendix, the term “volume per unit time,” as defined in section 40.6.2, “Terms and definitions,” of HI 40.6-2021 shall be deemed to be synonymous with the term “flow rate” used throughout that standard and this appendix. In addition, the specifications in section 40.6.4.1 of HI 40.6-2021, “Vertically suspended pumps,” do not apply to ST pumps and the performance of ST bare pumps considers bowl performance only. However, the specifications in the first paragraph of section 40.6.4.1 of HI 40.6-2021 (including the applicable provisions of HI 14.1-14.2-2019, the HI Engineering Data Book, and AWWA E103-2015, as referenced in section 40.6.4.1 of HI 40.6), “Vertically suspended pumps,” do apply to VT pumps and the performance of VT bare pumps considers bowl performance only.


A.1 *Scope.* Section II of this appendix applies to all pumps and describes how to calculate the pump energy index (section II.A) based on the pump energy rating for the minimally-compliant reference pump (PER_STD_; section II.B) and the constant load pump energy rating (PER_CL_) or variable load pump energy rating (PER_VL_) determined in accordance with one of sections III through VII of this appendix, based on the configuration in which the pump is distributed in commerce and the applicable testing method specified in sections III through VII and as described in Table 1 of this appendix.

A.3 Section IV of this appendix addresses the testing-based approach for pumps sold with motors, which applies to all pumps sold with electric motors, except for pumps sold with inverter-only synchronous electric motors, but including pumps sold with single-phase induction motors. This test procedure also applies to pumps sold with controls other than continuous or non-continuous controls (*e.g.,* on/off switches).


A.4 Section V of this appendix addresses the calculation-based approach for pumps sold with motors, which applies to:


A.4.1 Pumps sold with polyphase electric motors regulated by DOE's energy conservation standards for electric motors at § 431.25(g), and


A.4.2 SVIL pumps sold with small electric motors regulated by DOE's energy conservation standards at § 431.446 or sold with SNEMs regulated by DOE's test procedure and/or energy conservation standards in subpart B of this part but including motors of such varieties that are less than 0.25 hp, and

C.1 Nominal Speed of Rotation. Determine the nominal speed of rotation based on the range of speeds of rotation at which the pump is designed to operate, in accordance with sections I.C.1.1, I.C.1.2, and I.C.1.3 of this appendix, as applicable. When determining the range of speeds at which the pump is designed to operate, DOE will refer to published data, marketing literature, and other publicly-available information about the pump model and motor, as applicable.


C.1.1 For pumps sold without motors, select the nominal speed of rotation based on the speed for which the pump is designed.


C.1.1.1 For bare pumps designed for speeds of rotation including 2,880 to 4,320 revolutions per minute (rpm), the nominal speed of rotation shall be 3,600 rpm.


C.1.1.2 For bare pumps designed for speeds of rotation including 1,440 to 2,160 rpm, the nominal speed of rotation shall be 1,800 rpm.


C.1.1.3 For bare pumps designed for speeds of rotation including 960 to 1,439 rpm, the nominal speed of rotation shall be 1,200 rpm.

C.1.2.2 For pumps sold with 4-pole induction motors, the nominal speed of rotation shall be 1,800 rpm.




C.1.2.3 For pumps sold with 2-pole induction motors, the nominal speed of rotation shall be 3,600 rpm.

C.2 Multi-Stage Pumps. Perform testing on the pump with three stages for RSH and RSV pumps, and nine stages for ST and VT pumps. If the basic model of pump being tested is only available with fewer than the required number of stages, test the pump with the maximum number of stages with which the basic model is distributed in commerce in the United States. If the basic model of pump being tested is only available with greater than the required number of stages, test the pump with the lowest number of stages with which the basic model is distributed in commerce in the United States. If the basic model of pump being tested is available with both fewer and greater than the required number of stages, but not the required number of stages, test the pump with the number of stages closest to the required number of stages. If both the next lower and next higher number of stages are equivalently close to the required number of stages, test the pump with the next higher number of stages.


C.3 Twin-Head Pumps. For twin-head pumps, perform testing on an equivalent single impeller IL or SVIL pump as applicable, constructed by incorporating one of the driver and impeller assemblies of the twin-head pump being rated into an adequate IL-style or SVIL-style, single impeller volute and casing. An adequate IL-style or SVIL-style, single impeller volute and casing means a volute and casing for which any physical and functional characteristics that affect energy consumption and energy efficiency are the same as their corresponding characteristics for a single impeller in the twin-head pump volute and casing.


D. *Data Collection and Analysis.*

D.1 Damping Devices. Use of damping devices, as described in section 40.6.3.2.2 of HI 40.6-2021, are only permitted to integrate up to the data collection interval used during testing.


D.2 Stabilization. Record data at any tested load point only under stabilized conditions, as defined in HI 40.6-2021 section 40.6.5.5.1, including the applicable provisions of HI 9.6.1-2017 as referenced in section 40.6.5.5.1 of HI 40.6, where a minimum of two measurements are used to determine stabilization.


D.3 Calculations and Rounding. Normalize all measured data to the nominal speed of rotation of 3,600 or 1,800 or 1,200 rpm based on the nominal speed of rotation selected for the pump in section I.C.1 of this appendix, in accordance with the procedures specified in section 40.6.6.1.1 of HI 40.6-2021. Except for the “expected BEP flow rate,” all terms and quantities refer to values determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in this appendix for the rated pump. Perform all calculations using raw measured values without rounding. Round PER _CL_ and PER _VL_ to three significant digits, and round PEI _CL_, and PEI _VL_ values, as applicable, to the hundredths place (*i.e.,* 0.01).


D.4 Pumps with BEP at Run Out. Test pumps for which the expected BEP corresponds to a volume rate of flow that is within 20 percent of the expected maximum flow rate at which the pump is designed to operate continuously or safely (*i.e.,* pumps with BEP at run-out) in accordance with the test procedure specified in this appendix, but with the following exceptions:


D.4.1 Use the following seven flow points—40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 percent of the expected maximum flow rate for determination of BEP in sections III.D, IV.D, V.D, VI.D, and VII.D of this appendix instead of the flow points specified in those sections.


D.4.2 Use flow points of 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 percent of the expected maximum flow rate of the pump to determine pump power input or driver power input instead of the flow points of 60, 75, 90, 100, 110, and 120 percent of the expected BEP flow rate specified in sections III.E.1.1, IV.E.1, V.E.1.1, VI.E.1, and VII.E.1.1 of this appendix.


D.4.3 To determine PER _CL_ in sections III.E, IV.E, and V.E and to determine PER _STD_ in section II.B, use load points of 65, 90, and 100 percent of the BEP flow rate determined with the modified flow points specified in this section I.D.4 of this appendix instead of 75, 100, and 110 percent of BEP flow. In section II.B.1.1, where alpha values are specified for the load points 75, 100, and 110 percent of BEP flow rate, instead apply the alpha values to the load points of 65, 90, and 100 percent of the BEP flow rate determined with the modified flow points specified in this section I.D.4 of this appendix. However, in sections II.B.1.1.1 and II.B.1.1.1.1 of this appendix, use 100 percent of the BEP flow rate as specified to determine η_pump,STD_ and Ns as specified. To determine motor sizing for bare pumps in sections II.B.1.2.1.1 and III.E.1.2.1.1 of this appendix, use a load point of 100 percent of the BEP flow rate instead of 120 percent.
