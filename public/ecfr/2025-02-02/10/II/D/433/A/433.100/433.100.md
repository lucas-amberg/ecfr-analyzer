# § 433.100   Energy efficiency performance standard.

(a) (1) All Federal agencies shall design new Federal buildings that are commercial and multi-family high-rise residential buildings, for which design for construction began on or after January 3, 2007, but before August 10, 2012, to:


(i) Meet ASHRAE 90.1-2004, (incorporated by reference, see § 433.3); and


(ii) If life-cycle cost-effective, achieve energy consumption levels, calculated consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, that are at least 30 percent below the levels of the ASHRAE Baseline Building 2004.


(2) All Federal agencies shall design new Federal buildings that are commercial and multi-family high-rise residential buildings, for which design for construction began on or after August 10, 2012, but before July 9, 2014, to:


(i) Meet ASHRAE 90.1-2007, (incorporated by reference, see § 433.3); and


(ii) If life-cycle cost-effective, achieve energy consumption levels, calculated consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, that are at least 30 percent below the levels of the ASHRAE Baseline Building 2007.


(3) All Federal agencies shall design new Federal buildings that are commercial and multi-family high-rise residential buildings, for which design for construction began on or after July 9, 2014, but before November 6, 2016 to:


(i) Meet ASHRAE 90.1-2010, (incorporated by reference, see § 433.3); and


(ii) If life-cycle cost-effective, achieve energy consumption levels, calculated consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, that are at least 30 percent below the levels of the ASHRAE Baseline Building 2010.


(4) All Federal agencies shall design new Federal buildings that are commercial and multi-family high-rise residential buildings, for which design for construction began on or after November 6, 2016, but before April 7, 2023, to:


(i) Meet ASHRAE 90.1-2013, (incorporated by reference, see § 433.3); and


(ii) If LCC effective, achieve energy consumption levels, calculated consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, that are at least 30 percent below the levels of the ASHRAE Baseline Building 2013.


(5) All Federal agencies shall design new Federal buildings that are commercial and multi-family high-rise residential buildings, for which design for construction began on or after April 7, 2023, to:


(i) Meet ASHRAE 90.1-2019, (incorporated by reference, see § 433.3); and


(ii) If LCC effective, achieve energy consumption levels, calculated consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, that are at least 30 percent below the levels of the ASHRAE Baseline Building 2019.


(b) If a 30 percent reduction is not LCC effective, the design of the proposed building shall be modified so as to achieve an energy consumption level at or better than the maximum level of energy efficiency that is LCC effective, but at a minimum complies with paragraph (a) of this section.
