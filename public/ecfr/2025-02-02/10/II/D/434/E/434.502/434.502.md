# ยง 434.502   Determination of the annual energy cost budget.

502.1 The annual Energy Cost Budgets shall be determined in accordance with the Prototype Building Procedure in ยง 434.503 and ยง 434.504 or the Reference Building Procedure in ยง 434.505. Both methods calculate an annual Energy Cost by summing the 12 monthly Energy Cost Budgets. Each monthly Energy Cost Budget is the product of the monthly Building Energy Consumption of each type of energy used multiplied by the monthly Energy Cost per unit of energy for each type of energy used. 


502.2 The Energy Cost Budget shall be determined in accordance with Equation 502.2.a as follows: 


502.3 The monthly Energy Cost Budget shall be determined using current rate schedules or contract prices available at the building site for all types of energy purchased. These costs shall include demand charges, rate blocks, time of use rates, interruptible service rates, delivery charges, taxes, and all other applicable rates for the type, location, operation, and size of the proposed design. The monthly Budget Energy Consumption shall be calculated from the first day through the last day of each month, inclusive.
