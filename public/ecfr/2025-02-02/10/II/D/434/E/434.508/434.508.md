# ยง 434.508   Determination of the design energy consumption and design energy cost.

508.1 The Design Energy Consumption shall be calculated by modeling the Proposed Design using the same methods, assumptions, climate data, and simulation tool as were used to establish the Energy Cost Budget, except as explicitly stated in 509 through 534. The Design Energy Cost shall be calculated per Equation 508.1. 


The DECON_mi_ shall be calculated from the first day through the last day of the month, inclusive.
