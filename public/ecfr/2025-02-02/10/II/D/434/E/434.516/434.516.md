# § 434.516   Building exterior envelope.

516.1 *Insulation and Glazing.* The insulation and glazing characteristics of the Prototype and Reference Building envelope shall be determined by using the first column under “Base Case”, with no assumed overhangs, for the appropriate Alternate Component Tables (ACP) in Table 402.4.1.2, as defined by climate range. The insulation and glazing characteristics from this ACP are prescribed assumptions for Prototype and Reference Buildings for calculating the Energy Cost Budget. In calculating the Design Energy Consumption of the Proposed Design, the envelope characteristics of the Proposed Design shall be used. 


516.2 *Infiltration.* For Prototype and Reference Buildings, the infiltration assumptions in subsection 516.2.1 shall be prescribed assumptions for calculating the Energy Cost Budget and default assumptions for the Design Energy Consumption. Infiltration shall impact perimeter zones only. 


516.2.1 When the HVAC system is switched “on,” no infiltration shall be assumed. When the HVAC system is switched “off,” the infiltration rate for buildings with or without operable windows shall be assumed to be 0.038 cfm/ft
2 of gross exterior wall. Hotels/motels and multi-family high-rise residential buildings shall have infiltration rates of 0.038 cfm/ft
2 of gross exterior wall area at all times. 


516.3 *Envelope and Ground Absorptivities.* For Prototype and Reference Buildings, absorptivity assumptions shall be prescribed assumptions for computing the Energy Cost Budget and default assumptions for computing the Design Energy Consumption. The solar absorptivity of opaque elements of the building envelope is assumed to be 70%. The solar absorptivity of ground surfaces is assumed to be 80% (20% reflectivity). 


516.4 *Window Management.* For the Prototype and Reference Building, window management drapery assumptions shall be prescribed assumptions for setting the Energy Cost Budget. No draperies shall be the default assumption for computing the Design Energy Consumption. Glazing is assumed to be internally shaded by medium-weight draperies, closed one-half time. The draperies shall be modeled by assuming that one-half the area in each zone is draped and one-half is not. If manually-operated draperies, shades, or blinds are to be used in the Proposed Design, the Design Energy Consumption shall be calculated by assuming they are effective over one-half the glazing area in each zone. 


516.5 *Shading.* For Prototype and Reference buildings and the Proposed Design, shading by permanent structures, terrain, and vegetation shall be taken into account for computing energy consumption, whether or not these features are located on the building site. A permanent fixture is one that is likely to remain for the life of the Proposed Design.
