Attached houses are considered single-family houses as long as they are not divided into more than one dwelling unit and they have independent outside entrances. A single-family house is contained within walls extending from the basement (or the ground floor, if there is no basement) to the roof. Townhouses, row houses, and duplexes are considered single-family attached dwelling units, as long as there is no dwelling unit above or below another.


(5) *Single-Family Detached* means a separate, unconnected dwelling unit, not sharing a wall with any other building or dwelling unit, which provides living space for one household or family. A single-family house is contained within walls extending from the basement (or the ground floor, if there is no basement) to the roof. This includes modular homes but does not include mobile homes.
