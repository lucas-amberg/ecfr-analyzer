# § 503.10   Use of fluidized bed combustion not feasible—general requirement for permanent exemptions.

(a) *OFE finding.* Except in the case of an exemption for fuel mixtures, OFE may deny permanent exemptions authorized under section 212 of the Act if OFE finds on a site-specific or generic basis that use of a method of fluidized bed combustion of an alternate fuel is economically and technically feasible.


(b) *Demonstration.* If OFE has made such a finding, OFE will deny a petitioner's request for exemption unless the petitioner demonstrated that the use of a method of fluidized bed combustion is not economically or technically feasible. The petition or any supplement thereto required by OFE must include the following evidence:


(1) If use of a method of fluidized bed combustion were to be required, evidence that the petitioner would be eligible for a permanent exemption for lack of alternate fuel supply, site limitations, environmental requirements, lack of adequate capital, or State or local requirements; or 


(2) Use of a method of fluidized bed combustion is not technically or economically feasible due to design or special circumstances.
