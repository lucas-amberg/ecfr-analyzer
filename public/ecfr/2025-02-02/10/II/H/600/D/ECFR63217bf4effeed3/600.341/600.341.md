# ยง 600.341   Monitoring and reporting program and financial performance.

(a) The terms and conditions of the award prescribe the reporting requirements, the frequency, and the due dates for reports. At a minimum, requirements must include:


(1) Periodic progress reports (at least annually, but no more frequently than quarterly) addressing both program status and business status, as follows:


(i) The program portions of the reports must address progress toward achieving program performance goals and milestones, including current issues, problems, or developments.


(ii) The business portions of the reports must provide summarized details on the status of resources (Federal funds and non-Federal cost sharing or matching), including an accounting of expenditures for the period covered by the report. The report should compare the resource status with any payment and expenditure schedules or plans provided in the original award, explain any major deviations from those schedules, and discuss actions that will be taken to address the deviations.


(2) A final technical report if the award is for research and development.


(b) If the contracting officer previously authorized advance payments, pursuant to ยง 600.312(a)(2), he/she should consult with the DOE project director and consider whether program progress reported in the periodic progress report, in relation to reported expenditures, is sufficient to justify continued authorization of advance payments.
