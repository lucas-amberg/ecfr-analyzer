(1) The technical merit of the proposed advanced technology vehicles or qualifying components, with greater weight given for factors including, but not limited to:


(i) Improved vehicle fuel economy above that required for an advanced technology vehicle;


(ii) Potential contributions to improved fuel economy of the U.S. light-duty vehicle fleet;


(iii) Likely reductions in petroleum use by the U.S. light-duty fleet; and


(iv) Promotion of use of advanced fuel (e.g., E85, ultra-low sulfur diesel).


(2) Technical Program Factors such as economic development and diversity in technology, company, risk, and geographic location.


(3) The adequacy of the proposed provisions to protect the Government, including sufficiency of Security, the priority of the lien position in the Security, and the percentage of the project to be financed with the loan.


(4) In making loans to those manufacturers that have existing facilities, priority will be given to those facilities that are oldest or have been in existence for at least 20 years even if such facilities are idle at the time of application.
