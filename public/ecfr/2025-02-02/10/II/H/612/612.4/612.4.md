# § 612.4   Recapture.

(a) Credits allocated to an owner/operator shall be subject to recapture—


(1) If the nuclear reactor terminates operations during the award period, pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section; or


(2) At the conclusion of the award period, if the nuclear reactor would not have operated at an annual loss in the absence of the credits, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.


(b) If the Department determines that a nuclear reactor has terminated operations during the award period, then the Department will recapture the award of credits for the award year in which the termination of operations occurred and for any remaining award years by rescinding the credits awarded but not paid, and the owner/operator shall have no further rights to any credits. In addition, the value of credits that the Department has previously paid to the owner/operator with respect to a prior award year shall be repaid to the Department by the owner/operator if the Department determines that the nuclear reactor terminated operations as a result of the owner/operator's failure to adhere to prudent industry practice in the operation of the nuclear reactor during the award period.


(c) Following the conclusion of the award period, the Department will determine whether, for the award period, the nuclear reactor would not have operated at an annual loss in the absence of the credits. The amount subject to recapture following the conclusion of the award period shall be determined in the same manner that the annual adjustment of credits is calculated under the terms of the award of such credits.
