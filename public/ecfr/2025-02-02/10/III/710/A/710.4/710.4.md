# ยง 710.4   Policy.

(a) It is the policy of DOE to provide for the security of its programs in a manner consistent with traditional American concepts of justice and fairness. To this end, the Secretary has established procedures that will afford those individuals described in ยง 710.2 the opportunity for administrative review of questions concerning their eligibility for access authorization or eligibility to hold a sensitive position.


(b) It is also the policy of DOE that none of the procedures established for determining eligibility for access authorization or eligibility to hold a sensitive position shall be used for an improper purpose, including any attempt to coerce, restrain, threaten, intimidate, or retaliate against individuals for exercising their rights under any statute, regulation or DOE directive. Any DOE officer or employee violating, or causing the violation of this policy, shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.
