# ยง 719.41   How does the Department determine whether fees are reasonable?

In determining whether fees or rates charged by retained legal counsel are reasonable, the Department may consider among other things:


(a) Whether the lowest reasonably achievable fees or rates (including any currently available or negotiable discounts) were obtained from retained legal counsel;


(b) Whether lower rates from other firms providing comparable services, at appropriate competency and experience levels, were available;


(c) Whether alternative rate structures such as flat, contingent, and other innovative proposals, were considered; and


(d) The complexity of the legal matter and the expertise of the law firm in this area.
