# ยง 770.7   What procedures are to be used to transfer real property at defense nuclear facilities for economic development?

(a) *Proposal.* The transfer process starts when a potential purchaser or lessee submits to the Field Office Manager a proposal for the transfer of real property that DOE has included on a list of available real property, as provided in ยง 770.5 of this part. 


(1) A proposal must include (but is not limited to): 


(i) A description of the real property proposed to be transferred; 


(ii) The intended use and duration of use of the real property, including potential users and an indication that these users are interested in participating in the economic development of the property;


(iii) A description of the economic development that would be furthered by the transfer (*e.g.,* jobs to be created or retained, improvements to be made) or what reuse or reutilization would be accomplished by means of a description of the business to be created (direct and indirect economic benefits that will result due to the proposed transfer);


(iv) Information supporting the economic viability of the proposed development; and


(v) The consideration offered and any financial requirements. 


(2) The person or entity should state in the proposal whether it is or is not requesting indemnification against claims based on the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant resulting from DOE activities. 


(3) If a proposal for transfer does not contain a statement regarding indemnification, the Field Office Manager will notify the person or entity by letter of the potential availability of indemnification under this part, and will request that the person or entity either modify the proposal to include a request for indemnification or submit a statement that it is not seeking indemnification. 


(b) *Decision to transfer real property.* After review of the proposal, DOE will notify, by letter, the person or entity that submitted the proposal of DOE's decision whether or not a transfer of the real property by sale or lease is in the best interest of the Government. If DOE determines the transfer is in the Government's best interest, then the Field Office Manger will begin development of a transfer agreement. 


(c) *Congressional committee notification.* DOE may not transfer real property under this part until 30 days have elapsed after the date DOE notifies congressional defense committees of the proposed transfer. The Field Office Manager will notify congressional defense committees through the Secretary of Energy.
