# ยง 770.8   May DOE transfer real property at defense nuclear facilities for economic development at less than fair market value?

DOE generally attempts to obtain fair market value for real property transferred for economic development, but DOE may agree to sell or lease such property for less than fair market value if the statutory transfer authority used imposes no market value restriction, and: 


(a) The real property requires considerable infrastructure improvements to make it economically viable, or


(b) A conveyance at less than market value would, in the DOE's judgment, further the public policy objectives of the laws governing the downsizing of defense nuclear facilities.
