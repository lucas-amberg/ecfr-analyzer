*Design features* means the design features of a nuclear facility specified in the technical safety requirements that, if altered or modified, would have a significant effect on safe operation.


*Document* means recorded information that describes, specifies, reports, certifies, requires, or provides data or results.


*Documented safety analysis* means a documented analysis of the extent to which a nuclear facility can be operated safely with respect to workers, the public, and the environment, including a description of the conditions, safe boundaries, and hazard controls that provide the basis for ensuring safety.


*Environmental restoration activities* means the process(es) by which contaminated sites and facilities are identified and characterized and by which contamination is contained, treated, or removed and disposed.


*Fissionable materials* means a nuclide capable of sustaining a neutron-induced chain reaction (*e.g.,* uranium-233, uranium-235, plutonium-238, plutonium-239, plutonium-241, neptunium-237, americium-241, and curium-244).


*Graded approach* means the process of ensuring that the level of analysis, documentation, and actions used to comply with a requirement in this part are commensurate with:


(1) The relative importance to safety, safeguards, and security;


(2) The magnitude of any hazard involved;


(3) The life cycle stage of a facility;


(4) The programmatic mission of a facility;


(5) The particular characteristics of a facility;


(6) The relative importance of radiological and nonradiological hazards; and


(7) Any other relevant factor.


*Hazard* means a source of danger (*i.e.,* material, energy source, or operation) with the potential to cause illness, injury, or death to a person or damage to a facility or to the environment (without regard to the likelihood or credibility of accident scenarios or consequence mitigation).


*Hazard Category 1, 2, and 3 DOE nuclear facilities* means nuclear facilities that meet the criteria for their respective hazard category consistent with the provisions of DOE-STD-1027-92, Change Notice 1. Hazard Category 1, 2, and 3 DOE nuclear facilities are required to have safety bases established in accordance with Subpart B of this part. Hazard categories are based on their radioactive material inventories and the potential consequences to the public, workers, and the environment. Hazard Category 1 represents the highest potential consequence and Hazard Category 3 represents the lowest potential consequence of the facilities required to establish safety bases.


*Hazard controls* means measures to eliminate, limit, or mitigate hazards to workers, the public, or the environment, including:


(1) Physical, design, structural, and engineering features;


(2) Safety structures, systems, and components;


(3) Safety management programs;


(4) Technical safety requirements; and


(5) Other controls necessary to provide adequate protection from hazards.


*Item* is an all-inclusive term used in place of any of the following: Appurtenance, assembly, component, equipment, material, module, part, product, structure, subassembly, subsystem, system, unit, or support systems.


*Limiting conditions for operation* means the limits that represent the lowest functional capability or performance level of safety structures, systems, and components required for safe operations.


*Limiting control settings* means the settings on safety systems that control process variables to prevent exceeding a safety limit.


*Low-level residual fixed radioactivity* means the remaining radioactivity following reasonable efforts to remove radioactive systems, components, and stored materials. The remaining radioactivity is composed of surface contamination that is fixed following chemical cleaning or some similar process; a component of surface contamination that can be picked up by smears; or activated materials within structures. The radioactivity can be characterized as low-level if the smearable radioactivity is less than the values defined for removable contamination by 10 CFR part 835, Appendix D, Surface Contamination Values, and the hazard analysis results show that no credible accident scenario or work practices would release the remaining fixed radioactivity or activation components at levels that would prudently require the use of active safety systems, structures, or components to prevent or mitigate a release of radioactive materials.


*Major modification* means a modification to a DOE nuclear facility that substantially changes the existing safety basis for the facility.


*New Hazard Category 1, 2, and 3 DOE nuclear facility* means a Hazard Category 1, 2, or 3 DOE nuclear facility that is in design or under construction that does not yet have a DOE approved safety basis.


*Nonreactor nuclear facility* means those facilities, activities or operations that involve, or will involve, radioactive and/or fissionable materials in such form and quantity that a nuclear or a nuclear explosive hazard potentially exists to workers, the public, or the environment, but does not include accelerators and their operations and does not include activities involving only incidental use and generation of radioactive materials or radiation such as check and calibration sources, use of radioactive sources in research and experimental and analytical laboratory activities, electron microscopes, and X-ray machines.


*Nuclear facility* means a reactor or a nonreactor nuclear facility where an activity is conducted for or on behalf of DOE and includes any related area, structure, facility, or activity to the extent necessary to ensure proper implementation of the requirements established by this Part.


*Operating limits* means those limits required to ensure the safe operation of a nuclear facility, including limiting control settings and limiting conditions for operation.


*Preliminary documented safety analysis* means documentation prepared in connection with the design and construction of a new Hazard Category 1, 2, or 3 DOE nuclear facility or a major modification to an existing Hazard Category 1, 2, or 3 DOE nuclear facility that provides a reasonable basis for the preliminary conclusion that the nuclear facility can be operated safely through the consideration of factors such as:


(1) The nuclear safety design criteria to be satisfied;


(2) A safety analysis that derives aspects of design that are necessary to satisfy the nuclear safety design criteria; and


(3) An initial listing of the safety management programs that must be developed to address operational safety considerations.


*Process* means a series of actions that achieves an end or result.


*Quality* means the condition achieved when an item, service, or process meets or exceeds the user's requirements and expectations.


*Quality assurance* means all those actions that provide confidence that quality is achieved.

(3) The basis for approval by DOE of the safety basis for the facility, including any conditions for approval.


*Safety limits* means the limits on process variables associated with those safety class physical barriers, generally passive, that are necessary for the intended facility function and that are required to guard against the uncontrolled release of radioactive materials.


*Safety management program* means a program designed to ensure a facility is operated in a manner that adequately protects workers, the public, and the environment by covering a topic such as: Quality assurance; maintenance of safety systems; personnel training; conduct of operations; inadvertent criticality protection; emergency preparedness; fire protection; waste management; or radiological protection of workers, the public, and the environment.
