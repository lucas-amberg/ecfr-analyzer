# ยง 905.34   Adjustment provisions.

Western reserves the right to adjust marketable resources committed to all customers with long-term firm power contracts only as required to respond to changes in hydrology and river operations, except as otherwise expressly provided in these regulations. Under contracts that extend resources under this PMI, existing customers shall be given at least 5 years' notice before adjustments are made. New customers may receive less notice. The earliest that any notice under this section shall become effective is the date that existing contractual commitments expire. Any adjustment shall only take place after an appropriate public process. Withdrawals to serve project use and other purposes provided for by contract shall continue to take place based on existing contract/marketing criteria principles.
