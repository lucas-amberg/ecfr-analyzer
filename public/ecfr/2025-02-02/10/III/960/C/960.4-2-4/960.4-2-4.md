# ยง 960.4-2-4   Climatic changes.

(a) *Qualifying condition.* The site shall be located where future climatic conditions will not be likely to lead to radionuclide releases greater than those allowable under the requirements specified in ยง 960.4-1. In predicting the likely future climatic conditions at a site, the DOE will consider the global, regional, and site climatic patterns during the Quaternary Period, considering the geomorphic evidence of the climatic conditions in the geologic setting.


(b) *Favorable conditions.* (1) A surface-water system such that expected climatic cycles over the next 100,000 years would not adversely affect waste isolation.


(2) A geologic setting in which climatic changes have had little effect on the hydrologic system throughout the Quaternary Period.


(c) *Potentially adverse conditions.* (1) Evidence that the water table could rise sufficiently over the next 10,000 years to saturate the underground facility in a previously unsaturated host rock.


(2) Evidence that climatic changes over the next 10,000 years could cause perturbations in the hydraulic gradient, the hydraulic conductivity, the effective porosity, or the ground-water flux through the host rock and the surrounding geohydrologic units, sufficient to significantly increase the transport of radionuclides to the accessible environment.
