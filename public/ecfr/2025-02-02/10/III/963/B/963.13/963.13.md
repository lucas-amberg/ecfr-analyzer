# ยง 963.13   Preclosure suitability evaluation method.

(a) DOE will evaluate preclosure suitability using a preclosure safety evaluation method. DOE will evaluate the performance of the geologic repository at the Yucca Mountain site using the method described in paragraph (b) of this section and the criteria in ยง 963.14. DOE will consider the performance of the system in terms of the criteria to evaluate whether the geologic repository is likely to comply with the applicable radiation protection standard. 


(b) The preclosure safety evaluation method, using preliminary engineering specifications, will assess the adequacy of the repository facilities to perform their intended functions and prevent or mitigate the effects of postulated Category 1 and 2 event sequences. The preclosure safety evaluation will consider: 


(1) A preliminary description of the site characteristics, the surface facilities and the underground operating facilities; 


(2) A preliminary description of the design bases for the operating facilities and a preliminary description of any associated limits on operation; 


(3) A preliminary description of potential hazards, event sequences, and their consequences; and 


(4) A preliminary description of the structures, systems, components, equipment, and operator actions intended to mitigate or prevent accidents.
