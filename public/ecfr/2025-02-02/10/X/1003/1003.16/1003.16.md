# § 1003.16   Dismissal of petitions.

The Director may issue a Decision and Order dismissing a petition at any time during the course of a proceeding. The Decision and Order shall state whether the dismissal is with prejudice or without prejudice. A Decision and order Dismissing a petition may be the subject of a motion for reconsideration in accordance with § 1003.19 of this part.


(a) *Dismissal with prejudice.* The dismissal of a petition with prejudice by the OHA terminates the OHA's review of the petition and bars the petitioner from submitting any future petition concerning the same, or substantially the same, issues as those in the petition. The OHA may dismiss a petition with prejudice if:


(1) The OHA lacks jurisdiction to consider the petition;


(2) The petitioner has already received a Decision and Order from the Director in response to a previously filed petition that addresses the same issue;


(3) The petitioner provides a false statement under oath or files a false instrument with the OHA, as determined by the OHA;


(4) The petitioner refuses to comply with an order issued by the OHA;


(5) The petition is untimely;


(6) The issues raised in the petition are moot;


(7) The petitioner repeatedly fails to comply with procedural requirements; or,


(8) The same or a substantially similar petition was previously dismissed by the OHA without prejudice, and the same basis for dismissal without prejudice exists upon refiling by the same petitioner.


(b) *Dismissal without prejudice.* The dismissal of a petition without prejudice by the OHA terminates the OHA's review of the petition but does not bar the petitioner from resubmitting the petition provided that the facts or circumstances leading to the dismissal have been resolved. In dismissing a petition without prejudice, the OHA may order that the petitioner may not resubmit the petition, or a substantially similar petition, for a period of time not to exceed 180 days. The OHA may dismiss a petition without prejudice if:


(1) The petitioner fails to include any of the required elements of a petition set forth in § 1003.11 of this part;


(2) The petitioner fails to provide notice as required by § 1003.12 of this part;


(3) The petitioner fails to timely provide documents or information at the request of the OHA pursuant to § 1003.14 or § 1003.15 of this part;


(4) The petition fails to state a claim upon which the OHA can grant relief; or


(5) The OHA determines that there is insufficient information upon which to base a decision.
