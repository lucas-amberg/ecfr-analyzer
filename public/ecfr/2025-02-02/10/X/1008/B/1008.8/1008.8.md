# § 1008.8   Action in response to a request for access: disclosure of requested information to subject individuals.

(a) Consistent with the recommendation of the System Manager and the concurrence of the appropriate General Counsel, the Privacy Act Officer shall provide to the requesting individual the information about or access to a record or information pertaining to the individual contained in a system of records, unless the request is being denied in accordance with § 1008.9 of this part. The Privacy Act Officer shall notify the individual of such determination and provide the following information: 


(1) Whether there is information or a record pertaining to him that is contained in a system of records; 


(2) The methods of access as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section; 


(3) The place at which the record or information may be inspected; 


(4) The earliest date on which the record or information may be inspected and the period of time that the record or information will remain available for inspection. In no event shall the earliest date be later than thirty calendar days from the date of notification. 


(5) An indication that copies of the records are enclosed, or the estimated date by which a copy of the record could be mailed and the estimate of fees that would be charged to provide other than the first copy of the record, pursuant to § 1008.13. 


(6) The fact that the individual, if he wishes, may be accompanied by another person during the in-person review of the record or information, provided that the individual shall first furnish to the Privacy Act Officer a written statement authorizing disclosure of that individual's record in the accompanying person's presence; and 


(7) Any additional requirements that must be satisfied in order to provide information about or to grant access to the requested record or information. 


(b) The following methods of access to records or information pertaining to an individual and contained in a system of records may be available to that individual depending on the circumstances of a particular request:


(1) A copy of the record may be enclosed with the initial response in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section;


(2) Inspection in person may be arranged during the regular business hours of the DOE in the office specified by the Privacy Act Officer;


(3) Transfer of records to a Federal facility more convenient to the individual may be arranged, but only if the Privacy Act Officer determines that a suitable facility is available, that the individual's access can be properly supervised at that facility, and that transmittal of the records or information to that facility will not unduly interfere with operations of the DOE or involve unreasonable costs, in terms of money or manpower; and 


(4) The requested number of copies in addition to the initial copy may be mailed at the request of the individual, subject to payment of the fees prescribed in § 1008.13.


(c) If the Privacy Act Officer believes, based upon a recommendation of the System Manager and the agency's medical officer, that disclosure of medical and/or psychological information directly to an individual could have an adverse effect upon that individual, the individual may be asked:


(1) To designate in writing a physician or mental health professional to whom he would like the records to be disclosed; or


(2) To submit a signed statement by his physician or a mental health professional indicating that, in his view, disclosure of the requested records or information directly to the individual will not have an adverse effect upon the individual. If the individual refuses to designate a physician or mental health professional, or to submit a signed statement from his physician or mental health professional as provided in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section, the request will be considered denied, and the appeal rights provided in § 1008.11 will be available to the individual.


(d) The Privacy Act Officer shall supply such other information and assistance at the time of an individual's review of his record as is necessary to make the record intelligible to the individual.


(e) The DOE will, as required by subsection (d)(1), assure an individual's right “to review his or her record and have a copy made of all or any portion thereof in a form comprehensible to him.” However, original records will be made available to individuals only under the supervision of the Privacy Act Officer or his designee. Individuals will be provided at their request with a copy, but not the original, of records pertaining to them.
