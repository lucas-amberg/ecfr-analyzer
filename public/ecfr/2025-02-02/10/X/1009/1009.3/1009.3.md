# ยง 1009.3   Policy.

(a) The Department's price or charge for materials and services sold to persons and organizations outside the Federal Government shall be the Government's full cost for those materials and services, unless otherwise provided in this part.


(b) Exceptions from the Department pricing and charging policy may be authorized in accordance with the following provisions:


(1) Prices and charges for byproduct material sold pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 2111 and 2112 *et seq.* shall be either the full cost recovery price or the commercial price, whichever is higher, except that lower prices and charges may be established by the Department if it is determined that such lower prices and charges (i) will provide reasonable compensation to the Government for such material, (ii) will not discourage the use of or the development of sources of supply independent of the DOE of such material, and (iii) will encourage research and development. In individual cases, if (ii) and (iii) cannot be equally accommodated, greater weight will be given to encouragement of research and development.


(2) Prices and charges for materials and services sold pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 2201 shall be either the full cost recovery price or the commercial price, whichever is higher, except that lower prices and charges may be established by the Department if it is determined that such lower prices and charges will provide reasonable compensation to the Government and will not discourage the development of sources of supply independent of the DOE of such material.
