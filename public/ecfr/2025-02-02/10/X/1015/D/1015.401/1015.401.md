# ยง 1015.401   Scope and application.

(a) The standards set forth in this subpart apply to the suspension or termination of collection activity pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711 on debts that do not exceed $100,000, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, after deducting the amount of partial payments or collections, if any. Prior to referring a debt to the DOJ for litigation, DOE may suspend or terminate collection under this part with respect to debts arising out of activities of, or referred to, DOE. 


(b) If, after deducting the amount of any partial payments or collections, the principal amount of a debt exceeds $100,000, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, the authority to suspend or terminate rests solely with the DOJ. If DOE believes that suspension or termination of any debt in excess of $100,000 may be appropriate, DOE shall refer the debt to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating division in the DOJ, using the CCLR. The referral should specify the reasons for DOE's recommendation. If, prior to referral to the DOJ, DOE determines that a debt is plainly erroneous or clearly without legal merit, DOE may terminate collection activity regardless of the amount involved without obtaining DOJ concurrence.
