(a) *Regulations.* Any person who violates a UCNI security requirement of any of the following is subject to a civil penalty under this part:


(1) 10 CFR Part 1017—Identification and Protection of Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information; or


(2) Any other DOE regulation related to the safeguarding or security of UCNI if the regulation provides that violation of its provisions may result in a civil penalty pursuant to section 148 of the Act.


(b) *Compliance order.* If, without violating a requirement of any regulation issued under section 148, a person by an act or omission causes, or creates a risk of, the loss, compromise or unauthorized disclosure of UCNI, the Secretary may issue a compliance order to that person requiring the person to take corrective action and notifying the person that violation of the compliance order is subject to a notice of violation and assessment of a civil penalty. If a person wishes to contest the compliance order, the person must file a notice of appeal with the Secretary within 15 days of receipt of the compliance order.


(c) *Amount of penalty.* The Director may propose imposition of a civil penalty for violation of a requirement of a regulation under paragraph (a) of this section or a compliance order issued under paragraph (b) of this section, not to exceed $337,966 for each violation.






(d) *Settlements.* The Director may enter into a settlement, with or without conditions, of an enforcement proceeding at any time if the settlement is consistent with the objectives of DOE's UCNI protection requirements.


(e) *Enforcement conference.* The Director may convene an informal conference to discuss any situation that might be a violation of the Act, its significance and cause, any correction taken or not taken by the person, any mitigating or aggravating circumstances, and any other useful information. The Director may compel a person to attend the conference. This conference will not normally be open to the public and there shall be no transcript.


(f) *Investigations.* The Director may conduct investigations and inspections relating to the scope, nature and extent of compliance by a person with DOE security requirements specified in these regulations and take such action as the Director deems necessary and appropriate to the conduct of the investigation or inspection, including signing, issuing and serving subpoenas.


(g) *Preliminary notice of violation.* (1) In order to begin a proceeding to impose a civil penalty under this part, the Director shall notify the person by a written preliminary notice of violation sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, of:


(i) The date, facts, and nature of each act or omission constituting the alleged violation;


(ii) The particular provision of the regulation or compliance order involved in each alleged violation;


(iii) The proposed remedy for each alleged violation, including the amount of any civil penalty proposed;


(iv) The right of the person to submit a written reply to the Director within 30 calendar days of receipt of such preliminary notice of violation; and,


(v) The fact that upon failure of the person to pay any civil penalty imposed, the penalty may be collected by civil action.


(2) A reply to a preliminary notice of violation must contain a statement of all relevant facts pertaining to an alleged violation. The reply must:


(i) State any facts, explanations, and arguments that support a denial of the alleged violation;

(iii) Discuss the relevant authorities that support the position asserted, including rulings, regulations, interpretations, and previous decisions issued by DOE;


(iv) Furnish full and complete answers to any questions set forth in the preliminary notice; and


(v) Include copies of all relevant documents.


(3) If a person fails to submit a written reply within 30 calendar days of receipt of a preliminary notice of violation:


(i) The person relinquishes any right to appeal any matter in the preliminary notice; and

(4) The Director, at the request of a person notified of an alleged violation, may extend for a reasonable period the time for submitting a reply or a hearing request letter.


(h) *Final notice of violation.* (1) If a person submits a written reply within 30 calendar days of receipt of a preliminary notice of violation, the Director must make a final determination whether the person violated or is continuing to violate an UCNI security requirement.


(2) Based on a determination by the Director that a person has violated or is continuing to violate an UCNI security requirement, the Director may issue to the person a final notice of violation that concisely states the determined violation, the amount of any civil penalty imposed, and further actions necessary by or available to the person. The final notice of violation also must state that the person has the right to submit to the Director, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the notice, a written request for a hearing under paragraph (i) of this section.


(3) The Director must send a final notice of violation by certified mail, return receipt requested, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of a reply.


(4) Subject to paragraphs (h)(7) and (h)(8) of this section, the effect of final notice shall be:


(i) If a final notice of violation does not contain a civil penalty, it shall be deemed a final order 15 days after the final notice is issued.


(ii) If a final notice of violation contains a civil penalty, the person must submit to the Director within 30 days after the issuance of the final notice:


(A) A waiver of further proceedings; or


(B) A request for an on-the-record hearing under paragraph (i) of this section.


(5) If a person waives further proceedings, the final notice of violation shall be deemed a final order enforceable against the person. The person must pay the civil penalty set forth in the notice of violation within 60 days of the filing of waiver unless the Director grants additional time.


(6) If a person files a request for an on-the-record hearing, then the hearing process commences.


(7) The Director may amend the final notice of violation at any time before the time periods specified in paragraphs (h)(4)(i) or (h)(4)(ii) of this section expire. An amendment shall add 15 days to the time period under paragraph (h)(4) of this section.

The UCNI status shall not, however, preclude information from being introduced into evidence. The Hearing Officer may issue such orders as may be necessary to consider such evidence *in camera* including the preparation of a supplemental initial decision to address issues of law or fact that arise out of that portion of the evidence that is protected.
