# § 1040.2   Application.

(a) The application of this part is to any program or activity for which Federal financial assistance is authorized under laws administered by DOE. Types of Federal financial assistance to which this part applies are listed in Appendix A of this part. appendix A is to be revised from time to time by notice published in the _Federal Register._ This part applies to money paid, property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance including cooperative agreements extended, by way of grant, loan, or contract by DOE, or grants awarded in the performance of a contract with DOE by an authorized contractor or subcontractor, the terms of which require compliance with this part. If any statutes implemented by this part are otherwise applicable, the failure to list a type of Federal financial assistance in appendix A does not mean that a program or activity is not covered by this part. 


(b) This part does not apply to: 


(1) Contracts of insurance or guaranty; 


(2) Employment practices under any program or activity except as provided in §§ 1040.12, 1040.14, 1040.41, 1040.47 and 1040.66; or
