(a) Where a recipient is found to have discriminated on the basis of age, the recipient shall take such remedial action as the Director, Office of Civil Rights and Diversity, considers necessary to overcome the effects of the discrimination.


(b) Even in the absence of a finding of discrimination, a recipient may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in the recipient's program or activity on the basis of age.


(c) If a recipient operating a program or activity which serves the elderly or children, in addition to persons of other ages, provides special benefits to the elderly or to children, the provision of those benefits shall be presumed to be voluntary affirmative action provided that it does not have the effect of excluding otherwise eligible persons from participation in the program or activity.
