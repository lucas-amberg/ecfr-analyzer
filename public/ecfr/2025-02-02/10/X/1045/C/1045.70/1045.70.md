(1) Ensuring the information is not prohibited from being classified under ยง 1045.75;


(2) Considering whether the information falls within the classification or declassification presumptions in ยง 1045.80; and


(3) Evaluating the criteria in this paragraph.


(i) Whether the information is so widely known or readily apparent to knowledgeable observers that its classification would cast doubt on the credibility of classification programs;


(ii) Whether publication of the information would assist in the development of countermeasures or otherwise jeopardize any U.S. weapon or weapon system;


(iii) Whether the information would hinder U.S. nonproliferation efforts by significantly assisting potential adversaries to develop or improve a nuclear weapon capability, produce nuclear weapons materials, or make other military use of nuclear energy;
