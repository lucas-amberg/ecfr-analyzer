# ยง 1045.120   What training is required for persons who have access to or who derivatively classify matter containing RD, FRD, or TFNI?

(a) Prior to being authorized access to RD and FRD, a person must receive training that explains:


(1) What information is potentially RD and FRD;


(2) Matter that potentially contains RD or FRD must be reviewed by an RD Derivative Classifier to determine whether it contains RD or FRD;


(3) DOE must review matter that potentially contains RD or TFNI for public release and DOE or DoD must review matter that potentially contains FRD for public release;


(4) RD Derivative Classification authority is required to classify or upgrade matter containing RD or FRD, or to downgrade the level of matter containing RD or FRD;


(5) Only a person trained in accordance with this section, may classify matter containing TFNI;


(6) Matter containing RD, FRD, and TFNI is not automatically declassified and only DOE authorized persons may downgrade the category or declassify matter marked as containing RD; only DOE or DoD authorized persons may downgrade the category or declassify matter marked as containing FRD;


(7) How to submit a challenge if they believe RD, FRD, or TFNI information (*e.g.,* a guide topic) or matter containing RD, FRD, or TFNI is not properly classified; and


(8) Access requirements for matter marked as containing RD or FRD.


(b) Each person with access to RD and FRD must also receive periodic refresher briefings covering these same topics.


(c) In addition to the training in paragraph (a) of this section, prior to derivatively classifying matter containing RD, or FRD and every 2 years thereafter, each RD Derivative Classifier must also receive training that explains:


(1) The use of classification guides, classification bulletins, and portion-marked source documents to classify matter containing RD and FRD;


(2) What to do if applicable classification guidance is not available;


(3) Limitations on an RD Derivative Classifier's authority to remove RD or FRD portions from matter; and


(4) Marking requirements for matter containing RD and FRD.


(d) Prior to having access to TFNI, and periodically thereafter, each person must receive the following training (which may be combined with the training required for access to RD or FRD):


(1) What information is potentially TFNI;


(2) Only a person with appropriate training may determine if matter contains TFNI;


(3) Marking requirements for matter containing TFNI;


(4) Matter containing TFNI is not automatically declassified and only DOE authorized persons may downgrade the category or declassify matter marked as containing TFNI; and


(5) How to submit a challenge if they believe TFNI information (*e.g.,* a guide topic) or matter containing TFNI is not properly classified.


(e) In addition to the training in ยง 1045.120(d), prior to derivatively classifying matter containing TFNI and every 2 years thereafter, each person who derivatively classifies matter containing TFNI must also receive training that explains:


(1) The markings applied to matter containing TFNI;


(2) Limitations on their authority to remove TFNI portions from matter;


(3) Only DOE authorized persons may determine that classified matter no longer contains TFNI;


(4) Only DOE authorized persons may declassify matter marked as containing TFNI; and


(5) DOE must review matter that potentially contains TFNI for public release.
