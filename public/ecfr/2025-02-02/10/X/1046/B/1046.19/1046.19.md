(a) SPOs and SOs must report immediately to their supervisor that they have a known or suspected change in health status that might impair their capacity for duty. To protect their medical confidentiality, they are required only to identify that they need to see the Designated Physician.

(b) SPOs and SOs must report to their supervisor and the Designated Physician for a determination of fitness for duty when prescription medication is started or a dosage is changed, to ensure that such medication or change in dosage does not alter the individual's ability to perform any of the essential functions of the job. SPOs and SOs must report to their supervisor and the Designated Physician for a determination of fitness for duty within 24 hours, and prior to assuming duty, after any medication capable of affecting the mind, emotions, and behavior is started, to ensure that such medication does not alter the individual's ability to perform any of the essential functions of the job.
