# § 1710.113   Coordinating salary offset with other agencies.

(a) *Responsibility of the Board as the creditor agency.* The Chairperson or his or her designee shall coordinate debt collections with other agencies and shall, as appropriate:


(1) Arrange for a hearing or special review upon proper petitioning by a federal employee; and


(2) Prescribe, upon consultation with the General Counsel, such additional practices and procedures as may be necessary to carry out the intent of this regulation.


(3) The designated salary offset coordinator will be responsible for:


(i) Ensuring that each notice of intent to offset is consistent with the requirements of §§ 1710.107 and 1710.111 of this part;


(ii) Ensuring that each certification of debt that is sent to a paying agency is consistent with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section;


(iii) Obtaining hearing officials; and


(iv) Ensuring that hearings are properly scheduled.


(b) *Requesting recovery from current paying agency.* Upon completion of the procedures established in these regulations and pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514, the Board must:


(1) Certify, in writing, to the paying agency that the employee owes the debt, the amount and basis of the debt, the date on which payment(s) is due, the date the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, and that the Board's regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. 5514 have been approved by the Office of Personnel Management;


(2) Advise the paying agency of the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be collected in each installment and the number and commencing date of the installments (if a date other than the next officially established pay period is required);


(3) Advise the paying agency of the action(s) taken under 5 U.S.C. 5514(b) and give the date(s) action(s) were taken (unless the employee has consented to the salary offset in writing or signed a statement acknowledging receipt of the required procedures and the written consent or statement is forwarded to the paying agency);


(4) Submit a debt claim certification containing the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1), (2), and (3) of this section and an installment agreement (or other instruction on the payment schedule), if applicable, to the paying agency; and


(5) Submit the debt claim to the paying agency for collection if the employee is in the process of separating, and has not received a final salary check, or other final payment(s) from the paying agency. The Board must submit a properly certified claim to the agency responsible for making such payments before the collection can be made.


(c) *Separated employee.* If the employee is already separated and all payments due from his or her former paying agency have been paid, the Board may request, unless otherwise prohibited, that money due and payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (5 CFR 831.1801 *et seq.* or 5 CFR 845.401 *et seq.*), or other similar funds, be administratively offset to collect the debt (31 U.S.C. 3716 and the FCCS).


(d) *Employee transfer.* When an employee transfers from one paying agency to another paying agency, the Board is not required to repeat the due process procedures described in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this subpart to resume the collection. The Board will submit a properly certified claim to the new paying agency and will subsequently review the debt to verify that the collection is continued by the new paying agency.
