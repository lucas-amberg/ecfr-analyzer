# § 100.16   Independent expenditure (52 U.S.C. 30101(17)).

(a) The term *independent expenditure* means an expenditure by a person for a communication expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate that is not made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate's authorized committee, or their agents, or a political party committee or its agents. A communication is “made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate's authorized committee, or their agents, or a political party committee or its agents” if it is a coordinated communication under 11 CFR 109.21 or a party coordinated communication under 11 CFR 109.37. 


(b) No expenditure by an authorized committee of a candidate on behalf of that candidate shall qualify as an independent expenditure. 


(c) No expenditure shall be considered independent if the person making the expenditure allows a candidate, a candidate's authorized committee, or their agents, or a political party committee or its agents to become materially involved in decisions regarding the communication as described in 11 CFR 109.21(d)(2), or shares financial responsibility for the costs of production or dissemination with any such person.
