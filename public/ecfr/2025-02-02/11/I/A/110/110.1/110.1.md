# § 110.1   Contributions by persons other than multicandidate political committees (52 U.S.C. 30116(a)(1)).

(a) *Scope.* This section applies to all contributions made by any person as defined in 11 CFR 100.10, except multicandidate political committees as defined in 11 CFR 100.5(e)(3) or entities and individuals prohibited from making contributions under 11 CFR 110.20 and 11 CFR parts 114 and 115.


(b) *Contributions to candidates; designations; and redesignations.* (1) No person shall make contributions to any candidate, his or her authorized political committees or agents with respect to any election for Federal office that, in the aggregate, exceed $2,000. 


(i) The contribution limitation in the introductory text of paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be increased by the percent difference in the price index in accordance with 11 CFR 110.17. 


(ii) The increased contribution limitation shall be in effect for the 2-year period beginning on the first day following the date of the last general election in the year preceding the year in which the contribution limitation is increased and ending on the date of the next general election. For example, an increase in the contribution limitation made in January 2005 is effective from November 3, 2004 to November 7, 2006. 


(iii) In every odd numbered year, the Commission will publish in the _Federal Register_ the amount of the contribution limitation in effect and place such information on the Commission's Web site.


(2) For purposes of this section, *with respect to any election* means—


(i) In the case of a contribution designated in writing by the contributor for a particular election, the election so designated. Contributors to candidates are encouraged to designate their contributions in writing for particular elections. *See* 11 CFR 110.1(b)(4).


(ii) In the case of a contribution not designated in writing by the contributor for a particular election, the next election for that Federal office after the contribution is made.


(3)(i) A contribution designated in writing for a particular election, but made after that election, shall be made only to the extent that the contribution does not exceed net debts outstanding from such election. To the extent that such contribution exceeds net debts outstanding, the candidate or the candidate's authorized political committee shall return or deposit the contribution within ten days from the date of the treasurer's receipt of the contribution as provided by 11 CFR 103.3(a), and if deposited, then within sixty days from the date of the treasurer's receipt the treasurer shall take the following action, as appropriate:


(A) Refund the contribution using a committee check or similar draft, including electronic transfer; or


(B) Obtain a written redesignation by the contributor for another election in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(b)(5); or


(C) Obtain a written reattribution to another contributor in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(k)(3).


If the candidate is not a candidate in the general election, all contributions made for the general election shall be either returned or refunded to the contributors or redesignated in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(b)(5), or reattributed in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(k)(3), as appropriate.


(ii) In order to determine whether there are net debts outstanding from a particular election, the treasurer of the candidate's authorized political committee shall calculate net debts outstanding as of the date of the election. For purposes of this section, *net debts outstanding* means the total amount of unpaid debts and obligations incurred with respect to an election, including the estimated cost of raising funds to liquidate debts incurred with respect to the election and, if the candidate's authorized committee terminates or if the candidate will not be a candidate for the next election, estimated necessary costs associated with termination of political activity, such as the costs of complying with the post-election requirements of the Act and other necessary administrative costs associated with winding down the campaign, including office space rental, staff salaries and office supplies, less the sum of:


(A) The total cash on hand available to pay those debts and obligations, including: currency; balances on deposit in banks, savings and loan institutions, and other depository institutions; traveler's checks; certificates of deposit; treasury bills; and any other committee investments valued at fair market value; and


(B) The total amounts owed to the candidate or political committee in the form of credits, refunds of deposits, returns, or receivables, or a commercially reasonable amount based on the collectibility of those credits, refunds, returns, or receivables.




(iii) The amount of the net debts outstanding shall be adjusted as additional funds are received and expenditures are made. The candidate and his or her authorized political committee(s) may accept contributions made after the date of the election if: 


(A) Such contributions are designated in writing by the contributor for that election; 


(B) Such contributions do not exceed the adjusted amount of net debts outstanding on the date the contribution is received; and 


(C) Such contributions do not exceed the contribution limitations in effect on the date of such election. 




(iv) This paragraph shall not be construed to prevent a candidate who is a candidate in the general election or his or her authorized political committee(s) from paying primary election debts and obligations with funds which represent contributions made with respect to the general election.


(4) For purposes of this section, a contribution shall be considered to be designated in writing for a particular election if—


(i) The contribution   clearly indicates the particular election with respect to which the contribution is made;


(ii) The contribution is accompanied by a writing, signed by the contributor, which clearly indicates the particular election with respect to which the contribution is made; or


(iii) The contribution is redesignated in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(b)(5).


(5)(i) The treasurer of an authorized political committee may request a written redesignation of a contribution by the contributor for a different election if—


(A) The contribution was designated in writing for a particular election, and the contribution, either on its face or when aggregated with other contributions from the same contributor for the same election, exceeds the limitation on contributions set forth in 11 CFR 110.1(b)(1);


(B) The contribution was designated in writing for a particular election and the contribution was made after that election and the contribution cannot be accepted under the net debts outstanding provisions of 11 CFR 110.1(b)(3);


(C) The contribution was not designated in writing for a particular election, and the contribution exceeds the limitation on contributions set forth in 11 CFR 110.1(b)(1); or


(D) The contribution was not designated in writing for a particular election, and the contribution was received after the date of an election for which there are net debts outstanding on the date the contribution is received.


(ii)(A) A contribution shall be considered to be redesignated for another election if— 




(*1*) The treasurer of the recipient authorized political committee requests that the contributor provide a written redesignation of the contribution and informs the contributor that the contributor may request the refund of the contribution as an alternative to providing a written redesignation; and 


(*2*) Within sixty days from the date of the treasurer's receipt of the contribution, the contributor provides the treasurer with a written redesignation of the contribution for another election, which is signed by the contributor. 


(B) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section or any other provision of this section, the treasurer of the recipient authorized political committee may treat all or part of the amount of the contribution that exceeds the contribution limits in paragraph (b)(1) of this section as made with respect to the general election, provided that: 


(*1*) The contribution was made before the primary election; 


(*2*) The contribution was not designated for a particular election; 


(*3*) The contribution would exceed the limitation on contributions set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if it were treated as a contribution made for the primary election; 


(*4*) Such redesignation would not cause the contributor to exceed any of the limitations on contributions set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; 


(*5*) The treasurer of the recipient authorized political committee notifies the contributor of the amount of the contribution that was redesignated and that the contributor may request a refund of the contribution; and 


(*6*) Within sixty days from the date of the treasurer's receipt of the contribution, the treasurer shall provide notification required in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B)(5) of this section to the contributor by any written method. 


(C) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section or any other provision of this section, the treasurer of the recipient authorized political committee may treat all or part of the amount of the contribution that exceeds the contribution limits in paragraph (b)(1) of this section as made with respect to the primary election, provided that: 


(*1*) The contribution was made after the primary election but before the general election; 


(*2*) The contribution was not designated for a particular election; 


(*3*) The contribution would exceed the limitation on contributions set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if it were treated as a contribution made for the general election; 


(*4*) Such redesignation would not cause the contributor to exceed any of the limitations on contributions set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; 


(*5*) The contribution does not exceed the committee's net debts outstanding for the primary election; 


(*6*) The treasurer of the recipient authorized political committee notifies the contributor of how the contribution was redesignated and that the contributor may request a refund of the contribution; and 


(*7*) Within sixty days from the date of the treasurer's receipt of the contribution, the treasurer shall provide notification required in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(C)(6) of this section to the contributor by any written method.

(6) For the purposes of this section, a contribution shall be considered to be made when the contributor relinquishes control over the contribution. A contributor shall be considered to relinquish control over the contribution when it is delivered by the contributor to the candidate, to the political committee, or to an agent of the political committee. A contribution that is mailed to the candidate, or to the political committee or to an agent of the political committee, shall be considered to be made on the date of the postmark. *See* 11 CFR 110.1(l)(4)  A contribution made in an electronic transaction is considered to be made when the contributor authorizes the transaction.  An in-kind contribution shall be considered to be made on the date that the goods or services are provided by the contributor.

(2) By agreement of the partners, as long as—


(i) Only the profits of the partners to whom the contribution is attributed are reduced (or losses increased), and


(ii) These partners' profits are reduced (or losses increased) in proportion to the contribution attributed to each of them.

(2) A contribution by an LLC that elects to be treated as a partnership by the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to 26 CFR 301.7701-3, or does not elect treatment as either a partnership or a corporation pursuant to that section, shall be considered a contribution from a partnership pursuant to 11 CFR 110.1(e).


(3) An LLC that elects to be treated as a corporation by the Internal Revenue Service, pursuant to 26 CFR 301.7701-3, or an LLC with publicly-traded shares, shall be considered a corporation pursuant to 11 CFR Part 114.
