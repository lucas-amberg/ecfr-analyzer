(b) *General content requirements.* A disclaimer required by paragraph (a) of this section must contain the following information: 


(1) If the communication, including any solicitation, is paid for and authorized by a candidate, an authorized committee of a candidate, or an agent of either of the foregoing, the disclaimer must clearly state that the communication has been paid for by the authorized political committee; 


(2) If the communication, including any solicitation, is authorized by a candidate, an authorized committee of a candidate, or an agent of either of the foregoing, but is paid for by any other person, the disclaimer must clearly state that the communication is paid for by such other person and is authorized by such candidate, authorized committee, or agent; or 


(3) If the communication, including any solicitation, is not authorized by a candidate, authorized committee of a candidate, or an agent of either of the foregoing, the disclaimer must clearly state the full name and permanent street address, telephone number, or website address of the person who paid for the communication, and that the communication is not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee.


(c) *Disclaimer specifications*—(1) *Specifications for all disclaimers.* A disclaimer required by paragraph (a) of this section must be presented in a clear and conspicuous manner, to give the reader, observer, or listener adequate notice of the identity of the person or political committee that paid for and, where required, that authorized the communication. A disclaimer is not clear and conspicuous if it is difficult to read or hear, or if the placement is easily overlooked. 


(2) *Specific requirements for printed communications.* In addition to the general requirement of paragraphs (b) and (c)(1) of this section, a disclaimer required by paragraph (a) of this section that appears on any printed public communication must comply with all of the following: 


(i) The disclaimer must be of sufficient type size to be clearly readable by the recipient of the communication. A disclaimer in twelve (12)-point type size satisfies the size requirement of this paragraph (c)(2)(i) when it is used for signs, posters, flyers, newspapers, magazines, or other printed material that measure no more than twenty-four (24) inches by thirty-six (36) inches. 


(ii) The disclaimer must be contained in a printed box set apart from the other contents of the communication. 


(iii) The disclaimer must be printed with a reasonable degree of color contrast between the background and the printed statement. A disclaimer satisfies the color contrast requirement of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) if it is printed in black text on a white background or if the degree of color contrast between the background and the text of the disclaimer is no less than the color contrast between the background and the largest text used in the communication. 


(iv) The disclaimer need not appear on the front or cover page of the communication as long as it appears within the communication, except on communications, such as billboards, that contain only a front face. 


(v) A communication that would require a disclaimer if distributed separately, that is included in a package of materials, must contain the required disclaimer. 


(3) *Specific requirements for radio and television communications authorized by candidates.* In addition to the general requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c)(1) of this section, a communication that is authorized or paid for by a candidate or the authorized committee of a candidate (*see* paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section) that is transmitted through radio or television, or through any broadcast, cable, or satellite transmission, must comply with the following: 


(i) A communication transmitted through radio must include an audio statement by the candidate that identifies the candidate and states that he or she has approved the communication; or 


(ii) A communication transmitted through television or through any broadcast, cable, or satellite transmission, must include a statement that identifies the candidate and states that he or she has approved the communication. The candidate shall convey the statement either: 


(A) Through an unobscured, full-screen view of himself or herself making the statement, or 


(B) Through a voice-over by himself or herself, accompanied by a clearly identifiable photographic or similar image of the candidate. A photographic or similar image of the candidate shall be considered clearly identified if it is at least eighty (80) percent of the vertical screen height. 


(iii) A communication transmitted through television or through any broadcast, cable, or satellite transmission, must also include a similar statement that must appear in clearly readable writing at the end of the television communication.

(B) The statement must be visible for a period of at least four (4) seconds; and

(iv) The following are examples of acceptable statements that satisfy the spoken statement requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section with respect to a radio, television, or other broadcast, cable, or satellite communication, but they are not the only allowable statements: 


(A) “I am [insert name of candidate], a candidate for [insert Federal office sought], and I approved this advertisement.” 


(B) “My name is [insert name of candidate]. I am running for [insert Federal office sought], and I approved this message.” 


(4) *Specific requirements for radio and television communications paid for by other persons and not authorized by a candidate.* In addition to the general requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c)(1) of this section, a communication not authorized by a candidate or a candidate's authorized committee that is transmitted through radio or television or through any broadcast, cable, or satellite transmission, must comply with the following: 


(i) A communication transmitted through radio or television or through any broadcast, cable, or satellite transmission, must include the following audio statement, “XXX is responsible for the content of this advertising,” spoken clearly, with the blank to be filled in with the name of the political committee or other person paying for the communication, and the name of the connected organization, if any, of the payor unless the name of the connected organization is already provided in the “XXX is responsible” statement; and 


(ii) A communication transmitted through television, or through any broadcast, cable, or satellite transmission, must include the audio statement required by paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section. That statement must be conveyed by an unobscured full-screen view of a representative of the political committee or other person making the statement, or by a representative of such political committee or other person in voice-over.

A disclaimer satisfies the color contrast requirement of this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(C) if it is printed in black text on a white background or if the degree of color contrast between the background and the text of the disclaimer is no less than the color contrast between the background and the largest type size used in the communication. 




(5) *Specific requirements for internet public communications.* (i) For purposes of this section, *internet public communication* means any public communication over the internet that is placed or promoted for a fee on another person's website, digital device, application, or advertising platform. A public communication is promoted for a fee where a payment is made to a website, digital device, application, or advertising platform in order to increase the circulation, prominence, or availability of the communication on that website, digital device, application, or advertising platform.


(ii) An internet public communication must include a disclaimer that complies with the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c)(1) of this section. The disclaimer requirement under this paragraph applies to any person that pays to place an internet public communication, regardless of whether that person originally created, produced, or distributed the communication.


(iii) In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c)(1) of this section, a disclaimer required by paragraph (a) of this section that appears on an internet public communication must comply with the following:


(A) Except as provided by paragraph (g) of this section, an internet public communication with text or graphic components must include the written disclaimer required by this paragraph, such that the disclaimer can be viewed without taking any action.


(B) The disclaimer must be of sufficient type size to be clearly readable by the recipient of the communication. A disclaimer that appears in letters at least as large as the majority of other text in the communication satisfies this requirement.


(C) The disclaimer must be displayed with a reasonable degree of color contrast between the background and the disclaimer's text. A disclaimer satisfies this requirement if it is displayed in black text on a white background, or if the degree of color contrast is no less than the color contrast between the background and the largest text used in the communication.


(D) If the disclaimer is displayed within a video, the disclaimer must be visible for at least 4 seconds and appear without the recipient of the communication taking any action.


(E) An internet public communication with an audio component but without video, graphic, or text components must include a disclaimer that satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c)(1) of this section within the audio component.




(d) *Coordinated party expenditures and independent expenditures by political party committees.* (1)(i) For a communication paid for by a political party committee pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30116(d), the disclaimer required by paragraph (a) of this section must identify the political party committee that makes the expenditure as the person who paid for the communication, regardless of whether the political party committee was acting in its own capacity or as the designated agent of another political party committee. 


(ii) A communication made by a political party committee pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30116(d) and distributed prior to the date the party's candidate is nominated shall satisfy the requirements of this section if it clearly states who paid for the communication. 


(2) For purposes of this section, a communication paid for by a political party committee, other than a communication covered by paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, that is being treated as a coordinated expenditure under 52 U.S.C. 30116(d) and that was made with the approval of a candidate, a candidate's authorized committee, or the agent of either shall identify the political party that paid for the communication and shall state that the communication is authorized by the candidate or candidate's authorized committee. 


(3) For a communication paid for by a political party committee that constitutes an independent expenditure under 11 CFR 100.16, the disclaimer required by this section must identify the political party committee that paid for the communication, and must state that the communication is not authorized by any candidate or candidate's authorized committee. 


(e) *Exempt activities.* A public communication authorized by a candidate, authorized committee, or political party committee, that qualifies as an exempt activity under 11 CFR 100.140, 100.147, 100.148, or 100.149, must comply with the disclaimer requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), (c)(1), and (c)(2) of this section, unless excepted under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, but the disclaimer does not need to state whether the communication is authorized by a candidate, or any authorized committee or agent of any candidate. 


(f) *Exceptions.* (1) The requirements of paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section do not apply to the following: 


(i) Bumper stickers, pins, buttons, pens, and similar small items upon which the disclaimer cannot be conveniently printed; 


(ii) Skywriting, water towers, wearing apparel, or other means of displaying an advertisement of such a nature that the inclusion of a disclaimer would be impracticable; or 


(iii) Checks, receipts, and similar items of minimal value that are used for purely administrative purposes and do not contain a political message. 


(2) For purposes of this section, whenever a separate segregated fund or its connected organization solicits contributions to the fund from those persons it may solicit under the applicable provisions of 11 CFR part 114, or makes a communication to those persons, such communication shall not be considered a type of public communication and need not contain the disclaimer required by paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. 




(g) *Adapted disclaimers*—(1) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section:


(i) *Adapted disclaimer* means a clear statement that the internet public communication is paid for, and that identifies the person or persons who paid for the internet public communication using their full name or a commonly understood abbreviation or acronym by which the person or persons are known, which is accompanied by: an indicator and a mechanism. An adapted disclaimer must satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) and paragraphs (c)(5)(ii) and (iii) of this section.


(ii) *Indicator* means any visible or audible element associated with an internet public communication that is presented in a clear and conspicuous manner and gives notice to persons reading, observing, or listening to the internet public communication that they may read, observe, or listen to a disclaimer satisfying the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c)(1) of this section through a mechanism. An indicator may take any form including, but not limited to, words, images, sounds, symbols, and icons.


(iii) *Mechanism* means any use of technology that enables the person reading, observing, or listening to an internet public communication to read, observe, or listen to a disclaimer satisfying the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c)(1) of this section after no more than one action by the recipient of the internet public communication. A mechanism may take any form including, but not limited to, hover-over text, pop-up screens, scrolling text, rotating panels, and hyperlinks to a landing page.


(2) When a disclaimer described by paragraphs (b) and (c)(1) of this section cannot be provided or would occupy more than 25 percent of the communication due to character or space constraints intrinsic to the advertising product or medium, an adapted disclaimer may be used within the communication instead.




(h) *Comparable rate for campaign purposes.* (1) No person who sells space in a newspaper or magazine to a candidate, an authorized committee of a candidate, or an agent of the candidate, for use in connection with the candidate's campaign for nomination or for election, shall charge an amount for the space which exceeds the comparable rate for the space for non-campaign purposes. 


(2) For purposed of this section, comparable rate means the rate charged to a national or general rate advertiser, and shall include discount privileges usually and normally available to a national or general rate advertiser.
