(a) *Contribution limitations for affiliated committees.* (1) For the purposes of the contribution limitations of 11 CFR 110.1 and 110.2, all contributions made or received by more than one affiliated committee, regardless of whether they are political committees under 11 CFR 100.5, shall be considered to be made or received by a single political committee. *See* 11 CFR 100.5(g).

(i) Authorized committees of the same candidate for the same election to Federal office; or


(ii) Committees (including a separate segregated fund, *see* 11 CFR part 114) established, financed, maintained or controlled by the same corporation, labor organization, person or group of persons, including any parent, subsidiary, branch, division, department or local unit thereof. For the purposes of this section, *local unit* may include, in appropriate cases, a franchisee, licensee, or State or regional association.

(ii) In determining whether committees not described in paragraphs (a)(2) (i)-(iv) of this section are affiliated, the Commission will consider the circumstantial factors described in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii) (A) through (J) of this section. The Commission will examine these factors in the context of the overall relationship between committees or sponsoring organizations to determine whether the presence of any factor or factors is evidence of one committee or organization having been established, financed, maintained or controlled by another committee or sponsoring organization. Such factors include, but are not limited to:


(A) Whether a sponsoring organization owns a controlling interest in the voting stock or securities of the sponsoring organization of another committee;

(D) Whether a sponsoring organization or committee has a common or overlapping membership with another sponsoring organization or committee which indicates a formal or ongoing relationship between the sponsoring organizations or committees;


(E) Whether a sponsoring organization or committee has common or overlapping officers or employees with another sponsoring organization or committee which indicates a formal or ongoing relationship between the sponsoring organizations or committees;


(F) Whether a sponsoring organization or committee has any members, officers or employees who were members, officers or employees of another sponsoring organization or committee which indicates a formal or ongoing relationship between the sponsoring organizations or committees, or which indicates the creation of a successor entity;


(G) Whether a sponsoring organization or committee provides funds or goods in a significant amount or on an ongoing basis to another sponsoring organization or committee, such as through direct or indirect payments for administrative, fundraising, or other costs, but not including the transfer to a committee of its allocated share of proceeds jointly raised pursuant to 11 CFR 102.17;


(H) Whether a sponsoring organization or committee causes or arranges for funds in a significant amount or on an ongoing basis to be provided to another sponsoring organization or committee, but not including the transfer to a committee of its allocated share of proceeds jointly raised pursuant to 11 CFR 102.17;


(I) Whether a sponsoring organization or a committee or its agent had an active or significant role in the formation of another sponsoring organization or committee; and


(J) Whether the sponsoring organizations or committees have similar patterns of contributions or contributors which indicates a formal or ongoing relationshp between the sponsoring organizations or committees.


(b) *Contribution limitations for political party committees.* (1) For the purposes of the contribution limitations of 11 CFR 110.1 and 110.2, all contributions made or received by the following political committees shall be considered to be made or received by separate political committees—


(i) The national committee of a political party and any political committees established, financed, maintained, or controlled by the same national committee; and

(ii) The political committee of the party unit in question does not make its contributions in cooperation, consultation or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of any other party unit or political committee established, financed, maintained, or controlled by another party unit.


(c) *Permissible Transfers.* The contribution limitations of 11 CFR 110.1 and 110.2 shall not limit the transfers set forth below in 11 CFR 110.3(c) (1) through (6)—

The cash on hand from which the transfer is made shall be considered to consist of the funds most recently received by the transferor committee. The transferor committee must be able to demonstrate that such cash on hand contains sufficient funds at the time of the transfer that comply with the limitations and prohibitions of the Act to cover the amount transferred.


(i) *Previous Federal campaign committee* means a principal campaign committee, or other authorized committee, that was organized to further the candidate's campaign in a Federal election that has already been held.


(ii) *Current Federal campaign committee* means a principal campaign committee, or other authorized committee, organized to further the candidate's campaign in a future Federal election.


(iii) For purposes of the contribution limits, a contribution made after an election has been held, or after an individual ceases to be a candidate in an election, shall be aggregated with other contributions from the same contributor for the next election unless the contribution is designated for the previous election, or is designated for another election, and the candidate has net debts outstanding for the election so designated pursuant to 11 CFR 110.1(b)(3).


(iv) For purposes of this section, an individual ceases to be a candidate in an election as of the earlier of the following dates—


(A) The date on which the candidate publicly announces that he or she will no longer be a candidate in that election for that office and ceases to conduct campaign activities with respect to that election; or

(5) Transfers of funds between the principal campaign committees of an individual seeking nomination or election to more than one Federal office, as long as the conditions in 11 CFR 110.3(c)(5) (i), (ii) and (iii) are met.

(i) The transfer shall not be made when the individual is actively seeking nomination or election to more than one Federal office. An individual will not be considered to be actively seeking nomination or election to a Federal office if:


(A) The individual publicly announces that he or she will no longer seek nomination or election to that office and ceases to conduct campaign activities with respect to that election, except in connection with the retirement of debts outstanding at the time of the announcement;


(B) The individual is or becomes ineligible for nomination or election to that office by operation of law;


(C) The individual has filed a proper termination report with the Commission under 11 CFR 102.3; or

(ii) The limitations on contributions by persons shall not be exceeded by the transfer. The cash on hand from which the transfer is made shall be considered to consist of the funds most recently received by the transferor committee. The transferor committee must be able to demonstrate that such cash on hand contains sufficient funds at the time of the transfer that comply with the limitations and prohibitions of the Act to cover the amount transferred. A contribution shall be excluded from the amount transferred to the extent that such contribution, when aggregated with other contributions from the same contributor to the transferee principal campaign committee, exceeds the contribution limits set forth at 11 CFR 110.1 or 110.2, as appropriate; and


(iii) The candidate has not elected to receive funds under 26 U.S.C. 9006 or 9037 for either election; or


(6) [Reserved]


(7) The authorized committees of a candidate for more than one Federal office, or for a Federal office and a nonfederal office, shall follow the requirements for separate campaign organizations set forth at 11 CFR 110.8(d).


(d) *Transfers from nonfederal to federal campaigns.* Transfers of funds or assets from a candidate's campaign committee or account for a nonfederal election to his or her principal campaign committee or other authorized committee for a federal election are prohibited. However, at the option of the nonfederal committee, the nonfederal committee may refund contributions, and may coordinate arrangements with the candidate's principal campaign committee or other authorized committee for a solicitation by such committee(s) to the same contributors. The full cost of this solicitation shall be paid by the Federal committee.
