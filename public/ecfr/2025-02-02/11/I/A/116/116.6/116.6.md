# ยง 116.6   Salary payments owed to employees.

(a) *Treatment as debts or volunteer services.* If a political committee does not pay an employee for services rendered to the political committee in accordance with an employment contract or a formal or informal agreement to do so, the unpaid amount either may be treated as a debt owed by the political committee to the employee or, provided that the employee signs a written statement agreeing to be considered a volunteer, converted to a volunteer services arrangement under 11 CFR 100.74. The unpaid amount shall not be treated as a contribution under 11 CFR part 100, subparts B and C.


(b) *Settlement or forgiveness of the debt.* If the unpaid amount is treated as a debt, the employee and the political committee may agree to a settlement of the debt for less than the entire amount owed pursuant to 11 CFR 116.7. The provisions of this part shall not be construed to require the employee to settle the debt for less than the entire amount owed.


(c) *Reporting.* If the unpaid amount is treated as a debt, the political committee shall continue to report the debt in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(d) and 104.11 until the Commission has completed a review of the debt settlement plan pursuant to 11 CFR 116.7(f) or until the employee agrees to be considered a volunteer, or until the political committee pays the debt, whichever occurs first.
