(a) *General solicitations.* A Federal candidate, an individual holding Federal office, or an individual agent acting on behalf of either, may make a general solicitation of funds, without regard to source or amount limitation, if:

(b) *Specific solicitations.* A Federal candidate, an individual holding Federal office, or an individual agent acting on behalf of either, may make a solicitation explicitly to obtain funds for any activity described in paragraph (c) of this section or for an organization whose principal purpose is to conduct that activity, if: 


(1) The solicitation is made only to individuals; and 


(2) The amount solicited from any individual does not exceed $20,000 during any calendar year.

(e) *Safe Harbor.* In determining whether a 501(c) organization is one whose principal purpose is to conduct election activities, including activity described in paragraph (c) of this section, a Federal candidate, an individual holding Federal office, or an individual agent acting on behalf of either, may obtain and rely upon a certification from the organization that satisfies the following criteria: 


(1) The certification is a signed written statement by an officer or other authorized representative of the organization with knowledge of the organization's activities; 


(2) The certification states that the organization's principal purpose is not to conduct election activities, including election activity described in paragraph (c) of this section; and 


(3) The certification states that the organization does not intend to pay debts incurred from the making of expenditures or disbursements in connection with an election for Federal office (including for Federal election activity) in a prior election cycle. 


(f) If a Federal candidate, an individual holding Federal office, or an individual agent acting on behalf of either has actual knowledge that the certification is false, the certification may not be relied upon.
