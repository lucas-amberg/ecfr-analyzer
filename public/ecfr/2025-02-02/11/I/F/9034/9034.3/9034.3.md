# ยง 9034.3   Non-matchable contributions.

A contribution to a candidate other than one which meets the requirements of 11 CFR 9034.2 is not matchable. Contributions which are not matchable include, for example:


(a) In-kind contributions of real or personal property;


(b) A subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money, or anything of value;


(c) A contract, promise, or agreement, whether or not legally enforceable, such as a pledge card to make a contribution for any such purposes (but a gift of money by written instrument is not rendered unmatchable solely because the contribution was preceded by a promise or pledge);

(f) Contributions in the form of a check drawn on the account of a committee, corporation, union or government contractor even though the funds represent personal funds earmarked by a contributing individual to a Presidential candidate;


(g) Contributions in the form of the purchase price paid for an item with significant intrinsic and enduring value, such as a watch;


(h) Contributions in the form of the purchase price paid for or other otherwise induced by a chance to participate in a raffle, lottery, or a similar drawing for valuable prizes;


(i) Contributions which are made by persons without the necessary donative intent to make a gift or made for any purpose other than to influence the result of a primary election;


(j) Contributions of currency of the United States or currency of any foreign country; and
