(a) The Commission will make the fullest possible disclosure of records to the public, consistent with the rights of individuals to privacy, the rights of individuals and other entities with respect to trade secrets and commercial or financial information entitled to privileged and confidential treatment, and the need for the Commission to promote free internal policy deliberations and to pursue its official activities without undue disruption.


(b) All Commission records shall be available to the public unless they are specifically exempt under this part.


(c) In the interest of efficiency and economy, the Commission's preference is to furnish records to requesters in electronic format, when possible.
