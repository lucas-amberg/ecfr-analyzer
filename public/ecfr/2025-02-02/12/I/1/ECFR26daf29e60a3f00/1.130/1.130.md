# § 1.130   Type II securities; guidelines for obligations issued for university and housing purposes.

(a) *Investment quality.* An obligation issued for housing, university, or dormitory purposes is a Type II security only if it: 


(1) Qualifies as an investment security, as defined in § 1.2(e); and 


(2) Is issued for the appropriate purpose and by a qualifying issuer. 


(b) *Obligation issued for university purposes.* (1) An obligation issued by a State or political subdivision or agency of a State or political subdivision for the purpose of financing the construction or improvement of facilities at or used by a university or a degree-granting college-level institution, or financing loans for studies at such institutions, qualifies as a Type II security. Facilities financed in this manner may include student buildings, classrooms, university utility buildings, cafeterias, stadiums, and university parking lots. 


(2) An obligation that finances the construction or improvement of facilities used by a hospital may be eligible as a Type II security, if the hospital is a department or a division of a university, or otherwise provides a nexus with university purposes, such as an affiliation agreement between the university and the hospital, faculty positions of the hospital staff, and training of medical students, interns, residents, and nurses (*e.g.,* a “teaching hospital”). 


(c) *Obligation issued for housing purposes.* An obligation issued for housing purposes may qualify as a Type II security if the security otherwise meets the criteria for a Type II security.
