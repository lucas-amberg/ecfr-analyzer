(a) *Written notification.* A written notification disclosing: 


(1) Name of the bank; 


(2) Name of the customer; 


(3) Capacity in which the bank acts (i.e., as agent for the customer, as agent for both the customer and some other person, as principal for its own account, or in any other capacity); 


(4) Date and time of execution, or a statement that the bank will furnish the time of execution within a reasonable time upon written request of the customer, and the identity, price, and number of shares or units (or principal amount in the case of debt securities) of the security purchased or sold by the customer; 


(5) Amount of any remuneration that the customer has provided or is to provide any broker/dealer, directly or indirectly, in connection with the transaction; 


(6)(i) Amount of any remuneration that the bank has received or will receive from the customer, and the source and amount of any other remuneration that the bank has received or will receive in connection with the transaction; unless:

(9) In the case of a transaction in a debt security effected exclusively on the basis of a dollar price: 


(i) The dollar price at which the transaction was effected; and 


(ii) The yield to maturity calculated from the dollar price, unless the transaction is for a debt security that either: 


(A) Has a maturity date that may be extended by the issuer thereof, with a variable interest payable thereon; or

(ii) The dollar price calculated from the yield at which the transaction was effected; and 


(iii) If effected on a basis other than yield to maturity and the yield to maturity is lower than the represented yield, the yield to maturity as well as the represented yield, unless the transaction is for a debt security that either: 


(A) Has a maturity date that may be extended by the issuer thereof, with a variable interest rate payable thereon; or 


(B) Is an asset-backed security that represents an interest in or is secured by a pool of receivables or other financial assets that continuously are subject to prepayment; 


(11) In the case of a transaction in a debt security that is an asset-backed security, which represents an interest in or is secured by a pool of receivables or other financial assets that continuously are subject to prepayment, a statement indicating that the actual yield of the asset-backed security may vary according to the rate at which the underlying receivables or other financial assets are prepaid and a statement that information concerning the factors that affect yield (including at a minimum estimated yield, weighted average life, and the prepayment assumptions underlying yield) will be furnished upon written request of the customer; and
