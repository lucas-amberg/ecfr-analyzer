# § 12.7   Securities trading policies and procedures.

(a) *Policies and procedures; reports of securities trading.* A national bank effecting securities transactions for customers shall maintain and adhere to policies and procedures that: 


(1) Assign responsibility for supervision of all officers or employees who: 


(i) Transmit orders to or place orders with registered broker/dealers; 


(ii) Execute transactions in securities for customers; or 


(iii) Process orders for notification or settlement purposes, or perform other back office functions with respect to securities transactions effected for customers. Policies and procedures for personnel described in this paragraph (a)(1)(iii) must provide for supervision and reporting lines that are separate from supervision and reporting lines for personnel described in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section; 


(2) Provide for the fair and equitable allocation of securities and prices to accounts when the bank receives orders for the same security at approximately the same time and places the orders for execution either individually or in combination; 


(3) Provide for the crossing of buy and sell orders on a fair and equitable basis to the parties to the transaction, where permissible under applicable law; and 


(4) Require bank officers and employees to report to the bank, within the deadline specified in SEC rule 17j-1 (17 CFR 270.17j-1) for quarterly transaction reports, all personal transactions in securities made by them or on their behalf in which they have a beneficial interest, if the officers and employees: 


(i) Make investment recommendations or decisions for the accounts of customers; 


(ii) Participate in the determination of the recommendations or decisions; or 


(iii) In connection with their duties, obtain information concerning which securities are purchased, sold, or recommended for purchase or sale by the bank. 


(b) *Required information.* The report required under paragraph (a)(4) of this section must contain the following information: 


(1) The date of the transaction, the title and number of shares, and the principal amount of each security involved; 


(2) The nature of the transaction (i.e. purchase, sale, or other type of acquisition or disposition); 


(3) The price at which the transaction was effected; and 


(4) The name of the registered broker, registered dealer, or bank with or through whom the transaction was effected. 


(c) *Report not required.* This section does not require a bank officer or employee to report transactions if: 


(1) The officer or employee has no direct or indirect influence or control over the transaction; 


(2) The transaction is in mutual fund shares; 


(3) The transaction is in government securities; or 


(4) The transactions involve an aggregate amount of purchases and sales per officer or employee of $10,000 or less during the calendar quarter. 


(d) *Additional reporting requirement.* A national bank that acts as an investment adviser to an investment company is subject to the requirements of SEC Rule 17j-1 (17 CFR 270.17j-1) issued under the Investment Company Act of 1940. SEC Rule 17j-1 requires an “access person” of the investment adviser to report certain personal securities transactions to the investment adviser for review by the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Access person” includes directors, officers, and certain employees of the investment adviser. The reporting requirement under paragraph (a)(4) of this section is a separate requirement from any applicable requirements under SEC Rule 17j-1. However, an “access person” required to file a report with a national bank pursuant to SEC Rule 17j-1 need not file a separate report under paragraph (a)(4) of this section if the required information is the same.
