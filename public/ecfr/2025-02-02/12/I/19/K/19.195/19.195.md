# § 19.195   Incompetence.

Incompetence in the representation of a client's rights and interests in a significant matter before the OCC is grounds for suspension or debarment. The term “incompetence” encompasses conduct that reflects a lack of the knowledge, judgment, and skill that a professional would ordinarily and reasonably be expected to exercise in adequately representing the rights and interests of a client. Such conduct includes, but is not limited to:


(a) Handling a matter that the individual knows or should know that they are not competent to handle, without associating with a professional who is competent to handle such matter;


(b) Handling a matter without adequate preparation under the circumstances; or


(c) Neglect in a matter entrusted to him or her.
