# ยง 192.8   Computation of time.

In computing the period of days, the OCC excludes the day of the act or event (*e.g.,* the date an application is received by the OCC) from when the period begins to run. When the last day of a time period is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the time period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday.
