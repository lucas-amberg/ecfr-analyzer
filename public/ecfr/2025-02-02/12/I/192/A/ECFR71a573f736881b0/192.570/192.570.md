(2) Will serve as an officer, director, or employee of the charitable organization. *See* Form AC for further information on operating plans and conflict of interest plans.


(b) *Identification and recusal of directors.* Before the savings association's board of directors may adopt a plan of conversion that includes a charitable organization, the savings association must identify its directors that will serve on the charitable organization's board. These directors may not participate in the board's discussions concerning contributions to the charitable organization, and may not vote on the matter.
