(a) *Reductions.* (1) A savings association must reduce the balance of an eligible account holder's or supplemental eligible account holder's liquidation sub-account if the deposit balance in the account holder's savings account at the close of business on any annual closing date, which for purposes of this section is the savings association's fiscal year end, falls below the lesser of:


(i) The deposit balance in the account holder's savings account as of the relevant eligibility record date; or


(ii) The deposit balance in the account holder's savings account as of its lowest balance as of any subsequent annual closing date.


(2) The reduction in the account holder's liquidation sub-account from its balance at the time of conversion must be proportionate to the reduction in the account holder's savings account from its balance at the time of conversion.


(b) *Prohibition on increases.* If a savings association reduces the balance of a liquidation sub-account, it may not subsequently increase it if the deposit balance increases.


(c) *Liquidation account adjustments.* A savings association is not required to adjust the liquidation account and sub-account balances at each annual closing date if the savings association maintains sufficient records to make the computations if a liquidation subsequently occurs.


(d) *Maintenance of liquidation sub-account.* A savings association must maintain the liquidation sub-account for each account holder as long as the account holder maintains an account with the same social security number.


(e) *Complete liquidation.* If there is a complete liquidation, the savings association must provide the account holder of a liquidation sub-account with a liquidation distribution in the amount of the account holder's remaining liquidation sub-account balance.
