# § 23.3   Lease requirements.

(a) *General requirements.* A national bank may acquire personal property for the purpose of, or in connection with leasing that property, and may engage in activities incidental thereto, if the lease qualifies as a full-payout lease and a net lease. 


(b) *Exceptions*—(1) *Change in condition.* If, in good faith, a national bank believes that there has been a change in condition that threatens its financial position by increasing its exposure to loss, then the bank may: 


(i) Take reasonable and appropriate action, including the actions specified in § 23.2(f), to salvage or protect the value of the leased property or its interests arising under the lease; and 


(ii) Acquire or perfect title to the leased property pursuant to any existing rights. 


(2) *Provisions to protect the bank's interests.* A national bank may include any provision in a lease, or make any additional agreement, to protect its financial position or investment in the event of a change in conditions that would increase its exposure to loss. 


(3) *Arranging for services by a third party.* A national bank may arrange for a third party to provide any of the services enumerated in § 23.2(f) to the lessee at the expense of the lessee.
