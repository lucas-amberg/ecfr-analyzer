A. A reasonable loan-to-deposit ratio (considering seasonal variations) given the bank's or savings association's size, financial condition, the credit needs of its facility-based assessment areas, and taking into account, as appropriate, other lending-related activities such as loan originations for sale to the secondary markets, community development loans, and community development investments;
