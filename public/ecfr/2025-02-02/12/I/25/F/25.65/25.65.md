(a) *In general.* If the OCC determines that a bank or savings association is not reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank or savings association in the host state, and that the bank's or savings association's statewide loan-to-deposit ratio is less than 50 percent of the host state loan-to-deposit ratio, the OCC:


(1) May order that a bank's or savings association's covered interstate branch or branches be closed unless the bank or savings association provides reasonable assurances to the satisfaction of the OCC, after an opportunity for public comment, that the bank or savings association has an acceptable plan under which the bank or savings association will reasonably help to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank or savings association in the host state; and


(2) Will not permit the bank or savings association to open a new branch in the host state that would be considered to be a covered interstate branch unless the bank or savings association provides reasonable assurances to the satisfaction of the OCC, after an opportunity for public comment, that the bank or savings association will reasonably help to meet the credit needs of the community that the new branch will serve.


(b) *Notice prior to closure of a covered interstate branch.* Before exercising the OCC's authority to order the bank or savings association to close a covered interstate branch, the OCC will issue to the bank or savings association a notice of the OCC's intent to order the closure and will schedule a hearing within 60 days of issuing the notice.


(c) *Hearing.* The OCC will conduct a hearing scheduled under paragraph (b) of this section in accordance with the provisions of 12 U.S.C. 1818(h) and 12 CFR part 19.
