# § 3.33   Off-balance sheet exposures.

(a) *General.* (1) A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate the exposure amount of an off-balance sheet exposure using the credit conversion factors (CCFs) in paragraph (b) of this section.


(2) Where a national bank or Federal savings association commits to provide a commitment, the national bank or Federal savings association may apply the lower of the two applicable CCFs.


(3) Where a national bank or Federal savings association provides a commitment structured as a syndication or participation, the national bank or Federal savings association is only required to calculate the exposure amount for its pro rata share of the commitment.


(4) Where a national bank or Federal savings association provides a commitment, enters into a repurchase agreement, or provides a credit-enhancing representation and warranty, and such commitment, repurchase agreement, or credit-enhancing representation and warranty is not a securitization exposure, the exposure amount shall be no greater than the maximum contractual amount of the commitment, repurchase agreement, or credit-enhancing representation and warranty, as applicable.


(b) *Credit conversion factors*—(1) *Zero percent CCF.* A national bank or Federal savings association must apply a zero percent CCF to the unused portion of a commitment that is unconditionally cancelable by the national bank or Federal savings association.


(2) *20 percent CCF.* A national bank or Federal savings association must apply a 20 percent CCF to the amount of:


(i) Commitments with an original maturity of one year or less that are not unconditionally cancelable by the national bank or Federal savings association; and


(ii) Self-liquidating, trade-related contingent items that arise from the movement of goods, with an original maturity of one year or less.


(3) *50 percent CCF.* A national bank or Federal savings association must apply a 50 percent CCF to the amount of:


(i) Commitments with an original maturity of more than one year that are not unconditionally cancelable by the national bank or Federal savings association; and


(ii) Transaction-related contingent items, including performance bonds, bid bonds, warranties, and performance standby letters of credit.


(4) *100 percent CCF.* A national bank or Federal savings association must apply a 100 percent CCF to the amount of the following off-balance-sheet items and other similar transactions:


(i) Guarantees;


(ii) Repurchase agreements (the off-balance sheet component of which equals the sum of the current fair values of all positions the national bank or Federal savings association has sold subject to repurchase);


(iii) Credit-enhancing representations and warranties that are not securitization exposures;


(iv) Off-balance sheet securities lending transactions (the off-balance sheet component of which equals the sum of the current fair values of all positions the national bank or Federal savings association has lent under the transaction);


(v) Off-balance sheet securities borrowing transactions (the off-balance sheet component of which equals the sum of the current fair values of all non-cash positions the national bank or Federal savings association has posted as collateral under the transaction);
