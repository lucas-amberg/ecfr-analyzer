# ยง 3.401   Purpose and scope.

The rules and procedures specified in this subpart are applicable to a proceeding to establish required minimum capital ratios that would otherwise be applicable to a national bank or Federal savings association under subpart B of this part. The OCC is authorized under 12 U.S.C. 1464(s)(2) and 3907(a)(2) to establish such minimum capital requirements for a national bank or Federal savings association as the OCC, in its discretion, deems appropriate in light of the particular circumstances at that national bank or Federal savings association. Proceedings under this subpart also may be initiated to require a national bank or Federal savings association having capital ratios above those set forth in subpart B of this part, or other legal authority to continue to maintain those higher ratios.
