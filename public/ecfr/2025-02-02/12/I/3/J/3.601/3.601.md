(a) This subpart is applicable to proceedings by the OCC to issue a directive under 12 U.S.C. 3907(b)(2) or 12 U.S.C. 1464(s), as appropriate. A directive is an order issued to a national bank or Federal savings association that does not have or maintain capital at or above the minimum ratios set forth in subpart B of this part, or established for the national bank or Federal savings association under subpart H of this part, by a written agreement under 12 U.S.C. 1818(b), or as a condition for approval of an application. A directive may order the national bank or Federal savings association to:


(1) Achieve the minimum capital ratios applicable to it by a specified date;


(2) Adhere to a previously submitted plan to achieve the applicable capital ratios;


(3) Submit and adhere to a plan acceptable to the OCC describing the means and time schedule by which the national bank or Federal savings association shall achieve the applicable capital ratios;


(4) Take other action, such as reduction of assets or the rate of growth of assets, or restrictions on the payment of dividends, to achieve the applicable capital ratios; or


(5) A combination of any of these or similar actions.


(b) A directive issued under this rule, including a plan submitted under a directive, is enforceable under the provisions of 12 U.S.C. 1818(i) in the same manner and to the same extent as an effective and outstanding cease and desist order issued pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1818(b) that has become final. Violation of a directive may result in assessment of civil money penalties in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 3909(d).
