# ยง 34.45   Appraiser independence.

(a) *Staff appraisers.* If an appraisal is prepared by a staff appraiser, that appraiser must be independent of the lending, investment, and collection functions and not involved, except as an appraiser, in the federally related transaction, and have no direct or indirect interest, financial or otherwise, in the property. If the only qualified persons available to perform an appraisal are involved in the lending, investment, or collection functions of the regulated institution, the regulated institution shall take appropriate steps to ensure that the appraisers exercise independent judgment. Such steps include, but are not limited to, prohibiting an individual from performing an appraisal in connection with federally related transactions in which the appraiser is otherwise involved and prohibiting directors and officers from participating in any vote or approval involving assets on which they performed an appraisal. 


(b) *Fee appraisers.* (1) If an appraisal is prepared by a fee appraiser, the appraiser shall be engaged directly by the regulated institution or its agent, and have no direct or indirect interest, financial or otherwise, in the property or the transaction. 


(2) A regulated institution also may accept an appraisal that was prepared by an appraiser engaged directly by another financial services institution, if: 


(i) The appraiser has no direct or indirect interest, financial or otherwise, in the property or the transaction; and 


(ii) The regulated institution determines that the appraisal conforms to the requirements of this subpart and is otherwise acceptable.
