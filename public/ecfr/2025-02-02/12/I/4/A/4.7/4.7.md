# § 4.7   Frequency of examination of Federal agencies and branches.

(a) *General.* The OCC examines Federal agencies and Federal branches (as these entities are defined in § 28.11 (g) and (h), respectively, of this chapter) pursuant to the authority conferred by 12 U.S.C. 3105(c)(1)(C). Except as noted in paragraph (b) of this section, the OCC will conduct a full-scope, on-site examination of every Federal branch and agency at least once during each 12-month period.


(b) *18-month rule for certain small institutions*—(1) *Mandatory standards.* The OCC may conduct a full-scope, on-site examination at least once during each 18-month period, rather than each 12-month period as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, if the Federal branch or agency:


(i) Has total assets of less than $3 billion;


(ii) Has received a composite ROCA supervisory rating (which rates risk management, operational controls, compliance, and asset quality) of 1 or 2 at its most recent examination;


(iii) Satisfies the requirements of either paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section:


(A) The foreign bank's most recently reported capital adequacy position consists of, or is equivalent to, common equity tier 1, tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios that satisfy the definition of “well capitalized” set forth at 12 CFR 6.4, respectively, on a consolidated basis; or


(B) The branch or agency has maintained on a daily basis, over the past three quarters, eligible assets in an amount not less than 108 percent of the preceding quarter's average third party liabilities (determined consistent with applicable federal and state law), and sufficient liquidity is currently available to meet its obligations to third parties;


(iv) Is not subject to a formal enforcement action or order by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the OCC; and


(v) Has not experienced a change in control during the preceding 12-month period in which a full-scope, on-site examination would have been required but for this section.


(2) *Discretionary standards.* In determining whether a Federal branch or agency that meets the standards of paragraph (b)(1) of this section should not be eligible for an 18-month examination cycle pursuant to this paragraph (b), the OCC may consider additional factors, including whether:


(i) Any of the individual components of the ROCA rating of the Federal branch or agency is rated “3” or worse;


(ii) The results of any off-site supervision indicate a deterioration in the condition of the Federal branch or agency;


(iii) The size, relative importance, and role of a particular office when reviewed in the context of the foreign bank's entire U.S. operations otherwise necessitate an annual examination; and


(iv) The condition of the foreign bank gives rise to such a need.


(c) *Authority to conduct more frequent examinations.* Nothing in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section limits the authority of the OCC to examine any Federal branch or agency as frequently as the OCC deems necessary.


(d) Through December 31, 2021, for purposes of determining eligibility for the 18-month rule described in paragraph (b) of this section, the OCC may determine total assets of a Federal branch or agency by reference to the total assets of the Federal branch or agency as reported by the Federal branch or agency as of December 31, 2019.
