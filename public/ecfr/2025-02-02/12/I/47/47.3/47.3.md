(c) *Covered QFCs.* For purposes of this part, a covered QFC is:


(1) With respect to a covered bank that is a covered bank on January 1, 2018, an in-scope QFC that the covered bank:


(i) Enters, executes, or otherwise becomes a party to on or after January 1, 2019; or


(ii) Entered, executed, or otherwise became a party to before January 1, 2019, if the covered bank, or any affiliate that is a covered entity, covered bank, or covered FSI, also enters, executes, or otherwise becomes a party to a QFC with the same person or a consolidated affiliate of the same person on or after January 1, 2019.


(2) With respect to a covered bank that becomes a covered bank after January 1, 2018, an in-scope QFC that the covered bank:

(d) *In-scope QFCs.* An in-scope QFC is a QFC that explicitly:


(1) Restricts the transfer of a QFC (or any interest or obligation in or under, or any property securing, the QFC) from a covered bank; or


(2) Provides one or more default rights with respect to a QFC that may be exercised against a covered bank.


(e) *Rules of construction.* For purposes of this part:


(1) A covered bank does not become a party to a QFC solely by acting as agent with respect to the QFC; and


(2) The exercise of a default right with respect to a covered QFC includes the automatic or deemed exercise of the default right pursuant to the terms of the QFC or other arrangement.


(f) *Initial applicability of requirements for covered QFCs.* (1) With respect to each of its covered QFCs, a covered bank that is a covered bank on January 1, 2018, must conform the covered QFC to the requirements of this part by:
