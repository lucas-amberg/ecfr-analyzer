# ยง 5.63   Capital limitation under 12 U.S.C. 56.

(a) *General limitation.* Except as provided by 12 U.S.C. 59 and ยง 5.46, a national bank may not withdraw, or permit to be withdrawn, either in the form of a dividend or otherwise, any portion of its permanent capital. Further, a national bank may not declare a dividend in excess of undivided profits. 


(b) *Preferred stock.* The provisions of 12 U.S.C. 56 do not apply to dividends on preferred stock. However, if the undivided profits of the national bank are not sufficient to cover a proposed dividend on preferred stock, the proposed dividend constitutes a reduction in capital subject to 12 U.S.C. 59 and ยง 5.46.
