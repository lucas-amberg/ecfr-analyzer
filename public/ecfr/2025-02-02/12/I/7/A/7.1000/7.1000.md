# ยง 7.1000   Activities that are part of, or incidental to, the business of banking.

(a) *Purpose.* This section identifies the criteria that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) uses to determine whether an activity is authorized as part of, or incidental to, the business of banking under 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) or other statutory authority.


(b) *Restrictions and conditions on activities.* The OCC may determine that activities are permissible under 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) or other statutory authority only if they are subject to standards or conditions designed to provide that the activities function as intended and are conducted safely and soundly, in accordance with other applicable statutes, regulations, or supervisory policies.


(c) *Activities that are part of the business of banking.* (1) An activity is permissible for national banks as part of the business of banking if the activity is authorized under 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) or other statutory authority. In determining whether an activity that is not specifically included in 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) or other statutory authority is part of the business of banking, the OCC considers the following factors:


(i) Whether the activity is the functional equivalent to, or a logical outgrowth of, a recognized banking activity;


(ii) Whether the activity strengthens the bank by benefiting its customers or its business;


(iii) Whether the activity involves risks similar in nature to those already assumed by banks; and


(iv) Whether the activity is authorized for State-chartered banks.


(2) The weight accorded each factor set out in paragraph (c)(1) of this section depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.


(d) *Activities that are incidental to the business of banking.* (1) An activity is authorized for a national bank as incidental to the business of banking if it is convenient or useful to an activity that is specifically authorized for national banks or to an activity that is otherwise part of the business of banking. In determining whether an activity is convenient or useful to such activities, the OCC considers the following factors:


(i) Whether the activity facilitates the production or delivery of a bank's products or services, enhances the bank's ability to sell or market its products or services, or improves the effectiveness or efficiency of the bank's operations, in light of risks presented, innovations, strategies, techniques and new technologies for producing and delivering financial products and services; and


(ii) Whether the activity enables the bank to use capacity acquired for its banking operations or otherwise avoid economic loss or waste.


(2) The weight accorded each factor set out in paragraph (d)(1) of this section depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.
