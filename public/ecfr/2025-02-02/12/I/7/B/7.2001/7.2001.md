# § 7.2001   National bank adoption of anti-takeover provisions.

(a) *In general.* Pursuant to § 7.2000(b), a national bank may adopt anti-takeover provisions included in State corporate governance law if the provisions are not inconsistent with Federal banking statutes or regulations and not inconsistent with bank safety and soundness.


(b) *State anti-takeover provisions that are not inconsistent with Federal banking statutes or regulations.* State anti-takeover provisions that are not inconsistent with Federal banking statutes or regulations include the following:


(1) *Restrictions on business combinations with interested shareholders.* State provisions that prohibit, or that permit the corporation to prohibit in its certificate of incorporation or other governing document, the corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder or any related entity for a specified period of time from the date on which the shareholder first becomes an interested shareholder, subject to certain exceptions such as board approval. An interested shareholder is one that owns an amount of stock specified in the State provision.


(2) *Poison pill.* State provisions that provide, or that permit the corporation to provide in its certificate of incorporation or other governing document, that all the shareholders, other than the hostile acquiror, have the right to purchase additional stock at a substantial discount upon the occurrence of a triggering event.


(3) *Requiring all shareholder actions to be taken at a meeting.* State provisions that provide, or that permit the corporation to provide in its certificate of incorporation or other governing document, that all actions to be taken by shareholders must occur at a meeting and that shareholders may not take action by written consent.


(4) *Limits on shareholders' authority to call special meetings.* State provisions that provide, or that permit the corporation to provide in its certificate of incorporation or other governing document, that:


(i) Only the board of directors, and not the shareholders, have the right to call special meetings of the shareholders; or


(ii) If shareholders have the right to call special meetings, a high percentage of shareholders is needed to call the meeting.


(5) *Shareholder removal of a director only for cause.* State provisions that provide, or that permit the corporation to provide in its certificate of incorporation or other governing document, that shareholders may remove a director only for cause, and not both for cause and without cause.


(c) *State anti-takeover provisions that are inconsistent with Federal banking statutes or regulations.* The following State anti-takeover provisions are inconsistent with Federal banking statutes or regulations:


(1) *Supermajority voting requirements.* State provisions that require, or that permit the corporation to require in its certificate of incorporation or other governing document, a supermajority of the shareholders to approve specified matters are inconsistent when applied to matters for which Federal banking statutes or regulations specify the required level of shareholder approval.


(2) *Restrictions on a shareholder's right to vote all the shares it owns.* State provisions that prohibit, or that permit the corporation in its certificate of incorporation or other governing document to prohibit, a person from voting shares acquired that increase their percentage of ownership of the company's stock above a certain level are inconsistent when applied to shareholder votes governed by 12 U.S.C. 61.


(d) *Bank safety and soundness*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, any State corporate governance provision, including anti-takeover provisions, that would render more difficult or discourage an injection of capital by purchase of bank stock, a merger, the acquisition of the bank, a tender offer, a proxy contest, the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of the bank's stock, or the removal of the incumbent board of directors or management is inconsistent with bank safety and soundness if:


(i) The bank is less than adequately capitalized (as defined in 12 CFR part 6);


(ii) The bank is in troubled condition (as defined in 12 CFR 5.51(c)(7));


(iii) Grounds for the appointment of a receiver under 12 U.S.C. 191, as determined by the OCC, are present; or


(iv) The bank is otherwise in less than satisfactory condition, as determined by the OCC.


(2) *Exception.* Anti-takeover provisions are not inconsistent with bank safety and soundness if, at the time the bank adopts the provisions:


(i) The bank is not subject to any of the conditions in paragraph (d)(1) of this section; and


(ii) The bank includes, in its articles of association or its bylaws, as applicable pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, a limitation that would make the provisions ineffective if:


(A) The conditions in paragraph (d)(1) of this section exist; or


(B) The OCC otherwise directs the bank not to follow the provision for supervisory reasons.


(e) *Case-by-case review*—(1) *OCC determination.* Based on the substance of the provision or the individual circumstances of a national bank, the OCC may determine that a State anti-takeover provision, as proposed or adopted by a bank, is:


(i) Inconsistent with Federal banking statutes or regulations, notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section; or


(ii) Inconsistent with bank safety and soundness other than as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.


(2) *Review.* The OCC may initiate a review, or a bank may request OCC review pursuant to § 7.2000(d), of a State anti-takeover provision.


(f) *Method of adoption for anti-takeover provisions*—(1) *Board and shareholder approval.* A national bank must follow the provisions for approval by the board of directors and approval of shareholders for the adoption of an anti-takeover provision in the State corporate governance law it has elected to follow. However, if the provision is included in the bank's articles of association, the bank's shareholders must approve the amendment of the articles pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 21a, even if the State law does not require approval by the shareholders.


(2) *Documentation.* If the State corporate governance law requires the anti-takeover provision to be in the company's articles of incorporation, certificate of incorporation, or similar document, the national bank must include the provision in its articles of association. If the State corporate governance law does not require the provision to be in the company's articles of incorporation, certificate of incorporation, or similar document, but allows it to be in the bylaws, then the national bank must include the provision in either its articles of association or in its bylaws, provided, however, that if the State corporate governance law requires shareholder approval for changes to the corporation's bylaws, then the national bank must include the provision in its articles of association.
