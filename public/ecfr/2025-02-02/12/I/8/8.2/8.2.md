# § 8.2   Semiannual assessment.

(a) Each national bank and each Federal savings association shall pay to the OCC a semiannual assessment fee, due by March 31 and September 30 of each year, for the six-month period beginning on January 1 and July 1 before each payment date. The OCC will calculate the amount due under this section and provide a notice of assessments to each national bank and each Federal savings association no later than 7 business days prior to collection on March 31 and September 30 of each year. In setting assessments, the OCC may take into account the nature and scope of the activities of a national bank or Federal savings association, the amount and type of assets that the entity holds, the financial and managerial condition of the entity, and any other factor the OCC determines is appropriate, as provided by 12 U.S.C. 16. The semiannual assessment will be calculated as follows:


(1) Every national bank and every Federal savings association falls into one of the asset-size brackets denoted by Columns A and B. A national bank's or Federal savings association's semiannual assessment is composed of two parts. The first part is the calculation of a base amount of the assessment, which is computed on the assets of the national bank or Federal savings association up to the lower endpoint (Column A) of the bracket in which it falls. This base amount of the assessment is calculated by the OCC in Column C.


(2) The second part is the calculation of assessments due on the remaining assets of the national bank or Federal savings association in excess of Column E. The excess is assessed at the marginal rate shown in Column D.


(3) The total semiannual assessment is the amount in Column C, plus the amount of the national bank's or Federal savings association's assets in excess of Column E times the marginal rate in Column D:


(4) Each year, the OCC may index the marginal rates in Column D to adjust for the percent change in the level of prices, as measured by changes in the Gross Domestic Product Implicit Price Deflator (GDPIPD) for each June-to-June period. The OCC may at its discretion adjust marginal rates by amounts other than the percentage change in the GDPIPD. The OCC will also adjust the amounts in Column C to reflect any change made to the marginal rate.


(5)(i) The specific marginal rates and complete assessment schedule will be published in the “Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and Assessments,” provided for at § 8.8. Each semiannual assessment is based upon the total assets shown in the national bank's or Federal savings association's most recent “Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income” (Call Report) preceding the payment date. Each national bank or Federal savings association subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC on the date of the second or fourth quarterly Call Report as appropriate, required by the OCC under 12 U.S.C. 161 and 12 U.S.C. 1464(v), is subject to the full assessment for the next six-month period. National banks and Federal savings associations that are no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC as of the date of the first or third quarterly Call Report, as appropriate, will receive a refund of assessments for the second three months of the semiannual assessment period.


(ii) [Reserved]


(6)(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the OCC may reduce the semiannual assessment for each non-lead national bank or non-lead Federal savings association by a percentage that it will specify in the “Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and Assessments” described in § 8.8.


(ii) For purposes of this paragraph (a)(6):


(A) *Lead national bank* or *lead Federal savings association* means the largest national bank or Federal savings association controlled by a company, based on a comparison of the total assets held by each national bank or Federal savings association controlled by that company as reported in each national bank's or Federal savings association's Call Report filed for the quarter immediately preceding the payment of a semiannual assessment.


(B) *Non-lead national bank* or *non-lead Federal savings association* means a national bank or Federal savings association that is not the lead national bank or lead Federal savings association controlled by a company that controls two or more national banks or Federal savings associations.


(C) *Control* and *company* with respect to national banks have the same meanings as these terms have in sections 2(a)(2) and 2(b), respectively, of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841(a)(2) and (b)).


(D) *Control* and *company* with respect to Federal savings associations have the same meanings as these terms have in section 10(a) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1467a(a).


(b)(1) Each Federal branch and each Federal agency shall pay to the OCC a semiannual assessment fee, due by March 31 and September 30 of each year, for the six-month period beginning on January 1 and July 1 before each payment date. The OCC will calculate the amount due under this section and provide a notice of assessments to each Federal branch and agency no later than 7 business days prior to March 31 and September 30 of each year.


(2) The amount of the semiannual assessment paid by each Federal branch and Federal agency shall be computed at the same rate as provided in the Table in 12 CFR 8.2(a); however, only the total domestic assets of the Federal branch or agency shall be subject to assessment.


(3)(i) Each semiannual assessment of each Federal branch and each agency is based upon the total assets shown in the Federal branch's or agency's Call Report most recently preceding the payment date. Each Federal branch or agency subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC on the date of the second and fourth Call Reports is subject to the full assessment for the next six-month period. Federal branches and agencies that are no longer subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC as of the date of the first or third quarterly Call Report, as appropriate, will receive a refund of assessments for the second three months of the semiannual assessment period.


(ii) [Reserved]


(4)(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the OCC may reduce the semiannual assessment for each non-lead Federal branch and agency by an amount that it will specify in the “Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and Assessments” described in § 8.8.


(ii) For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4):


(A) *Lead Federal branch or agency* means the largest Federal branch or agency of a foreign bank, based on a comparison of the total assets held by each Federal branch or agency of that foreign bank as reported in each Federal branch's or agency's Call Report filed for the quarter immediately preceding the payment of a semiannual assessment.


(B) *Non-lead Federal branch or agency* means a Federal branch or agency that is not the lead Federal branch or agency of a foreign bank that controls two or more Federal branches or agencies.


(c) *Additional assessment for independent credit card national banks and independent credit card Federal savings associations*—(1) *General rule.* In addition to the assessment calculated according to paragraph (a) of this section, each independent credit card national bank and independent credit card Federal savings association will pay an assessment based on receivables attributable to credit card accounts owned by the national bank or Federal savings association. This assessment will be computed by adding to its asset-based assessment an additional amount determined by its level of receivables attributable. The dollar amount of the additional assessment will be published in the “Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and Assessments,” described at § 8.8.


(2) *Independent credit card national banks and independent credit card Federal savings associations affiliated with full-service national banks or Federal savings associations.* The OCC will assess an independent credit card national bank and an independent credit card Federal savings association in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, notwithstanding that the national bank or Federal savings association is affiliated with a full-service national bank or full-service Federal savings association, if the OCC concludes that the affiliation is intended to evade this part.


(3) *Definitions.* For purposes of this paragraph (c), the following definitions apply:


(i) *Affiliate,* with respect to national banks, has the same meaning as this term has in 12 U.S.C. 221a(b).


(ii) *Affiliate,* with respect to Federal savings associations, has the same meaning as in 12 U.S.C. 1462(9).


(iii) *Engaged primarily in card operations* means a bank described in section 2(c)(2)(F) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1841(c)(2)(F)) or a national bank or a Federal savings association whose ratio of total gross receivables attributable to the national bank's or Federal savings association's balance sheet assets exceeds 50%.


(iv) *Full-service national bank* is a national bank that generates more than 50% of its interest and non-interest income from activities other than credit card operations or trust activities and is authorized according to its charter to engage in all types of permissible banking activities.


(v) *Full-service Federal savings association* is a Federal savings association that generates more than 50% of its interest and non-interest income from activities other than credit card operations or trust activities and is authorized according to its charter to engage in all types of activities permissible for Federal savings associations.


(vi) *Independent credit card national bank* is a national bank that engages primarily in credit card operations and is not affiliated with a full-service national bank.


(vii) *Independent credit card Federal savings association* is a Federal savings association that engages primarily in credit card operations and is not affiliated with a full-service Federal savings association.


(viii) *Receivables attributable* is the total amount of outstanding balances due on credit card accounts owned by an independent credit card national bank or an independent credit card Federal savings association (the receivables attributable to those accounts) on the last day of the assessment period, minus receivables retained on the national bank's or Federal savings association's balance sheet as of that day.


(4) *Reports of receivables attributable.* Independent credit card national banks and independent credit card Federal savings associations will report receivables attributable data to the OCC semiannually at a time specified by the OCC.


(d) *Surcharge based on the condition of the national bank, Federal savings association, or Federal branch or agency.* Subject to any limit that the OCC prescribes in the “Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and Assessments,” the OCC shall apply a surcharge to the semiannual assessment computed in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. This surcharge will be determined by multiplying the semiannual assessment computed in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section by—


(1) 1.5, in the case of any national bank or Federal savings association that receives a composite rating of 3 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (UFIRS) and any Federal branch or agency that receives a composite rating of 3 under the ROCA rating system (which rates risk management, operational controls, compliance, and asset quality) at its most recent examination prior to December 31 or June 30, as appropriate; and
