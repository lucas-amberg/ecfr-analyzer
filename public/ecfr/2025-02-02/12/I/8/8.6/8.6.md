(3) Conducting special examinations and investigations of an entity with respect to its performance of activities described in section 7(c) of the Bank Service Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1867(c)) if the OCC determines that assessment of the fee is warranted with regard to a particular national bank, Federal branch or agency of a foreign bank, or Federal savings association because of the high risk or unusual nature of the activities performed; the significance to the national bank's, Federal branch's or agency's, or Federal saving association's operations and income of the activities performed; or the extent to which the national bank, Federal branch or agency, or Federal savings association has sufficient systems, controls, and personnel to adequately monitor, measure, and control risks arising from such activities;

(b) *Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and Assessments.* The OCC publishes the fee schedule for fiduciary activities, special examinations and investigations, examinations of affiliates and examinations related to corporate activities in the “Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and Assessments” described in § 8.8.


(c) *Additional assessments on trust national banks and trust Federal savings associations*—(1) *Independent trust national banks and independent trust Federal savings associations.* The assessment of independent trust national banks and independent trust Federal savings associations will include a fiduciary and related asset component, in addition to the assessment calculated according to § 8.2 of this part, as follows:


(i) *Minimum fee.* All independent trust national banks and independent trust Federal savings associations will pay a minimum fee, to be provided in the “Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and Assessments.”


(ii) *Additional amount for independent trust national banks and independent trust Federal savings associations with fiduciary and related assets in excess of $1 billion.* Independent trust national banks and independent trust Federal savings associations with fiduciary and related assets in excess of $1 billion will pay an amount that exceeds the minimum fee. The amount to be paid will be calculated by multiplying the amount of fiduciary and related assets by a rate or rates provided by the OCC in the “Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and Assessments.”


(iii) *Surcharge based on the condition of the independent trust national bank or of the independent trust Federal savings association.* Subject to any limit that the OCC prescribes in the “Notice of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Fees and Assessments,” the OCC shall adjust the semiannual assessment computed in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section by multiplying that figure by 1.5 for each independent trust national bank and independent trust Federal savings association that receives a composite UFIRS rating of 3 at its most recent examination prior to December 31 or June 30, as appropriate, and by 2.0 for each independent trust national bank and independent trust Federal savings association that receives a composite UFIRS rating of 4 or 5 at such examination.


(2) *Trust national banks affiliated with full-service national banks and trust Federal savings associations affiliated with full-service Federal savings associations.* The OCC will assess a trust national bank and a trust Federal savings association in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, notwithstanding that the national bank is affiliated with a full-service national bank, or that the Federal savings association is affiliated with a full-service Federal savings association, if the OCC concludes that the affiliation is intended to evade the assessment regulation.
