# § 208.21   Investments in premises and securities.

(a) *Investment in bank premises.* No state member bank shall invest in bank premises, or in the stock, bonds, debentures, or other such obligations of any corporation holding the premises of such bank, or make loans to or upon the security of any such corporation unless:


(1) The bank notifies the appropriate Reserve Bank at least fifteen days prior to such investment and has not received notice that the investment is subject to further review by the end of the fifteen day notice period;


(2) The aggregate of all such investments and loans, together with the amount of any indebtedness incurred by any such corporation that is an affiliate of the bank (as defined in section 2 of the Banking Act of 1933, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 221a), is less than or equal to the bank's perpetual preferred stock and related surplus plus common stock plus surplus, as those terms are defined in the FFIEC Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income; or


(3)(i) The aggregate of all such investments and loans, together with the amount of any indebtedness incurred by any such corporation that is an affiliate of the bank, is less than or equal to 150 percent of the bank's perpetual preferred stock and related surplus plus common stock plus surplus, as those terms are defined in the FFIEC Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income; and


(ii) The bank:


(A) Has a CAMELS composite rating of 1 or 2 under the Uniform Interagency Bank Rating System 
5 (or an equivalent rating under a comparable rating system) as of the most recent examination of the bank; and


(B) Is well capitalized and will continue to be well capitalized, in accordance with subpart D of this part, after the investment or loan.


(b) *Investments in securities.* Member banks are subject to the same limitations and conditions with respect to purchasing, selling, underwriting, and holding investment securities and stocks as are national banks under 12 U.S.C. 24, ¶ 7th. To determine whether an obligation qualifies as an investment security for the purposes of 12 U.S.C. 24, ¶ 7th, and to calculate the limits with respect to the purchase of such obligations, a state member bank may look to part 1 of the rules of the Comptroller of the Currency (12 CFR part 1) and interpretations thereunder. A state member bank may consult the Board for a determination with respect to the application of 12 U.S.C. 24, ¶ 7th, with respect to issues not addressed in 12 CFR part 1. The provisions of 12 CFR part 1 do not provide authority for a state member bank to purchase securities of a type or amount that the bank is not authorized to purchase under applicable state law.
