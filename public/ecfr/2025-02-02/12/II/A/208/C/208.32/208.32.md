# ยง 208.32   Notice of disciplinary sanctions imposed by registered clearing agency.

(a) *Notice requirement.* Any member bank or any of its subsidiaries that is a registered clearing agency pursuant to section 17A(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Act), and that:


(1) Imposes any final disciplinary sanction on any participant therein;


(2) Denies participation to any applicant; or


(3) Prohibits or limits any person in respect to access to services offered by the clearing agency, shall file with the Board (and the appropriate regulatory agency, if other than the Board, for a participant or applicant) notice thereof in the manner prescribed in this section.


(b) *Notice of final disciplinary actions.* (1) Any registered clearing agency for which the Board is the appropriate regulatory agency that takes any final disciplinary action with respect to any participant shall promptly file a notice thereof with the Board in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. For the purposes of this paragraph (b), *final disciplinary action* means the imposition of any disciplinary sanction pursuant to section 17A(b)(3)(G) of the Act, or other action of a registered clearing agency which, after notice and opportunity for hearing, results in final disposition of charges of:


(i) One or more violations of the rules of the registered clearing agency; or


(ii) Acts or practices constituting a statutory disqualification of a type defined in paragraph (iv) or (v) (except prior convictions) of section 3(a)(39) of the Act.


(2) However, if a registered clearing agency fee schedule specifies certain charges for errors made by its participants in giving instructions to the registered clearing agency which are *de minimis* on a per error basis, and whose purpose is, in part, to provide revenues to the clearing agency to compensate it for effort expended in beginning to process an erroneous instruction, such error charges shall not be considered a final disciplinary action for purposes of this paragraph (b).


(c) *Contents of final disciplinary action notice.* Any notice filed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall consist of the following, as appropriate:


(1) The name of the respondent and the respondent's last known address, as reflected on the records of the clearing agency, and the name of the person, committee, or other organizational unit that brought the charges. However, identifying information as to any respondent found not to have violated a provision covered by a charge may be deleted insofar as the notice reports the disposition of that charge and, prior to the filing of the notice, the respondent does not request that identifying information be included in the notice;


(2) A statement describing the investigative or other origin of the action;


(3) As charged in the proceeding, the specific provision or provisions of the rules of the clearing agency violated by the respondent, or the statutory disqualification referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and a statement describing the answer of the respondent to the charges;


(4) A statement setting forth findings of fact with respect to any act or practice in which the respondent was charged with having engaged in or omitted; the conclusion of the clearing agency as to whether the respondent violated any rule or was subject to a statutory disqualification as charged; and a statement of the clearing agency in support of its resolution of the principal issues raised in the proceedings;


(5) A statement describing any sanction imposed, the reasons therefor, and the date upon which the sanction became or will become effective; and


(6) Such other matters as the clearing agency may deem relevant.


(d) *Notice of final denial, prohibition, termination or limitation based on qualification or administrative rules.* (1) Any registered clearing agency, for which the Board is the appropriate regulatory agency, that takes any final action that denies or conditions the participation of any person, or prohibits or limits access, to services offered by the clearing agency, shall promptly file notice thereof with the Board (and the appropriate regulatory agency, if other than the Board, for the affected person) in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section; but such action shall not be considered a final disciplinary action for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section where the action is based on an alleged failure of such person to:


(i) Comply with the qualification standards prescribed by the rules of the registered clearing agency pursuant to section 17A(b)(4)(B) of the Act; or


(ii) Comply with any administrative requirements of the registered clearing agency (including failure to pay entry or other dues or fees, or to file prescribed forms or reports) not involving charges of violations that may lead to a disciplinary sanction.


(2) However, no such action shall be considered final pursuant to this paragraph (d) that results merely from a notice of such failure to comply to the person affected, if such person has not sought an adjudication of the matter, including a hearing, or otherwise exhausted the administrative remedies within the registered clearing agency with respect to such a matter.


(e) *Contents of notice required by paragraph (d) of this section.* Any notice filed pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section shall consist of the following, as appropriate:


(1) The name of each person concerned and each person's last known address, as reflected in the records of the clearing agency;


(2) The specific grounds upon which the action of the clearing agency was based, and a statement describing the answer of the person concerned;


(3) A statement setting forth findings of fact and conclusions as to each alleged failure of the person to comply with qualification standards or administrative obligations, and a statement of the clearing agency in support of its resolution of the principal issues raised in the proceeding;


(4) The date upon which such action became or will become effective; and


(5) Such other matters as the clearing agency deems relevant.


(f) *Notice of final action based on prior adjudicated statutory disqualifications.* Any registered clearing agency for which the Board is the appropriate regulatory agency that takes any final action shall promptly file notice thereof with the Board (and the appropriate regulatory agency, if other than the Board, for the affected person) in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, where the final action:


(1) Denies or conditions participation to any person, or prohibits or limits access to services offered by the clearing agency; and


(2) Is based upon a statutory disqualification of a type defined in paragraph (A), (B) or (C) of section 3(a)(39) of the Act, consisting of a prior conviction, as described in subparagraph (E) of section 3(a)(39) of the Act. However, no such action shall be considered final pursuant to this paragraph (f) that results merely from a notice of such disqualification to the person affected, if such person has not sought an adjudication of the matter, including a hearing, or otherwise exhausted the administrative remedies within the clearing agency with respect to such a matter.


(g) *Contents of notice required by paragraph (f) of this section.* Any notice filed pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section shall consist of the following, as appropriate:


(1) The name of each person concerned and each person's last known address, as reflected in the records of the clearing agency;


(2) A statement setting forth the principal issues raised, the answer of any person concerned, and a statement of the clearing agency in support of its resolution of the principal issues raised in the proceeding;


(3) Any description furnished by or on behalf of the person concerned of the activities engaged in by the person since the adjudication upon which the disqualification is based;


(4) A copy of the order or decision of the court, appropriate regulatory agency, or self-regulatory organization that adjudicated the matter giving rise to the statutory disqualification;


(5) The nature of the action taken and the date upon which such action is to be made effective; and


(6) Such other matters as the clearing agency deems relevant.


(h) *Notice of summary suspension of participation.* Any registered clearing agency for which the Board is the appropriate regulatory agency that summarily suspends or closes the accounts of a participant pursuant to the provisions of section 17A(b)(5)(C) of the Act shall, within one business day after such action becomes effective, file notice thereof with the Board and the appropriate regulatory agency for the participant, if other than the Board, of such action in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section.


(i) *Contents of notice of summary suspension.* Any notice pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section shall contain at least the following information, as appropriate:


(1) The name of the participant concerned and the participant's last known address, as reflected in the records of the clearing agency;


(2) The date upon which the summary action became or will become effective;


(3) If the summary action is based upon the provisions of section 17A(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Act, a copy of the relevant order or decision of the self-regulatory organization, if available to the clearing agency;


(4) If the summary action is based upon the provisions of section 17A(b)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act, a statement describing the default of any delivery of funds or securities to the clearing agency;
