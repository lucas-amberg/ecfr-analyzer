# § 211.25   Termination of offices of foreign banks.

(a) *Grounds for termination*—(1) *General.* Under sections 7(e) and 10(b) of the IBA (12 U.S.C. 3105(d), 3107(b)), the Board may order a foreign bank to terminate the activities of its representative office, state branch, state agency, or commercial lending company subsidiary if the Board finds that: 


(i) The foreign bank is not subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision in accordance with § 211.24(c)(1), and the home country supervisor is not making demonstrable progress in establishing arrangements for the consolidated supervision of the foreign bank; or 


(ii) Both of the following criteria are met: 


(A) There is reasonable cause to believe that the foreign bank, or any of its affiliates, has committed a violation of law or engaged in an unsafe or unsound banking practice in the United States; and 


(B) As a result of such violation or practice, the continued operation of the foreign bank's representative office, state branch, state agency, or commercial lending company subsidiary would not be consistent with the public interest, or with the purposes of the IBA, the BHC Act, or the FDIA. 


(2) *Additional ground.* The Board also may enforce any condition imposed in connection with an order issued under § 211.24. 


(b) *Factor.* In making its findings under this section, the Board may take into account the needs of the community, the history of operation of the foreign bank, and its relative size in its home country, provided that the size of the foreign bank shall not be the sole determining factor in a decision to terminate an office. 


(c) *Consultation with relevant state supervisor.* Except in the case of termination pursuant to the expedited procedure in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the Board shall request and consider the views of the relevant state supervisor before issuing an order terminating the activities of a state branch, state agency, representative office, or commercial lending company subsidiary under this section. 


(d) *Termination procedures*—(1) *Notice and hearing.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, an order issued under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be issued only after notice to the relevant state supervisor and the foreign bank and after an opportunity for a hearing. 


(2) *Procedures for hearing.* Hearings under this section shall be conducted pursuant to the Board's Rules of Practice for Hearings (12 CFR part 263). 


(3) *Expedited procedure.* The Board may act without providing an opportunity for a hearing, if it determines that expeditious action is necessary in order to protect the public interest. When the Board finds that it is necessary to act without providing an opportunity for a hearing, the Board, solely in its discretion, may: 


(i) Provide the foreign bank that is the subject of the termination order with notice of the intended termination order; 


(ii) Grant the foreign bank an opportunity to present a written submission opposing issuance of the order; or 


(iii) Take any other action designed to provide the foreign bank with notice and an opportunity to present its views concerning the order. 


(e) *Termination of federal branch or federal agency.* The Board may transmit to the Comptroller a recommendation that the license of a federal branch or federal agency be terminated if the Board has reasonable cause to believe that the foreign bank or any affiliate of the foreign bank has engaged in conduct for which the activities of a state branch or state agency may be terminated pursuant to this section. 


(f) *Voluntary termination.* A foreign bank shall notify the Board at least 30 days prior to terminating the activities of any office. Notice pursuant to this paragraph (f) is in addition to, and does not satisfy, any other federal or state requirements relating to the termination of an office or the requirement for prior notice of the closing of a branch, pursuant to section 39 of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1831p).
