# § 220.108   International Bank Securities.

(a) Section 2 of the Act of June 29, 1949 (Pub. L. 142—81st Congress), amended the Bretton Woods Agreements Act by adding a new section numbered 15 providing, in part, that—


(b) In response to inquiries with respect to the applicability of the margin requirements of this part to securities issued or guaranteed by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Board has replied that, as a result of this enactment, securities issued by the Bank are now classified as exempted securities under § 220.2(e). Such securities are now in the same category under this part as are United States Government, State and municipal bonds. Accordingly, the specific percentage limitations prescribed by this part with respect to maximum loan value and margin requirements are no longer applicable thereto.
