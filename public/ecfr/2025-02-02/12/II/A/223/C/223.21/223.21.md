# § 223.21   What valuation and timing principles apply to credit transactions?

(a) *Valuation*—(1) *Initial valuation.* Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section, a credit transaction with an affiliate initially must be valued at the greater of: 


(i) The principal amount of the transaction; 


(ii) The amount owed by the affiliate to the member bank under the transaction; or 


(iii) The sum of: 


(A) The amount provided to, or on behalf of, the affiliate in the transaction; and 


(B) Any additional amount that the member bank could be required to provide to, or on behalf of, the affiliate under the terms of the transaction. 


(2) *Initial valuation of certain acquisitions of a credit transaction.* If a member bank acquires from a nonaffiliate a credit transaction with an affiliate, the covered transaction initially must be valued at the sum of: 


(i) The total amount of consideration given (including liabilities assumed) by the member bank in exchange for the credit transaction; and 


(ii) Any additional amount that the member bank could be required to provide to, or on behalf of, the affiliate under the terms of the transaction. 


(3) *Debt securities.* The valuation principles of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section do not apply to a member bank's purchase of or investment in a debt security issued by an affiliate, which is governed by § 223.23. 


(4) *Examples.* The following are examples of how to value a member bank's credit transactions with an affiliate.


(i) *Term loan.* A member bank makes a loan to an affiliate that has a principal amount of $100. The affiliate pays $2 in up-front fees to the member bank, and the affiliate receives net loan proceeds of $98. The member bank must initially value the covered transaction at $100. 


(ii) *Revolving credit.* A member bank establishes a $300 revolving credit facility for an affiliate. The affiliate has drawn down $100 under the facility. The member bank must value the covered transaction at $300 throughout the life of the facility. 


(iii) *Guarantee.* A member bank has issued a guarantee to a nonaffiliate on behalf of an affiliate under which the member bank would be obligated to pay the nonaffiliate $500 if the affiliate defaults on an issuance of debt securities. The member bank must value the guarantee at $500 throughout the life of the guarantee. 


(iv) *Acquisition of a loan to an affiliate.* A member bank purchases from a nonaffiliate a fixed-rate loan to an affiliate. The loan has an outstanding principal amount of $100 but, due to movements in the general level of interest rates since the time of the loan's origination, the member bank is able to purchase the loan for $90. The member bank initially must value the credit transaction at $90 (and must ensure that the credit transaction complies with the collateral requirements of § 223.14 at the time of its acquisition of the loan). 


(b) *Timing*—(1) *In general.* A member bank engages in a credit transaction with an affiliate at the time during the day that: 


(i) The member bank becomes legally obligated to make an extension of credit to, issue a guarantee, acceptance, or letter of credit on behalf of, or confirm a letter of credit issued by, an affiliate; 


(ii) The member bank enters into a cross-affiliate netting arrangement; or 


(iii) The member bank acquires an extension of credit to, or guarantee, acceptance, or letter of credit issued on behalf of, an affiliate. 


(2) *Credit transactions by a member bank with a nonaffiliate that becomes an affiliate of the member bank*—(i) *In general.* A credit transaction with a nonaffiliate becomes a covered transaction at the time that the nonaffiliate becomes an affiliate of the member bank. The member bank must treat the amount of any such credit transaction as part of the aggregate amount of the member bank's covered transactions for purposes of determining compliance with the quantitative limits of §§ 223.11 and 223.12 in connection with any future covered transactions. Except as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the member bank is not required to reduce the amount of its covered transactions with any affiliate because the nonaffiliate has become an affiliate. If the nonaffiliate becomes an affiliate less than one year after the member bank enters into the credit transaction with the nonaffiliate, the member bank also must ensure that the credit transaction complies with the collateral requirements of § 223.14 promptly after the nonaffiliate becomes an affiliate. 


(ii) *Credit transactions by a member bank with a nonaffiliate in contemplation of the nonaffiliate becoming an affiliate of the member bank.* Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, if a member bank engages in a credit transaction with a nonaffiliate in contemplation of the nonaffiliate becoming an affiliate of the member bank, the member bank must ensure that: 


(A) The aggregate amount of the member bank's covered transactions (including any such credit transaction with the nonaffiliate) would not exceed the quantitative limits of § 223.11 or 223.12 at the time the nonaffiliate becomes an affiliate; and 


(B) The credit transaction complies with the collateral requirements of § 223.14 at the time the nonaffiliate becomes an affiliate. 


(iii) *Example.* A member bank with capital stock and surplus of $1,000 and no outstanding covered transactions makes a $120 unsecured loan to a nonaffiliate. The member bank does not make the loan in contemplation of the nonaffiliate becoming an affiliate. Nine months later, the member bank's holding company purchases all the stock of the nonaffiliate, thereby making the nonaffiliate an affiliate of the member bank. The member bank is not in violation of the quantitative limits of § 223.11 or 223.12 at the time of the stock acquisition. The member bank is, however, prohibited from engaging in any additional covered transactions with the new affiliate at least until such time as the value of the loan transaction falls below 10 percent of the member bank's capital stock and surplus. In addition, the member bank must bring the loan into compliance with the collateral requirements of § 223.14 promptly after the stock acquisition.
