# § 225.10   Temporary relief for 2020 and 2021.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section and subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, from December 2, 2020, through December 31, 2021, the consolidated assets, consolidated risk-weighted assets, total consolidated assets, and total assets of a bank holding company for purposes of §§ 225.4(b)(2)(iii)(A) and (B), 225.14(a)(1)(v)(A)(*1*) and (*2*), 225.14(a)(1)(vi), 225.23(a)(1)(iii)(A)(*1*) and (*2*), 225.24(a)(2)(iv) and (v), and 225.28(b)(11)(vi) shall be determined based on the lesser of each such amount as of December 31, 2019, and as of the otherwise applicable asset measurement date of the relevant paragraph.


(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section and subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, from December 2, 2020, through December 31, 2021, for purposes of determining the applicability of §§ 224.14(c)(6)(ii), 225.17(a)(6), and 225.23(c)(5)(ii) of this part and appendix C to this part, the *pro forma* consolidated assets of a bank holding company and the consolidated risk-weighted assets of a bank holding company immediately following consummation of a transaction each shall be calculated as the lesser of:


(1) Such amount calculated as the sum of the assets of each company involved in the proposed business combination, as well as any company with which any such company has combined since December 31, 2019, as of December 31, 2019; and


(2) Such amount calculated as the sum of the assets of each company involved in the proposed business combination as of the end of the most recent calendar quarter.


(c) The relief provided under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section does not apply to a bank holding company if the Board determines that permitting the bank holding company to determine its assets in accordance with that paragraph would not be commensurate with the risk profile of the bank holding company. When making this determination, the Board will consider all relevant factors, including the extent of asset growth of the bank holding company since December 31, 2019; the causes of such growth, including whether growth occurred as a result of mergers or acquisitions; whether such growth is likely to be temporary or permanent; whether the bank holding company has become involved in any additional activities since December 31, 2019; the asset size of any parent companies; and the type of assets held by the bank holding company. In making a determination pursuant to this section, the Board will apply notice and response procedures in the same manner and to the same extent as the notice and response procedures in 12 CFR 263.202.


(d) Nothing in this section limits the discretion of the Board or its delegatee to disallow the use of any expedited action process, require the submission of additional information in connection with a notice or application, or consider the ability of a bank holding company filing a notice or application under this part to comply with any statutory or regulatory requirements that may be applicable to the bank holding company upon expiration of the relief provided by this section.
