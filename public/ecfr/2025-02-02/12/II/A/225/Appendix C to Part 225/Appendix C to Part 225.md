# Appendix C to Part 225—Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement 


In acting on applications filed under the Bank Holding Company Act, the Board has adopted, and continues to follow, the principle that bank holding companies should serve as a source of strength for their subsidiary banks. When bank holding companies incur debt and rely upon the earnings of their subsidiary banks as the means of repaying such debt, a question arises as to the probable effect upon the financial condition of the holding company and its subsidiary bank or banks.


The Board believes that a high level of debt at the parent holding company impairs the ability of a bank holding company to provide financial assistance to its subsidiary bank(s) and, in some cases, the servicing requirements on such debt may be a significant drain on the resources of the bank(s). For these reasons, the Board has not favored the use of acquisition debt in the formation of bank holding companies or in the acquisition of additional banks. Nevertheless, the Board has recognized that the transfer of ownership of small banks often requires the use of acquisition debt. The Board, therefore, has permitted the formation and expansion of small bank holding companies with debt levels higher than would be permitted for larger holding companies. Approval of these applications has been given on the condition that small bank holding companies demonstrate the ability to service acquisition debt without straining the capital of their subsidiary banks and, further, that such companies restore their ability to serve as a source of strength for their subsidiary banks within a relatively short period of time.


In the interest of continuing its policy of facilitating the transfer of ownership in banks without compromising bank safety and soundness, the Board has, as described below, adopted the following procedures and standards for the formation and expansion of small bank holding companies subject to this policy statement.


This policy statement applies only to bank holding companies with *pro forma* consolidated assets of less than $3 billion that (i) are not engaged in significant nonbanking activities either directly or through a nonbank subsidiary; (ii) do not conduct significant off-balance sheet activities (including securitization and asset management or administration) either directly or through a nonbank subsidiary; and (iii) do not have a material amount of debt or equity securities outstanding (other than trust preferred securities) that are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Board may in its discretion exclude any bank holding company, regardless of asset size, from the policy statement if such action is warranted for supervisory purposes.
1 With the exception of section 4 (Additional Application Requirements for Expedited/Waived Processing), the policy statement applies to savings and loan holding companies as if they were bank holding companies.


While this policy statement primarily applies to the formation of small bank holding companies, it also applies to existing small bank holding companies that wish to acquire an additional bank or company and to transactions involving changes in control, stock redemptions, or other shareholder transactions.

The following guidelines must be followed on an ongoing basis for all organizations operating under this policy statement.


A. Reduction in parent company leverage: Small bank holding companies are to reduce their parent company debt consistent with the requirement that all debt be retired within 25 years of being incurred. The Board also expects that these bank holding companies reach a debt to equity ratio of .30:1 or less within 12 years of the incurrence of the debt. 
3 The bank holding company must also comply with debt servicing and other requirements imposed by its creditors.


B. Capital adequacy: Each insured depository subsidiary of a small bank holding company is expected to be well-capitalized. Any institution that is not well-capitalized is expected to become well-capitalized within a brief period of time.


C. Dividend restrictions: A small bank holding company whose debt to equity ratio is greater than 1.0:1 is not expected to pay corporate dividends until such time as it reduces its debt to equity ratio to 1.0:1 or less and otherwise meets the criteria set forth in §§ 225.14(c)(1)(ii), 225.14(c)(2), and 225.14(c)(7) of Regulation Y.

Small bank holding companies formed before the effective date of this policy statement may switch to a plan that adheres to the intent of this statement provided they comply with the requirements set forth above.


In assessing applications or notices by organizations subject to this policy statement, the Board will continue to take into account a full range of financial and other information about the applicant, and its current and proposed subsidiaries, including the recent trend and stability of earnings, past and prospective growth, asset quality, the ability to meet debt servicing requirements without placing an undue strain on the resources of the bank(s), and the record and competency of management. In addition, the Board will require applicants to meet the following requirements:


A. Minimum down payment: The amount of acquisition debt should not exceed 75 percent of the purchase price of the bank(s) or company to be acquired. When the owner(s) of the holding company incurs debt to finance the purchase of the bank(s) or company, such debt will be considered acquisition debt even though it does not represent an obligation of the bank holding company, unless the owner(s) can demonstrate that such debt can be serviced without reliance on the resources of the bank(s) or bank holding company.


B. Ability to reduce parent company leverage: The bank holding company must clearly be able to reduce its debt to equity ratio and comply with its loan agreement(s) as set forth in paragraph 2A above.


Failure to meet the criteria in this section would normally result in denial of an application.


A. Expedited notices under §§ 225.14 and 225.23 of Regulation Y: A small bank holding company proposal will be eligible for the expedited processing procedures set forth in §§ 225.14 and 225.23 of Regulation Y if the bank holding company is in compliance with the ongoing requirements of this policy statement, the bank holding company meets the core requirements for all applicants noted above, and the following requirements are met: 


i. The parent bank holding company has a *pro forma* debt to equity ratio of 1.0:1 or less. 


ii. The bank holding company meets all of the criteria for expedited action set forth in §§ 225.14 or 225.23 of Regulation Y.


B. Waiver of stock redemption filing: A small bank holding company will be eligible for the stock redemption filing exception for well-capitalized bank holding companies contained in § 225.4(b)(6) if the following requirements are met: 


i. The parent bank holding company has a *pro forma d*ebt to equity ratio of 1.0:1 or less. 


ii. The bank holding company is in compliance with the ongoing requirements of this policy statement and meets the requirements of §§ 225.14(c)(1)(ii), 225.14(c)(2), and 225.14(c)(7) of Regulation Y.
