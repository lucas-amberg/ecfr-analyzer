(iv) The date of completion of any hearing or other proceeding.


(g) *Exceptions to notice and hearing requirements*—(1) *Probable bank failure.* If the Board finds it must act immediately on an application or notice in order to prevent the probable failure of a bank or bank holding company, the Board may modify or dispense with the notice and hearing requirements of this section.


(2) *Emergency.* If the Board finds that, although immediate action on an application or notice is not necessary, an emergency exists requiring expeditious action, the Board shall provide the primary supervisor 10 days to submit its recommendation. The Board may act on such an application or notice without a hearing and may modify or dispense with the other notice and hearing requirements of this section.


(h) *Waiting period.* A transaction approved under § 225.14 or § 225.15 shall not be consummated until 30 days after the date of approval of the application, except that a transaction may be consummated:


(1) Immediately upon approval, if the Board has determined under paragraph (g) of this section that the application or notice involves a probable bank failure;
