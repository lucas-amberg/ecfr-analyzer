# § 225.83   What are the consequences of failing to continue to meet applicable capital and management requirements?

(a) *Notice by the Board.* If the Board finds that a financial holding company controls any depository institution that is not well capitalized or well managed, the Board will notify the company in writing that it is not in compliance with the applicable requirement(s) for a financial holding company and identify the area(s) of noncompliance. The Board may provide this notice at any time before or after receiving notice from the financial holding company under paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) *Notification by a financial holding company required*—(1) *Notice to Board.* A financial holding company must notify the Board in writing within 15 calendar days of becoming aware that any depository institution controlled by the company has ceased to be well capitalized or well managed. This notification must identify the depository institution involved and the area(s) of noncompliance.


(2) *Triggering events for notice to the Board*—(i) *Well capitalized.* A company becomes aware that a depository institution it controls is no longer well capitalized upon the occurrence of any material event that would change the category assigned to the institution for purposes of section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831o). *See* 12 CFR 6.3(b)-(c), 208.42(b)-(c), and 325.102(b)-(c).


(ii) *Well managed.* A company becomes aware that a depository institution it controls is no longer well managed at the time the depository institution receives written notice from the appropriate Federal or state banking agency that either its composite rating or its rating for management is not at least satisfactory. 


(c) *Execution of agreement acceptable to the Board*—(1) *Agreement required; time period.* Within 45 days after receiving a notice from the Board under paragraph (a) of this section, the company must execute an agreement acceptable to the Board to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. 


(2) *Extension of time for executing agreement.* Upon request by a company, the Board may extend the 45-day period under paragraph (c)(1) of this section if the Board determines that granting additional time is appropriate under the circumstances. A request by a company for additional time must include an explanation of why an extension is necessary.


(3) *Agreement requirements.* An agreement required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section to correct a capital or management deficiency must: 


(i) Explain the specific actions that the company will take to correct all areas of noncompliance; 


(ii) Provide a schedule within which each action will be taken; 


(iii) Provide any other information that the Board may require; and 


(iv) Be acceptable to the Board. 


(d) *Limitations during period of noncompliance.* Until the Board determines that a company has corrected the conditions described in a notice under paragraph (a) of this section: 


(1) The Board may impose any limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of the company or any of its affiliates as the Board finds to be appropriate and consistent with the purposes of the BHC Act; and


(2) The company and its affiliates may not commence any additional activity or acquire control or shares of any company under section 4(k) of the BHC Act without prior approval from the Board. 


(e) *Consequences of failure to correct conditions within 180 days*—(1) *Divestiture of depository institutions.* If a company does not correct the conditions described in a notice under paragraph (a) of this section within 180 days of receipt of the notice or such additional time as the Board may permit, the Board may order the company to divest ownership or control of any depository institution owned or controlled by the company. Such divestiture must be done in accordance with the terms and conditions established by the Board. 


(2) *Alternative method of complying with a divestiture order.* A company may comply with an order issued under paragraph (e)(1) of this section by ceasing to engage (both directly and through any subsidiary that is not a depository institution or a subsidiary of a depository institution) in any activity that may be conducted only under section 4(k), (n), or (o) of the BHC Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(k), (n), or (o)). The termination of activities must be completed within the time period referred to in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and in accordance with the terms and conditions acceptable to the Board. 


(f) *Consultation with other agencies.* In taking any action under this section, the Board will consult with the relevant Federal and state regulatory authorities.
