# Appendix E to Part 226—Rules for Card Issuers That Bill on a Transaction-by-Transaction Basis


The following provisions of Subpart B apply if credit cards are issued and the card issuer and the seller are the same or related persons; no finance charge is imposed; consumers are billed in full for each use of the card on a transaction-by-transaction basis, by means of an invoice or other statement reflecting each use of the card; and no cumulative account is maintained which reflects the transactions by each consumer during a period of time, such as a month. The term “related person” refers to, for example, a franchised or licensed seller of a creditor's product or service or a seller who assigns or sells sales accounts to a creditor or arranges for credit under a plan that allows the consumer to use the credit only in transactions with that seller. A seller is not related to the creditor merely because the seller and the creditor have an agreement authorizing the seller to honor the creditor's credit card.


1. *Section 226.6(a)(5) or § 226.6(b)(5)(iii).*

2. *Section 226.6(a)(2) or § 226.6(b)(3)(ii)(B), as applicable.* The disclosure required by § 226.6(a)(2) or § 226.6(b)(3)(ii)(B) shall be limited to those charges that are or may be imposed as a result of the deferral of payment by use of the card, such as late payment or delinquency charges. A tabular format is not required.


3. *Section 226.6(a)(4) or § 226.6(b)(5)(ii).*

4. *Section 226.7(a)(2) or § 226.7(b)(2), as applicable; § 226.7(a)(9) or § 226.7(b)(9), as applicable.* Creditors may comply by placing the required disclosures on the invoice or statement sent to the consumer for each transaction.


5. *Section 226.9(a).* Creditors may comply by mailing or delivering the statement required by § 226.6(a)(5) or § 226.6(b)(5)(iii) (see appendix G-3 and G-3(A) to this part) to each consumer receiving a transaction invoice during a one-month period chosen by the card issuer or by sending either the statement prescribed by § 226.6(a)(5) or § 226.6(b)(5)(iii), or an alternative billing error rights statement substantially similar to that in appendix G-4 and G-4(A) to this part, with each invoice sent to a consumer.


6. *Section 226.9(c).* A tabular format is not required.


7. *Section 226.10.*

8. *Section 226.11(a).* This section applies when a card issuer receives a payment or other credit that exceeds by more than $1 the amount due, as shown on the transaction invoice. The requirement to credit amounts to an account may be complied with by other reasonable means, such as by a credit memorandum. Since no periodic statement is provided, a notice of the credit balance shall be sent to the consumer within a reasonable period of time following its occurrence unless a refund of the credit balance is mailed or delivered to the consumer within seven business days of its receipt by the card issuer.


9. *Section 226.12 including § 226.12(c) and (d), as applicable.* Section 226.12(e) is inapplicable.


10. *Section 226.13, as applicable.* All references to “periodic statement” shall be read to indicate the invoice or other statement for the relevant transaction. All actions with regard to correcting and adjusting a consumer's account may be taken by issuing a refund or a new invoice, or by other appropriate means consistent with the purposes of the section.


11. *Section 226.15, as applicable.*
