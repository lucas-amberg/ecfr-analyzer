# Appendix G to Part 226—Open-End Model Forms and Clauses 


(a) Adjusted balance method


We figure [a portion of] the finance charge on your account by applying the periodic rate to the “adjusted balance” of your account. We get the “adjusted balance” by taking the balance you owed at the end of the previous billing cycle and subtracting [any unpaid finance charges and] any payments and credits received during the present billing cycle.


(b) Previous balance method


We figure [a portion of] the finance charge on your account by applying the periodic rate to the amount you owe at the beginning of each billing cycle [minus any unpaid finance charges]. We do not subtract any payments or credits received during the billing cycle. [The amount of payments and credits to your account this billing cycle was $ ______.]


(c) Average daily balance method (excluding current transactions)


We figure [a portion of] the finance charge on your account by applying the periodic rate to the “average daily balance” of your account (excluding current transactions). To get the “average daily balance” we take the beginning balance of your account each day and subtract any payments or credits [and any unpaid finance charges]. We do not add in any new [purchases/advances/loans]. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add all the daily balances for the billing cycle together and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the “average daily balance.”


(d) Average daily balance method (including current transactions)


We figure [a portion of] the finance charge on your account by applying the periodic rate to the “average daily balance” of your account (including current transactions). To get the “average daily balance” we take the beginning balance of your account each day, add any new [purchases/advances/loans], and subtract any payments or credits, [and unpaid finance charges]. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the “average daily balance.”


(e) Ending balance method


We figure [a portion of] the finance charge on your account by applying the periodic rate to the amount you owe at the end of each billing cycle (including new purchases and deducting payments and credits made during the billing cycle).


(f) Daily balance method (including current transactions)


We figure [a portion of] the finance charge on your account by applying the periodic rate to the “daily balance” of your account for each day in the billing cycle. To get the “daily balance” we take the beginning balance of your account each day, add any new [purchases/advances/fees], and subtract [any unpaid finance charges and] any payments or credits. This gives us the daily balance.


(a) Adjusted balance method


We figure the interest charge on your account by applying the periodic rate to the “adjusted balance” of your account.

You may be liable for the unauthorized use of your credit card [or other term that describes the credit card].

[You may also contact us on the Web: [Creditor Web or email address]]


You will not be liable for any unauthorized use that occurs after you notify us. You may, however, be liable for unauthorized use that occurs before your notice to us. In any case, your liability will not exceed [insert $50 or any lesser amount under agreement with the cardholder].


This notice contains important information about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.


If you think your bill is wrong, or if you need more information about a transaction on your bill, write us [on a separate sheet] at [address] [the address listed on your bill]. Write to us as soon as possible. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the first bill on which the error or problem appeared. [You may also contact us on the Web: [Creditor Web or email address]] You can telephone us, but doing so will not preserve your rights.


In your letter, give us the following information:


• Your name and account number.


• The dollar amount of the suspected error.


• Describe the error and explain, if you can, why you believe there is an error. If you need more information, describe the item you are not sure about.


If you have authorized us to pay your credit card bill automatically from your savings or checking account, you can stop the payment on any amount you think is wrong. To stop the payment your letter must reach us three business days before the automatic payment is scheduled to occur.


We must acknowledge your letter within 30 days, unless we have corrected the error by then. Within 90 days, we must either correct the error or explain why we believe the bill was correct.


After we receive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount you question, or report you as delinquent. We can continue to bill you for the amount you question, including finance charges, and we can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. You do not have to pay any questioned amount while we are investigating, but you are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are not in question.


If we find that we made a mistake on your bill, you will not have to pay any finance charges related to any questioned amount. If we didn't make a mistake, you may have to pay finance charges, and you will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned amount. In either case, we will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date that it is due.


If you fail to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report you as delinquent. However, if our explanation does not satisfy you and you write to us within ten days telling us that you still refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we report you to that you have a question about your bill. And, we must tell you the name of anyone we reported you to. We must tell anyone we report you to that the matter has been settled between us when it finally is.


If we don't follow these rules, we can't collect the first $50 of the questioned amount, even if your bill was correct.


If you have a problem with the quality of property or services that you purchased with a credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the property or services.


There are two limitations on this right:


(a) You must have made the purchase in your home state or, if not within your home state within 100 miles of your current mailing address; and


(b) The purchase price must have been more than $50.


These limitations do not apply if we own or operate the merchant, or if we mailed you the advertisement for the property or services.
