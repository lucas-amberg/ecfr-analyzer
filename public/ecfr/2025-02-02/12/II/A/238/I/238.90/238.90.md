# § 238.90   Hearings.

(b) *Board review of hearing request.* The Board will review the hearing request to determine if the savings and loan holding company or person has demonstrated good cause for a hearing on the application. Within 30 days after the filing of a timely request for a hearing, the Board will notify the savings and loan holding company or person in writing of its decision to grant or deny the hearing request. If the Board grants the request for a hearing, it will order a hearing to be commenced within 60 days of the issuance of the notification. Upon the request of a party, the Board may at its discretion order a later hearing date.

The Board will furnish a transcript of the proceedings upon an applicant's request and upon the payment of the costs of the transcript.


(8) The presiding officer has the power to administer oaths and affirmations, to take or cause to be taken depositions of unavailable witnesses, and to issue, revoke, quash, or modify subpoenas and subpoenas *duces tecum.* If the presentation of witnesses is permitted, the presiding officer may require the attendance of witnesses from any state, territory, or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States at any location where the proceeding is being conducted.

(12) The presiding officer must forward his or her recommendation to the Board who shall promptly certify the entire record, including the presiding officer's recommendations. The Board's certification will close the record.
