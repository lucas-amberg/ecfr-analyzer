# § 246.4   Assessments.

(a) *Assessment.* Each assessed company shall pay to the Board an assessment for any assessment period for which the Board determines the company to be an assessed company.


(b)(1) *Assessment formula.* Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the assessment will be calculated according to the Assessment Formula, as follows:


(2) In any assessment period, if, at the time a company becomes a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company, it also becomes an assessed company, as defined in § 246.3, the Board shall pro-rate that company's assessment for that assessment period based on the number of quarters in which such company is an assessed company. For a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board, for the assessment period that the company is designated for Board supervision, Board shall pro-rate that company's assessment for that assessment period based on the number of quarters the company has been a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board.


(c) *Assessment rate.* Assessment rate means, with regard to a given assessment period, the rate published by the Board on its Web site for the calculation of assessments for that period.


(1)(i) The assessment rate for Category IV and “other” firms will be calculated according to this formula:








(ii) The assessment rate for Category I, II, and III firms will be calculated according to this formula:


(2) For the calculation set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the number of assessed companies and the total assessable assets of all assessed companies will each be that of the relevant assessment period, provided, however, that for the assessment periods corresponding to 2012, 2013 and 2014, the Board shall use the number of assessed companies and the total assessable assets of the 2012 assessment period to calculate the assessment rate.


(d) *Assessment basis.* (1) For the 2012, 2013, and 2014 assessment periods, the assessment basis is the amount of total expenses the Board estimates is necessary or appropriate to carry out the supervisory and regulatory responsibilities of the Board with respect to assessed companies for 2012.

2

(3) Net Assessment Basis is the assessment basis, as defined by paragraph (d)(2), net of the total $50,000 base amount charged to all assessed companies. *Net Assessment Basis* = assessment basis−(number of assessed companies × $50,000).
