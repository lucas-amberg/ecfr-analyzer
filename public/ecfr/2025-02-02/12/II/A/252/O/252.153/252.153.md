(2) *Factors.* In making a determination under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Board may consider whether applicable law would prohibit the foreign banking organization from owning or controlling one or more of its U.S. subsidiaries through a single U.S. intermediate holding company, or whether circumstances otherwise warrant an exception based on the foreign banking organization's activities, scope of operations, structure, or other similar considerations.


(3) *Request*—(i) *Contents.* A request submitted under this section must include an explanation of why the request should be granted and any other information required by the Board.
