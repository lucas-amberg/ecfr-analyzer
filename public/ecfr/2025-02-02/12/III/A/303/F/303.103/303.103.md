# § 303.103   Processing.

(a) *Processing.* The 30-day notice period specified in § 303.102(a) shall begin on the date substantially all information required to be submitted by the notificant pursuant to § 303.102(c)(1) is received by the appropriate FDIC office. The FDIC shall notify the FDIC-supervised institution submitting the notice of the date on which the notice is accepted for processing and of the date on which the 30-day notice period will expire. If processing cannot be completed with 30 days, the notificant will be advised in writing, prior to expiration of the 30-day period, of the reason for the delay in processing and of the additional time period, not to exceed 60 days, in which processing will be completed.


(b) *Commencement of service*—(1) *At expiration of period.* A proposed director or senior executive officer may begin service after the end of the 30-day period or any other additional period as provided under paragraph (a) of this section, unless the FDIC disapproves the notice before the end of the period.


(2) *Prior to expiration of the period.* A proposed director or senior executive officer may begin service before the end of the 30-day period or any additional time period as provided under paragraph (a) of this section, if the FDIC notifies the FDIC-supervised institution and the individual in writing of the FDIC's intention not to disapprove the notice.


(c) *Notice of disapproval.* The FDIC may disapprove a notice filed under § 303.102 if the FDIC finds that the competence, experience, character, or integrity of the individual with respect to whom the notice is submitted indicates that it would not be in the best interests of depositors of the FDIC-supervised institution or in the best interests of the public to permit the individual to be employed by, or associated with the FDIC-supervised institution. Subpart L of 12 CFR part 308 sets forth the rules of practice and procedure for a notice of disapproval.
