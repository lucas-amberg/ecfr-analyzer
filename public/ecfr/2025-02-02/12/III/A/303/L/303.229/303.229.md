# § 303.229   How an application is evaluated.

(a) *Criminal-history records.* In reviewing an application, the FDIC will—


(1) Primarily rely on the criminal history record provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (rap sheet); and


(2) Provide such record to the subject of the application to review for accuracy. The FDIC will make reasonable efforts to communicate with the subject of the application within 15 calendar days of receipt of this record from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to inform the individual that the FDIC will be providing them with a copy of the report and to verify the individual's contact information. The FDIC will make reasonable efforts to send the report to the individual within 5 business days of successful verification of the individual's contact information. If the individual believes that there are any inaccuracies in the report, the FDIC will direct the individual to an appropriate contact at the Federal Bureau of Investigation where the individual can seek corrections to the report.


(b) *Certified copies.* The FDIC will not require an applicant to provide certified copies of criminal history records unless the FDIC determines that there is a clear and compelling justification to require additional information to verify the accuracy of the criminal history record provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.


(c) *Ultimate determinations.* The ultimate determinations in assessing an application are whether the person has demonstrated their fitness to participate in the conduct of the affairs of an IDI, and whether the affiliation, ownership, control, or participation by the person in the conduct of the affairs of the institution may constitute a threat to the safety and soundness of the institution or the interests of its depositors or threaten to impair public confidence in the institution.


(d) *Individualized assessment.* When evaluating applications, the FDIC will conduct an individualized assessment that will consider:


(1) Whether the conviction or program entry is subject to section 19, and the specific nature and circumstances of the offense;


(2) Whether the participation directly or indirectly by the person in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the IDI constitutes a threat to the safety and soundness of the institution or the interests of its depositors or threatens to impair public confidence in the institution;


(3) Evidence of rehabilitation, including the person's age at the time of the conviction or program entry, the time that has elapsed since the conviction or program entry, and the relationship of the individual's offense to the responsibilities of the applicable position;


(4) The individual's employment history, letters of recommendation, certificates documenting participation in substance-abuse programs, successful participation in job preparation and educational programs, and other relevant evidence;


(5) The ability of management of the IDI to supervise and control the person's activities;


(6) The level of ownership or control the person will have of an IDI;


(7) The applicability of the IDI's fidelity bond coverage to the person; and


(8) Any additional factors in the specific case that appear relevant to the application or the individual including, but not limited to, the opinion or position of the primary Federal or State regulator.


(e) *No re-consideration of guilt.* The question of whether a person, who was convicted of a crime or who agreed to a program entry, was guilty of that crime will not be at issue in a proceeding under this subpart or under 12 CFR part 308, subpart M.


(f) *Factors considered for enumerated offenses.* The foregoing factors will also be applied by the FDIC to determine whether the interests of justice are served in seeking an exception in the appropriate court when an application is made to terminate the ten-year ban prior to its expiration date under 12 U.S.C. 1829(a)(2) for certain Federal offenses.


(g) *Mandatory conditions of approval.* All approvals and orders will be subject to the condition that the person be covered by a fidelity bond to the same extent as others in similar positions. If the FDIC has approved an application filed by an individual and has issued a consent order, the individual must disclose the presence of the conviction(s) or program entry(ies) to all IDIs in the affairs of which they wish to participate.


(h) *Institution-sponsored applications: work at same employer.* When deemed appropriate by the FDIC, institution-sponsored applications are to allow the individual to work for the same employer (without restrictions on the location) and across positions, except that the prior consent of the FDIC (which may require a new application) will be required for any proposed significant changes in the individual's security-related duties or responsibilities, such as promotion to an officer or other positions that the employer determines will require higher security screening credentials.


(i) *Work at a different employer after certain approvals.* In situations in which an approval has been granted for a person to participate in the affairs of a particular IDI and the person subsequently seeks to participate at another IDI, another application must be submitted and approved by the FDIC prior to the person participating in the affairs of the other IDI.
