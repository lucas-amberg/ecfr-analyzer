# ยง 313.22   Collection.

(a) The Director may collect a claim from a person by administrative offset of monies payable by the Government only after:


(1) Providing the debtor with due process required under this part; and


(2) Providing the paying agency with written certification that the debtor owes the debt in the amount stated and that the FDIC, as creditor agency, has complied with this part.


(b) Prior to initiating collection by administrative offset, the Director should determine that the proposed offset is within the scope of this remedy, as set forth in 31 CFR 901.3(a). Administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 may not be used to collect debts more than 10 years after the federal government's right to collect the debt first accrued, except as otherwise provided by law. In addition, administrative offset may not be used when a statute explicitly prohibits its use to collect the claim or type of claim involved.


(c) Unless otherwise provided, debts or payments not subject to administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 may be collected by administrative offset under common law, or any other applicable statutory authority.
