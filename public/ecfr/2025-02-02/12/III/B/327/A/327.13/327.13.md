# § 327.13   Special Assessment Pursuant to March 12, 2023, Systemic Risk Determination.

(a) *Special Assessment.* A special assessment shall be imposed on each insured depository institution to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, resulting from the March 12, 2023, systemic risk determination pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1823(c)(4)(G). The special assessment shall be collected from each insured depository institution on a quarterly basis as described in this section during the initial special assessment period as defined in paragraph (i) of this section and, if necessary, the extended special assessment period as defined in paragraph (j) of this section, and if further necessary, on a one-time basis as described in paragraph (m) of this section.


(b) *Losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund.* As used in this section, “losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund” refers to losses incurred by the Deposit Insurance Fund resulting from actions taken by the FDIC under the March 12, 2023, systemic risk determination, as may be revised from time to time.


(c) *Calculation of quarterly special assessment amount.* An insured depository institution's special assessment for each quarter during the initial special assessment period and extended special assessment period shall be calculated by multiplying the special assessment rate defined in paragraph (i)(2) or (j)(3) of this section, as appropriate, by the institution's special assessment base as defined in paragraph (i)(3) or (j)(4) of this section, as appropriate.


(d) *Invoicing of special assessment.* For each assessment period in which the special assessment is imposed, the FDIC shall advise each insured depository institution of the amount and calculation of any special assessment payment due in a form that notifies the institution of the special assessment base and special assessment rate exclusive of any other assessments imposed under this part. The FDIC shall also advise each insured depository institution subject to the special assessment of any revisions, if any, to losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. This information shall be provided at the same time as the institution's quarterly certified statement invoice under § 327.2 for the assessment period in which the special assessment was imposed.


(e) *Payment of quarterly special assessment amount.* Each insured depository institution shall pay to the Corporation any special assessment imposed under this section in compliance with and subject to the provisions of §§ 327.3, 327.6, and 327.7. The date for any special assessment payment shall be the date provided in § 327.3(b)(2) for the institution's quarterly certified statement invoice for the calendar quarter in which the special assessment was imposed.


(f) *Uninsured deposits.* For purposes of this section, the term “uninsured deposits” means an institution's estimated uninsured deposits as reported in Memoranda Item 2 on Schedule RC-O, Other Data For Deposit Insurance Assessments in the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report) or Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks (FFIEC 002) for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, reported as of the later of:


(1) November 2, 2023, adjusted for mergers prior to March 12, 2023; or


(2) The date of the institution's most recent amendment to its Call Report or FFIEC 002 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, if such amendment arises from, or is confirmed through, the FDIC's Assessment Reporting Review. Institutions with less than $1 billion in total assets as of June 30, 2021, were not required to report such items; therefore, for purposes of calculating the special assessment or a shortfall special assessment under this section, the amount of uninsured deposits for such institutions as of December 31, 2022, is zero.


(g) *$5 billion deduction from the special assessment base—institution's portion.* For purposes of this section, an institution's portion of the $5 billion deduction shall equal the ratio of the institution's uninsured deposits to the sum of the institution's uninsured deposits and the uninsured deposits of all of the institution's affiliated insured depository institutions, multiplied by $5 billion.


(h) *Affiliates.* For the purposes of this section, an affiliated insured depository institution is an insured depository institution that meets the definition of “affiliate” in section 3 of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1813(w)(6).


(i) *Special assessment during initial special assessment period*—(1) *Initial special assessment period.* The initial special assessment period shall begin with the first quarterly assessment period of 2024 and end the earlier of the last quarterly assessment period of 2025 or the first quarterly assessment period that the aggregate amount of special assessments collected under this section meets or exceeds the losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund, where amounts collected and losses are compared on a quarterly basis.


(2) *Special assessment rate during initial special assessment period.* The special assessment rate during the initial special assessment period is 3.36 basis points on a quarterly basis.


(3) *Special assessment base during initial special assessment period*—(i) The special assessment base for an insured depository institution during the initial special assessment period that has no affiliated insured depository institution shall equal:


(A) The institution's uninsured deposits; minus


(B) $5 billion; provided, however, that an institution's assessment base cannot be negative.


(ii) The special assessment base for an insured depository institution during the initial special assessment period that has one or more affiliated insured depository institutions shall equal:


(A) The institution's uninsured deposits; minus


(B) The institution's portion of the $5 billion deduction; provided, however, that an institution's special assessment base cannot be negative.


(j) *Special assessment during extended special assessment period*—(1) *Shortfall amount.* The shortfall amount is the amount of losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund, as reviewed and revised as of the last quarterly assessment period of 2025, that exceed the aggregate amount of special assessments collected during the initial special assessment period.


(2) *Extended special assessment period.* If there is a shortfall amount after the last quarterly assessment period of 2025, the special assessment period will be extended, with at least 30 day notice to insured depository institutions, to collect the shortfall amount. The length of the extended special assessment period shall be the minimum number of quarters required to recover the shortfall amount at a rate under paragraph (j)(3) of this section that is at or below 3.36 basis points per quarter.


(3) *Assessment rate during extended special assessment period.* The quarterly assessment rate during the extended special assessment period will be the shortfall amount, divided by the total amount of uninsured deposits, adjusted for mergers, consolidation, and termination of insurance as of the last quarterly assessment period of 2025, minus the $5 billion deduction for each insured depository institution or each institution's portion of the $5 billion deduction, divided by the minimum number of quarters that results in the quarterly rate being no greater than 3.36 basis points.


(4) *Assessment base during the extended special assessment period.* (i) The special assessment base for an insured depository institution during the extended special assessment period that has no affiliated insured depository institution shall equal:


(A) The institution's uninsured deposits; minus


(B) $5 billion; provided, however, that an institution's special assessment base cannot be negative.


(ii) The special assessment base for an insured depository institution during the extended special assessment period that has one or more affiliated insured depository institutions shall equal:


(A) The institution's uninsured deposits; minus


(B) The institution's portion of the $5 billion deduction, adjusted for termination of insurance as of the last assessment period of 2025; provided, however, that an institution's special assessment base cannot be negative.


(k) *Effect of mergers, consolidations, and other terminations of insurance on the special assessment*—(1) *Final quarterly certified invoice for acquired institution.* The surviving or resulting insured depository institution in a merger or consolidation shall be liable for any unpaid special assessment or one-time final shortfall special assessment outstanding at the time of the merger or consolidation on the part of the institution that is not the resulting or surviving institution consistent with § 327.6.


(2) *Special assessment for quarter in which the merger or consolidation occurs and subsequent quarters.* If an insured depository institution is the surviving or resulting institution in a merger or consolidation or acquires all or substantially all of the assets, or assumes all or substantially all of the deposit liabilities, of an insured depository institution, then the surviving or resulting insured depository institution or the insured depository institution that acquires such assets or assumes such deposit liabilities, shall be liable for the acquired institutions' special assessment from the quarter of the acquisition through the remainder of the initial and extended special assessment period, including any one-time final shortfall special assessment.


(3) *Other termination.* When the insured status of an institution is terminated, and the deposit liabilities of such institution are not assumed by another insured depository institution, the special assessment and any shortfall special assessment shall be paid consistent with § 327.6(c). When an insured depository institution voluntarily terminates its deposit insurance, the institution shall be liable for any unpaid special assessment or one-time final shortfall special assessment outstanding at the time of the termination and all future special assessments, if any, the institution would have been invoiced through the remainder of the initial or extended special assessment period, as applicable, including any one-time final shortfall special assessment for which the institution has been given notice before termination. Any special assessment or one-time final shortfall special assessment liabilities will be included, in full, on the final quarterly assessment invoice following voluntary termination.


(l) *Corrective reporting amendments*—(1) *Recalculation of quarterly special assessment amount.* Corrective amendments to an institution's uninsured deposits that arise from, or are confirmed through, the FDIC's Assessment Reporting Review will apply retroactively beginning the first quarterly collection period of the initial special assessment period. An institution's special assessment base and portion of the $5 billion deduction, along with the portion of the $5 billion deduction allocated to the institution's affiliated insured depository institutions, will be recalculated for prior collection quarters. Any overpayment or underpayment in prior collection quarters as a result of the recalculation will be invoiced as described in paragraph (l)(2) of this section.


(2) *Invoicing overpayment and underpayment.* Any underpayment of the special assessment by an institution as the result of corrective amendments to uninsured deposits will be included, in full and with interest, on the invoice for the quarter following the date a corrective amendment is filed. If a corrective amendment results in an overpayment of the special assessment, the institution will be credited the overpayment amount, with interest, and such amount will be applied to the institution's subsequent special assessment invoices beginning in the quarter following the date of the amendment. If any excess credit amount remains after the end of the initial and any extended special assessment period(s), the excess credit amount shall be refunded to the institution. Payment and collection of interest on amounts resulting from overpayment and underpayment of the special assessment shall be consistent with § 327.7.


(m) *One-time final shortfall special assessment.* If the aggregate amount of the special assessment collected during the initial and any extended special assessment period(s) do not meet or exceed the losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund, as calculated after the receiverships resulting from the March 12, 2023, systemic risk determination are terminated, insured depository institutions shall pay a one-time final shortfall special assessment in accordance with this paragraph.


(1) *Notification of one-time final shortfall special assessment.* The FDIC shall notify each insured depository institution of the amount of such institution's one-time final shortfall special assessment no later than 45 days before such shortfall assessment is due.


(2) *Aggregate one-time final shortfall special assessment amount.* The aggregate amount of the one-time final shortfall special assessment imposed across all insured depository institutions shall equal the losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund, as of termination of the receiverships to which the March 12, 2023, systemic risk determination applied, minus the aggregate amount of the special assessment collected under this section through initial and extended special assessment periods, including the net amount of interest paid or received as a result of overpayments and underpayments.


(3) *One-time final shortfall special assessment rate.* The final shortfall special assessment rate shall be the aggregate final shortfall special assessment amount divided by the total amount of uninsured deposits, as described in paragraph (f) of this section, adjusted for mergers, consolidation, and termination of insurance as of the assessment period preceding the final shortfall special assessment period, minus the $5 billion deduction for each insured depository institution or each institution's portion of the $5 billion deduction.


(4) *One-time final shortfall special assessment base*—(i) The one-time final shortfall special assessment base for an insured depository institution that has no affiliated insured depository institution shall equal:


(A) The institution's uninsured deposits; minus


(B) $5 billion; provided, however, that an institution's one-time final shortfall special assessment base cannot be negative.


(ii) The one-time final shortfall special assessment base for an insured depository institution that has one or more affiliated insured depository institutions shall equal:


(A) The institution's uninsured deposits; minus


(B) The institution's portion of the $5 billion deduction, adjusted for termination of insurance as of the assessment period preceding the final shortfall assessment period; provided, however, that an institution's one-time final shortfall special assessment base cannot be negative.


(5) *Calculation of one-time final shortfall special assessment.* An insured depository institution's final shortfall special assessment shall be calculated by multiplying the final shortfall special assessment rate by the institution's one-time final shortfall special assessment base.


(6) *One-time final special assessment.* The one-time final shortfall special assessment shall be collected on a one-time quarterly basis after losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund are determined after termination of the receiverships to which the March 12, 2023, systemic risk determination applied.


(7) *Payment, invoicing, and mergers.* Paragraphs (d), (e), and (k) of this section are applicable to the one-time shortfall special assessment.


(n) *Request for revisions.* An insured depository institution may submit a written request for revision of the computation of any special assessment or shortfall special assessment pursuant to this part consistent with § 327.3(f).


(o) *Special assessment collection in excess of losses.* Any special assessment collected under this section that exceeds the losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund, as of termination of the receiverships to which the March 12, 2023, systemic risk determination applied, shall be placed in the Deposit Insurance Fund.


(p) *Rule of construction.* Nothing in this section shall prevent the FDIC from imposing additional special assessments as required to recover current or future losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund resulting from any systemic risk determination under 12 U.S.C. 1823(c)(4)(G).
