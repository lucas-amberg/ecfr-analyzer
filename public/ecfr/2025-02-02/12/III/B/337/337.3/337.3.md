# § 337.3   Limits on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders of FDIC-supervised institutions.

(a) With the exception of 12 CFR 215.5(b) and (c)(3) and (4), FDIC-supervised institutions are subject to the restrictions contained in Federal Reserve Board Regulation O (12 CFR part 215) to the same extent and to the same manner as though they were member banks.


(b) For the purposes of compliance with § 215.4(b) of Federal Reserve Board Regulation O, no FDIC-supervised institution may extend credit or grant a line of credit to any of its executive officers, directors, or principal shareholders or to any related interest of any such person in an amount that, when aggregated with the amount of all other extensions of credit and lines of credit by the FDIC-supervised institution to that person and to all related interests of that person, exceeds the greater of $25,000 or five percent of the FDIC-supervised institution's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus,
1 or $500,000 unless:


(1) The extension of credit or line of credit has been approved in advance by a majority of the entire board of directors of that FDIC-supervised institution and


(2) The interested party has abstained from participating directly or indirectly in the voting.


(c)(1) No FDIC-supervised institution may extend credit in an aggregate amount greater than the amount permitted in paragraph (c)(2) of this section to a partnership in which one or more of the FDIC-supervised institution's executive officers are partners and, either individually or together, hold a majority interest. For the purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the total amount of credit extended by an FDIC-supervised institution to such partnership is considered to be extended to each executive officer of the FDIC-supervised institution who is a member of the partnership.


(2) An FDIC-supervised institution is authorized to extend credit to any executive officer of the bank for any other purpose not specified in § 215.5(c)(1) and (2) of Federal Reserve Board Regulation O (12 CFR 215.5(c)(1) and (2)) if the aggregate amount of such other extensions of credit does not exceed at any one time the higher of 2.5 percent of the FDIC-supervised institution's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus or $25,000 but in no event more than $100,000, provided, however, that no such extension of credit shall be subject to this limit if the extension of credit is secured by:


(i) A perfected security interest in bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness, or Treasury bills of the United States or in other such obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States;


(ii) Unconditional takeout commitments or guarantees of any department, agency, bureau, board, commission or establishment of the United States or any corporation wholly owned directly or indirectly by the United States; or


(iii) A perfected security interest in a segregated deposit account in the lending FDIC-supervised institution.


(3) For the purposes of this paragraph (c), the definitions of the terms used in Federal Reserve Board Regulation O shall apply including the exclusion of executive officers of an FDIC-supervised institution's parent bank or savings and loan holding company and executive officers of any other subsidiary of that bank or savings and loan holding company from the definition of executive officer for the purposes of complying with the loan restrictions contained in section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act. For the purposes of complying with § 215.5(d) of Federal Reserve Board Regulation O, the reference to “the amount specified for a category of credit in paragraph (c) of this section” shall be understood to refer to the amount specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this § 337.3.


(d) *Definition.* For purposes of this section, *FDIC-supervised institution* means an entity for which the FDIC is the appropriate Federal banking agency pursuant to section 3(q) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1813(q).
