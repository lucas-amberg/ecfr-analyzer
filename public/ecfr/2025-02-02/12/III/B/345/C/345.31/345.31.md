# ยง 345.31   Effect of CRA performance on applications.

(a) *CRA performance.* Among other factors, the FDIC takes into account the record of performance under the CRA of each applicant bank in considering an application for approval of:


(1) The establishment of a domestic branch or other facility with the ability to accept deposits;


(2) The relocation of the bank's main office or a branch;

The FDIC takes the description into account in considering the application and may deny or condition approval on that basis.

(d) *Denial or conditional approval of application.* A bank's record of performance may be the basis for denying or conditioning approval of an application listed in paragraph (a) of this section.
