(a) *In general.* The FDIC encourages communication between members of the public and banks, including through members of the public submitting written public comments regarding community credit needs and opportunities as well as a bank's record of helping to meet community credit needs. The FDIC will take these comments into account in connection with the bank's next scheduled CRA examination.


(b) *Submission of public comments.* Members of the public may submit public comments regarding community credit needs and a bank's CRA performance by submitting comments to the FDIC at *CRACommentCollector@fdic.gov* or to the address of the appropriate FDIC regional office found at *https://www.fdic.gov/resources/bankers/community-reinvestment-act/cra-regional-contacts-list.html*.


(c) *Timing of public comments.* If the FDIC receives a public comment before the close date of a bank's CRA examination, the public comment will be considered in connection with that CRA examination. If the FDIC receives a public comment after the close date of a bank's CRA examination, it will be considered in connection with the bank's subsequent CRA examination.


(d) *Distribution of public comments.* The FDIC will forward all public comments received regarding a bank's CRA performance to the bank.
