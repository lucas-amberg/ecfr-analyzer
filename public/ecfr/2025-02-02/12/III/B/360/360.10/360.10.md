# § 360.10   Resolution plans required for insured depository institutions with $100 billion or more in total assets; informational filings required for insured depository institutions with at least $50 billion but less than $100 billion in total assets.

(a) *Scope and purpose.* This section applies to insured depository institutions with $50 billion or more in total assets. It requires a covered insured depository institution with $100 billion or more in total assets (a group A CIDI, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) to submit a resolution plan that should enable the FDIC, as receiver, to resolve the institution under 12 U.S.C. 1821 and 1823 in a manner that provides depositors timely access to their insured deposits, maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of assets and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by the creditors in the resolution, and addresses risks of adverse effects on U.S. economic conditions or economic stability. Other covered insured depository institutions (group B CIDIs, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) are required under this section to submit to the FDIC an informational filing containing information relevant to the group B CIDI's resolution that will support the development of strategic options for resolution of the CIDI by the FDIC. This section also establishes the requirements regarding the submission of resolution plans and informational filings and their contents, as well as procedures for their review by the FDIC. This rule is intended to ensure that each group A CIDI develops a credible strategy to facilitate the FDIC's resolution of the institution across a range of possible scenarios and, with respect to each group A CIDI and each group B CIDI, the FDIC has access to all of the material information and analysis it needs to resolve efficiently the covered insured depository institution in the event of its failure.

That approval or delegation of express authority must be noted in the minutes of the board of directors.


(6) *Incorporation from other sources*—(i) *Sources.* A CIDI may incorporate information or analysis into the confidential section of its full resolution submission or its interim supplement from one or more of the following without seeking the authorization for disclosure of FDIC confidential information required under 12 CFR part 309:


(A) The most recent full resolution submission submitted by the CIDI or an affiliate of the CIDI.


(B) The most recent DFA resolution plan of a company that is a CIDI affiliate.


(C) Any other regulatory filing by the CIDI or a CIDI affiliate with the FDIC.


(ii) *Requirements for incorporation from other sources.* A CIDI may incorporate information from other sources only if:


(A) The full resolution submission seeking to incorporate information or analysis from other sources clearly indicates the source and as-of date of the information or analysis the CIDI is incorporating, and the information or analysis required by this section is readily distinguishable from any extraneous parent company (or parent company affiliate) information or analysis, with a description of any material differences.


(B) The CIDI certifies that the information or analysis the CIDI is incorporating from other sources remains accurate in all respects that are material to the CIDI's full resolution submission.


(d) *Content of the full resolution submissions for CIDIs.* Each group A CIDI must submit a resolution plan that includes all content specified in this paragraph (d). Each group B CIDI must submit an informational filing that includes the content specified in paragraphs (d)(4) through (9), (d)(10)(i) through (iii) and (vii) through (viii), (d)(11), and (d)(13) through (27) of this section, inclusive; a description of each material change since the submission of its prior informational filing or, where relevant, interim supplement (or affirmation that no such material change has occurred); and a discussion of the changes to the CIDI's previously submitted informational filing resulting from any change in law or regulation, guidance, or feedback from the FDIC, or material change.


(1) *Identified strategy.* (i) Each resolution plan must include an identified strategy for the resolution of the CIDI in the event of its failure that meets the credibility criteria in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.


(ii) A CIDI must utilize as its identified strategy the formation and stabilization of a bridge depository institution that continues operation through the completion of the resolution and exit from the bridge depository institution unless the CIDI determines and demonstrates in its resolution plan why another strategy:


(A) Would be more appropriate for the size, complexity, and risk profile of the CIDI;


(B) Reasonably could be executed by the FDIC across a range of likely failure scenarios; and


(C) Best addresses the credibility criteria described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.


(iii) The identified strategy must include meaningful optionality for execution across a range of scenarios. The exit from the bridge depository institution may be through a multiple acquirer exit, or any other exit strategy following the stabilization of the operations of the bridge depository institution. The identified strategy may not be based upon a sale or other disposition to one or more acquirers over resolution weekend.


(2) *Failure scenario.* For the identified strategy, the CIDI must use a failure scenario that demonstrates that the CIDI is experiencing material financial distress, such that the quality of the CIDI's asset base has deteriorated and high-quality liquid assets have been depleted or pledged in the stress period before failure due to high, unexpected outflows of deposits and increased liquidity requirements from counterparties that would impact the CIDI's ability to pay its obligations in the normal course of business before the FDIC's appointment as receiver. Though the immediate failure event may be liquidity-related and associated with a lack of market confidence in the financial condition of the CIDI before the final recognition of losses, the identified strategy must also consider the depletion of capital before and at the time of the appointment of the FDIC as receiver. The CIDI may not assume any regulatory waivers in connection with the actions proposed to be taken before or in resolution. To the extent that the CIDI assumes that DIF funding is used during the resolution by a bridge depository institution, it must demonstrate the capacity for such borrowing on a fully secured basis and the source of repayment. The identified strategy must take into account that failure of the CIDI will occur under severely adverse economic conditions developed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 5365(i)(1)(B), and must assume that the U.S. parent company (if any) is in resolution under 11 U.S.C. 101 *et seq.* or another applicable insolvency regime. The FDIC may provide a CIDI additional or alternative parameters for the failure scenario detailed in this paragraph (d)(2). The FDIC will endeavor to provide a CIDI notice of such additional or alternative parameters for the failure scenario at least one year before the applicable resolution plan is due. Any such additional or alternative parameters:


(i) May be applicable to all CIDIs or only specific individual CIDIs; and


(ii) May include additional conditions, such as different macroeconomic stress scenario information or assumptions with respect to the cause of failure. If the FDIC provides such additional or alternative parameters, the CIDI must use the additional or alternative parameters rather than the conditions specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, to the extent inconsistent with the conditions specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.


(3) *Executive summary.* A resolution plan must include an executive summary providing:


(i) A description of the key elements of the identified strategy;


(ii) An overview of the CIDI's core business lines and franchise components;


(iii) A description of each material change since the prior resolution plan addressing the changed element (or affirmation that no such material change has occurred);


(iv) A discussion of the changes to the CIDI's previously submitted resolution plan resulting from any change in law or regulation, guidance, or feedback from the FDIC, or material change; and


(v) A discussion of any actions taken by the CIDI since the submission of its prior resolution plan to further develop the quality or comprehensiveness of the information and analysis included in the resolution plan, including the identified strategy, or to improve its capabilities to develop and timely deliver that information and analysis.


(4) *Organizational structure: legal entities; core business lines; and branches.* A full resolution submission must:


(i) Identify and describe the CIDI's, the parent company's, and the parent company affiliates' legal and functional structures, including all material entities.


(ii) Identify and describe each of the CIDI's core business lines, including whether any core business line draws additional value from, or relies on the operations of, the parent company or a parent company affiliate, and identify any such operations that are cross-border. Provide information about the assets and annual revenue for each core business line, clearly identifying revenue to the CIDI.


(iii) Map franchise components to core business lines, and franchise components and core business lines to material entities and regulated subsidiaries.


(iv) Describe the CIDI's branch organization, both domestic and foreign, including the address and total domestic and foreign deposits of each branch.

(A) A broker or dealer that is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a *et seq.*);


(B) A registered investment adviser, properly registered by or on behalf of either the Securities and Exchange Commission or any State, with respect to the investment advisory activities of such investment adviser and activities incidental to such investment advisory activities;


(C) An investment company that is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 *et seq.*);


(D) An insurance company, with respect to insurance activities of the insurance company and activities incidental to such insurance activities, that is subject to supervision by a State insurance regulator;


(E) A legal entity that is subject to regulation by, or registration with, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, with respect to activities conducted as a futures commission merchant, commodity trading adviser, commodity pool, commodity pool operator, swap execution facility, swap data repository, swap dealer, major swap participant, and activities that are incidental to such commodities and swaps activities;


(F) A corporation organized under12 U.S.C. 611 *et seq.* or a corporation having an agreement or undertaking with the Federal Reserve Board under 12 U.S.C. 601 *et seq.;* or


(G) Any legal entity that is organized under the law of any jurisdiction other than the United States and that is authorized or supervised by a regulatory authority of such jurisdiction in a manner generally comparable to the U.S. legal entities and authorities described in paragraphs (d)(4)(v)(A) through (E) of this section, and includes any subsidiary that takes deposits or conducts the business of banking under the laws of such jurisdiction.


(vi) Identify all of the CIDI's subsidiaries, offices, and agencies with cross-border operations associated with the operations of any core business line or franchise component. For each such subsidiary, office, or agency, provide metrics that appropriately depict its size and significance, and the location of each such subsidiary, office, and agency.

(6) *Separation from parent; potential barriers or material obstacles to orderly resolution.* The full resolution submission must address the CIDI's ability to operate separately from the parent company's organization, and any impact on maintaining economic viability and preservation of franchise value in a bridge depository institution, with the assumption that the parent company and parent company affiliates are in resolution under 11 U.S.C. 101 *et seq.* or another applicable insolvency regime. The full resolution submission must describe the actions necessary to separate the CIDI and its subsidiaries from the organizational structure of its parent company in a cost-effective and timely fashion. The full resolution submission must identify potential barriers or other material obstacles to an orderly resolution of the CIDI that may occur upon the CIDI's separation from the parent company's organization, as well as risks to the identified strategy (if required), and inter-connections and inter-dependencies that may hinder the timely and effective resolution of the CIDI, and include the remediation steps or mitigating responses necessary to eliminate or minimize such barriers or obstacles.


(7) *Overall deposit activities.* A full resolution submission must:


(i) Describe the CIDI's overall deposit activities, including, insured and uninsured deposits, and particular deposit concentrations or other aspects of the deposit base or underlying systems that may create operational complexity for the FDIC.

Describe the CIDI's reporting capabilities on sweep deposits, including whether such reporting is automated and any data lag that affects the accuracy of such reports. If the CIDI receives significant amounts of deposits through such deposit sweep arrangements with the parent company or parent company affiliates, include a detailed discussion of such relationships and the business objectives of such deposit sweep arrangements.


(iv) Identify all omnibus, deposit sweep, and pass-through accounts, and identify the accountholder, the location of relevant contracts, and the system on which the accounts are maintained.

(v) Provide a report regarding the CIDI's depositors that hold or control the largest deposits (whether in one account or multiple accounts) that collectively are material to one or more business segments (“key depositors”). The report must identify key depositors by name and business segment and the amount of deposit of each key depositor, and for each key depositor must identify other services provided by the CIDI to that depositor, such as lending, wealth management, brokerage services, or custody services. The full resolution submission must describe the CIDI's approach to identifying these key depositors and must describe how long it would take the CIDI to generate such a report and the timeliness of the information provided.


(8) *Critical services.* A CIDI must be able to demonstrate capabilities necessary to ensure continuity of critical services in resolution. In order to support these capabilities, a full resolution submission must:


(i) Identify and describe the CIDI's critical services and critical services support, including whether they are provided, in whole or in part, by or through:

Describe the CIDI's approach for continuing critical services in the event of the CIDI's failure. Identify contracts for critical services that contain provisions that, upon the insolvency of the CIDI or the FDIC being appointed receiver of the CIDI, purport to permit the service provider to stop providing services, to alter pricing, or to alter other terms of service. Discuss potential obstacles to maintaining critical services that could occur in the event of the CIDI's failure and steps that could be taken to remediate or otherwise mitigate the risk of interruption, to include those critical services and critical services support provided by the parent company or a parent company affiliate and addressing:

For each material asset portfolio, describe how the assets within the portfolio are valued and how they are maintained on the books and records of the CIDI. Identify and discuss impediments to the sale of each material asset portfolio identified and provide a timeline for such sale.


(12) *Valuation to facilitate FDIC's assessment of least-costly resolution method.* A CIDI must be able to demonstrate the capabilities necessary to produce valuations needed in assessing the least-cost test. A resolution plan must:


(i) Provide a detailed description of the approaches the CIDI would employ for determining the values of the franchise components and the IDI franchise as a whole, including the underlying assumptions and rationale. Describe the CIDI's approach to the development of the information needed to support valuation analysis, including a description of the CIDI's current ability to produce updated projections, timely if necessary, to support the FDIC's analysis to determine whether a resolution strategy would be the least costly to the Deposit Insurance Fund in the event of failure.


(ii) Provide the following valuation analysis based upon the failure scenario assumed in the development of the identified strategy, with such adjustments to the scenario as may be necessary to demonstrate the analysis required under paragraph (d)(12)(ii)(B) of this section:


(A) Valuation estimates of the IDI franchise, and where a multiple acquirer exit strategy is incorporated in the identified strategy, a sum-of-the-parts analysis. In determining these valuation estimates, the CIDI must consider appropriate valuation approaches, such as the income-based approach, asset-based approach, and market-based approach. In deriving a range of estimates of value, the CIDI must assess and provide a reasoned quantitative or qualitative analysis in support of whether the conclusion of value should reflect the results of one valuation approach and method, or a combination of the results of more than one valuation approach and method; as appropriate, the resolution plan must discuss the relevance and weight given to the different valuation approaches and methods used.


(B) A qualitative analysis of the impact on franchise value that may result from not transferring any uninsured deposits to the bridge depository institution, including a narrative describing any options to mitigate franchise value destruction where there is not a transfer of all deposits to a bridge depository institution such as, an advance dividend payment to depositors that takes into account the expected loss to depositors, and the impact of such an advance dividend on depositor behavior and preservation of franchise value at different levels of loss. Such qualitative analysis should reflect reasonable assumptions of customer behavior based upon the CIDI's range of services provided to, and interconnections with, depositors.


(iii) Provide all content responsive to paragraph (d)(12)(ii) of this section as an appendix to the resolution plan, including any analysis of liquidity and deposit runoff assumptions and factors underlying such runoff estimates.

(ii) Describe the booking models for risk from derivative transactions, including whether customer-facing risk or other dealer-facing risk resides in the CIDI while the position risk hedging is performed by a parent company affiliate. Describe the CIDI's use of any “global risk book,” “remote bookings,” or “back-to-backs” booking model, identify the challenges these booking models present to the transfer or unwind of such related derivatives, and analyze approaches for addressing those challenges.


(iii) Describe how the CIDI uses qualified financial contracts to manage its hedging or liquidity needs, including specifying the hedged items (including underlying risk, cash flow, assets or liability being hedged) and the applicable core business line, as well as the approach used to mitigate such risks.


(iv) For each of paragraphs (d)(14)(i) through (iii) of this section, identify hedges that receive hedge accounting treatment, core business line-specific hedges, and reporting capabilities and practices for hedge accounting information and other end-user hedges.


(15) *Unconsolidated balance sheet; material entity and regulated subsidiary financial statements.* A full resolution submission must provide an unconsolidated balance sheet for the CIDI and a consolidating schedule for all material entities and regulated subsidiaries that are subject to consolidation with the CIDI.

For each such PCS service provider:


(i) Map those PCS service providers to the CIDI's legal entities, core business lines, and franchise components;


(ii) Describe the PCS services provided by such PCS service providers, including the value and volume of activities on a per-provider basis; and


(iii) Describe the CIDI's role as a PCS service provider that is material in terms of revenue to, or value of, any franchise component or core business line.


(17) *Capital structure; funding sources.* A full resolution submission must:

Describe the current capabilities of the CIDI to project and report its funding and liquidity needs (*e.g.,* next day, cumulative next five days, cumulative next 30 days).


(ii) Identify the composition of the liabilities of the CIDI including the types and amounts of short-term and long-term liabilities by type and term to maturity, secured and unsecured liabilities, and subordinated liabilities. Such information must include whether such liabilities are held by affiliates, whether they are publicly issued, their maturity, any call rights provided, and, where applicable, the identity of their indenture trustees.


(iii) Identify the material funding relationships and material inter-affiliate exposures between the CIDI and any CIDI subsidiary or foreign branch that is a material entity, including material inter-affiliate financial exposures, claims or liens, lending or borrowing lines and relationships, guaranties, deposits, and derivatives transactions.


(18) *Parent and parent company affiliate funding, transactions, accounts, exposures, and concentrations.* A full resolution submission must:

(19) *Economic effects of resolution.* A full resolution submission must identify any activities of the CIDI that provide a service or function that is material:


(i) To a geographic area or region of the United States;


(ii) To a business sector or product line in that geographic area or region, or nationally; or


(iii) To other financial institutions. The full resolution submission must include a discussion of mitigants to the potential impact of termination of those activities in the event of failure of the CIDI, including whether the activity is readily substitutable.

(27) *Any other material factor.* A full resolution submission must identify and discuss any other material factor that may impede the resolution of the CIDI.


(e) *Interim supplement.* Each CIDI must submit interim supplements containing current and accurate information regarding the specified full resolution submission content items in accordance with this paragraph (e).


(1) *Submission date.* (i) Each interim supplement must be submitted to the FDIC on or before the anniversary date (or first business day thereafter) of its most recent full resolution submission, or its most recent interim supplement, unless the CIDI has received written notice of a different date from the FDIC.


(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, with respect to all CIDIs, no interim supplement is required in the calendar year in which a full resolution submission is made and, with respect to a biennial filer, no interim supplement is required in the calendar year in which it submits a DFA resolution plan.


(2) *Content items for interim supplement.* Each CIDI must submit interim supplements that address each of the following content items:


(i) A description of all material changes resulting from an extraordinary event;


(ii) A description of each material change applicable to interim supplement content items since the submission of its prior full resolution submission (or affirmation that no such material change has occurred);


(iii) The content required under paragraph (d)(4) of this section;


(iv) From paragraph (d)(7) of this section, the content required under paragraph (d)(7)(i), the first sentence of paragraph (d)(7)(ii), the first sentence of paragraph (d)(7)(iii), the first sentence of paragraph (d)(7)(iv), and the first two sentences of paragraph (d)(7)(v) of this section;

(xiv) From paragraph (d)(22) of this section, the content required under paragraph (d)(22)(i) of this section; and


(xv) Any other content element expressly identified for the next interim supplement by the FDIC.


(f) *Credibility; review of full resolution submissions; engagement; capabilities testing*—(1) *Credibility criteria.* Each full resolution submission must be credible. The FDIC may, at its sole discretion, determine that the full resolution submission is not credible if:


(i) The identified strategy would not provide timely access to insured deposits, maximize value from the sale or disposition of assets, minimize any losses realized by creditors of the CIDI in resolution, and address potential risk of adverse effects on U.S. economic conditions or financial stability; or


(ii) The information and analysis in the full resolution submission is not supported with observable and verifiable capabilities and data and reasonable projections or the CIDI fails to comply in any material respect with the requirements of paragraph (d) or (e) of this section.


(2) *Resolution submission review and credibility determination.* The FDIC will review the full resolution submission in consultation with the appropriate Federal banking agency for the CIDI and its parent company. If, after consultation with the appropriate Federal banking agency for the CIDI, the FDIC determines that the full resolution submission of a CIDI is not credible pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the FDIC must notify the CIDI in writing of such determination. Any notice provided under this paragraph (f)(2) must include a description of the material weaknesses in the full resolution submission identified by the FDIC that resulted in the determination that the full resolution submission is not credible. A material weakness is an aspect of a CIDI's full resolution submission that individually or in conjunction with other aspects fails to meet the credibility criteria described in paragraph (f)(1).


(3) *Resubmission of a full resolution submission.* Within 90 days of receiving a notice issued by the FDIC pursuant to paragraph (f)(2) of this section that the full resolution submission is not credible based on identified material weaknesses, or such shorter or longer period as the FDIC may determine, a CIDI must submit a revised full resolution submission, or such other information or material specified by the FDIC, to the FDIC that addresses any material weaknesses identified by the FDIC and discusses in detail the revisions made to address such material weaknesses.


(4) *Failure regarding resubmission.* If the CIDI fails to submit the revised full resolution submission within the required time-period under paragraph (f)(3) of this section or the FDIC determines that the revised full resolution submission fails to address adequately the material weaknesses identified in the notice issued by the FDIC, the FDIC may take enforcement action against the CIDI in accordance with paragraph (j) of this section.


(5) *Significant findings.* The FDIC may also identify significant findings and other observations after review of a full resolution submission. A significant finding is a weakness or gap that raises questions about the credibility of a CIDI's full resolution submission but does not rise to the level of a material weakness. If a significant finding is not satisfactorily explained or addressed before or in the CIDI's next full resolution submission, it may be found to be a material weakness in the CIDI's next full resolution submission. The FDIC may require a project plan with identified milestones to assure that the significant finding is timely addressed. The FDIC may identify an aspect of a CIDI's full resolution submission as a material weakness even if such aspect was not identified as a significant finding in an earlier full resolution submission. The FDIC must notify the CIDI in writing of any significant findings that are identified in the full resolution submission.


(6) *Engagement.* Each CIDI must provide the FDIC such information and access to such personnel of the CIDI as the FDIC in its discretion determines is relevant to any of the provisions of this section (“engagement”). Personnel made available must have sufficient expertise and responsibility to address the informational and data requirements of the engagement. Engagement between the CIDI and the FDIC may be required at any time. This engagement may include the FDIC requiring the CIDI to provide information or data to support the content items required by paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, other information related to a group A CIDI's identified strategy, or, for any CIDI, other resolution options being considered by the FDIC. The FDIC will provide the CIDI with timely notification of the scope of any engagement before such engagement begins and will notify the CIDI on the conclusion of the engagement.


(7) *Capabilities testing.* At the discretion of the FDIC, the FDIC may require any CIDI to demonstrate the CIDI's capabilities described, or required to be described, in the full resolution submission, including the ability to provide the information, data and analysis underlying the full resolution submission (“capabilities testing”). The CIDI must perform such capabilities testing promptly, and provide the results in a time frame and format acceptable to the FDIC. Capabilities testing may be included in connection with full resolution submission review under paragraph (f)(2) of this section or any engagement under paragraph (f)(6) of this section. The FDIC will provide the CIDI with timely notification of the scope of any capabilities testing before such capabilities testing begins and will notify the CIDI on the conclusion of the capabilities testing.


(g) *No limiting effect on FDIC.* No full resolution submission or interim supplement provided pursuant to this section will be binding on the FDIC as supervisor, deposit insurer, or receiver for a CIDI or otherwise require the FDIC to act in conformance with such full resolution submission or interim supplement.


(1) *Financial information.* The full resolution submission or interim supplement must, to the greatest extent possible, use financial information as of the most recent fiscal year-end for which the CIDI has financial statements or, if the use of financial information as of a more recent date as of which the CIDI has financial statements would more accurately reflect the operations of the CIDI on the date of the submission, financial information as of that more recent date.


(2) *Indexing of information and analysis to full resolution submission and interim supplement content requirements.* A full resolution submission or interim supplement must include an index of each content requirement in paragraph (d) or (e)(2) of this section, as applicable, required to be included in that full resolution submission or interim supplement, as applicable, to every instance of its location in the full resolution submission, or interim supplement, as applicable.


(3) *Combined full resolution submission or interim supplements by affiliated CIDIs.* CIDIs that are affiliates may submit a single, combined full resolution submission or interim supplement, but only if all affiliated CIDIs submitting the combined full resolution submission or interim supplement are within the same CIDI group, whether group A or group B. The combined full resolution submission or interim supplement must satisfy the content requirements for each CIDI's full resolution submission or interim supplement, as applicable, and the FDIC must be able to readily identify the portions of a combined full resolution submission or interim supplement that comprise each CIDI's full resolution submission or interim supplement.


(h) *Form of full resolution submissions; confidential treatment of full resolution submissions and interim supplements.* (1) Each full resolution submission must be divided into a Public Section and a Confidential Section. Each CIDI must segregate and separately identify the Public Section from the Confidential Section. The Public Section must consist of a summary overview of the full resolution submission that describes the business of the CIDI. For each CIDI, the Public Section must include, to the extent material to the CIDI's full resolution submission:


(i) The names of material entities;


(ii) A description of core business lines;


(iii) Consolidated financial information regarding assets, liabilities, capital and major funding sources;


(iv) A description of derivative activities and hedging activities;


(v) A list of PCS service providers;


(vi) A description of foreign operations;


(vii) The identities of material supervisory authorities;


(viii) The identities of the principal officers;


(ix) A description of the corporate governance structure and processes related to resolution planning;


(x) A description of material management information systems; and


(xi) For group A CIDIs only, a description, at a high level, of the CIDI's identified strategy.


(2) The confidentiality of full resolution submissions and interim supplements must be determined in accordance with applicable exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)) and the FDIC's Disclosure of Information Rules (12 CFR part 309).


(3) Any CIDI submitting a full resolution submission, interim supplement, or related materials pursuant to this section that desires confidential treatment of the information submitted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) and 12 CFR part 309 and related policies may file a request for confidential treatment in accordance with those rules.


(4) To the extent permitted by law, information comprising the Confidential Section of a full resolution submission and the information comprising an interim supplement will be treated as confidential.


(5) To the extent permitted by law, the submission of any non-publicly available data or information under this section will not constitute a waiver of, or otherwise affect, any privilege arising under Federal or State law (including the rules of any Federal or State court) to which the data or information is otherwise subject. Privileges that apply to full resolution submissions and related materials are protected pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1828(x).


(i) *Extensions and exemptions*—(1) *Extension.* Notwithstanding the general requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, on a case-by-case basis, the FDIC may extend, on its own initiative or upon written request, any time frame or deadline of this section.


(2) *Waiver.* The FDIC may, on its own initiative or upon written request, exempt a CIDI from one or more of the requirements of this section.


(j) *Enforcement.* Violating any provision of this section constitutes a violation of a regulation and may subject the CIDI to enforcement actions under 12 U.S.C. 1818, including paragraph (t) thereunder.
