# ยง 367.8   Causes for suspension.

(a) Suspension may be imposed under the procedures set forth in this section upon adequate evidence: 


(1) Of suspension by another federal agency; 


(2) That a cause for exclusion under ยง 367.6 may exist; 


(3) Of the commission of any other offense indicating a breach of trust, dishonesty, or lack of integrity that seriously and directly affects the minimum ethical standards required of an FDIC contractor; or 


(4) Of any other cause so serious or compelling in nature that it adversely affects the ability of a contractor to meet the minimal ethical standards required by 12 CFR part 366. 


(b) Indictment for any offense described in ยง 367.6 is adequate evidence to suspend a contractor. 


(c) In assessing the adequacy of the evidence, FDIC will consider how much information is available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result.
