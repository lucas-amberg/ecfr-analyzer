(a) *In general.* If the FDIC determines that a bank is not reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank in the host state, and that the bank's statewide loan-to-deposit ratio is less than 50 percent of the host state loan-to-deposit ratio, the FDIC: 


(1) May order that a bank's covered interstate branch or branches be closed unless the bank provides reasonable assurances to the satisfaction of the FDIC, after an opportunity for public comment, that the bank has an acceptable plan under which the bank will reasonably help to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank in the host state; and 


(2) Will not permit the bank to open a new branch in the host state that would be considered to be a covered interstate branch unless the bank provides reasonable assurances to the satisfaction of the FDIC, after an opportunity for public comment, that the bank will reasonably help to meet the credit needs of the community that the new branch will serve. 


(b) *Notice prior to closure of a covered interstate branch.* Before exercising the FDIC's authority to order the bank to close a covered interstate branch, the FDIC will issue to the bank a notice of the FDIC's intent to order the closure and will schedule a hearing within 60 days of issuing the notice. 


(c) *Hearing.* The FDIC will conduct a hearing scheduled under paragraph (b) of this section in accordance with the provisions of 12 U.S.C. 1818(h) and 12 CFR part 308.
