# § 380.14   Record retention requirements.

(a) *Scope.* 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(16)(D) requires that the Corporation establish retention schedules for the maintenance of certain documents and records of a covered financial company for which the Corporation has been appointed receiver and certain documents and records generated by the Corporation as receiver for a covered financial company in connection with the exercise of its authorities under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, 12 U.S.C. 5381 through 5397. This section addresses retention of those two categories of documents and records.


(b) *Definitions.* For the purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings:


(1) *Documentary material.* The term *documentary material* means any reasonably accessible document, book, paper, map, photograph, microfiche, microfilm, or writing regardless of physical form or characteristics and includes any computer or electronically-created data or file.


(2) *Inherited record.* The term *inherited record* means documentary material of a covered financial company, provided that such documentary material existed on the date of the appointment of the Corporation as receiver for such covered financial company and was generated or maintained by the covered financial company in the course of, and necessary to, the transaction of its business. The determination of whether documentary material was generated or maintained by the covered financial company in the course of, and necessary to, the transaction of its business shall be based on an analysis of the following factors;


(i) Whether such documentary material was generated or maintained in accordance with the covered financial company's own practices and procedures (including the document retention policies of the covered financial company) or pursuant to standards established by the covered financial company's regulators;


(ii) Whether such documentary material is necessary for the Corporation to carry out its obligations as receiver for the covered financial company; and


(iii) Whether there is a present or reasonably foreseeable evidentiary need for such documentary material by the Corporation as receiver for the covered financial company or the public.


(3) *Receivership record.* The term *receivership record* means documentary material generated or maintained by the Corporation in accordance with the policies and procedures of the Corporation (including the document retention policies of the Corporation) that relates to the Corporation's appointment as receiver for a covered financial company or the exercise of its authorities as receiver for the covered financial company under 12 U.S.C. 5381 through 5397.


(c) *Inherited records*—(1) *Retention schedule for inherited records.* The Corporation shall retain any inherited record of a covered financial company that was created fewer than ten years before the date of the appointment of the Corporation as receiver for the covered financial company for a period of no less than six years from the date of such appointment, provided however that an inherited record shall be retained indefinitely so long as it is:


(i) Subject to a litigation hold imposed by the Corporation;


(ii) Subject to a Congressional subpoena or relates to an ongoing investigation by Congress, the United States Government Accountability Office, or the Corporation's Inspector General; or


(iii) An inherited record that the Corporation has determined is necessary for a present or reasonably foreseeable future evidentiary need of the Corporation or the public.


(2) *Examples.* Examples of inherited records include, without limitation: Correspondence; tax forms, accounting forms, and related work papers; internal audits; inventories; board of directors or committee meeting minutes; personnel files and employee benefits information; general ledger and financial reports; financial data; litigation files; loan documents including records relating to intercompany debt; contracts and agreements to which the covered financial company was a party; customer accounts and transactions; qualified financial contracts and related information; and reports or other records of subsidiaries or affiliates of the covered financial company that were provided to the covered financial company.


(3) *Transfer of an inherited record to an acquirer of assets or liabilities of a covered financial company.* If the Corporation transfers an inherited record of a covered financial company to a third party (including a bridge financial company) in connection with the acquisition of assets or liabilities of the covered financial company by such third party, the record retention requirements of 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(16)(D) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be satisfied if the third party agrees, in writing, that:


(i) It will maintain the inherited record for at least six years from the date of the appointment of the Corporation as receiver for the covered financial company unless otherwise notified in writing by the Corporation; and


(ii) Prior to destruction of such inherited record it will provide the Corporation with notice and the opportunity to cause the inherited record to be returned to the Corporation.


(d) *Receivership records*—(1) *Retention schedule for receivership records.* (i) A receivership record shall be retained indefinitely to the extent that there is a present or reasonably foreseeable future evidentiary or historical need for such receivership record.


(ii) A receivership record that is subject to a litigation hold imposed by the Corporation, is subject to a Congressional subpoena, or relates to an ongoing investigation by Congress, the United States Government Accountability Office, or the Corporation's Office of Inspector General shall be retained pursuant to the conditions of such hold, subpoena, or investigation.


(iii) In no event shall a receivership record be retained by the Corporation for a period of less than six years following the termination of the receivership to which it relates.


(2) *Not included in receivership records.* Receivership records do not include inherited records.


(3) *Examples.* Examples of receivership records include, without limitation: Correspondence; tax forms, accounting forms and related work papers; inventories; contracts and other information relating to the management and disposition of the assets of the covered financial company; documentary material relating to the appointment of the Corporation as receiver; administrative records and other information relating to administrative proceedings; pleadings and similar documents in civil litigation, criminal restitution, forfeiture litigation, and all other litigation matters in which the Corporation as receiver is a party; the charter and formation documents of a bridge financial company; contracts, other documents, and information relating to the role of the Corporation as receiver in overseeing the operations of the bridge financial company; reports or other records of the bridge financial company and its subsidiaries or affiliates that were provided to the Corporation as receiver; and documentary material relating to the administration, determination, and payment of claims by the Corporation as receiver.

(1) *Impact on discoverability, admissibility, or release; compliance with court orders.* The Corporation's determination that documentary material must be maintained pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 5390(a)(16)(D) and this section shall not bear on the discoverability or admissibility of such documentary material in any court, tribunal, or other adjudicative proceeding nor on whether such documentary material is subject to release under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, or any other law. The Corporation shall comply with any applicable court order concerning mandatory retention or destruction of any documentary material subject to this section.
