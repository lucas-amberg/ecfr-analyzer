# § 602.5   FCA response to requests for records.

(a) *Response time.* Within 20 business days of receiving your request, the FOIA Officer will tell you whether we have granted or denied it. If you send your request to the wrong address, the 20-day response time will not begin until the FOIA Officer receives your request.


(b) *Extension of response time.* In “unusual circumstances,” the FOIA Officer may extend the 20-day response time for up to 10 more business days by telling you in writing why we need more time and the date we will mail you our response. As used in this subpart, “unusual circumstances” means our need to:


(1) Search for and get the requested records from field offices or other locations;


(2) Search for, get, and review many records identified in a single request;


(3) Consult with another Federal agency having a substantial interest in the request; or


(4) Consult with two or more FCA offices having a substantial interest in the request.


(c) *Referrals.* If you ask for records we have that another Federal agency originated, we will refer the request to the originating agency and tell you about the referral. If you should have sent your request to another Federal agency, we will refer the request to that agency and so advise you.
