# ยง 602.7   Confidential business information.

(a) *FCA disclosure.* FCA may disclose business information from a business submitter only under this section. This section will not apply if:


(1) We decide the business submitter has no valid basis to object to disclosure;


(2) The information has been published lawfully or made available to the public; or


(3) Law (other than the FOIA) requires disclosure of the information.


(b) *Notice by FCA.* When we receive a request for confidential business information, the FOIA Officer will promptly tell the requester and the business submitter in writing that the responsive records may be free from disclosure under the FOIA. We will give the business submitter a reasonable time to object to the proposed disclosure of the responsive records and tell the requester whenever:


(1) The business submitter has in good faith labeled the information a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. We will provide such notice for 10 years after receiving the information unless the business submitter justifies the need for a longer period; or


(2) We believe that disclosing the information may result in commercial or financial injury to the business submitter.


(c) *Objection to release.* A business submitter who objects to our releasing the requested information should tell us in writing why the information is a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential.


(d) *FCA response.* (1) We will consider carefully a business submitter's objections. If we decide to disclose business information over the submitter's objection, the FOIA Officer will explain to the submitter in writing why we disagreed with the submitter's objection and describe the business information to be disclosed.


(2) We will tell the requester and the submitter the proposed disclosure date at the same time.


(3) If a submitter sues to prevent release, we will promptly tell the requester and will not disclose the business information until after the court's decision.


(4) If a requester sues to compel disclosure, we will promptly tell the business submitter.
