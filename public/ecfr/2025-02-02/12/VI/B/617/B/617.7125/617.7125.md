# ยง 617.7125   How should a qualified lender determine the effective interest rate?

(a) A qualified lender must calculate the effective interest rate on a loan using the discounted cash flow method showing the effect of the time value of money.


(b) For all loans, the cash flow stream used for calculating the effective interest rate of a loan must include:


(1) Principal and interest;


(2) The cost of stock or participation certificates that a borrower is required to purchase in connection with the loan; and


(3) Loan origination charges described in ยง 617.7115.


(c) A qualified lender must establish policies and procedures for EIR disclosures that clearly show the effect of the cost of borrower stock (or participation certificates) and loan origination charges on the interest rate of a loan. A qualified lender must also establish policies and procedures for determining major assumptions used in calculating the effective interest rate, *e.g.,* criteria on how the cost of borrower stock (or participation certificates) and loan origination charges are assigned or allocated among multiple loans obtained by a borrower simultaneously.
