# ยง 622.5   Answer.

(a) *Answer is required.* Unless a different period is specified by the Board, a party who does not wish to consent to a final order must file an answer within 20 days after being served with a notice that commences the proceeding. Any subsequent notice which contains amended allegations and by its terms requires an answer must similarly be answered within 20 days after service.


(b) *Requirements of answer; effect of failure to deny.* An answer filed under this section shall concisely state any defenses and specifically admit or deny each allegation in the notice. A party who lacks information or knowledge sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of any particular allegation shall so state and this shall have the effect of a denial. Any allegation not denied shall be deemed to be admitted. A party who intends in good faith to deny only a part of or to qualify an allegation shall specify so much of it as is true and shall deny only the remainder.


(c) *Admitted allegations.* If a party filing an answer under this section elects not to contest any of the allegations of fact set forth in the notice, the answer shall consist of a statement admitting all of the allegations to be true. Such answer constitutes a waiver of hearing as to the facts alleged in the notice, and together with the notice will provide a record basis on which the presiding officer shall file with the Board a recommended decision in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 557. The recommended decision shall be served on the party, who may file exceptions thereto within the time provided in ยง 622.13.


(d) *Effect of failure to answer.* Failure of a party to file an answer required by this section within the time provided constitutes a waiver of the party's right to appear and contest the allegations in the notice and authorizes the presiding officer, without further notice to the party, to find the facts to be as alleged in the notice and to file with the Board a recommended decision containing such findings and appropriate conclusions. The Board or the presiding officer may, for good cause shown, permit the filing of a delayed answer after the time for filing and the answer has expired.
