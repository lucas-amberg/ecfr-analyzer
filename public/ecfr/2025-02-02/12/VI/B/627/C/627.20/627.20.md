# § 627.20   FCSIC as receiver.

(a) *Appointment.* (1) The Farm Credit Administration Board may exercise its authority under section 4.12(b) of the Act and § 627.3 to appoint FCSIC as the receiver of a Farm Credit institution upon finding that one or more of the grounds identified in § 627.3(b) exists. The Farm Credit Administration Board may appoint, *ex parte* and without notice, FCSIC as receiver for any Farm Credit institution.


(2) Upon appointing FCSIC as the receiver of an institution, the Chairman of the Farm Credit Administration shall immediately notify such institution and, in the case of an association, its funding bank. The Farm Credit Administration will immediately publish notice of the appointment of the receiver in the _Federal Register_.


(b) *Funding bank role for association in liquidation.* In the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation of an association, the funding bank must institute appropriate measures to minimize the adverse effect of the liquidation on those borrowers whose loans are purchased by, or otherwise transferred to another System institution.


(c) *Receivership.* (1) Once the Farm Credit Administration Board issues the order placing a Farm Credit institution in receivership, all rights, privileges, and powers of its members, the board of directors, officers, and employees, are transferred to and vested exclusively in FCSIC as receiver, except that the institution's board of directors retains authority to initiate an action in a Federal district court to remove the receiver pursuant to § 627.4.


(2) The Farm Credit Administration Board simultaneously will cancel the charter of the institution when it appoints FCSIC as receiver.


(d) *Uninsured accounts.* Once the Farm Credit Administration Board has placed an institution into receivership, FCSIC, in accordance with section 4.37 of the Act will, as soon as practicable, notify every borrower who holds an uninsured voluntary or involuntary account, as described in § 614.4175 of this subchapter, at the institution that:


(1) Such accounts ceased earning interest from the date the Farm Credit Administration Board placed the institution into receivership; and


(2) FCSIC, as receiver, will immediately apply the funds in a borrower's uninsured account(s) as payment against the outstanding balance of the borrower's loan(s).


(e) *Final discharge and release of the receiver.* The receivership terminates after FCSIC makes a final distribution of the assets of the liquidated institution. Then, the Farm Credit Administration Board will completely and finally release and discharge the receiver.
