# § 702.207   Consideration of Subordinated Debt and Grandfathered Secondary Capital for new credit unions.

(a) *Exception from prompt corrective action for new credit unions.* The requirements of §§ 702.204 and 702.205 do not apply to a new credit union if, as of the applicable date of determination, each of the following conditions is satisfied:


(1) The new credit union has outstanding Subordinated Debt or Grandfathered Secondary Capital;


(2) The Subordinated Debt or Grandfathered Secondary Capital would be treated as Regulatory Capital under subpart D of this part if the new credit union were a complex credit union or a low income-designated credit union;


(3) The ratio of the new credit union's net worth (including the amount of its Subordinated Debt and Grandfathered Secondary Capital treated as Regulatory Capital (as defined in subpart D of this part)) to its total assets is at least seven percent (7%); and


(4) The new credit union's net worth is increasing in a manner consistent with the new credit union's approved initial business plan or RBP.


(b) *Consideration of Subordinated Debt and Grandfathered Secondary Capital in evaluating an RBP.* The NCUA shall, in evaluating an RBP under this subpart, consider a new credit union's aggregate outstanding principal amount of Subordinated Debt and Grandfathered Secondary Capital.


(c) *Prompt corrective action based on other supervisory criteria*—(1) *Application of prompt corrective action to an exempt new credit union.* The NCUA Board may apply prompt corrective action to a new credit union that is otherwise exempt under paragraph (a) of this section in the following circumstances:


(i) *Unsafe or unsound condition.* The NCUA Board has determined, after providing the new credit union with written notice and opportunity for hearing pursuant to § 747.2003 of this chapter, that the new credit union is in an unsafe or unsound condition; or


(ii) *Unsafe or unsound practice.* The NCUA Board has determined, after providing the new credit union with written notice and opportunity for hearing pursuant to § 747.2003 of this chapter, that the new credit union has not corrected a material unsafe or unsound practice of which it was, or should have been, aware.


(2) *Non-delegation.* The NCUA Board may not delegate its authority under paragraph (c) of this section.


(3) *Consultation with state officials.* The NCUA Board shall consult and seek to work cooperatively with the appropriate state official before taking action under paragraph (c) of this section and shall promptly notify the appropriate state official of its decision to take action under paragraph (c) of this section.


(d) *Discretionary liquidation.* Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the NCUA may place a new credit union into liquidation pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1787(a)(3)(A), provided that the new credit union's ratio under paragraph (a)(3) of this section is, as of the applicable date of determination, below six percent (6%) and the new credit union has no reasonable prospect of becoming “adequately capitalized” under § 702.202.


(e) *Restrictions on payments on Subordinated Debt.* Beginning 60 days after the effective date of a new credit union being classified by the NCUA as “uncapitalized”, the new credit union shall not pay principal of or interest on its Subordinated Debt, except that unpaid interest shall continue to accrue under the terms of the related Subordinated Debt Note, to the extent permitted by law.
