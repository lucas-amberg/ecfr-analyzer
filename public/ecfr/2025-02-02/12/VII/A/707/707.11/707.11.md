# § 707.11   Additional disclosure requirements for overdraft services.

(a) *Disclosure of total fees on periodic statements*—(1) *General.* A credit union must separately disclose on each periodic statement, as applicable:


(i) The total dollar amount for all fees or charges imposed on the account for paying checks or other items when there are insufficient or unavailable funds and the account becomes overdrawn, using the term “Total Overdraft Fees;” and


(ii) The total dollar amount for all fees or charges imposed on the account for returning items unpaid.


(2) *Totals required.* The disclosures required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be provided for the statement period and for the calendar year-to-date.


(3) *Format requirements.* The aggregate fee disclosures required by paragraph (a) of this section must be disclosed in close proximity to fees identified under § 707.6(a)(3), using a format substantially similar to Sample Form B-10 in appendix B.


(b) *Advertising disclosures for overdraft services*—(1) *Disclosures.* Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2),(b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section, any advertisement promoting the payment of overdrafts must disclose in a clear and conspicuous manner:


(i) The fee or fees for the payment of each overdraft;


(ii) The categories of transactions for which a fee for paying an overdraft may be imposed;


(iii) The time period by which the member must repay or cover any overdraft; and


(iv) The circumstances under which the credit union will not pay an overdraft.


(2) *Communications about the payment of overdrafts not subject to additional advertising disclosures.* Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply to:


(i) An advertisement promoting a service where the credit union's payment of overdrafts will be agreed upon in writing and subject to part 1026 of this title (Regulation Z);


(ii) A communication by a credit union about the payment of overdrafts in response to a member-initiated inquiry about share accounts or overdrafts. Providing information about the payment of overdrafts in response to a balance inquiry made through an automated system, such as a telephone response machine, ATM, or a credit union's Internet site, is not a response to a member-initiated inquiry for purposes of this paragraph;


(iii) An advertisement made through broadcast or electronic media, such as television or radio;


(iv) An advertisement made on outdoor media, such as billboards;


(v) An ATM receipt;


(vi) An in-person discussion with a member;


(vii) Disclosures required by Federal or other applicable law;


(viii) Information included on a periodic statement or a notice informing a member about a specific overdrawn item or the amount the account is overdrawn;


(ix) A term in a share account agreement discussing the credit union's right to pay overdrafts;


(x) A notice provided to a member, such as at an ATM, that completing a requested transaction may trigger a fee for overdrawing an account, or a general notice that items overdrawing an account may trigger a fee;


(xi) Informational or educational materials concerning the payment of overdrafts if the materials do not specifically describe the credit union's overdraft service; or


(xii) An opt-out or opt-in notice regarding the credit union's payment of overdrafts or provision of discretionary overdraft services.


(3) *Exception for ATM screens and telephone response machines.* The disclosures described in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(iv) of this section are not required in connection with any advertisement made on an ATM screen or using a telephone response machine.


(4) *Exception for indoor signs.* Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply to advertisements for the payment of overdrafts on indoor signs as described by § 707.8(e)(2) of this part, provided that the sign contains a clear and conspicuous statement that fees may apply and that members should contact an employee for further information about applicable fees and terms. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4), an indoor sign does not include an ATM screen.


(c) *Disclosure of account balances.* If a credit union discloses balance information to a member through an automated system, the balance may not include additional amounts that the credit union may provide to cover an item when there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the member's account, whether under a service provided in its discretion, a service subject to part 1026 of this title (Regulation Z), or a service to transfer funds from another member account. The credit union may, at its option, disclose additional account balances that include such additional amounts, if the credit union prominently states that any such balance includes such additional amounts and, if applicable, that additional amounts are not available for all transactions.
