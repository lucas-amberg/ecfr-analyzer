# ยง 708b.105   Approval of merger proposal by the NCUA.

(a) In any case where the continuing credit union is federally insured and the merging credit union is non-federally insured or uninsured, the NCUA will determine the potential risk to the NCUSIF.


(b) If the NCUA finds that the merger proposal complies with the provisions of this part and does not present an undue risk to the NCUSIF, it may approve the proposal subject to any other specific requirements as it may prescribe to fulfill the intended purposes of the proposed merger. For mergers of federal credit unions into federally insured credit unions, if the NCUA determines that the merging credit union is in danger of insolvency and that the proposed merger would reduce the risk or avoid a threatened loss to the NCUSIF, the NCUA may permit the merger to become effective without an affirmative vote of the membership of the merging credit union otherwise required by ยง 708b.106 of this part.


(c) NCUA may approve any proposed charter amendments for a continuing federal credit union contingent upon the completion of the merger. All charter amendments must be consistent with NCUA chartering policy.
