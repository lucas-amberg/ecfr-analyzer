# ยง 711.1   Authority, purpose, and scope.

(a) *Authority.* This part is issued under the provisions of the Depository Institution Management Interlocks Act (Interlocks Act) (12 U.S.C. 3201 *et seq*). 


(b) *Purpose.* The purpose of the Interlocks Act and this part is to foster competition by generally prohibiting a management official from serving two nonaffiliated depository organizations in situations where the management interlock likely would have an anticompetitive effect. 


(c) *Scope.* This part applies to management officials of federally insured credit unions. Section 711.4(c) exempts a management official of a credit union from the prohibitions of the Interlocks Act when the individual serves as a management official of another credit union. Therefore, the Interlocks Act prohibitions contained in this part only apply to a management official of a credit union when that individual also serves as a management official of another type of depository organization (usually a bank or thrift).
