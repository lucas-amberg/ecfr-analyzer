(b) *Methods.* Any of the following methods may be used to verify members' passbooks and accounts, as appropriate:


(1) *Controlled verification.* A controlled verification of 100 percent of members' share and loan accounts;

(v) Additional procedures to be performed if evidence provided by confirmations alone is not sufficient.


(3) *Non-statistical method.* When the verification is performed by an Independent person licensed by the State or jurisdiction in which the credit union is principally located, the auditor may choose among the sampling methods set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section and non-statistical sampling methods consistent with GAAS if such methods provide for:


(i) Sufficient accounts in both number and scope on which to base conclusions concerning management's financial reporting objectives to provide assurance that the General Ledger accounts are fairly stated in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole;

(iii) Documentation of the sampling procedures used and of their consistency with GAAS (to be provided to the NCUA Board upon request).
