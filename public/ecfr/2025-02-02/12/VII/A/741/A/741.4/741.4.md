*Board* means the NCUA Board or any individual or group of individuals with the delegated authority to act on behalf of the Board to implement the requirements of this section.


*Equity ratio* means the ratio of:


(i) The amount determined by subtracting—

*Insured shares* means the total amount of a federally insured credit union's share, share draft and share certificate accounts, or their equivalent under state law (which may include deposit accounts), authorized to be issued to members, other credit unions, public units, or nonmembers (where permitted under the Act or equivalent state law), but does not include amounts in excess of insurance coverage as provided in part 745 of this chapter.


*Modified premium/distribution ratio* means one minus the premium/distribution ratio.


*National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund* or *NCUSIF* refers to a revolving fund established by Congress within the U.S. Treasury to provide federal share insurance coverage to federally insured credit union members and to offset the NCUA's administrative expenses associated with the conservatorship and liquidation of federally insured credit unions.

For credit unions with total assets of less than $50,000,000, insured shares will be measured and adjusted annually based on the insured shares reported in the credit union's 5300 report for December 31 of each year. For credit unions with total assets of $50,000,000 or more, insured shares will be measured and adjusted semiannually based on the insured shares reported in the credit union's 5300 reports for December 31 and June 30 of each year.


(d) *Insurance premium charges*—(1) *In general.* Each insured credit union will pay to the NCUSIF, on dates the NCUA Board determines, but not more than twice in any calendar year, an insurance premium in an amount stated as a percentage of insured shares, which will be the same percentage for all insured credit unions.


(2) *Relation of premium charge to equity ratio of NCUSIF.* (i) The NCUA Board may assess a premium charge only if the NCUSIF's equity ratio is less than 1.3 percent and the premium charge does not exceed the amount necessary to restore the equity ratio to 1.3 percent.


(ii) If the equity ratio of the NCUSIF falls to between 1.0 and 1.2 percent, the NCUA Board is required to assess a premium in an amount it determines is necessary to restore the equity ratio to at least 1.2 percent, as provided for in the restoration plan adopted under Section 202(c)(2)(D) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1782(c)(20)(D)). If the equity ratio of the NCUSIF falls below 1.0 percent, the NCUA Board is required to assess a deposit replenishment charge in an amount it determines is necessary to restore the equity ratio to 1.0 percent and to assess a premium charge in an amount it determines is necessary to restore the equity ratio to, at least 1.2 percent, as provided for in the restoration plan adopted under Section 202(c)(2)(D) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1782(c)(20)(D)).


(e) *NCUSIF equity distribution.* Except as otherwise provided for by federal law or regulation, the following procedures shall apply to any NCUSIF equity distribution declared by the Board:


(1) *Eligibility for an NCUSIF equity distribution.* The Board shall make an NCUSIF equity distribution to any financial institution that files at least one quarterly Call Report as a federally insured credit union for a reporting period in the calendar year for which the Board declares the NCUSIF equity distribution.


(2) *Requirement to make an NCUSIF equity distribution.* The Board shall make an NCUSIF equity distribution on a pro rata basis to financial institutions after each calendar year if, as of the end of the calendar year:


(i) Any loans to the NCUSIF from the Federal Government, and any interest on those loans, have been repaid;


(ii) The NCUSIF's equity ratio exceeds the normal operating level; and


(iii) The NCUSIF's available assets ratio exceeds one percent.


(3) *Amount of NCUSIF equity distribution.* The Board shall make the maximum possible NCUSIF equity distribution that does not:


(i) Reduce the NCUSIF's equity ratio below the normal operating level; and


(ii) Reduce the NCUSIF's available assets ratio below one percent.


(4) *Form of NCUSIF equity distribution.* The Board shall have the discretion to determine the form of an NCUSIF equity distribution including a waiver of federal share insurance premiums, a rebate of federal share insurance premiums, a dividend, or any combination thereof.


(5) *Calculation of pro rata share of NCUSIF equity distribution.* The Board shall determine a financial institution's pro rata share of an NCUSIF equity distribution by dividing the dollar amount of the declared NCUSIF equity distribution by the aggregate average amount of insured shares for that calendar year and then multiplying by a financial institution's average amount of insured shares.


(i) *Special rules.* The following special rules shall apply to newly chartered federally insured credit unions, financial institutions that convert to federal share insurance coverage from the NCUSIF, financial institutions that terminate federal share insurance coverage from the NCUSIF, mergers between federally insured credit unions, and purchase and assumption transactions:


(A) *New charters.* A newly chartered federally insured credit union that obtains federal share insurance coverage from the NCUSIF during the calendar year shall not receive an NCUSIF equity distribution for that calendar year unless the federally insured credit union has filed at least one quarterly Call Report as a federally insured credit union for a reporting period in the calendar year for which the Board has declared a distribution. For purposes of calculating the newly chartered federally insured credit union's average amount of insured shares, the federally insured credit union shall be treated as having no insured shares for reporting periods preceding the first reporting period in which the federally insured credit union files its first quarterly Call Report.


(B) *Conversion to federal share insurance.* A financial institution that converts to federal share insurance coverage from the NCUSIF during the calendar year for which the Board declares an NCUSIF equity distribution (including through merger into a federally insured credit union) shall receive a prorated NCUSIF equity distribution for that calendar year provided that the financial institution has filed at least one quarterly Call Report as a federally insured credit union for a reporting period in the applicable calendar year. For purposes of calculating the financial institution's average amount of insured shares, the financial institution shall be treated as having no insured shares for reporting periods preceding the date of conversion to federal share insurance coverage. In cases of conversion through merger, only the insured shares attributable to the continuing federally insured credit union shall be used to determine the average amount of insured shares for reporting periods preceding the date of conversion.


(C) *Conversion from, or termination of, federal share insurance.* A financial institution that terminates federal share insurance coverage from the NCUSIF during the calendar year for which the Board declares an NCUSIF equity distribution (including through a conversion to, or merger into, a non-federally insured credit union or an insured depository institution) shall receive a prorated NCUSIF equity distribution for that calendar year provided that the financial institution has filed at least one quarterly Call Report as a federally insured credit union for a reporting period in the applicable calendar year. For purposes of calculating the financial institution's average amount of insured shares, the financial institution shall be treated as having no insured shares for reporting periods following the date of termination of federal share insurance coverage. For purposes of this subparagraph, a financial institution that terminates federal share insurance coverage from the NCUSIF through liquidation will be treated as terminating federal share insurance coverage during the calendar year when it enters liquidation.


(D) *Mergers between federally insured credit unions.* A federally insured credit union that merges with a federally insured credit union shall receive an equity distribution equivalent to what the continuing federally insured credit union and the merging federally insured credit union would have received separately but for the consummation of the merger provided that the merging federally insured credit union has filed at least one quarterly Call Report as a federally insured credit union for a reporting period in the calendar year for which the Board declares the distribution. For purposes of calculating the continuing federally insured credit union's average amount of insured shares, any insured shares previously reported by the merging federally insured credit union on its quarterly Call Reports filed prior to the consummation of the merger during that calendar year for which the Board declares the distribution shall be combined with the insured shares reported on the continuing federally insured credit union's quarterly Call Reports.


(E) *Purchase and assumption transactions.* A federally insured credit union that acquires all of the insured shares of another federally insured credit union in the calendar year for which the Board declares an NCUSIF equity distribution shall receive an amount equivalent to what the acquiring federally insured credit union and the selling federally insured credit union would have received but for the consummation of the purchase and assumption transaction provided that the selling federally insured credit union has filed at least one quarterly Call Report as a federally insured credit union for a reporting period in the calendar year for which the Board declares an NCUSIF equity distribution. For purposes of calculating the acquiring federally insured credit union's average amount of insured shares, any insured shares previously reported during that calendar year for which the Board declares an NCUSIF equity distribution by the selling federally insured credit union on its quarterly Call Reports filed prior to the consummation of the purchase and assumption transaction shall be combined with the insured shares reported on the acquiring federally insured credit union's quarterly Call Reports.


(f) *Invoices.* The NCUA provides invoices to all federally insured credit unions stating any change in the amount of a credit union's one percent deposit and the computation and funding of any NCUSIF premium or deposit replenishment assessments due. Invoices for federal credit unions also include any annual operating fees that are due. Invoices are calculated based on a credit union's insured shares as of the most recently ended reporting period. The invoices may also provide for any distribution the NCUA Board declares in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, resulting in a single net transfer of funds between a credit union and the NCUA.


(g) *New charters.* A newly-chartered credit union that obtains share insurance coverage from the NCUSIF during the calendar year in which it has obtained its charter will not be required to pay for insurance for that calendar year. The credit union will fund its one percent deposit on a date to be determined by the NCUA Board in the following calendar year.


(h) *Depletion of one percent deposit.* All or part of the one percent deposit may be used by the NCUSIF if necessary to meet its expenses. The NCUSIF may invoice credit unions in an amount necessary to replenish the one percent deposit at any time following the effective date of the depletion.


(i) *Conversion to Federal insurance.* (1) A credit union or other institution that converts to insurance coverage with the NCUSIF will:


(i) Immediately fund its one percent deposit based on the total of its insured shares as of the last day of the most recently ended reporting period prior to the date of conversion;


(ii) If the NCUSIF assesses a premium in the calendar year of conversion, pay a premium based on the institution's insured shares as of the last day of the most recently ended reporting period preceding the invoice date times the institution's premium/distribution ratio;


(iii) If the NCUSIF declares, in the calendar year of conversion on or before the date of conversion, an assessment to replenish the one-percent deposit, pay nothing related to that assessment;


(iv) If the NCUSIF declares, at any time after the date of conversion through the end of that calendar year, an assessment to replenish the one-percent deposit, pay a replenishment amount based on the institution's insured shares as of the last day of the most recently ended reporting period preceding the invoice date; and


(2) A federally insured credit union that merges with a non-federally insured credit union or other non-federally insured institution (the “merging institution”), where the federally insured credit union is the continuing institution, will:


(i) Immediately on the date of merger increase the amount of its NCUSIF deposit by an amount equal to one percent of the merging institution's insured shares as of the last day of the merging institution's most recently ended reporting period preceding the date of merger;


(ii) With regard to any NCUSIF premiums assessed in the calendar year of merger, pay a two-part premium, with one part calculated on the merging institution's insured shares as described in paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section, and the other part calculated on the continuing institution's insured shares as of the last day of its most recently ended reporting period preceding the date of merger; and


(j) *Conversion from, or termination of, Federal share insurance.* (1) A federally insured credit union whose insurance coverage with the NCUSIF terminates, including through a conversion to, or merger into, a non-federally insured credit union or a noncredit union entity, will:


(i) Receive the full amount of its NCUSIF deposit paid, less any amounts applied to cover NCUSIF losses that exceed NCUSIF retained earnings, immediately after the final date on which any shares of the credit union are NCUSIF-insured;


(ii) If the NCUSIF assesses a premium in the calendar year of conversion or merger on or before the day in which the conversion or merger is completed, pay a prorated premium based on the financial institution's insured shares as of the last day of the most recently ended reporting period preceding the conversion or merger multiplied by the ratio of the amount of full calendar months for which the financial institution maintained federal share insurance coverage from the NCUSIF to the number of full calendar months for the entire calendar year. If the financial institution has previously paid a premium based on this same assessment that exceeds this amount, the financial institution will receive a refund of the difference following the completion of the conversion or merger.


(2) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (j)(1) of this section:


(i) Any insolvent credit union that is closed for involuntary liquidation will not be entitled to a return of its deposit;


(ii) Any solvent credit union that is closed due to voluntary or involuntary liquidation will be entitled to a return of its deposit paid, less any amounts applied to cover NCUSIF losses that exceed NCUSIF retained earnings, prior to final distribution of member shares; and


(iii) The Board reserves the right to delay return of the deposit to any credit union converting from or terminating its federal insurance, or voluntarily liquidating, for up to one year if the Board determines that immediate repayment would jeopardize the NCUSIF.


(k) *Assessment of administrative fee and interest for delinquent payment.* Each federally insured credit union must pay to the NCUA an administrative fee, the costs of collection, and interest on any delinquent payment of its capitalization deposit or insurance premium. A payment will be considered delinquent if it is postmarked or electronically posted later than the date stated in the invoice provided to the credit union. The NCUA may waive or abate charges or collection of interest, if circumstances warrant.


(1) The administrative fee for a delinquent payment shall be an amount as fixed from time to time by the NCUA Board based upon the administrative costs of such delinquent payments to the NCUA in the preceding year.


(2) The costs of collection shall be calculated as the actual hours expended by NCUA personnel multiplied by the average hourly cost of the salaries and benefits of such personnel.


(3) The interest rate charged on any delinquent payment shall be the U.S. Department of the Treasury Tax and loan Rate in effect on the date when the loan payment is due as provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717.


(4) The Act contains specific penalties and other consequences for delinquent payments, including, but not limited to:


(i) Section 202(d)(2)(B) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1782(d)(2)(B)) provides that the Board may assess and collect a penalty from an insured credit union, up to the amount specified in § 747.1001 of this chapter, for each day the credit union fails or refuses to pay any deposit or premium due to the fund; and


(ii) Section 202(d)(3) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1782(d)(3)) provides, generally, that no insured credit union shall pay any dividends on its insured shares or distribute any of its assets while it remains in default in the payment of its deposit or any premium charge due to the fund. Section 202(d)(3) further provides that any director or officer of any insured credit union who knowingly participates in the declaration or payment of any such dividend or in any such distribution shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned more than one year, or both.
