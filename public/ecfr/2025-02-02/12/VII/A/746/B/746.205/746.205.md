(a) *Initial review.* The Special Counsel shall review all appeals filed with the Secretary of the Board for conformance with the rules set forth in this subpart, including deadlines for submission of an appeal. The Special Counsel shall also make an evaluation concerning whether an appeal is moot or is otherwise not in good order, and shall make a recommendation for the disposition of all such appeals to the Board. The Special Counsel shall have the authority to dismiss an appeal upon the request of the petitioner.


(b) *Supplemental materials.* Within 30 calendar days from the date the Secretary of the Board receives an appeal, the Special Counsel may request in writing that the petitioner submit additional evidence in support of the appeal. If additional evidence is requested, the petitioner shall have 30 calendar days from the date of issuance of such request to provide the requested information. Failure by the petitioner to provide such information may result in denial of the petitioner's appeal. The Special Counsel shall have the authority to request additional information from any other relevant source in order to provide the Board with a full and complete administrative record. All requests by the Special Counsel pursuant to this section must be reasonable and designed to facilitate the processing of the appeal, not to delay it.
