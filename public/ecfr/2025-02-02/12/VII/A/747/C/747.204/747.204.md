# ยง 747.204   Notice of intention to terminate insured status.

Unless correction of the practices, condition, or violations set forth in the Notice of Charges is made within 120 days after service of such statement, or within a shorter period of not less than 20 days after such service as the NCUA Board may require in any case where it determines that the insurance risk with respect to such credit union could be unduly jeopardized by further delay or as the appropriate State supervisory authority shall require in the case of an insured State-chartered credit union, the Board, if it determines to proceed further, shall give to the credit union not less than 30 days written notice of its intent to terminate the status of the credit union as an insured credit union. The notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged unsafe or unsound practices or conditions or violations on which a hearing will be held. Such hearing shall commence not earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days after the date of service of such notice upon the credit union, unless an earlier or later date is set by the NCUA Board at the request of the credit union.
