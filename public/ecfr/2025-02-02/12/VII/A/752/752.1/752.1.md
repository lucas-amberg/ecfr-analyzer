# § 752.1.   What is section 205(d) of the Federal Credit Union Act?

(a) This part covers applications under section 205(d) of the Federal Credit Union Act (FCU Act), 12 U.S.C. 1785(d). The NCUA refers to such applications as “consent applications.” Under section 205(d), any person who has been convicted of any criminal offense involving dishonesty or breach of trust, or has agreed to enter into a pretrial diversion or similar program (program entry) in connection with a prosecution for such offense (collectively, Covered Offenses), may not become, or continue as, an institution-affiliated party (IAP) of an insured credit union; or otherwise participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of the affairs of any insured credit union without the prior written consent of the NCUA. Section 205(d) imposes a ten-year ban against the Board granting consent for a person convicted of certain crimes enumerated in title 18 of the United States Code (U.S.C.). In order for the Board to grant consent during the 10-year period, the Board must file a motion with, and obtain the approval of, the sentencing court.


(b) In addition, the law prohibits an insured credit union from permitting such a person to engage in any conduct or to continue any relationship prohibited by section 205(d). Insured credit unions must therefore make a reasonable, documented, inquiry to verify an applicant's history to ensure that a person who has a Covered Offense under section 205(d) is not hired or permitted to participate in its affairs without the written consent of the NCUA issued under this subpart. Insured credit unions may extend a conditional offer of employment contingent on the completion of a background check satisfactory to the credit union to determine if the applicant is prohibited under section 205(d), but the applicant may not work for, be employed by, or otherwise participate in the affairs of the insured credit union until the credit union has determined that the applicant is not prohibited under section 205(d) (including persons who have had a consent application approved).


(c) If there is a conviction or program entry covered by the prohibitions of section 205(d), an application under this subpart must be filed seeking the NCUA's consent to become, or to continue as, an IAP; or to otherwise participate, directly or indirectly, in the affairs of the insured credit union. The application must be filed, and consented to, prior to serving in any of the foregoing capacities unless such application is not required under the subsequent provisions of this subpart. The purpose of an application is to provide the applicant an opportunity to demonstrate that, notwithstanding the prohibition, a person is fit to participate in the conduct of the affairs of an insured credit union without posing a risk to its safety and soundness or impairing public confidence in that credit union. The burden is upon the applicant to establish that the application warrants approval.


(d) The term *field office,* for purposes of this subpart, means a Regional Office or the Office of National Examinations and Supervision, as described in 12 CFR 790.2.
