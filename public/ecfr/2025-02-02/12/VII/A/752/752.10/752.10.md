# § 752.10   How will the NCUA evaluate an application?

(a) *Criminal history records.* In reviewing an application, the NCUA will—


(1) Primarily rely on the criminal history record provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (rap sheet); and


(2) Provide such record to the subject of the application to review for accuracy.


(b) *Certified copies.* The NCUA will not require an applicant to provide certified copies of criminal history records unless the NCUA determines that there is a clear and compelling justification to require additional information to verify the accuracy of the criminal history record provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.


(c) *Ultimate determinations.* The ultimate determinations in assessing an application are whether the person has demonstrated their fitness to participate in the conduct of the affairs of an insured credit union, and whether the affiliation or participation by the person in the conduct of the affairs of the credit union may constitute a threat to the safety and soundness of the credit union or the interests of its members or threaten to impair public confidence in the credit union.


(d) *Individualized assessment.* When evaluating applications, the NCUA will conduct an individualized assessment that will consider:


(1) Whether the conviction or program entry is subject to section 205(d) and the specific nature and circumstances of the offense;


(2) Whether the participation directly or indirectly by the person in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the insured credit union constitutes a threat to the safety and soundness of the credit union or the interests of its members or threatens to impair public confidence in the credit union;


(3) Evidence of rehabilitation including the person's age at the time of the conviction or program entry, the time that has elapsed since the conviction or program entry, and the relationship of the individual's offense to the responsibilities of the applicable position;


(4) The individual's employment history, letters of recommendation, certificates documenting participation in substance-abuse programs, successful participation in job preparation and educational programs, and other relevant evidence;


(5) The ability of management of the insured credit union to supervise and control the person's activities;


(6) The applicability of the insured credit union's fidelity bond coverage to the person; and


(7) For state-chartered, federally insured credit unions, the opinion or position of the state regulator; and


(8) Any additional factors in the specific case that appear relevant to the application or the individual.


(e) *No re-consideration of guilt.* The question of whether a person, who was convicted of a crime or who agreed to a program entry, was guilty of that crime will not be at issue in a proceeding under this part or under 12 CFR part 746, subpart B.


(f) *Factors considered for enumerated offenses.* The foregoing factors will also be applied by the NCUA to determine whether the interests of justice are served in seeking an exception in the appropriate court when an application is made to terminate the 10-year ban prior to its expiration date under 12 U.S.C. 1785(d)(2)(A) for certain Federal offenses.


(g) *Mandatory conditions of approval.* All approvals or orders will be subject to the condition that the person be covered by a fidelity bond to the same extent as others in similar positions. If the NCUA has approved an application filed by an individual and has issued a consent order, the individual must disclose the presence of the conviction(s) or program entry(ies) to all insured credit unions in the affairs of which they wish to participate.


(h) *Credit union-sponsored consent applications: work at same employer.* When deemed appropriate by the NCUA, credit union-sponsored applications are to allow the individual to work for the same employer (without restrictions on the location) and across positions, except that the prior consent of the NCUA (which may require a new application) will be required for any proposed significant changes in the individual's security-related duties or responsibilities, such as promotion to an officer or other positions that the employer determines will require higher security screening credentials.


(i) *Work at a different employer after certain approvals.* In situations in which an approval has been granted for a person to participate in the affairs of a particular insured credit union and the person subsequently seeks to participate at another insured credit union, another application must be submitted and approved by the NCUA prior to the person participating in the affairs of the other insured credit union.
