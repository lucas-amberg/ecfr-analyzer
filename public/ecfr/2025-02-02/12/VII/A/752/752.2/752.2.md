# ยง 752.2   Who is covered by section 205(d)?

(a) Persons covered by section 205(d) include IAPs, as defined by 12 U.S.C. 1786(r), and others who are participants in the conduct of the affairs of an insured credit union. Therefore, all directors, officers, and employees of an insured credit union who fall within the scope of section 205(d), including *de facto* employees, as determined by the NCUA based upon generally applicable standards of employment law, will also be subject to section 205(d). Whether other persons are covered by section 205(d) depends upon their degree of influence or control over the management or affairs of an insured credit union. For example, section 205(d) would apply to directors and officers of affiliates, subsidiaries, or joint ventures of an insured credit union if they participate in the affairs of the insured credit union or are able to influence or control the management or affairs of the insured credit union. Typically, an independent contractor does not have a relationship with the insured credit union other than the activity for which the credit union has contracted. However, an independent contractor who also influences or controls the management or affairs of the insured credit union would be covered by section 205(d).


(b) The term *person,* for purposes of section 205(d), means an individual and does not include a corporation, firm, or other business entity.
