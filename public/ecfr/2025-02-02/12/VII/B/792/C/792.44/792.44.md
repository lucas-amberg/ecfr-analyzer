# ยง 792.44   When should I make a request?

You should submit your request at least 45 days before the date that you need the records or testimony. If you want to have your request processed in less time, you must explain why you couldn't submit the request earlier and why you need expedited processing. If you are requesting the testimony of an NCUA employee, the NCUA expects you to anticipate your need for the testimony in sufficient time to obtain it by a deposition. The General Counsel may deny a request for testimony at a legal proceeding unless you explain why you could not use deposition testimony. The General Counsel will determine the location of a deposition taking into consideration the NCUA's interest in minimizing the disruption for an NCUA employee's work schedule and the costs and convenience of other persons attending the deposition.
