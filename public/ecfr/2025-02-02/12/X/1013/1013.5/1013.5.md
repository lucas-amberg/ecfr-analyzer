# ยง 1013.5   Renegotiations, extensions, and assumptions.

(a) *Renegotiation.* A renegotiation occurs when a consumer lease subject to this part is satisfied and replaced by a new lease undertaken by the same consumer. A renegotiation requires new disclosures, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.


(b) *Extension.* An extension is a continuation, agreed to by the lessor and the lessee, of an existing consumer lease beyond the originally scheduled end of the lease term, except when the continuation is the result of a renegotiation. An extension that exceeds six months requires new disclosures, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.


(c) *Assumption.* New disclosures are not required when a consumer lease is assumed by another person, whether or not the lessor charges an assumption fee.


(d) *Exceptions.* New disclosures are not required for the following, even if they meet the definition of a renegotiation or an extension:


(1) A reduction in the rent charge;


(2) The deferment of one or more payments, whether or not a fee is charged;


(3) The extension of a lease for not more than six months on a month-to-month basis or otherwise;


(4) A substitution of leased property with property that has a substantially equivalent or greater economic value, provided no other lease terms are changed;


(5) The addition, deletion, or substitution of leased property in a multiple-item lease, provided the average periodic payment does not change by more than 25 percent; or


(6) An agreement resulting from a court proceeding.
