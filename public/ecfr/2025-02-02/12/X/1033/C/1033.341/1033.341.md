# § 1033.341   Information about the data provider.

(a) *Requirement to make information about the data provider readily identifiable.* A data provider must make the information described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section:


(1) Readily identifiable to members of the public, meaning the information must be at least as available as it would be on a public website; and


(2) Available in both human-readable and machine-readable formats.


(b) *Identifying information.* A data provider must disclose in the manner required by paragraph (a) of this section:


(1) Its legal name and, if applicable, any assumed name it is using while doing business with the consumer;


(2) A link to its website;


(3) Its LEI that is issued by:


(i) A utility endorsed by the LEI Regulatory Oversight Committee, or


(ii) A utility endorsed or otherwise governed by the Global LEI Foundation (or any successor thereof) after the Global LEI Foundation assumes operational governance of the global LEI system; and


(4) Contact information that enables a consumer or third party to receive answers to questions about accessing covered data under this part.


(c) *Developer interface documentation.* For its developer interface, a data provider must disclose in the manner required by paragraph (a) of this section documentation, including metadata describing all covered data and their corresponding data fields, and other documentation sufficient for a third party to access and use the interface. A data provider is not required to make publicly available information that would impede its ability to deny a third party access to its developer interface, consistent with § 1033.321. Indicia that documentation is sufficient for a third party to access and use a developer interface include conformance to a consensus standard. The documentation must:


(1) Be maintained and updated as reasonably necessary for third parties to access and use the interface in accordance with the terms to which data providers are subject under this part;


(2) Include how third parties can get technical support and report issues with the interface; and


(3) Be easy to understand and use, similar to data providers' documentation for other commercially available products.


(d) *Performance disclosure.* On or before the final day of each calendar month, a data provider must disclose in the manner required by paragraph (a) of this section the quantitative minimum performance specification for the response rate described in § 1033.311(c)(1)(i) through (iv) that the data provider's developer interface achieved in the previous calendar month. The data provider's disclosure must include at least a rolling 13 months of the required monthly figure, except that the disclosure need not include the monthly figure for months prior to the compliance date applicable to the data provider. The data provider must disclose the metric as a percentage rounded to four decimal places, such as “99.9999 percent.”
