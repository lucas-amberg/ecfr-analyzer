# § 1070.56   Request for amendment of records.

(a) *Procedures for making request.* (1) If an individual wishes to amend a record that pertains to that individual in a system of records, that individual may submit a request in writing to the Chief Privacy Officer, as set forth in § 1070.53(a). The request shall be labeled “Privacy Act Amendment Request.”


(2) A request for amendment of a record must:


(i) Identify the name of the system of records that the requester believes contains the record for which the amendment is requested, or a description of the nature of the record in detail sufficient to enable CFPB personnel to locate the system of records containing the record with a reasonable amount of effort;


(ii) Specify the portion of that record requested to be amended; and


(iii) Describe the nature and reasons for each requested amendment.


(3) When making a request for amendment of a record, the CFPB will require a requester to verify his or her identity under the procedures set forth in § 1070.53(c), unless the requester has already done so in a related request for access or amendment.


(b) *Burden of proof.* In a request for amendment of a record, the requester bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the record is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete.
