# § 1070.58   Appeal of adverse determination of request for access or amendment.

(a) *Appeal.* A requester may appeal a denial of a request made pursuant to § 1070.53 or § 1070.56 within ten (10) business days after the CFPB notifies the requester that it has denied the request.


(b) *Content of appeal.* A requester may submit an appeal in writing as set forth in § 1070.53(a). The appeal shall be addressed to the General Counsel and labeled “Privacy Act Appeal.” The appeal must also:


(1) Specify the background of the request; and


(2) Provide reasons why the requester believes the denial is in error.


(c) *Determination.* The General Counsel will make a determination as to whether to grant or deny an appeal within thirty (30) business days from the date it is received, unless the General Counsel extends the time for good cause.


(1) If the General Counsel grants an appeal regarding a request for amendment, he or she will take the necessary steps to amend the record and, when appropriate and possible, notify prior recipients of the record of its action.


(2) If the General Counsel denies an appeal, he or she will inform the requester of such determination in writing, including the reasons for the denial, and the requester's right to file a statement of disagreement and to have a court review its decision.


(d) *Statement of disagreement.* (1) If the General Counsel denies an appeal regarding a request for amendment, a requester may file a concise statement of disagreement with the denial. The CFPB will maintain the requester's statement with the record that the requester sought to amend and any disclosure of the record will include a copy of the requester's statement of disagreement.


(2) When practicable and appropriate, the CFPB will provide a copy of the statement of disagreement to any prior recipients of the record.
