# § 1081.207   Production of witness statements.

(a) *Availability.* Any respondent may move that the Enforcement Division produce for inspection and copying any statement of any person called or to be called as a witness by the Enforcement Division that pertains, or is expected to pertain, to the witness's direct testimony and that would be required to be produced pursuant to the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. 3500, if the adjudication proceeding were a criminal proceeding. For purposes of this section, the term “statement” has the meaning set forth in 18 U.S.C. 3500(e). Such production will be made at a time and place fixed by the hearing officer and will be made available to any party, provided, however, that the production must be made under conditions intended to preserve the items to be inspected or copied.


(b) *Failure to produce—harmless error.* In the event that a statement required to be made available to a respondent pursuant to this section is not made available by the Enforcement Division, no rehearing or redecision of a proceeding already heard or decided will be required unless the respondent establishes that the failure to make the statement available was not harmless error.
