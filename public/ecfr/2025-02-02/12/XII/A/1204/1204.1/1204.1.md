# § 1204.1   Why did FHFA issue this part?

The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) issued this part to—


(a) Implement the Privacy Act, a Federal law that helps protect private information about individuals that Federal agencies collect or maintain. You should read this part together with the Privacy Act, which provides additional information about records maintained on individuals;


(b) Establish rules that apply to all FHFA and FHFA Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG) maintained systems of records retrievable by an individual's name or other personal identifier;


(c) Describe procedures through which you may request access to records, request amendment or correction of those records, or request an accounting of disclosures of those records by FHFA or FHFA-OIG;


(d) Inform you, that when it is appropriate to do so, FHFA or FHFA-OIG automatically processes a Privacy Act request for access to records under both the Privacy Act and FOIA, following the rules contained in this part and in FHFA's Freedom of Information Act regulation at part 1202 of this title so that you will receive the maximum amount of information available to you by law;


(e) Notify you that this part does not entitle you to any service or to the disclosure of any record to which you are not entitled under the Privacy Act. It also does not, and may not be relied upon, to create any substantive or procedural right or benefit enforceable against FHFA or FHFA-OIG; and


(f) Notify you that this part applies to both FHFA and FHFA-OIG.
