# § 1204.4   How will FHFA or FHFA-OIG respond to my Privacy Act request?

(a) *How will FHFA or FHFA-OIG locate the requested records?* FHFA or FHFA-OIG will search to determine if requested records exist in the system of records it owns or controls. You can find FHFA and FHFA-OIG system of records notices on our Web site at *http://www.fhfa.gov.* You can also find descriptions of OFHEO and FHFB system of records that have not yet been superseded on the FHFA Web site. A description of the system of records also is available in the “Privacy Act Issuances” compilation published by the Office of the Federal Register of the National Archives and Records Administration. You can access the “Privacy Act Issuances” compilation in most large reference and university libraries or electronically at the Government Printing Office Web site at: *http://www.gpoaccess.gov/privacyact/index.html.* You also can request a copy of FHFA or FHFA-OIG system of records from the Privacy Act Officer.


(b) *How long does FHFA or FHFA-OIG have to respond?* Either the FHFA or FHFA-OIG Privacy Act Officer generally will respond to your request in writing within 20 days after receiving it, if it meets the § 1204.3 requirements. For requests to amend a record, either the FHFA or FHFA-OIG Privacy Act Officer will respond within 10 days after receipt of the request to amend. FHFA or FHFA-OIG may extend the response time in unusual circumstances, such as when consultation is needed with another Federal agency (if that agency is subject to the Privacy Act) about a record or to retrieve a record shipped offsite for storage. If you submit your written request in person, either the FHFA or FHFA-OIG Privacy Act Officer may disclose records or information to you directly and create a written record of the grant of the request. If you are to be accompanied by another person when accessing your record or any information pertaining to you, FHFA or FHFA-OIG may require your written authorization before permitting access or discussing the record in the presence of the other person.


(c) *What will the FHFA or FHFA-OIG response include?* The written response will include a determination to grant or deny your request in whole or in part, a brief explanation of the reasons for the determination, and the amount of the fee charged, if any, under § 1204.6. If you are granted a request to access a record, FHFA or FHFA-OIG will make the record available to you. If you are granted a request to amend or correct a record, the response will describe any amendments or corrections made and advise you of your right to obtain a copy of the amended or corrected record.


(d) *What is an adverse determination?* An adverse determination is a determination on a Privacy Act request that—


(1) Withholds any requested record in whole or in part;


(2) Denies a request for an amendment or correction of a record in whole or in part;


(3) Declines to provide a requested accounting of disclosures;


(4) Advises that a requested record does not exist or cannot be located; or


(5) Finds what has been requested is not a record subject to the Privacy Act.


(e) *What will be stated in a response that includes an adverse determination?* If an adverse determination is made with respect to your request, either the FHFA or FHFA-OIG Privacy Act Officer's written response under this section will identify the person responsible for the adverse determination, state that the adverse determination is not a final action of FHFA or FHFA-OIG, and state that you may appeal the adverse determination under § 1204.5.
