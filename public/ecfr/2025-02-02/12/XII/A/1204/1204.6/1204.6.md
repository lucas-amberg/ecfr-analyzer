# ยง 1204.6   What does it cost to get records under the Privacy Act?

(a) *Must I agree to pay fees?* Your Privacy Act request is your agreement to pay all applicable fees, unless you specify a limit on the amount of fees you agree to pay. FHFA or FHFA-OIG will not exceed the specified limit without your written agreement.


(b) *How does FHFA or FHFA-OIG calculate fees?* FHFA and FHFA-OIG will charge a fee for duplication of a record under the Privacy Act in the same way it charges for duplication of records under FOIA in 12 CFR 1202.11. There are no fees to search for or review records.
