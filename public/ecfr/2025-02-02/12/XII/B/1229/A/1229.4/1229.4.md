(2) Significantly undercapitalized, if it is otherwise classified as undercapitalized; or


(3) Critically undercapitalized if it is otherwise classified as significantly undercapitalized.


(b) *Grounds for discretionary reclassification.* Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, the Director may at any time reclassify a Bank under this section if:

(iii) The value of property subject to mortgages owned by the Bank has decreased significantly.

(3) The Director finds, under ยง 1371(b) of Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4631(b)), that the Bank is engaging in an unsafe and unsound practice because the Bank's asset quality, management, earnings or liquidity were found to be less than satisfactory during the most recent examination, and any deficiency has not been corrected.


(c) *Procedures.* Before finalizing any action to reclassify a Bank under this section, the Director shall provide a Bank written notice describing the proposed action and an opportunity to submit information that the Bank considers relevant to the Director's proposed action in accordance with ยง 1229.12 of this subpart.


(d) *Duration.* Any condition, action or inaction by a Bank that is the basis for a decision to reclassify a Bank under this section or under any other authority provided the Director may be considered by the Director and form the basis of further, subsequent actions to reclassify the Bank until such time as the Bank remedies such condition or takes necessary action to correct such situation to the satisfaction of the Director.


(e) *Reservation of authority.* Nothing in this section shall prevent the Director from exercising any other authority under the Safety and Soundness Act, the Bank Act or any regulation to reclassify a Bank for reasons not set forth in paragraph (b) of this section or to take any other action against a Bank.
