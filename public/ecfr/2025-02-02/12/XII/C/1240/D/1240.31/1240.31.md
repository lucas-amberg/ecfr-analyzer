# § 1240.31   Mechanics for calculating risk-weighted assets for general credit risk.

(a) *General risk-weighting requirements.* An Enterprise must apply risk weights to its exposures as follows:


(1) An Enterprise must determine the exposure amount of each mortgage exposure, each other on-balance sheet exposure, each OTC derivative contract, and each off-balance sheet commitment, trade and transaction-related contingency, guarantee, repo-style transaction, forward agreement, or other similar transaction that is not:


(i) An unsettled transaction subject to § 1240.40;


(ii) A cleared transaction subject to § 1240.37;


(iii) A default fund contribution subject to § 1240.37;


(iv) A retained CRT exposure, acquired CRT exposure, or other securitization exposure subject to §§ 1240.41 through 1240.46; 


(v) An equity exposure (other than an equity OTC derivative contract) subject to §§ 1240.51 and 1240.52; or


(vi) CVA risk-weighted assets subject to § 1240.36(d).




(2) An Enterprise must multiply each exposure amount by the risk weight appropriate to the exposure based on the exposure type or counterparty, eligible guarantor, or financial collateral to determine the risk-weighted asset amount for each exposure.


(b) *Total risk-weighted assets for general credit risk.* Total risk-weighted assets for general credit risk equals the sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts calculated under this section.
