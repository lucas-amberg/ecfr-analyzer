# § 1240.41   Operational requirements for CRT and other securitization exposures.

(a) *Operational criteria for traditional securitizations.* An Enterprise that transfers exposures it has purchased or otherwise acquired to a securitization SPE or other third party in connection with a traditional securitization may exclude the exposures from the calculation of its risk-weighted assets only if each condition in this section is satisfied. An Enterprise that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any credit risk it retains in connection with the securitization. An Enterprise that fails to meet these conditions must hold risk-based capital against the transferred exposures as if they had not been securitized and must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the transaction. The conditions are:


(1) The exposures are not reported on the Enterprise's consolidated balance sheet under GAAP;


(2) The Enterprise has transferred to one or more third parties credit risk associated with the underlying exposures;


(3) Any clean-up calls relating to the securitization are eligible clean-up calls; and


(4) The securitization does not:


(i) Include one or more underlying exposures in which the borrower is permitted to vary the drawn amount within an agreed limit under a line of credit; and


(ii) Contain an early amortization provision.


(b) *Operational criteria for synthetic securitizations.* For synthetic securitizations, an Enterprise may recognize for risk-based capital purposes the use of a credit risk mitigant to hedge underlying exposures only if each condition in this paragraph (b) is satisfied. An Enterprise that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any credit risk of the exposures it retains in connection with the synthetic securitization. An Enterprise that fails to meet these conditions or chooses not to recognize the credit risk mitigant for purposes of this section must instead hold risk-based capital against the underlying exposures as if they had not been synthetically securitized. The conditions are:


(1) The credit risk mitigant is:


(i) Financial collateral;


(ii) A guarantee that meets all criteria as set forth in the definition of “eligible guarantee” in § 1240.2, except for the criteria in paragraph (3) of that definition; or


(iii) A credit derivative that meets all criteria as set forth in the definition of “eligible credit derivative” in § 1240.2, except for the criteria in paragraph (3) of the definition of “eligible guarantee” in § 1240.2.


(2) The Enterprise transfers credit risk associated with the underlying exposures to one or more third parties, and the terms and conditions in the credit risk mitigants employed do not include provisions that:


(i) Allow for the termination of the credit protection due to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;


(ii) Require the Enterprise to alter or replace the underlying exposures to improve the credit quality of the underlying exposures;


(iii) Increase the Enterprise's cost of credit protection in response to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;


(iv) Increase the yield payable to parties other than the Enterprise in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures; or


(v) Provide for increases in a retained first loss position or credit enhancement provided by the Enterprise after the inception of the securitization;


(3) The Enterprise obtains a well-reasoned opinion from legal counsel that confirms the enforceability of the credit risk mitigant in all relevant jurisdictions; and


(4) Any clean-up calls relating to the securitization are eligible clean-up calls.


(c) *Operational criteria for credit risk transfers.* For credit risk transfers, an Enterprise may recognize for risk-based capital purposes, the use of a credit risk transfer only if each condition in this paragraph (c) is satisfied (or, for a credit risk transfer entered into before February 16, 2021, only if each condition in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section is satisfied). An Enterprise that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any credit risk of the exposures it retains in connection with the credit risk transfer. An Enterprise that fails to meet these conditions or chooses not to recognize the credit risk transfer for purposes of this section must instead hold risk-based capital against the underlying exposures as if they had not been subject to the credit risk transfer. The conditions are:


(1) The credit risk transfer is any of the following—


(i) An eligible funded synthetic risk transfer;


(ii) An eligible reinsurance risk transfer;


(iii) An eligible single-family lender risk share;


(iv) An eligible multifamily lender risk share; or


(v) An eligible senior-subordinated structure.


(2) The credit risk transfer has been approved by FHFA as effective in transferring the credit risk of one or more mortgage exposures to another party, taking into account any counterparty, recourse, or other risk to the Enterprise and any capital, liquidity, or other requirements applicable to counterparties;


(3) The Enterprise transfers credit risk associated with the underlying exposures to one or more third parties, and the terms and conditions in the credit risk transfer employed do not include provisions that:


(i) Allow for the termination of the credit risk transfer due to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;


(ii) Require the Enterprise to alter or replace the underlying exposures to improve the credit quality of the underlying exposures;


(iii) Increase the Enterprise's cost of credit protection in response to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;


(iv) Increase the yield payable to parties other than the Enterprise in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures; or


(v) Provide for increases in a retained first loss position or credit enhancement provided by the Enterprise after the inception of the credit risk transfer;


(4) The Enterprise obtains a well-reasoned opinion from legal counsel that confirms the enforceability of the credit risk transfer in all relevant jurisdictions;


(5) Any clean-up calls relating to the credit risk transfer are eligible clean-up calls;




(6) Any time-based calls relating to the credit risk transfer are eligible time-based calls; and




(7) The Enterprise includes in its periodic disclosures under the Federal securities laws, or in other appropriate public disclosures, a reasonably detailed description of—


(i) The material recourse or other risks that might reduce the effectiveness of the credit risk transfer in transferring the credit risk on the underlying exposures to third parties; and


(ii) Each condition under paragraph (a) of this section (governing traditional securitizations) or paragraph (b) of this section (governing synthetic securitizations) that is not satisfied by the credit risk transfer and the reasons that each such condition is not satisfied.


(d) *Due diligence requirements for securitization exposures.* (1) Except for exposures that are deducted from common equity tier 1 capital and exposures subject to § 1240.42(h), if an Enterprise is unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of FHFA a comprehensive understanding of the features of a securitization exposure that would materially affect the performance of the exposure, the Enterprise must assign the securitization exposure a risk weight of 1,250 percent. The Enterprise's analysis must be commensurate with the complexity of the securitization exposure and the materiality of the exposure in relation to its capital.


(2) An Enterprise must demonstrate its comprehensive understanding of a securitization exposure under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, for each securitization exposure by:


(i) Conducting an analysis of the risk characteristics of a securitization exposure prior to acquiring the exposure, and documenting such analysis within three business days after acquiring the exposure, considering:


(A) Structural features of the securitization that would materially impact the performance of the exposure, for example, the contractual cash flow waterfall, waterfall-related triggers, credit enhancements, liquidity enhancements, fair value triggers, the performance of organizations that service the exposure, and deal-specific definitions of default;


(B) Relevant information regarding the performance of the underlying credit exposure(s), for example, the percentage of loans 30, 60, and 90 days past due; default rates; prepayment rates; loans in foreclosure; property types; occupancy; average credit score or other measures of creditworthiness; average loan-to-value ratio; and industry and geographic diversification data on the underlying exposure(s);


(C) Relevant market data of the securitization, for example, bid-ask spread, most recent sales price and historic price volatility, trading volume, implied market rating, and size, depth and concentration level of the market for the securitization; and


(D) For resecuritization exposures, performance information on the underlying securitization exposures, for example, the issuer name and credit quality, and the characteristics and performance of the exposures underlying the securitization exposures; and


(ii) On an on-going basis (no less frequently than quarterly), evaluating, reviewing, and updating as appropriate the analysis required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section for each securitization exposure.
