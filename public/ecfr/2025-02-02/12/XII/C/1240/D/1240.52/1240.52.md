(a) *General.* Under the SRWA, an Enterprise's total risk-weighted assets for equity exposures equals the sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts for each of the Enterprise's individual equity exposures as determined under this section.


(b) *SRWA computation for individual equity exposures.* An Enterprise must determine the risk-weighted asset amount for an individual equity exposure by multiplying the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure by the lowest applicable risk weight in this section.


(1) *Community development equity exposures.* A 100 percent risk weight is assigned to an equity exposure that was acquired with the prior written approval of FHFA and is designed primarily to promote community welfare, including the welfare of low- and moderate-income communities or families, such as by providing services or employment, and excluding equity exposures to an unconsolidated small business investment company and equity exposures held through a small business investment company described in section 302 of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 682).


(2) *Other equity exposures.* A 400 percent risk weight is assigned to an equity exposure to an operating company or an investment in a separate account.
