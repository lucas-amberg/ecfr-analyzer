# ยง 1240.100   Purpose, applicability, and principle of conservatism.

(a) *Purpose.* This subpart establishes:


(1) Minimum requirements for using Enterprise-specific internal risk measurement and management processes for calculating risk-based capital requirements; and


(2) Methodologies for the Enterprises to calculate their advanced approaches total risk-weighted assets.


(b) *Applicability.* (1) This subpart applies to each Enterprise.


(2) An Enterprise must also include in its calculation of advanced credit risk-weighted assets under this subpart all covered positions, as defined in subpart F of this part.


(c) *Principle of conservatism.* Notwithstanding the requirements of this subpart, an Enterprise may choose not to apply a provision of this subpart to one or more exposures provided that:


(1) The Enterprise can demonstrate on an ongoing basis to the satisfaction of FHFA that not applying the provision would, in all circumstances, unambiguously generate a risk-based capital requirement for each such exposure greater than that which would otherwise be required under this subpart;


(2) The Enterprise appropriately manages the risk of each such exposure;


(3) The Enterprise notifies FHFA in writing prior to applying this principle to each such exposure; and


(4) The exposures to which the Enterprise applies this principle are not, in the aggregate, material to the Enterprise.
