(2) *Agency securities.* Securities issued, insured or guaranteed by the United States Government, or any agency thereof, including without limitation:


(i) Mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, or any other agency of the United States Government; 


(ii) Mortgages or other loans, regardless of delinquency status, to the extent that the mortgage or loan is insured or guaranteed by the United States or any agency thereof, or otherwise is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, and such insurance, guarantee or other backing is for the direct benefit of the holder of the mortgage or loan; and


(iii) Securities backed by, or representing an equity interest in, mortgages or other loans referred to in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.


(3) *Cash or deposits.* Cash or deposits in a Bank. 


(4) *Other real estate-related collateral.* (i) Other real estate-related collateral provided that: 


(A) Such collateral has a readily ascertainable value, can be reliably discounted to account for liquidation and other risks, and can be liquidated in due course; and 


(B) The Bank can perfect a security interest in such collateral. 


(ii) Eligible other real estate-related collateral may include, but is not limited to: 


(A) Privately issued mortgage-backed securities not otherwise eligible under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section; 


(B) Second mortgage loans, including home equity loans; 


(C) Commercial real estate loans; and 


(D) Mortgage loan participations. 


(5) *Securities representing equity interests in eligible advances collateral.* Any security the ownership of which represents an undivided equity interest in underlying assets, all of which qualify either as: 


(i) Eligible collateral under paragraphs (a)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this section; or 


(ii) Cash equivalents. 


(b) *Additional collateral eligible as security for advances to CFI members or their affiliates*—(1) *General.* Subject to the requirements set forth in part 1272 of this chapter, a Bank is authorized to accept from CFI members or their affiliates as security for advances small business loans, small farm loans, small agri-business loans, or community development loans, in each case fully secured by collateral other than real estate, or securities representing a whole interest in such secured loans, provided that:


(i) Such collateral has a readily ascertainable value, can be reliably discounted to account for liquidation and other risks, and can be liquidated in due course; and


(ii) The Bank can perfect a security interest in such collateral. 


(2) *Change in CFI status.* If a Bank determines, as of April 1 of each year, that a member that has previously qualified as a CFI no longer qualifies as a CFI, and the member has total advances outstanding that exceed the amount that can be fully secured by collateral under paragraph (a) of this section, the Bank may: 


(i) Permit the advances of such member to run to their stated maturities; and 


(ii) Renew such member's advances to mature no later than March 31 of the following year; provided that the total of the member's advances under paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section shall be fully secured by collateral set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. 


(c) *Bank restrictions on eligible advances collateral.* A Bank at its discretion may further restrict the types of eligible collateral acceptable to the Bank as security for an advance, based upon the creditworthiness or operations of the borrower, the quality of the collateral, or other reasonable criteria. 


(d) *Additional advances collateral.* The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall not affect the ability of any Bank to take such steps as it deems necessary to protect its secured position on outstanding advances, including requiring additional collateral, whether or not such additional collateral conforms to the requirements for eligible collateral in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section or section 10 of the Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1430).


(e) *Bank stock as collateral.* (1) Pursuant to section 10(c) of the Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1430(c)), a Bank shall have a lien upon, and shall hold, the stock of a member in the Bank as further collateral security for all indebtedness of the member to the Bank. 


(2) The written security agreement used by the Bank shall provide that the borrowing member's Bank stock is assigned as additional security by the member to the Bank. 


(3) The security interest of the Bank in such member's Bank stock shall be entitled to the priority provided for in section 10(e) of the Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1430(e)). 


(f) *Advances collateral security requiring formal approval.* No home mortgage loan otherwise eligible to be accepted as collateral for an advance by a Bank under this section shall be accepted as collateral for an advance if any director, officer, employee, attorney or agent of the Bank or of the borrowing member is personally liable thereon, unless the board of directors of the Bank has specifically approved such acceptance by formal resolution, and the FHFA has endorsed such resolution. 


(g) *Pledge of advances collateral by affiliates.* Assets held by an affiliate of a member that are eligible as collateral under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section may be used to secure advances to that member only if: 


(1) The collateral is pledged to secure either: 


(i) The member's obligation to repay advances; or 


(ii) A surety or other agreement under which the affiliate has assumed, along with the member, a primary obligation to repay advances made to the member; and 


(2) The Bank obtains and maintains a legally enforceable security interest pursuant to which the Bank's legal rights and privileges with respect to the collateral are functionally equivalent in all material respects to those that the Bank would possess if the member were to pledge the same collateral directly, and such functional equivalence is supported by adequate documentation.
