# § 1266.17   Advances to housing associates.

(a) *Authority.* Subject to the provisions of the Bank Act and this subpart, a Bank may make advances only to a housing associate whose principal place of business, as determined in accordance with part 1263 of this chapter, is located in the Bank's district. 


(b) *Collateral requirements*—(1) *Advances to housing associates.* A Bank may make an advance to any housing associate upon the security of the following collateral: 


(i) Mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration of HUD under title II of the National Housing Act; or 


(ii) Securities representing a whole interest in the principal and interest payments due on a pool of mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration of HUD under title II of the National Housing Act. A Bank may only accept as collateral the securities described in this paragraph (b)(1)(ii) if the housing associate provides evidence that such securities are backed solely by mortgages of the type described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. 


(2) *Certain advances to SHFAs.* (i) In addition to the collateral described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a Bank may make an advance to a housing associate that has satisfied the requirements of § 1264.3(b) for the purpose of facilitating residential or commercial mortgage lending that benefits individuals or families meeting the income requirements in section 142(d) or 143(f) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 142(d) or 143(f)) upon the security of the following collateral: 


(A) The collateral described in § 1266.7(a)(1) or (2). 


(B) The collateral described in § 1266.7(a)(3). Solely for the purpose of facilitating acceptance of such collateral, a Bank may establish a cash collateral account for a housing associate that has satisfied the requirements of § 1264.3(b). 


(C) The other real estate-related collateral described in § 1266.7(a)(4), provided that such collateral comprises mortgage loans on one-to-four family or multifamily residential property. 


(ii) Prior to making an advance pursuant to this paragraph (b)(2), a Bank shall obtain a written certification from the housing associate that it shall use the proceeds of the advance for the purposes described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. 


(c) *Terms and conditions*—(1) *General.* Subject to the provisions of this paragraph (c), a Bank, in its discretion, shall determine whether, and on what terms, it will make advances to a housing associate. 


(2) *Advance pricing.* (i) A Bank shall price advances to housing associates in accordance with the requirements for pricing advances to members set forth in § 1266.5(b). Wherever the term “member” appears in § 1266.5(b) the term shall be construed also to mean “housing associate.” 


(ii) A Bank shall apply the pricing criteria identified in § 1266.5(b)(2) equally to all of its member and housing associate borrowers. 


(3) *Limit on advances.* The principal amount of any advance made to a housing associate may not exceed 90 percent of the unpaid principal of the mortgage loans or securities pledged as security for the advance. This limit does not apply to an advance made to a housing associate under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. 


(d) *Transaction accounts.* Solely for the purpose of facilitating the making of advances to a housing associate, a Bank may establish a transaction account for each housing associate. 


(e) *Loss of eligibility*—(1) *Notification of status changes.* A Bank shall require a housing associate that applies for an advance to agree in writing that it will promptly inform the Bank of any change in its status as a housing associate. 


(2) *Verification of eligibility.* A Bank may, from time to time, require a housing associate to provide evidence that it continues to satisfy all of the eligibility requirements of the Bank Act, this subpart and part 1264 of this chapter. 


(3) *Loss of eligibility.* A Bank shall not extend a new advance or renew an existing advance to a housing associate that no longer meets the eligibility requirements of the Bank Act, this subpart and part 1264 of this chapter until the entity has provided evidence satisfactory to the Bank that it is in compliance with such requirements.
