# ยง 1267.4   Limitations and prudential requirements on use of derivative instruments.

(a) *Non-speculative use.* Derivative instruments that do not qualify as hedging instruments pursuant to GAAP may be used only if a non-speculative use is documented by the Bank.


(b) *Additional Prohibitions.* (1) A Bank may not enter into interest rate swaps that amortize according to behavior of instruments described in ยง 1267.3(a)(5) or (6) of this part.


(2) A Bank may not enter into indexed principal swaps that have average lives that vary by more than six years under an assumed instantaneous change in interest rates of 300 basis points, unless they are entered into in conjunction with the issuance of consolidated obligations or the purchase of permissible investments or entry into a permissible transaction in which all interest rate risk is passed through to the investor or counterparty.


(c) *Documentation requirements.* (1) Derivative transactions with a single counterparty shall be governed by a single master agreement when practicable.


(2) A Bank's agreement with the counterparty for over-the-counter derivative contracts shall include:


(i) A requirement that market value determinations and subsequent adjustments of collateral be made at least on a monthly basis;


(ii) A statement that failure of a counterparty to meet a collateral call will result in an early termination event;


(iii) A description of early termination pricing and methodology, with the methodology reflecting a reasonable estimate of the market value of the over-the-counter derivative contract at termination (standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. language relative to early termination pricing and methodology may be used to satisfy this requirement); and


(iv) A requirement that the Bank's consent be obtained prior to the transfer of an agreement or contract by a counterparty.
