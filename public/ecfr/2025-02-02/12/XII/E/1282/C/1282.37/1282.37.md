# § 1282.37   General requirements for credit.

(a) *General.* FHFA will determine whether an activity included in an Enterprise's Underserved Markets Plan will receive duty to serve credit or extra credit under an underserved market in the Plan. In this determination, FHFA will consider whether the activity facilitates a secondary market for financing mortgages: On manufactured homes for very low-, low-, and moderate-income families; to preserve housing affordable to very low-, low-, and moderate-income families; and on housing for very low-, low-, and moderate-income families in rural areas. If FHFA determines that an activity will receive duty to serve credit or extra credit under an underserved market in the Plan, the activity will receive such credit under the relevant evaluation area for each underserved market it serves.


(b) *No credit under any evaluation area.* Enterprise activities related to the following are not eligible to receive duty to serve credit under any evaluation area under an underserved market, even if the activity otherwise would receive credit under any other section of this subpart, except as provided in this section:


(1) Contributions to the Housing Trust Fund (12 U.S.C. 4568) and the Capital Magnet Fund (12 U.S.C. 4569), and mortgage purchases funded with such grant amounts;


(2) HOEPA mortgages;


(3) Subordinate liens on multifamily properties, except for subordinate liens originated for energy or water efficiency improvements on multifamily rental properties that meet the requirements in § 1282.34(d)(2);


(4) Subordinate liens on single-family properties, except for shared appreciation loans that satisfy all of the requirements in § 1282.34(d)(4) of this part;


(5) Low-Income Housing Tax Credit equity investments in a property, except where the property is located in a rural area;


(6) Permanent construction take-out loans and Additional Activities under the affordable housing preservation market, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section; and


(7) Any combination of factors in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section.


(c) *Credit for certain permanent construction take-out loans and Additional Activities under the affordable housing preservation market.* Enterprise activities related to permanent construction take-out loans and Additional Activities under the affordable housing preservation market are eligible for duty to serve credit, provided the following requirements are met, as applicable:


(1) *Permanent construction take-out loans.*—(i) The permanent construction take-out loans preserve existing subsidies on affordable housing with regulatory periods of required affordability that are at least as restrictive as the longest affordability restriction applicable to the subsidy or subsidies being preserved; or


(ii) The permanent construction take-out loans are for housing developed under state or local inclusionary zoning, real estate tax abatement, or loan programs, where the property owner has agreed to restrict a portion of the units for occupancy by very low-, low-, or moderate-income families, and to restrict the rents that can be charged for those units at affordable rents to those populations, or where the property is developed for a shared equity program that meets the requirements under § 1282.34(d)(4), and where there is a regulatory agreement, recorded use restriction, or deed restriction in place that maintains affordability for the term defined by the state or local program.


(2) *Additional Activities.* Additional Activities that either:


(i) Involve preserving existing subsidy where the term of affordability required for the subsidy is followed, or where there is a deed restriction for affordability for the life of the loan; or


(ii) Involve preserving the affordability of properties in conjunction with state or local inclusionary zoning, real estate tax abatement, or loan programs, where a regulatory agreement, recorded use restriction, or deed restriction maintains affordability of a portion of the property's units for the term defined by the state or local program.


(d) *No credit under loan purchase evaluation area.* The following activities are not eligible to receive duty to serve credit under the loan purchase evaluation area, even if the activity otherwise would receive duty to serve credit under § 1282.38:


(1) Purchases of mortgages to the extent they finance any dwelling units that are secondary residences;


(2) Single-family refinancing mortgages that result from conversion of balloon notes to fully amortizing notes, if the Enterprise already owns or has an interest in the balloon note at the time conversion occurs;


(3) Purchases of mortgages or interests in mortgages that previously received credit under any underserved market within the five years immediately preceding the current performance year;


(4) Purchases of mortgages where the property or any units within the property have not been approved for occupancy;


(5) Any interests in mortgages that FHFA determines will not be treated as interests in mortgages;


(6) Purchases of state and local government housing bonds except as provided in § 1282.39(h); and


(7) Any combination of factors in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(6) of this section.


(e) *FHFA review of activities or objectives.* FHFA may determine whether and how any activity or objective will receive duty to serve credit under an underserved market in a Plan, including treatment of missing data. FHFA will notify each Enterprise in writing of any determination regarding the treatment of any activity or objective. FHFA will make any such determinations available to the public on FHFA's Web site.


(f) *The year in which an activity or objective will receive credit.* An activity or objective that FHFA determines will receive duty to serve credit under an underserved market in a Plan will receive such credit in the year in which the activity or objective is completed. FHFA may determine that credit is appropriate for an activity or objective in which an Enterprise engages, but does not complete, in a particular year, except that activities or objectives under the loan purchase evaluation area will receive credit in the year in which the Enterprise purchased the mortgage.


(g) *Credit under one evaluation area.* An activity or objective will receive duty to serve credit under only one evaluation area in a particular underserved market.


(h) *Credit under multiple underserved markets.* An activity or objective, including financing of dwelling units by an Enterprise's mortgage purchase, will receive duty to serve credit under each underserved market for which the activity or objective qualifies in that year.
