# § 1290.2   Community support requirements.

(a) *Bank notice to members.* By a date designated by FHFA notice pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, each Bank must provide written notice to each of its members subject to community support review that each such member must submit to FHFA a completed Community Support Statement in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. Unless instructed otherwise by FHFA, the Bank must provide to each member a blank Community Support Statement Form upon request by the member. FHFA will provide a copy of this blank form to the Bank. Upon a member's request, the Bank must provide assistance to the member in completing the Community Support Statement.


(b) *Community Support Statement submission requirements.* Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, in each odd-numbered year, each member must submit to FHFA a completed Community Support Statement (and any other related information FHFA may require) in accordance with the submission dates designated by FHFA notice pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section. The member's completed Community Support Statement must be executed by an appropriate senior officer of the member and must be submitted to FHFA pursuant to FHFA's submission instructions.


(c) *Notice to public.*—(1) *By the Banks.* By a date designated by FHFA notice pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, each Bank must provide written notice to its Advisory Council, and to interested nonprofit housing developers, community groups, and other interested parties in its district, and include a notice on its public website, of the opportunity to submit comments on the community support programs and activities of Bank members, with the name and address of each member subject to community support review, and the deadline and FHFA contact information for submission of any comments to FHFA.


(2) *By FHFA.* FHFA may publish a notice in the *Federal Register* notifying the public of the opportunity to submit comments on the community support programs and activities of Bank members, with the deadline and FHFA contact information for submission of any comments to FHFA.


(3) *Consideration of comments.* In reviewing a member for compliance with the community support requirements, FHFA will take into consideration any public comments it has received concerning the member.


(d) *Non-Depository Community Development Financial Institutions.* A member that has been certified as a community development financial institution by the CDFI Fund, other than a member that also is an insured depository institution or a CDFI credit union (as defined in 12 CFR 1263.1), is deemed to be in compliance with the community support requirements of section 10(g) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1430(g)) and this part, by virtue of that certification. Such non-depository CDFIs, therefore, are not required to submit Community Support Statements to FHFA under paragraph (b) of this section and are not subject to community support review under this part.


(e) *New Bank members.* A member of a Bank is not required to submit a Community Support Statement under paragraph (b) of this section if the institution has been a member of a Bank for a total of less than one year as of March 31 of the year in which submissions are due under paragraph (b) of this section.


(f) *Designation of submission and notice dates.* FHFA will designate applicable dates for each biennial review cycle via written notice to the Banks. The notice will designate the date by which FHFA will begin accepting Community Support Statements and the date by which Community Support Statements must be submitted, as well as the dates by which the Banks must notify members under paragraph (a) of this section and the public under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. FHFA's written notice to the Banks will be issued at least 90 days prior to the date by which the Banks must notify members under paragraph (a).
