# § 1610.10   Centrally cleared repurchase agreement data.

(a) *Definitions.*

*Central counterparty* means a clearing agency that interposes itself between the counterparties to transactions, acting functionally as the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer.


*Clearing agency* has the same meaning as set forth in 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(23).


*Covered reporter* means any central counterparty for repurchase agreement transactions that meets the criteria set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; provided, however, that any covered reporter shall cease to be a covered reporter only if it does not meet the dollar threshold specified in paragraph (b)(2) for at least four consecutive calendar quarters.


*General collateral trade* means a repurchase agreement transaction in which the trade reported to the central counterparty is for a category of securities as opposed to a specific security.


*Repurchase agreement transaction* or transaction means an agreement of a counterparty to transfer securities to another counterparty in exchange for the receipt of cash, and the simultaneous agreement of the former counterparty to later reacquire the same securities (or any subsequently substituted securities) from that same counterparty in exchange for the payment of cash; or an agreement of a counterparty to acquire securities from another counterparty in exchange for the payment of cash, and the simultaneous agreement of the former party to later transfer back the same securities (or any subsequently substituted securities) to the latter counterparty in exchange for the receipt of cash.


*Specific-security trade* means a repurchase agreement transaction where the trade as reported to the central counterparty is for a mutually agreed upon specific security.


(b) *Purpose and scope*—(1) *Purpose.* The purpose of this data collection is to require the reporting of certain information to the Office about repurchase agreement transactions cleared through a central counterparty. The information will be used by the Office to support the Council and Council member agencies by facilitating financial stability monitoring including research consistent with support of the Council and its member agencies, and to support the calculation of certain reference rates.

(iii) If a covered reporter is able to effect a rulemaking through the Securities and Exchange Commission requiring each direct clearing member, counterparty, and broker associated with a repurchase agreement transaction to obtain an LEI and provide it to the covered reporter, the covered reporter shall begin reporting all data elements requiring an LEI other than its own pursuant to paragraphs (c)(3) through (5) of this section by the later of the effective date of its rulemaking, or 420 days April 22, 2019, and continue to report all data elements requiring a legal name or internal identifier until 365 days after the date the covered reporter begins reporting all data elements requiring an LEI pursuant to this section. If a covered reporter is unable to effect such a rulemaking, the covered reporter is not required to report any data elements requiring an LEI other than its own pursuant to paragraphs (c)(3) through (5) of this section, except, if available, the LEI for any direct clearing member, counterparty, or broker associated with a repurchase agreement transaction that has an LEI, and shall report all data elements requiring a legal name or internal identifier in any report submitted under this section regardless of whether the relevant entity has an LEI. A covered reporter shall report its own LEI in accordance with the schedules set forth in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
