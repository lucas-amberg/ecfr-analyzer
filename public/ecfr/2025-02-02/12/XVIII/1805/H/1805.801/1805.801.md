# ยง 1805.801   Assistance Agreement; sanctions.

(a) Prior to providing any Financial or Technical Assistance, the CDFI Fund and a Recipient shall execute an Assistance Agreement that requires a Recipient to comply with performance goals and abide by other terms and conditions of assistance. Such performance goals may be modified at any time by mutual consent of the CDFI Fund and a Recipient or as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. If a Community Partner or an Affiliate is part of an application that is selected for assistance, such partner must be a party to the Assistance Agreement, if deemed appropriate by the CDFI Fund.


(b) A Recipient shall comply with performance goals that have been established or negotiated with the CDFI Fund and which are based upon the Comprehensive Business Plan submitted as part of the Recipient's application. Such performance goals may include measures that require a Recipient to:


(1) Be financially sound;


(2) Be managerially sound;


(3) Maintain appropriate internal controls; and/or


(4) Achieve specific lending, investment, and development service objectives.


(c) The Assistance Agreement shall provide that, in the event of fraud, mismanagement, noncompliance with the Act and the CDFI Fund's regulations, or noncompliance with the terms and conditions of the Assistance Agreement on the part of the Recipient (or the Community Partner, if applicable), the CDFI Fund, in its discretion, may:


(1) Require changes in the performance goals set forth in the Assistance Agreement;


(2) Require changes in the Recipient's Comprehensive Business Plan;


(3) Revoke approval of the Recipient's application;


(4) Reduce or terminate the Recipient's assistance;


(5) Require repayment of any assistance that has been distributed to the Recipient;


(6) Bar the Recipient from reapplying for any assistance from the CDFI Fund; or


(7) Take such other actions as the CDFI Fund deems appropriate.


(d) In the case of an Insured CDFI, the Assistance Agreement shall provide that the provisions of the Act, this part, and the Assistance Agreement shall be enforceable under 12 U.S.C. 1818 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act by the Appropriate Federal Banking Agency, as applicable, and that any violation of such provisions shall be treated as a violation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Nothing in this paragraph (d) precludes the CDFI Fund from directly enforcing the Assistance Agreement as provided for under the terms of the Act.


(e) The CDFI Fund shall notify the Appropriate Federal Banking Agency before imposing any sanctions on an Insured CDFI or other institution that is examined by or subject to the reporting requirements of that agency. The CDFI Fund shall not impose a sanction described in paragraph (c) of this section if the Appropriate Federal Banking Agency, in writing, and to the satisfaction of the CDFI Fund, not later than 30 calendar days after receiving notice from the CDFI Fund:


(1) Objects to the proposed sanction;


(2) Determines that the sanction would:


(i) Have a material adverse effect on the safety and soundness of the institution; or


(ii) Impede or interfere with an enforcement action against that institution by that agency;


(3) Proposes a comparable alternative action; and


(4) Specifically explains:


(i) The basis for the determination under paragraph (e)(2) of this section and, if appropriate, provides documentation to support the determination; and


(ii) How the alternative action suggested pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section would be as effective as the sanction proposed by the CDFI Fund in securing compliance and deterring future noncompliance.


(f) In reviewing the performance of a Recipient in which its Investment Area(s) includes an Indian Reservation or Targeted Population(s) includes an Indian Tribe, the CDFI Fund shall consult with, and seek input from, the appropriate tribal government.


(g) Prior to imposing any sanctions pursuant to this section or an Assistance Agreement, the CDFI Fund shall, to the maximum extent practicable, provide the Recipient (or the Community Partner, if applicable) with written notice of the proposed sanction and an opportunity to comment. Nothing in this section, however, shall provide a Recipient or Community Partner with the right to any formal or informal hearing or comparable proceeding not otherwise required by law.
