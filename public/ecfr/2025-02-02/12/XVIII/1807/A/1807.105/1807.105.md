# § 1807.105   Waiver authority.

The CDFI Fund may waive any requirement of this part that is not required by law upon a determination of good cause. Each such waiver shall be in writing and supported by a statement of the facts and the grounds forming the basis of the waiver. For a waiver in an individual case, the CDFI Fund must determine that application of the requirement to be waived would not adversely affect achieving the purposes of the Act. For waivers of general applicability, the CDFI Fund will publish notification of granted waivers in the _Federal Register_.
