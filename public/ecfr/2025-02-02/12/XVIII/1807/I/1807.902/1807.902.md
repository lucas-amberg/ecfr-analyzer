# § 1807.902   Data collection and reporting.

(a) *Data; general.* The Recipient must maintain such records as may be prescribed by the CDFI Fund that are necessary to:


(1) Disclose the manner in which the CMF Award is used, including providing documentation to demonstrate Project Completion;


(2) Demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this part and the Assistance Agreement; and


(3) Evaluate the impact of the CMF Award.


(b) *Beneficiary demographics data.* The Recipient may be required to compile such data on the gender, race, ethnicity, national origin, or other information on individuals that are benefiting from the CMF Award, as the CDFI Fund shall prescribe in the Assistance Agreement. Such data will be used to determine whether residents of the Recipient's Service Area are adequately served and to evaluate the impact of the CMF Award.


(c) *Access to records.* The Recipient must submit financial and activity reports, records, statements, and documents at such times, in such forms, and accompanied by such reporting data, as required by the CDFI Fund or the U.S. Department of the Treasury to ensure compliance with the requirements of this part and to evaluate the impact of the CMF Award. The United States Government, including the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Comptroller General, and their duly authorized representatives, shall have full and free access to the Recipient's offices and facilities and all books, documents, records, and financial statements relating to use of Federal funds and may copy such documents as they deem appropriate and audit or provide for an audit at least annually. The CDFI Fund, if it deems appropriate, may prescribe access to record requirements for entities that receive a CMF Award from the Recipient.


(d) *Retention of records.* The Recipient shall comply with all applicable record retention requirements set forth in the Uniform Administrative Requirements (as applicable), the Assistance Agreement and the applicable NOFA.


(e) *Data collection and reporting*—(1) *Financial reporting.* (i) All nonprofit organization Recipients that are required to have their financial statements audited pursuant to the Uniform Administrative Requirements, must submit their single-audits by a time set forth in the applicable NOFA or Assistance Agreement. Nonprofit organization Recipients (excluding Insured CDFIs and State-Insured Credit Unions) that are not required to have financial statements audited pursuant to the Uniform Administrative Requirements, must submit to the CDFI Fund a statement signed by the Recipient's authorized representative or certified public accountant, asserting that the Recipient is not required to have a single-audit pursuant to the Uniform Administrative Requirements as indicated in the Assistance Agreement. In such instances, the CDFI Fund may require additional audits to be performed and/or submitted to the CDFI Fund as stated in the applicable Notice of Funds Availability and Assistance Agreement.


(ii) For-profit Recipients (excluding Insured CDFIs and State-Insured Credit Unions) must submit to the CDFI Fund financial statements audited in conformity with generally accepted auditing standards as promulgated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants by a time set forth in the applicable NOFA or Assistance Agreement.


(iii) Regulated financial institutions (Insured Depository Institutions, Depository Institution Holding Companies, and Insured Credit Unions), including regulated nonprofit organizations, must submit to the CDFI Fund financial statements audited in conformity with generally accepted auditing standards as promulgated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants by a time set forth in the applicable NOFA or Assistance Agreement.


(2) *Annual report.* (i) The Recipient shall submit a performance and financial report that shall be specified in the Assistance Agreement (annual report). The annual report consists of several components which may include, but are not limited to, a report on performance goals and measures, explanation of any Recipient noncompliance, and such other information as may be required by the CDFI Fund. The annual report components shall be specified and described in the Assistance Agreement.


(ii) The CDFI Fund will use the annual report to collect data to assess the Recipient's compliance with its performance goals and the impact of the CMF and the CDFI industry.


(iii) The Recipient is responsible for the timely and complete submission of the annual report, even if all or a portion of the documents actually are completed by another entity. If such other entities are required to provide information for the annual report, or such other documentation that the CDFI Fund might require, the Recipient is responsible for ensuring that the information is submitted timely and complete. The CDFI Fund reserves the right to contact such other entities and require that additional information and documentation be provided.


(iv) The CDFI Fund's review of the compliance of an Insured CDFI, a Depository Institution Holding Company or a State-Insured Credit Union with the terms and conditions of its Assistance Agreement may also include information from the Appropriate Federal Banking Agency or Appropriate State Agency, as the case may be.
