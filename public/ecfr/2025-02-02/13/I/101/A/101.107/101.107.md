# ยง 101.107   What SBA forms are approved for public use?

(a) SBA uses forms approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 *et seq.*), as amended. You may obtain approved forms for use by the public when applying for or obtaining SBA assistance, or when providing services for SBA, from any field office (see ยง 101.103). You may also use forms which you have prepared yourself, or have obtained from another source, if those forms are identical in every respect to the forms approved by OMB for the same purpose. 


(b) Any member of the public who has reason to believe any SBA office or agent is in violation of the Public Protection Clause of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3512 and see 5 CFR 1320.6) should notify SBA. Direct such comments to the Director, Office of Business Operations at 409 3rd Street, SW., Washington, DC 20416.
