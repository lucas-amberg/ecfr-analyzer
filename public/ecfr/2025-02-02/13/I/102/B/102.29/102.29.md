# ยง 102.29   Requests for an accounting of record disclosures.

(a) *How made and addressed.* Except where accountings of disclosures are not required to be kept (as stated in paragraph (b) of this section), an individual may make a request for an accounting of any disclosure that has been made by the SBA to another person, organization, or agency of any record in a system of records about him or her. This accounting contains the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure, as well as the name and address of the person, organization, or agency to which the disclosure was made. The request for an accounting should identify each particular record in question and should be made by writing directly to the SBA office that maintains the record, following the procedures in ยง 102.24.


(b) *Where accountings are not required.* Offices are not required to provide accountings where they relate to:


(1) Disclosures for which accountings are not required to be kept; disclosures that are made to employees within the SBA and disclosures that are made under the FOIA;


(2) Disclosures made to law enforcement agencies for authorized law enforcement activities in response to written requests from those law enforcement agencies specifying the civil or criminal law enforcement activities for which the disclosures are sought; or


(3) Disclosures made from law enforcement systems of records that have been exempted from accounting requirements under Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) or (k) by notice published in the _Federal Register._

(c) *Appeals.* An individual may appeal a denial of a request for an accounting to the FOI/PA Office in the same manner as a denial of a request for access to records (see ยง 102.27), and the same procedures will be followed.
