(a) *Types of Leverageable available.* You may apply for Leverage from SBA in one or both of the following forms:


(1) The purchase or guarantee of your Debentures.


(2) The purchase or guarantee of your Participating Securities.


(b) *Applying for Leverage.* The Leverage application process has two parts. You must first apply for SBA's conditional commitment to reserve a specific amount of Leverage for your future use. You may then apply to draw down Leverage against the commitment. See §§ 107.1200 through 107.1240.
