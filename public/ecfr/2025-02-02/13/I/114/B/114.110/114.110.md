# ยง 114.110   What is SBA's policy with respect to indemnifying and providing legal representation to SBA employees?

(a) If an SBA employee engages in conduct, within the scope of his or her employment, which gives rise to a claim, and the SBA Administrator or designee determines that any of the following actions relating to the claim are in SBA's interest, SBA may: 


(1) Indemnify the employee after a verdict, judgment, or other monetary award is rendered personally against the employee in any civil suit in state or federal court or any arbitration proceeding; 


(2) Settle or compromise the claim; and/or 


(3) Pay for, or request that the Department of Justice provide, legal representation to the employee once personally named in such a suit. 


(b) If you are an SBA employee, you may ask SBA to settle or compromise your claim, provide you with legal representation, or provide you with indemnification for a verdict, judgment or award entered against you in a suit. To do so, you must submit a timely, written request to the General Counsel, with appropriate documentation, including copies of any pleadings, verdict, judgment, award, or settlement proposal. The General Counsel will decide all requests for representation or settlement, and will forward to the Administrator, with the accompanying documentation and a recommendation, any requests for indemnification. 


(c) Any payments by SBA under this section will be contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds.
