# § 120.463   Regulatory accounting—What are SBA's regulatory accounting requirements for SBA Supervised Lenders?

(a) *Books and records.* The books and records of an SBA Supervised Lender must be kept on an accrual basis in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) as promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), supplemented by Regulatory Accounting Principles (RAP) as identified by SBA in Policy, Procedural or Information Notices, from time to time.


(b) *Annual audit.* Each SBA Supervised Lender must have its financial statements audited annually by a certified public accountant experienced in auditing financial institutions. The audit must be performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards as adopted by the Auditing Standards Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) for non-public companies and by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) for public companies. Annually, the auditor must issue an audit report with an opinion as to the fairness of the SBA Supervised Lender's financial statements and their compliance with GAAP.


(c) *Auditor qualifications.* The audit shall be conducted by an independent certified public accountant who:


(1) Is registered or licensed to practice as a certified public accountant, and is in good standing, under the laws of the state or other political subdivision of the United States in which the SBA Supervised Lender's principal office is located;


(2) Agrees in the engagement letter with the SBA Supervised Lender to provide the SBA with access to and copies of any work papers, policies, and procedures relating to the services performed;


(3)(i) Is in compliance with the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct; and


(ii) Meets the independence requirements and interpretations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and its staff;


(4) Has received a peer review or is enrolled in a peer review program, that meets AICPA guidelines; and


(5) Is otherwise acceptable to SBA.


(d) *Change of auditor.* If an SBA Supervised Lender discharges or changes its auditor, it must notify SBA in writing within ten days of the occurrence. Such notification must provide:


(1) The name, address, and telephone number of the discharged auditor; and


(2) If the discharge/change involved a dispute over the financial statements, a reasonably detailed statement of all the reasons for the discharge or change. This statement must set out the issue in dispute, the position of the auditor, the position of the SBA Supervised Lender, and the effect of each position on the balance sheet and income statement of the SBA Supervised Lender.


(e) *Specific accounting requirements.* (1) Each SBA Supervised Lender must maintain an allowance for losses on loans and other assets that is sufficient to absorb all probable and estimated losses that may reasonably be expected based on the SBA Supervised Lender's historical performance and reasonably-anticipated events. Each SBA Supervised Lender must maintain documentation of its loan loss allowance calculations and analysis in sufficient detail to permit the SBA to understand the assumptions used and the application of those assumptions to the assets of the SBA Supervised Lender.


(2) The unguaranteed portions of loans determined to be uncollectible must be charged-off promptly. If the portion determined to be uncollectible by the SBA Supervised Lender is different from the amount determined by its auditors or the SBA, the SBA Supervised Lender must charge-off such amount as the SBA may direct.


(3) Each SBA Supervised Lender must classify loans as:


(i) “Nonaccrual,” if any portion of the principal or interest is determined to be uncollectible and


(ii) “Formally restructured,” if the loan meets the “troubled debt restructuring” definition set forth in FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 15, Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructurings.


(4) When one loan to a borrower is classified as nonaccrual or formally restructured, all loans to that borrower must be so classified unless the SBA Supervised Lender can document that the loans have independent sources of repayment.


(f) *Valuing loan servicing rights and residual interests.* Each SBA Supervised Lender must account for loan sales transactions and the valuation of loan servicing rights in accordance with GAAP. At the end of each quarter, the SBA Supervised Lender must review for reasonableness the existing environmental assumptions used in the valuation. Particular attention must be given to interest rate and repayment rate assumptions. Assumptions considered no longer reasonable must be modified and modifications must be reflected in the valuation and must be documented and supported by a market analysis. Work papers reflecting the analysis of assumptions and any resulting adjustment in the valuation must be maintained for SBA review in accordance with § 120.461. SBA may require an SBA Supervised Lender to use industry averages for the valuation of servicing rights.
