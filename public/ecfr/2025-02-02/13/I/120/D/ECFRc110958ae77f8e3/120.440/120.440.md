# ยง 120.440   How does a 7(a) Lender obtain delegated authority?

(a) In making its decision to grant or renew a delegated authority, SBA considers whether the Lender, as determined by SBA in its discretion:


(1) Has the continuing ability to evaluate, process, close, disburse, service, liquidate and litigate SBA loans. This includes the ability to develop and analyze complete loan packages. SBA may consider the experience and capability of Lender's management and staff.


(2) Has satisfactory SBA performance (as defined in ยง 120.410(a)(2));


(3) Is in compliance with SBA Loan Program Requirements (*e.g.,* Form 1502 reporting, timely payment of all fees to SBA);


(4) Has completed to SBA's satisfaction all required corrective actions;


(5) Whether Lender is subject to any enforcement action, order or agreement with a regulator or the presence of other regulatory concerns as determined by SBA; and


(6) Whether Lender exhibits other risk factors (*e.g.,* has rapid growth; low SBA activity; SBA loan volume; Lender, an officer or director is under investigation or indictment).


(b) Delegated authority decisions are made by the appropriate SBA official in accordance with Delegations of Authority, and are final.


(c) If delegated authority is approved or renewed, Lender must execute a Supplemental Guarantee Agreement, which will specify a term not to exceed two years. SBA may grant shortened renewals based on risk or any of the other delegated authority criteria. Lenders with less than 3 years of SBA lending experience will be limited to a term of 1 year or less.
