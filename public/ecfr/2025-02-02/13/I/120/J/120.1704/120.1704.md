(b) *SBA review of a Pool Loan prior to pool formation.* SBA has the right to review any Pool Loan before a Loan Interest in it is added to a Pool, and SBA may prohibit the Pool's formation as proposed based on SBA's review in SBA's sole discretion. In the event SBA decides to review Pool Loan documents related to a Loan Interest prior to the requested Pool formation, that Loan Interest may not be added to the Pool until SBA reviews and approves the Pool Loan for such purpose. Copies of Pool Loan documents related to underwriting and origination, and any other Pool Loan-related documents SBA may, in its sole discretion, request to review in writing, must be sent to SBA's Sacramento Pool Loan Processing Center. The Pool Originator must identify and SBA must review Pool Loan documents before a Loan Interest is added to a Pool if:


(1) The Pool Loan is to a business within NAICS code 713940 covering Fitness and Recreational Sports Centers; (If SBA determines that a Pool Loan has had any of its proceeds used for any of the restricted purposes listed above, the Pool Loan will be prohibited from being part of a Pool.)


(2) The Pool Loan was part of a 504 financing involving a 504 loan that was processed under SBA's Premier Certified Lenders Program; or


(3) The Project the Pool Loan financed included the refinancing of existing debt owed to the Seller or Third Party Lender (not including interim financing associated with the Project).
