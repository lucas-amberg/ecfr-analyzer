# ยง 123.14   How does the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act of 1990 apply?

(a) Under the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act of 1990 (28 U.S.C. 3201(e)), a debtor who owns property which is subject to an outstanding judgment lien for a debt owed to the United States generally is not eligible to receive a disaster loan. The SBA Associate Administrator for Disaster Assistance, or designee, may waive this restriction as to disaster loans (except IDAP loans) upon a demonstration of good cause. Good cause means a written representation by you under oath which convinces SBA that: 


(1) The declared disaster was a major contributing factor to the delinquency which led to the judgment lien, regardless of when the original debt was incurred; or 


(2) The disaster directly prevented you from fulfilling the terms of an agreement with SBA or any other Federal Government entity to satisfy its pre-disaster judgment lien; in this situation, the judgment creditor must certify to SBA that you were complying with the agreement to satisfy the judgment lien when the disaster occurred; or 


(3) Other circumstances exist which would justify a waiver. 


(b) The waiver determination by the Associate Administrator for Disaster Assistance, or designee, is a final, non-appealable decision. The granting of a waiver does not include loan approval; a waiver recipient must then follow normal loan application procedures.
