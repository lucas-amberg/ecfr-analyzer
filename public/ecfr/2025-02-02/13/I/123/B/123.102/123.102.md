# ยง 123.102   What circumstances would justify my relocating?

SBA may approve a loan if you intend to relocate outside the business area in which the disaster has occurred if your relocation is caused by such special or unusual circumstances as: 


(a) Demonstrable risk that the business area will suffer future disasters; 


(b) A change in employment status (such as loss of job, transfer, lack of adequate job opportunities within the business area or scheduled retirement within 18 months after the disaster occurs); 


(c) Medical reasons; or 


(d) Special family considerations which necessitate a move outside of the business area.
