A prospective IDAP Borrower must apply to an IDAP Lender for an IDAP loan by the application deadline for prospective IDAP Borrowers established by SBA in the IDAP-Eligible Disaster Declaration. If the IDAP Lender approves the application, it must submit a request for IDAP loan approval to SBA by the application deadline for IDAP Lenders established by SBA in the IDAP-Eligible Disaster Declaration. SBA will issue an approval or a decline of the IDAP Lender's request within 36 hours of receipt by SBA. A prospective IDAP Borrower will receive notice of approval or decline of its loan application from the IDAP Lender. Notice of decline will include the reasons. If an IDAP loan is approved, a loan authorization will be issued.
