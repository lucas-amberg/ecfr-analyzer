(a) For VA procurements, a contracting officer may award at or below the simplified acquisition threshold as set forth in the VAAR.


(b) For non-VA procurements, if a SDVOSB requirement is at or below the simplified acquisition threshold, the contracting officer may set aside the requirement for consideration among SDVOSBs using simplified acquisition procedures or may award a sole source contract to an SDVOSB.
