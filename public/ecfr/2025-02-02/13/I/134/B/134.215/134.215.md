# ยง 134.215   Interlocutory appeals.

(a) *General.* A motion for leave to take an interlocutory appeal from a Judge's ruling will not be entertained in those proceedings in which OHA issues final decisions. In all other cases, an interlocutory appeal will be permitted only if, upon motion by a party, or upon the Judge's own initiative, the Judge certifies that his or her ruling raises a question which is immediately appealable. Interlocutory appeals will be decided by the AA/OHA or a designee. 


(b) *Motion for certification.* A party must file and serve a motion for certification no later than 20 days after issuance of the ruling to which the motion applies. A denial of the motion does not preclude objections to the ruling in any subsequent request for review of an initial decision. 


(c) *Basis for certification.* The Judge will certify a ruling for interlocutory appeal only if he or she determines that: 


(1) The ruling involves an important question of law or policy about which there is substantial ground for a difference of opinion; and 


(2) An interlocutory appeal will materially expedite resolution of the case, or denial of an interlocutory appeal would cause undue hardship to a party. 


(d) *Stay of proceedings.* A stay while an interlocutory appeal is pending will be at the discretion of the Judge.
