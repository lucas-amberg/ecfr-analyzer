# ยง 134.407   Evidence beyond the record and discovery.

(a) Except in suspension appeals, the Administrative Law Judge may not admit evidence beyond the written administrative record nor permit any form of discovery unless he or she first determines that the petitioner, upon written submission, has made a substantial showing, based on credible evidence and not mere allegation, that the Agency determination in question may have resulted from bad faith or improper behavior.


(1) Prior to any such determination, the Administrative Law Judge must permit SBA to respond in writing to any allegations of bad faith or improper behavior.


(2) Upon a determination by the Administrative Law Judge that the petitioner has made such a substantial showing, the Administrative Law Judge may permit appropriate discovery, and accept relevant evidence beyond the written administrative record, which is specifically limited to the alleged bad faith or improper behavior.


(b) A determination by the Administrative Law Judge that the required showing set forth in paragraph (a) of this section has been made does not shift the burden of proof, which continues to rest with the petitioner.
