(a) Any investigating official may: 


(1) Refer allegations of criminal misconduct directly to the Department of Justice for prosecution or for suit under the False Claims Act or other civil proceeding; 


(2) Defer or postpone a report or referral to the reviewing official to avoid interference with a criminal investigation or prosecution; or 


(3) Issue subpoenas under other statutory authority.


(b) Nothing in this part limits the requirement that SBA employees report suspected violations of criminal law to the SBA Office of Inspector General or to the Attorney General.
