# ยง 11.101   May I ask FAA to reconsider my petition for rulemaking or petition for exemption if it is denied?

Yes, you may petition FAA to reconsider your petition denial. You must submit your request to the address to which you sent your original petition, and FAA must receive it within 60 days after we issued the denial. For us to accept your petition, show the following: 


(a) That you have a significant additional fact and why you did not present it in your original petition; 


(b) That we made an important factual error in our denial of your original petition; or


(c) That we did not correctly interpret a law, regulation, or precedent.
