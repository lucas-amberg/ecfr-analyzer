# ยง 11.87   Are there circumstances in which FAA may decide not to publish a summary of my petition for exemption?

The FAA may not publish a summary of your petition for exemption and request comments if you present or we find good cause why we should not delay action on your petition. The factors we consider in deciding not to request comment include: 


(a) Whether granting your petition would set a precedent. 


(b) Whether the relief requested is identical to exemptions granted previously. 


(c) Whether our delaying action on your petition would affect you adversely. 


(d) Whether you filed your petition in a timely manner.
