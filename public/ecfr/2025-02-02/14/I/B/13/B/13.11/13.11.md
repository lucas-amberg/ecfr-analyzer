# § 13.11   Administrative disposition of certain violations.

(a) If, after an investigation, FAA personnel determine that an apparent violation of 49 U.S.C. subtitle VII, 49 U.S.C. chapter 51, or any rule, regulation, or order issued under those statutes, does not require legal enforcement action, an appropriate FAA official may take administrative action to address the apparent violation.


(b) An administrative action under this section does not constitute a formal adjudication of the matter, and may take the form of—


(1) A Warning Notice that recites available facts and information about the incident or condition and indicates that it may have been a violation; or


(2) A Letter of Correction that states the corrective action the apparent violator has taken or agrees to take. If the apparent violator does not complete the agreed corrective action, the FAA may take legal enforcement action.
