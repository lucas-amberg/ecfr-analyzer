(b) The applicant must apply for the issue of a type or supplemental type certificate for the aircraft.

(2) The aircraft substantially meets the applicable flight characteristic requirements for the type or supplemental type certificate applied for; and 


(3) The aircraft can be operated safely under the appropriate operating limitations specified in paragraph (a) of this section. 


(d) The applicant must submit a report showing that the aircraft had been flown in all maneuvers necessary to show compliance with the flight requirements for the issue of the type or supplemental type certificate applied for, and to establish that the aircraft can be operated safely in accordance with the limitations contained in this subchapter. 


(e) The applicant must establish all limitations required for the issue of the type or supplemental type certificate applied for, including limitations on weights, speeds, flight maneuvers, loading, and operation of controls and equipment unless, for each limitation not so established, appropriate operating restrictions are established for the aircraft.
