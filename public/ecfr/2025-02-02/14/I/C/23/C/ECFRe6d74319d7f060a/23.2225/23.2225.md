# § 23.2225   Component loading conditions.

The applicant must determine the structural design loads acting on:


(a) Each engine mount and its supporting structure such that both are designed to withstand loads resulting from—


(1) Powerplant operation combined with flight gust and maneuver loads; and


(2) For non-reciprocating powerplants, sudden powerplant stoppage.


(b) Each flight control and high-lift surface, their associated system and supporting structure resulting from—


(1) The inertia of each surface and mass balance attachment;


(2) Flight gusts and maneuvers;


(3) Pilot or automated system inputs;


(4) System induced conditions, including jamming and friction; and


(5) Taxi, takeoff, and landing operations on the applicable surface, including downwind taxi and gusts occurring on the applicable surface.


(c) A pressurized cabin resulting from the pressurization differential—


(1) From zero up to the maximum relief pressure combined with gust and maneuver loads;


(2) From zero up to the maximum relief pressure combined with ground and water loads if the airplane may land with the cabin pressurized; and


(3) At the maximum relief pressure multiplied by 1.33, omitting all other loads.
