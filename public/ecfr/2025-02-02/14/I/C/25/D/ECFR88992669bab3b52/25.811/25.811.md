# § 25.811   Emergency exit marking.

(a) Each passenger emergency exit, its means of access, and its means of opening must be conspicuously marked. 


(b) The identity and location of each passenger emergency exit must be recognizable from a distance equal to the width of the cabin. 


(c) Means must be provided to assist the occupants in locating the exits in conditions of dense smoke. 


(d) The location of each passenger emergency exit must be indicated by a sign visible to occupants approaching along the main passenger aisle (or aisles). There must be—


(1) A passenger emergency exit locator sign above the aisle (or aisles) near each passenger emergency exit, or at another overhead location if it is more practical because of low headroom, except that one sign may serve more than one exit if each exit can be seen readily from the sign; 


(2) A passenger emergency exit marking sign next to each passenger emergency exit, except that one sign may serve two such exits if they both can be seen readily from the sign; and 


(3) A sign on each bulkhead or divider that prevents fore and aft vision along the passenger cabin to indicate emergency exits beyond and obscured by the bulkhead or divider, except that if this is not possible the sign may be placed at another appropriate location. 


(e) The location of the operating handle and instructions for opening exits from the inside of the airplane must be shown in the following manner: 


(1) Each passenger emergency exit must have, on or near the exit, a marking that is readable from a distance of 30 inches. 


(2) Each Type A, Type B, Type C or Type I passenger emergency exit operating handle must—


(i) Be self-illuminated with an initial brightness of at least 160 microlamberts; or 


(ii) Be conspicuously located and well illuminated by the emergency lighting even in conditions of occupant crowding at the exit. 


(3) [Reserved]


(4) Each Type A, Type B, Type C, Type I, or Type II passenger emergency exit with a locking mechanism released by rotary motion of the handle must be marked—


(i) With a red arrow, with a shaft at least three-fourths of an inch wide and a head twice the width of the shaft, extending along at least 70 degrees of arc at a radius approximately equal to three-fourths of the handle length. 


(ii) So that the centerline of the exit handle is within ±1 inch of the projected point of the arrow when the handle has reached full travel and has released the locking mechanism, and 


(iii) With the word “open” in red letters 1 inch high, placed horizontally near the head of the arrow. 


(f) Each emergency exit that is required to be openable from the outside, and its means of opening, must be marked on the outside of the airplane. In addition, the following apply: 


(1) The outside marking for each passenger emergency exit in the side of the fuselage must include a 2-inch colored band outlining the exit. 


(2) Each outside marking including the band, must have color contrast to be readily distinguishable from the surrounding fuselage surface. The contrast must be such that if the reflectance of the darker color is 15 percent or less, the reflectance of the lighter color must be at least 45 percent. “Reflectance” is the ratio of the luminous flux reflected by a body to the luminous flux it receives. When the reflectance of the darker color is greater than 15 percent, at least a 30-percent difference between its reflectance and the reflectance of the lighter color must be provided. 


(3) In the case of exists other than those in the side of the fuselage, such as ventral or tailcone exists, the external means of opening, including instructions if applicable, must be conspicuously marked in red, or bright chrome yellow if the background color is such that red is inconspicuous. When the opening means is located on only one side of the fuselage, a conspicuous marking to that effect must be provided on the other side. 


(g) Each sign required by paragraph (d) of this section may use the word “exit” in its legend in place of the term “emergency exit”.
