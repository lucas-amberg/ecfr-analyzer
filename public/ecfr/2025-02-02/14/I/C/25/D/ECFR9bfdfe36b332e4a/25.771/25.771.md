# ยง 25.771   Pilot compartment.

(a) Each pilot compartment and its equipment must allow the minimum flight crew (established under ยง 25.1523) to perform their duties without unreasonable concentration or fatigue. 


(b) The primary controls listed in ยง 25.779(a), excluding cables and control rods, must be located with respect to the propellers so that no member of the minimum flight crew (established under ยง 25.1523), or part of the controls, lies in the region between the plane of rotation of any inboard propeller and the surface generated by a line passing through the center of the propeller hub making an angle of five degrees forward or aft of the plane of rotation of the propeller. 


(c) If provision is made for a second pilot, the airplane must be controllable with equal safety from either pilot seat. 


(d) The pilot compartment must be constructed so that, when flying in rain or snow, it will not leak in a manner that will distract the crew or harm the structure. 


(e) Vibration and noise characteristics of cockpit equipment may not interfere with safe operation of the airplane.
