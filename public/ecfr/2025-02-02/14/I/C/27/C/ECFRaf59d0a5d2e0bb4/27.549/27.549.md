# § 27.549   Fuselage, landing gear, and rotor pylon structures.

(a) Each fuselage, landing gear, and rotor pylon structure must be designed as prescribed in this section. Resultant rotor forces may be represented as a single force applied at the rotor hub attachment point. 


(b) Each structure must be designed to withstand—


(1) The critical loads prescribed in §§ 27.337 through 27.341; 


(2) The applicable ground loads prescribed in §§ 27.235, 27.471 through 27.485, 27.493, 27.497, 27.501, 27.505, and 27.521; and 


(3) The loads prescribed in § 27.547 (d)(2) and (e). 


(c) Auxiliary rotor thrust, and the balancing air and inertia loads occurring under accelerated flight conditions, must be considered. 


(d) Each engine mount and adjacent fuselage structure must be designed to withstand the loads occurring under accelerated flight and landing conditions, including engine torque.
