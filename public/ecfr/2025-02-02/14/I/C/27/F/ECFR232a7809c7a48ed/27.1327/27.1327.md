# § 27.1327   Magnetic direction indicator.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section—


(1) Each magnetic direction indicator must be installed so that its accuracy is not excessively affected by the rotorcraft's vibration or magnetic fields; and 


(2) The compensated installation may not have a deviation, in level flight, greater than 10 degrees on any heading. 


(b) A magnetic nonstabilized direction indicator may deviate more than 10 degrees due to the operation of electrically powered systems such as electrically heated windshields if either a magnetic stabilized direction indicator, which does not have a deviation in level flight greater than 10 degrees on any heading, or a gyroscopic direction indicator, is installed. Deviations of a magnetic nonstabilized direction indicator of more than 10 degrees must be placarded in accordance with § 27.1547(e).
