# § 29.505   Ski landing conditions.

If certification for ski operation is requested, the rotorcraft, with skis, must be designed to withstand the following loading conditions (where *P* is the maximum static weight on each ski with the rotorcraft at design maximum weight, and *n* is the limit load factor determined under § 29.473(b)): 


(a) Up-load conditions in which—


(1) A vertical load of *Pn* and a horizontal load of *Pn/4* are simultaneously applied at the pedestal bearings; and 


(2) A vertical load of 1.33 *P* is applied at the pedestal bearings. 


(b) A side load condition in which a side load of 0.35 *Pn* is applied at the pedestal bearings in a horizontal plane perpendicular to the centerline of the rotorcraft. 


(c) A torque-load condition in which a torque load of 1.33 *P* (in foot-pounds) is applied to the ski about the vertical axis through the centerline of the pedestal bearings.
