# ยง 29.727   Reserve energy absorption drop test.

The reserve energy absorption drop test must be conducted as follows: 


(a) The drop height must be 1.5 times that specified in ยง 29.725(a). 


(b) Rotor lift, where considered in a manner similar to that prescribed in ยง 29.725(b), may not exceed 1.5 times the lift allowed under that paragraph. 


(c) The landing gear must withstand this test without collapsing. Collapse of the landing gear occurs when a member of the nose, tail, or main gear will not support the rotorcraft in the proper attitude or allows the rotorcraft structure, other than landing gear and external accessories, to impact the landing surface.
