# § 29.1163   Powerplant accessories.

(a) Each engine mounted accessory must—


(1) Be approved for mounting on the engine involved;


(2) Use the provisions on the engine for mounting; and 


(3) Be sealed in such a way as to prevent contamination of the engine oil system and the accessory system.


(b) Electrical equipment subject to arcing or sparking must be installed, to minimize the probability of igniting flammable fluids or vapors. 


(c) If continued rotation of an engine-driven cabin supercharger or any remote accessory driven by the engine will be a hazard if they malfunction, there must be means to prevent their hazardous rotation without interfering with the continued operation of the engine. 


(d) Unless other means are provided, torque limiting means must be provided for accessory drives located on any component of the transmission and rotor drive system to prevent damage to these components from excessive accessory load.
