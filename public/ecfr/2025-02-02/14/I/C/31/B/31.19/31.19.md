(1) The maximum vertical velocity attained. 


(2) The altitude loss from the point of failure to the point at which maximum vertical velocity is attained. 


(3) The altitude required to achieve level flight after corrective action is inititated, with the balloon descending at the maximum vertical velocity determined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
