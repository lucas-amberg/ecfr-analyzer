(a) A sponsor may apply for and the responsible Flight Standards office may issue an interim qualification level for an FSTD for a new type or model of aircraft, even though the aircraft manufacturer's aircraft data package is preliminary, if the sponsor provides the following to the satisfaction of the responsible Flight Standards office—

(2) The aircraft manufacturer's description of the prediction methodology used to develop the predicted data; and

Interim qualification terminates two years after its issuance, unless the responsible Flight Standards office determines that specific conditions warrant otherwise.


(c) Within twelve months of the release of the final aircraft data package by the aircraft manufacturer, but no later than two years after the issuance of the interim qualification status, the sponsor must apply for initial qualification in accordance with § 60.15 based on the final aircraft data package approved by the aircraft manufacturer, unless the responsible Flight Standards office determines that specific conditions warrant otherwise.


(d) An FSTD with interim qualification may be modified only in accordance with § 60.23.
