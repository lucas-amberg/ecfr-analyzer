(a) *Use of a flight simulator or flight training device.* If an applicant for a certificate or rating uses a flight simulator or flight training device for training or any portion of the practical test, the flight simulator and flight training device—


(1) Must represent the category, class, and type (if a class or type rating is applicable) for the rating sought; and


(2) Must be qualified and approved by the Administrator and used in accordance with an approved course of training under part 141 or part 142 of this chapter; or under part 121 or part 135 of this chapter, provided the applicant is a pilot employee of that air carrier operator.


(b) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, if an airplane is not used during the practical test for a type rating for a turbojet airplane (except for preflight inspection), an applicant must accomplish the entire practical test in a Level C or higher flight simulator and the applicant must—


(1) Hold a type rating in a turbojet airplane of the same class of airplane for which the type rating is sought, and that type rating may not contain a supervised operating experience limitation;


(2) Have 1,000 hours of flight time in two different turbojet airplanes of the same class of airplane for which the type rating is sought;


(3) Have been appointed by the U.S. Armed Forces as pilot in command in a turbojet airplane of the same class of airplane for which the type rating is sought;


(4) Have 500 hours of flight time in the same type of airplane for which the type rating is sought; or


(5) Have logged at least 2,000 hours of flight time, of which 500 hours were in turbine-powered airplanes of the same class of airplane for which the type rating is sought.


(c) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, if an airplane is not used during the practical test for a type rating for a turbo-propeller airplane (except for preflight inspection), an applicant must accomplish the entire practical test in a Level C or higher flight simulator and the applicant must—


(1) Hold a type rating in a turbo-propeller airplane of the same class of airplane for which the type rating is sought, and that type rating may not contain a supervised operating experience limitation;


(2) Have 1,000 hours of flight time in two different turbo-propeller airplanes of the same class of airplane for which the type rating is sought;


(3) Have been appointed by the U.S. Armed Forces as pilot in command in a turbo-propeller airplane of the same class of airplane for which the type rating is sought;


(4) Have 500 hours of flight time in the same type of airplane for which the type rating is sought; or


(5) Have logged at least 2,000 hours of flight time, of which 500 hours were in turbine-powered airplanes of the same class of airplane for which the type rating is sought.


(d) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, if a helicopter is not used during the practical test for a type rating in a helicopter (except for preflight inspection), an applicant must accomplish the entire practical test in a Level C or higher flight simulator and the applicant must meet one of the following requirements—


(1) Hold a type rating in a helicopter and that type rating may not contain the supervised operating experience limitation;


(2) Have been appointed by the U.S. Armed Forces as pilot in command of a helicopter;


(3) Have 500 hours of flight time in the type of helicopter; or


(4) Have 1,000 hours of flight time in two different types of helicopters.


(e) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, if a powered-lift is not used during the practical test for a type rating in a powered-lift (except for preflight inspection), an applicant must accomplish the entire practical test in a Level C or higher flight simulator and have 500 hours of flight time in the type of powered-lift for which the rating is sought.


(f) If the applicant does not meet one of the experience requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (5), paragraphs (c)(1) through (5), paragraphs (d)(1) through (4), or paragraph (e) of this section, as appropriate to the type rating sought, then—


(1) The applicant must complete the following tasks on the practical test in an aircraft appropriate to category, class, and type for the rating sought: Preflight inspection, normal takeoff, normal instrument landing system approach, missed approach, and normal landing; or


(2) The applicant's pilot certificate will be issued with a limitation that states: “The [name of the additional type rating] is subject to pilot in command limitations,” and the applicant is restricted from serving as pilot in command in an aircraft of that type.


(g) The limitation described under paragraph (f)(2) of this section may be removed from the pilot certificate if the applicant complies with the following—


(1) Performs 25 hours of flight time in an aircraft of the appropriate category, class (if a class rating is required), and type for which the limitation applies under the direct observation of the pilot in command who holds a category, class (if a class rating is required), and type rating, without limitations, for the aircraft;


(2) Logs each flight and the pilot in command who observed the flight attests in writing to each flight;


(3) Obtains the flight time while performing the duties of pilot in command; and


(4) Presents evidence of the supervised operating experience to any Examiner or Flight Standards office to have the limitation removed.
