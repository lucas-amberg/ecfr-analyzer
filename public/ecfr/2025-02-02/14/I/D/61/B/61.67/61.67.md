# § 61.67   Category II pilot authorization requirements.

(a) *General.* A person who applies for a Category II pilot authorization must hold: 


(1) At least a private or commercial pilot certificate with an instrument rating or an airline transport pilot certificate; 


(2) A type rating for the aircraft for which the authorization is sought if that aircraft requires a type rating; and 


(3) A category and class rating for the aircraft for which the authorization is sought. 


(b) *Experience requirements.* An applicant for a Category II pilot authorization must have at least— 


(1) 50 hours of night flight time as pilot in command. 


(2) 75 hours of instrument time under actual or simulated instrument conditions that may include not more than— 


(i) A combination of 25 hours of simulated instrument flight time in a flight simulator or flight training device; or 


(ii) 40 hours of simulated instrument flight time if accomplished in an approved course conducted by an appropriately rated training center certificated under part 142 of this chapter. 


(3) 250 hours of cross-country time as pilot in command. 


(c) *Practical test requirements.* (1) A practical test must be passed by a person who applies for— 


(i) Issuance or renewal of a Category II pilot authorization; and 


(ii) The addition of another type aircraft to the applicant's Category II pilot authorization. 


(2) To be eligible for the practical test for an authorization under this section, an applicant must— 


(i) Meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section; and 


(ii) If the applicant has not passed a practical test for this authorization during the 12 calendar months preceding the month of the test, then that person must— 


(A) Meet the requirements of § 61.57(c); and 


(B) Have performed at least six ILS approaches during the 6 calendar months preceding the month of the test, of which at least three of the approaches must have been conducted without the use of an approach coupler. 


(3) The approaches specified in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section— 


(i) Must be conducted under actual or simulated instrument flight conditions; 


(ii) Must be conducted to the decision height for the ILS approach in the type aircraft in which the practical test is to be conducted; 


(iii) Need not be conducted to the decision height authorized for Category II operations; 


(iv) Must be conducted to the decision height authorized for Category II operations only if conducted in a flight simulator or flight training device; and 


(v) Must be accomplished in an aircraft of the same category and class, and type, as applicable, as the aircraft in which the practical test is to be conducted or in a flight simulator that— 


(A) Represents an aircraft of the same category and class, and type, as applicable, as the aircraft in which the authorization is sought; and 


(B) Is used in accordance with an approved course conducted by a training center certificated under part 142 of this chapter. 


(4) The flight time acquired in meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section may be used to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. 


(d) *Practical test procedures.* The practical test consists of an oral increment and a flight increment. 


(1) *Oral increment.* In the oral increment of the practical test an applicant must demonstrate knowledge of the following: 


(i) Required landing distance; 


(ii) Recognition of the decision height; 


(iii) Missed approach procedures and techniques using computed or fixed attitude guidance displays; 


(iv) Use and limitations of RVR; 


(v) Use of visual clues, their availability or limitations, and altitude at which they are normally discernible at reduced RVR readings; 


(vi) Procedures and techniques related to transition from nonvisual to visual flight during a final approach under reduced RVR; 


(vii) Effects of vertical and horizontal windshear; 


(viii) Characteristics and limitations of the ILS and runway lighting system; 


(ix) Characteristics and limitations of the flight director system, auto approach coupler (including split axis type if equipped), auto throttle system (if equipped), and other required Category II equipment; 


(x) Assigned duties of the second in command during Category II approaches, unless the aircraft for which authorization is sought does not require a second in command; and 


(xi) Instrument and equipment failure warning systems. 


(2) *Flight increment.* The following requirements apply to the flight increment of the practical test: 


(i) The flight increment must be conducted in an aircraft of the same category, class, and type, as applicable, as the aircraft in which the authorization is sought or in a flight simulator that— 


(A) Represents an aircraft of the same category and class, and type, as applicable, as the aircraft in which the authorization is sought; and 


(B) Is used in accordance with an approved course conducted by a training center certificated under part 142 of this chapter. 


(ii) The flight increment must consist of at least two ILS approaches to 100 feet AGL including at least one landing and one missed approach. 


(iii) All approaches performed during the flight increment must be made with the use of an approved flight control guidance system, except if an approved auto approach coupler is installed, at least one approach must be hand flown using flight director commands. 


(iv) If a multiengine airplane with the performance capability to execute a missed approach with one engine inoperative is used for the practical test, the flight increment must include the performance of one missed approach with an engine, which shall be the most critical engine, if applicable, set at idle or zero thrust before reaching the middle marker. 


(v) If a multiengine flight simulator or multiengine flight training device is used for the practical test, the applicant must execute a missed approach with the most critical engine, if applicable, failed. 


(vi) For an authorization for an aircraft that requires a type rating, the practical test must be performed in coordination with a second in command who holds a type rating in the aircraft in which the authorization is sought. 


(vii) Oral questioning may be conducted at any time during a practical test.
