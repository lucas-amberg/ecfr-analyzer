# Appendix G to Part 91—Operations in Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace


*Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace.* Within RVSM airspace, air traffic control (ATC) separates aircraft by a minimum of 1,000 feet vertically between FL 290 and FL 410 inclusive. Air-traffic control notifies operators of RVSM airspace by providing route planning information.


*RVSM Group Aircraft.* Aircraft within a group of aircraft, approved as a group by the Administrator, in which each of the aircraft satisfy each of the following:


(a) The aircraft have been manufactured to the same design, and have been approved under the same type certificate, amended type certificate, or supplemental type certificate. 


(b) The static system of each aircraft is installed in a manner and position that is the same as those of the other aircraft in the group. The same static source error correction is incorporated in each aircraft of the group.


(c) The avionics units installed in each aircraft to meet the minimum RVSM equipment requirements of this appendix are:


(1) Manufactured to the same manufacturer specification and have the same part number; or


(2) Of a different manufacturer or part number, if the applicant demonstrates that the equipment provides equivalent system performance.


*RVSM Nongroup Aircraft.* An aircraft that is approved for RVSM operations as an individual aircraft.


*RVSM Flight envelope.* An RVSM flight envelope includes the range of Mach number, weight divided by atmospheric pressure ratio, and altitudes over which an aircraft is approved to be operated in cruising flight within RVSM airspace. RVSM flight envelopes are defined as follows:


(a) The *full RVSM flight envelope* is bounded as follows:


(1) The altitude flight envelope extends from FL 290 upward to the lowest altitude of the following:


(i) FL 410 (the RVSM altitude limit);


(ii) The maximum certificated altitude for the aircraft; or


(iii) The altitude limited by cruise thrust, buffet, or other flight limitations.


(2) The airspeed flight envelope extends:


(i) From the airspeed of the slats/flaps-up maximum endurance (holding) airspeed, or the maneuvering airspeed, whichever is lower;


(ii) To the maximum operating airspeed (V_mo_/M_mo_), or airspeed limited by cruise thrust buffet, or other flight limitations, whichever is lower.


(3) All permissible gross weights within the flight envelopes defined in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this definition.


(b) The *basic RVSM flight envelope* is the same as the full RVSM flight envelope except that the airspeed flight envelope extends:


(1) From the airspeed of the slats/flaps-up maximum endurance (holding) airspeed, or the maneuver airspeed, whichever is lower; 


(2) To the upper Mach/airspeed boundary defined for the full RVSM flight envelope, or a specified lower value not less than the long-range cruise Mach number plus .04 Mach, unless further limited by available cruise thrust, buffet, or other flight limitations.


(a) Except as specified in Section 9 of this appendix, an operator may be authorized to conduct RVSM operations if the Administrator finds that its aircraft comply with this section.


(b) The applicant for authorization shall submit the appropriate data package for aircraft approval. The package must consist of at least the following:
