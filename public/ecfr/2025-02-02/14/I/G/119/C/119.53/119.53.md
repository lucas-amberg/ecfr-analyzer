# ยง 119.53   Wet leasing of aircraft and other arrangements for transportation by air.

(a) Unless otherwise authorized by the Administrator, prior to conducting operations involving a wet lease, each certificate holder under this part authorized to conduct common carriage operations under this subchapter shall provide the Administrator with a copy of the wet lease to be executed which would lease the aircraft to any other person engaged in common carriage operations under this subchapter, including foreign air carriers, or to any other foreign person engaged in common carriage wholly outside the United States. 


(b) No certificate holder under this part may wet lease from a foreign air carrier or any other foreign person or any person not authorized to engage in common carriage. 


(c) Upon receiving a copy of a wet lease, the Administrator determines which party to the agreement has operational control of the aircraft and issues amendments to the operations specifications of each party to the agreement, as needed. The lessor must provide the following information to be incorporated into the operations specifications of both parties, as needed. 


(1) The names of the parties to the agreement and the duration thereof. 


(2) The nationality and registration markings of each aircraft involved in the agreement. 


(3) The kind of operation (e.g., domestic, flag, supplemental, commuter, or on-demand). 


(4) The airports or areas of operation. 


(5) A statement specifying the party deemed to have operational control and the times, airports, or areas under which such operational control is exercised. 


(d) In making the determination of paragraph (c) of this section, the Administrator will consider the following: 


(1) Crewmembers and training. 


(2) Airworthiness and performance of maintenance. 


(3) Dispatch. 


(4) Servicing the aircraft. 


(5) Scheduling. 


(6) Any other factor the Administrator considers relevant. 


(e) Other arrangements for transportation by air: Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, a certificate holder under this part operating under part 121 or 135 of this chapter may not conduct any operation for another certificate holder under this part or a foreign air carrier under part 129 of this chapter or a foreign person engaged in common carriage wholly outside the United States unless it holds applicable Department of Transportation economic authority, if required, and is authorized under its operations specifications to conduct the same kinds of operations (as defined in ยง 110.2). The certificate holder conducting the substitute operation must conduct that operation in accordance with the same operations authority held by the certificate holder arranging for the substitute operation. These substitute operations must be conducted between airports for which the substitute certificate holder holds authority for scheduled operations or within areas of operations for which the substitute certificate holder has authority for supplemental or on-demand operations. 


(f) A certificate holder under this part may, if authorized by the Department of Transportation under ยง 380.3 of this title and the Administrator in the case of interstate commuter, interstate domestic, and flag operations, or the Administrator in the case of scheduled intrastate common carriage operations, conduct one or more flights for passengers who are stranded because of the cancellation of their scheduled flights. These flights must be conducted under the rules of part 121 or part 135 of this chapter applicable to supplemental or on-demand operations.
