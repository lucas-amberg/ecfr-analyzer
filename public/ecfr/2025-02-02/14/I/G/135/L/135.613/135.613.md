(2) For all instrument approaches, including PinS when paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply, if the distance from the missed approach point to the landing area is 3 NM or less, the applicable VFR weather minimums are—


(i) For Day Operations: No less than a 600-foot ceiling and 2 statute miles flight visibility;


(ii) For Night Operations: No less than a 600-foot ceiling and 3 statute miles flight visibility; or


(3) For all instrument approaches, including PinS, if the distance from the missed approach point to the landing area is greater than 3 NM, the VFR weather minimums required by the class of airspace.


(b) *Departures.* For transitions from VFR to IFR upon departure—


(1) The VFR weather minimums of paragraph (a) of this section apply if—


(i) An FAA-approved obstacle departure procedure is followed; and


(ii) An IFR clearance is obtained on or before reaching a predetermined location that is not more than 3 NM from the departure location.
