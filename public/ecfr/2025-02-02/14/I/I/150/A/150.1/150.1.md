# § 150.1   Scope and purpose.

This part prescribes the procedures, standards, and methodology governing the development, submission, and review of airport noise exposure maps and airport noise compatibility programs, including the process for evaluating and approving or disapproving those programs. It prescribes single systems for—(a) measuring noise at airports and surrounding areas that generally provides a highly reliable relationship between projected noise exposure and surveyed reaction of people to noise; and (b) determining exposure of individuals to noise that results from the operations of an airport. This part also identifies those land uses which are normally compatible with various levels of exposure to noise by individuals. It provides technical assistance to airport operators, in conjunction with other local, State, and Federal authorities, to prepare and execute appropriate noise compatibility planning and implementation programs.
