# § 194.211   Alternate eligibility requirements for a person seeking a powered-lift type rating.

(a) *General applicability.* The requirements specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section apply only to persons seeking a type rating in a powered-lift that is capable of performing instrument maneuvers and procedures.


(b) *Obtaining an initial powered-lift type rating without concurrently obtaining the instrument-powered-lift rating.* (1) Notwithstanding the requirement to hold or concurrently obtain an appropriate instrument rating in § 61.63(d)(1) of this chapter, a person who applies for an initial powered-lift type rating to be completed concurrently with a powered-lift category rating may apply for the type rating without holding or concurrently obtaining a powered-lift instrument rating, but the type rating will be limited to “visual flight rules (VFR) only.”


(2) Notwithstanding the requirement in § 61.63(d)(4) of this chapter, a person who applies for a powered-lift type rating pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not required to perform the type rating practical test in actual or simulated instrument conditions.


(3) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, a person who obtains a powered-lift type rating with a “VFR only” limitation pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section must remove the limitation in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section within 2 calendar months from the month in which the person passes the type rating practical test.


(4) The “VFR only” limitation may be removed after the person—


(i) Passes an instrument rating practical test in a powered-lift in actual or simulated instrument conditions; and


(ii) Passes a practical test in the powered-lift type for which the “VFR only” limitation applies on the appropriate areas of operation listed in § 61.157(e)(3) of this chapter that consist of performing instrument maneuvers and procedures in actual or simulated instrument conditions.


(5) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, if a person who obtains a powered-lift type rating with a “VFR only” limitation pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not remove the limitation within 2 calendar months from the month in which the person completed the type rating practical test, the powered-lift type rating for which the “VFR only” limitation applies will become invalid for use until the person removes the limitation in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.


(6) A person holding a private pilot certificate is not required to remove the “VFR only” limitation if the limitation applies to a powered-lift type that is not a large aircraft or turbojet-powered.


(c) *Obtaining an additional powered-lift type rating with a “VFR Only” limitation.* (1) Notwithstanding the requirement to hold or concurrently obtain an appropriate instrument rating in § 61.63(d)(1) of this chapter, a person holding a private pilot certificate may apply for a powered-lift type rating for a powered-lift that is not a large aircraft or turbojet-powered without holding or concurrently obtaining a powered-lift instrument rating, but the type rating will be limited to “VFR only.”


(2) Notwithstanding the requirement in § 61.63(d)(4) of this chapter, a person who applies for a powered-lift type rating pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section is not required to perform the type rating practical test in actual or simulated instrument conditions.


(3) A person who obtains a powered-lift type rating with a “VFR only” limitation pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section may remove the “VFR only” limitation for that powered-lift type as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.


(d) *Concurrent practical tests for removal of “VFR only” limitation.* If a task required for the practical test specified in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section overlaps with a task required for the practical test specified in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, a person may perform the task a single time provided the task is performed to the highest standard required for the task.
