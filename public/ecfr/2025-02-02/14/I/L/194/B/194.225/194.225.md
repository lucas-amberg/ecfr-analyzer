# § 194.225   Test pilots, FAA test pilots, and aviation safety inspectors: Alternate aeronautical experience and logging requirements for an instrument-powered-lift rating.

(a) *General applicability.* An applicant for an instrument-powered-lift rating who is test pilot for the manufacturer of an experimental powered-lift, an FAA test pilot, or aviation safety inspector may satisfy the alternate aeronautical experience and logging requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, provided—


(1) The flights are conducted in an experimental powered-lift at the manufacturer; and


(2) The applicant is authorized by the Administrator to act as pilot-in-command of the experimental powered-lift.


(b) *Alternate aeronautical experience requirements.* A test pilot, FAA test pilot, or aviation safety inspector may meet the aeronautical experience requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section in lieu of the aeronautical experience requirements of § 61.65(f)(2) of this chapter.


(1) Notwithstanding the eligibility requirement in § 61.65(a)(5) of this chapter, a test pilot, FAA test pilot, or aviation safety inspector may receive 15 hours of instrument training on the areas of operation listed in § 61.65(c) of this chapter from an instructor pilot for the manufacturer of an experimental powered-lift in lieu of an authorized instructor, provided—


(i) The training is conducted in accordance with the manufacturer's proposed training curriculum in the experimental powered-lift; and


(ii) The test pilot, FAA test pilot, or aviation safety inspector receives a logbook or training record endorsement from the instructor pilot certifying that the applicant satisfactorily completed the training curriculum specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.


(2) A test pilot, FAA test pilot, or aviation safety inspector may accomplish the practical test preparation requirements in § 61.65(f)(2)(i) of this chapter with an instructor pilot for the manufacturer of the experimental powered-lift.


(3) A test pilot, FAA test pilot, or aviation safety inspector may accomplish the cross-country flight specified in § 61.65(f)(2)(ii) of this chapter for an instrument-powered-lift rating without an authorized instructor, provided the test pilot, FAA test pilot, or aviation safety inspector—


(i) Completes the cross-country flight specified in § 61.65(f)(2)(ii) of this chapter with a pilot who serves as an instructor pilot for the manufacturer of the experimental powered-lift; and


(ii) Obtains a logbook or training record endorsement from the instructor pilot certifying that the person completed the cross-country flight.


(4) A test pilot, FAA test pilot, or aviation safety inspector may satisfy the alternate requirements in § 194.235 in lieu of the cross-country aeronautical experience requirements specified in § 61.65(f)(2)(ii) of this chapter.


(c) *Alternate logging requirement.* Notwithstanding the logging requirements in § 61.51(e)(1) of this chapter, a test pilot, FAA test pilot, or aviation safety inspector may log pilot-in-command flight time for the purpose of satisfying the 10-hour cross-country requirement in § 61.65(f)(1) of this chapter for flights when the pilot is the sole manipulator of the controls of an experimental powered-lift for which the pilot is not rated, provided—


(1) The test pilot, FAA test pilot, or aviation safety inspector is acting as pilot-in-command of the experimental powered-lift in accordance with a letter of authorization issued by the Administrator; and


(2) The flight is conducted for the purpose of research and development or showing compliance with the regulations in this chapter in accordance with the experimental certificate issued to the powered-lift pursuant to § 21.191 of this chapter.
