# ยง 221.84   Cancellation of suspended matter subsequent to date to which suspended.

(a) *Endeavor to cancel prior to expiration of suspension period.* When an order of the Department requires the cancellation of tariff provisions which were suspended by the Department and such cancellation is required to be made effective on or before a date which is after the date to which such tariff provisions were suspended, the issuing carrier or agent shall, if possible, make the cancellation effective prior to the date to which such tariff provisions were suspended.


(b) *When necessary to republish matter continued in effect by suspension.* If suspended tariff provisions become effective upon expiration of their suspension period and thereby accomplish the cancellation of the tariff provisions continued in effect by the suspension, the issuing agent or carrier shall republish and reestablish such canceled tariff provisions effective simultaneously with the cancellation of the suspended provisions in compliance with the Department's order. The tariff amendments which reestablish such canceled tariff provisions shall bear reference to this subpart and the Department's order.
