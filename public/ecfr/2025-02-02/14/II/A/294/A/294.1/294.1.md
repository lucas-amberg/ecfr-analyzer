# § 294.1   Applicability and purpose.

This part establishes a classification of foreign air carriers known as “Canadian charter air taxi operators,” and establishes registration procedures for these carriers operating or seeking to operate transborder services between Canada and the United States. This part also exempts Canadian charter air taxi operators from certain provisions of the Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code (Transportation), and establishes rules applicable to their operations in the United States. This part does not provide exemption from the safety regulatory provisions of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII that are administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and Canadian charter air taxi operators in the conduct of their operations must observe all applicable safety standards and requirements.
