(2) That the carrier has previously attempted to resolve the dispute directly with the airport owner or operator; 


(3) That when there is information on which the carrier intends to rely that is not included with the brief, exhibits, or testimony, the information has been omitted because the airport owner or operator has not made that information available to the carrier. The certification shall specify the date and form of the carrier's request for information from the airport owner or operator; and 


(4) That any submission on computer diskette is a true copy of the data file used to prepare the printed versions of the exhibits or briefs.
