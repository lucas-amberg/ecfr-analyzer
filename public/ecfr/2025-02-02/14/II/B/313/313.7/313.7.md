# § 313.7   Integration with environmental procedures.

(a) In proceedings in which an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact is prepared by a responsible official pursuant to DOT's procedures implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), the energy information called for by this part may be included in that statement or declaration in order to yield a single, comprehensive document. In such instances, the DOT's NEPA procedures shall govern the submission of the energy information. However, it shall remain the responsibility of the administrative law judge or the DOT decisionmaker, as the case may be, to make the findings and conclusions required by § 313.6(a) of this part.


(b) A determination that a major regulatory action within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. 6362 and this part may be involved in a proceeding is independent from any determination that the proceeding is a “major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment” within the meaning of NEPA, and vice versa.
