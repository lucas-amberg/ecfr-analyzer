# ยง 375.44   Issuance of permit.

(a) The Department will issue a foreign aircraft permit if it finds that the proposed operations meet the requirements of this part and are in the public interest. Foreign aircraft permits may be conditioned or limited by the Department. Permits must be carried aboard the applicant's aircraft during flight over U.S. territory, and are not transferable.


(b) In determining whether to grant a particular application, the Department will consider, among other factors, the extent to which the country of the applicant's nationality deals with U.S. civil aircraft operators on the basis of substantial reciprocity, and whether the operation is otherwise in the public interest.
