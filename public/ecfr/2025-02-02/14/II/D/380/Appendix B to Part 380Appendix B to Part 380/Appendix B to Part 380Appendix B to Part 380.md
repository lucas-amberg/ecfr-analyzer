The trust shall not be liable hereunder for the payment of any damages hereinbefore described which arise as a result of any contracts, agreements, undertakings, or arrangements for the supplying of transportation and other services made by Operator after the termination of this trust as herein provided, but such termination shall not affect the liability of the trust hereunder for the payment of any damages arising as a result of contracts, agreements, or arrangements for the supplying of transportation and other services made by Operator prior to the date that such termination becomes effective.


Liability of the trust shall in all events be limited only to a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries who shall within sixty days after the termination of the particular charter give written notice of claim to Operator or, if it is unavailable, to Trustee, and all liability of the trust with respect to participants in a charter shall automatically terminate sixty days after the termination date of each particular charter covered by this trust except for claims made in the time provided herein.


Sixty-one days after the completion of the last charter covered by this Trust Agreement, the trust shall automatically terminate except for claims of any Beneficiary or Beneficiaries previously made in accordance with this Agreement still pending on and after said sixty-first day.

After all remaining claims which are covered by this Trust Agreement pending on and after the said sixty-first day have been discharged, dismissed, dropped, or otherwise terminated; Trustee shall convey forthwith the remainder of the trust corpus, if any, to Operator.


Either Operator or Trustee may at any time terminate this trust by written notice to: “U.S. Air Carrier Licensing/Special Authorities Division, X-44, Office of International Aviation, U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE, W-86-445, Washington, DC 20590,” such termination to become effective thirty days after the actual receipt of said notice by the Department.
