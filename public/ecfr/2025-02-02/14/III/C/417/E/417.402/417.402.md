# ยง 417.402   Compliance.

(a) *General.* A launch operator's ground safety process must satisfy this subpart.


(b) *Ground safety analysis conducted for launch at a Federal launch range.* This provision applies to all sections of this subpart. The FAA will accept a ground safety process conducted for a launch from a Federal launch range without need for further demonstration of compliance to the FAA if:


(1) A launch operator has contracted with a Federal launch range for the provision of the ground safety process; and


(2) The FAA has assessed the Federal launch range, through its launch site safety assessment, and found that the Federal launch range's ground safety process satisfies the requirements of this subpart. In this case, the FAA will treat the Federal launch range's process as that of a launch operator.


(c) *Toxic release hazard analysis conducted for launch processing at a Federal launch range.* The FAA will accept a toxic release hazard analysis conducted for launch processing from a Federal launch range provided the toxic release analysis satisfies the Federal launch range's requirements, and the FAA has assessed the Federal launch range, through its launch site safety assessment, and found that the applicable Federal launch range safety-related launch services and property satisfy the requirements of this subpart.


(d) *Demonstration of compliance.* For a licensed launch that does not satisfy paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a launch operator must demonstrate compliance to the FAA with the requirements of this subpart, and must include in its demonstration the analysis products required by subparts A and E of this part, and appendices I and J of this part.


(e) *Alternate methods.* The FAA will approve an alternate hazard control method if a launch operator demonstrates, in accordance with ยง 406.3(b), that its proposed hazard control method provides an equivalent level of safety to that required by this subpart.
