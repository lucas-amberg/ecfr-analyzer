# § 450.107   Hazard control strategies.

(a) *General.* To meet the safety criteria of § 450.101(a), (b), or (c) for the flight, or any phase of flight, of a launch or reentry vehicle, an operator must use one or more of the hazard control strategies identified in § 450.108 through § 450.111.


(b) *Hazard control strategy determination.* For each phase of flight during a launch or reentry, an operator must use a functional hazard analysis to determine a hazard control strategy or strategies that account for—


(1) All functional failures associated with reasonably foreseeable hazardous events that have the capability to create a hazard to the public;


(2) Safety-critical systems; and


(3) A timeline of all safety-critical events.


(c) *Flight hazard analysis.* An operator must conduct a flight hazard analysis in accordance with § 450.109 of this part for the flight, or phase of flight, of a launch or reentry vehicle if the public safety hazards cannot be mitigated adequately to meet the public risk criteria of § 450.101(a), (b), and (c) using physical containment, wind weighting, or flight abort.


(d) *Application requirements.* An applicant must submit in its application—


(1) The results of the hazard control strategy determination, including—


(i) All functional failures identified under paragraph (b)(1) of this section;


(ii) The identification of all safety-critical systems; and


(iii) A timeline of all safety-critical events.


(2) A description of its hazard control strategy or strategies for each phase of flight.
