(2) Returning a launch or reentry vehicle to a safe condition after landing, or after an aborted launch attempt; and


(3) Returning a site to a safe condition.


(b) An operator is not required to comply with §§ 450.181 through 450.189 of this part if:


(1) The launch or reentry is being conducted from a Federal launch or reentry site;


(2) The operator has a written agreement with the Federal launch or reentry site for the provision of ground safety services and oversight; and
