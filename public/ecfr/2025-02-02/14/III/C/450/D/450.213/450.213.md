# § 450.213   Pre-flight reporting.

(a) *Reporting method.* A licensee must send the information in this section as an email attachment to *ASTOperations@faa.gov,* or other method as agreed to by the Administrator in the license.


(b) *Mission information.* A licensee must submit to the FAA the following mission-specific information no less than 60 days before each mission conducted under the license, unless the Administrator agrees to a different time frame in accordance with § 404.15 in the license, except when the information was provided in the license application:


(1) Payload information in accordance with § 450.43(i); and


(2) Planned mission information, including the vehicle, launch site, planned flight path, staging and impact locations, each payload delivery point, intended reentry or landing sites including any contingency abort location, and the location of any disposed launch or reentry vehicle stage or component that is deorbited.


(c) *Flight abort and flight safety analysis products.* A licensee must submit to the FAA updated flight abort and flight safety analysis products, using methodologies previously approved by the FAA, for each mission no less than 30 days before flight, unless the Administrator agrees to a different time frame in accordance with § 404.15 in the license.


(1) A licensee is not required to submit the flight abort and flight safety analysis products if—


(i) The analysis submitted in the license application satisfies all the requirements of this section; or


(ii) The licensee demonstrated during the application process that the analysis does not need to be updated to account for mission-specific factors.


(2) If a licensee is required to submit the flight abort and flight safety analysis products, the licensee—


(i) Must account for vehicle- and mission-specific input data;


(ii) Must account for potential variations in input data that may affect any analysis product within the final 30 days before flight;


(iii) Must submit the analysis products using the same format and organization used in its license application; and


(iv) May not change an analysis product within the final 30 days before flight unless the licensee has a process, approved in the license, for making a change in that period as part of the licensee's flight safety analysis process.


(d) *Flight safety system test data.* Any licensee that is required by § 450.101(c) to use a flight safety system to protect public safety must submit to the FAA, or provide the FAA access to, any test reports, in accordance with approved flight safety system test plans, no less than 30 days before flight, unless the Administrator agrees to a different time frame in accordance with § 404.15 in the license. These reports must include:


(1) A summary of the system, subsystem, and component-level test results, including all test failures and corrective actions implemented;


(2) A summary of test results demonstrating sufficient margin to predicted operating environments;


(3) A comparison matrix of the actual qualification and acceptance test levels used for each component in each test compared against the predicted flight levels for each environment, including any test tolerances allowed for each test; and


(4) A clear identification of any components qualified by similarity analysis or a combination of analysis and test.


(e) *Collision avoidance analysis.* A licensee must submit to a Federal entity identified by the FAA and to the FAA the collision avoidance information in appendix A to part 450 in accordance with § 450.169(f).


(f) *Launch or reentry schedule.* A licensee must file a launch or reentry schedule that identifies each review, rehearsal, and safety-critical operation. The schedule must be filed and updated in time to allow FAA personnel to participate in the reviews, rehearsals, and safety-critical operations.
