# ยง 1203.406   Additional classification factors.

In determining the appropriate classification category, the following additional factors should be considered:


(a) *Uniformity within government activities.* The effect classification will have on technological programs of other Government departments and agencies should be considered. Classification of official information must be reasonably uniform within the Government.


(b) *Applicability of classification directives of other Government agencies.* It is necessary to determine whether authoritative classification guidance exists elsewhere for the information under consideration which would make it necessary to assign a higher classification than that indicated by the applicable NASA guidance. The Office of Protective Services will coordinate with the Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) Committee and the National Declassification Center to determine what classification guides are current.
