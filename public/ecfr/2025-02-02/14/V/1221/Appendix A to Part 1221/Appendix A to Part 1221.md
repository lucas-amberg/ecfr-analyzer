# Appendix A to Part 1221—Congressional Space Medal of Honor


A circular green enamel wreath of laurel surmounted by a five-pointed gold star (with vertical point downward) and issuing from between each point a gold flame, the star surmounted by a light blue enamel cloud bank with five lobes edged in gold bearing a five-pointed dark blue enamel star fimbriated gold and charged in center with a diamond; standing upon the wreath at top center a gold eagle with wings displayed.


The laurel wreath, a symbol of great achievement, with the overlapping star points, simulates space vehicles moving to greater accomplishments through space. The flames signify the dynamic energy of the rocket era and the imagination of the men in the space program of the United States. The stylized glory cloud alludes to the glory in the coat of arms of the United States and to the high esteem of the award. The dark blue voided star symbolizes the vast mysteries of outer space while the brilliancy of the feat is represented by a diamond. The eagle with wings raised in the spirit of peace represents man's first landing on another planet.


The reverse bears in center the inscription “CONGRESSIONAL” arranged in a semicircle above the inscription “SPACE MEDAL PRESENTED TO”; in base is space for the name of the recipient and the date all within an outer circle of fifty stars.
