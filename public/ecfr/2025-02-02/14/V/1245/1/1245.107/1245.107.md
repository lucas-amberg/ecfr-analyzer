# § 1245.107   Reservations.

(a) *License to the Government.* Any invention for which waiver of domestic or foreign rights has been granted under this subpart shall be subject to the reservation by the Administrator of an irrevocable, nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license for the practice of the invention throughout the world by or on behalf of the United States or any foreign government pursuant to any treaty or agreement with the United States.


(b) *March-in rights.* For any invention for which waiver of rights has been granted under this subpart, NASA has the same right as set forth in 35 U.S.C. 203 and 210, with the procedures set forth in § 1245.117 and 37 CFR 401.6, to require the contractor, an assignee, or exclusive licensee of the invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and if the contractor, assignee, or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, NASA has the right to grant such a license itself if NASA determines that:


(1) Such action is necessary because the contractor or assignee has not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the invention in such field of use;


(2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the contractor, assignee, or their licensees;


(3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the contractor, assignee, or licensees; or


(4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by the “Preference for United States industry” has not been obtained or waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any invention in the United States is in breach of such agreement.


(c) *Additional reservations.* In the event one or more of the situations set forth in § 1245.104 (b)(1) through (b)(3) exist, the Board may determine to recommend partial grant of the waiver request (rather than denial) by making the grant subject to additional reservations (than those set forth in (a) and (b) of this section) to the extent necessary to address the particular situation. Such additional reservations may include, but not be limited to, field-of-use or terrestrial-use limitations, or additions to the march-in rights.
