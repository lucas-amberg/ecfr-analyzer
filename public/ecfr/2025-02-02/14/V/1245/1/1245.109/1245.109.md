(a) The instrument of waiver set forth in § 1245.115(c) shall be voided by NASA with respect to the domestic title to any invention for which a patent application has not been filed within 1 year (or a reasonable time thereafter for good cause shown) from notification to NASA of election of title, as required by § 1245.104(c)(2), for an advanced waiver pursuant to § 1245.104, or within 1 year from the granting of a waiver for an individual invention granted pursuant to § 1245.105.


(b) The instrument of waiver set forth in § 1245.115(c) shall be voided by NASA with respect to title in any foreign country for which waiver has been granted pursuant to § 1245.106, if a patent application has not been filed in that country (or in the European Patent Office or under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and that country designated) within either 10 months (or a reasonable time thereafter for good cause shown) from the date a corresponding U.S. patent application has been filed or 6 months (or a reasonable time thereafter for good cause shown) from the date a license is granted by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent applications where such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.
