# § 1251.100   Purpose and broad coverage.

(a) *Purpose.* This part effectuates section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which is designed to eliminate discrimination on the basis of disability in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.


(b) *Broad scope of coverage.* Consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008's purpose (ADA Amendments Act) of reinstating a broad scope of protection under the ADA and section 504, the definition of “disability” applicable to this part shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this part. The primary object of attention in cases brought under this part should be whether entities covered under section 504 have complied with their obligations and whether discrimination has occurred, not whether the individual meets the definition of disability. The question of whether an individual meets the definition of disability under this part should not demand extensive analysis.
