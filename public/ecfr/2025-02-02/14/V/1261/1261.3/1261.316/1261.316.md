(b) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration may settle or compromise a personal damage claim against a present or former NASA employee by the payment of available funds, at any time, provided the alleged conduct giving rise to the personal damage claim was taken within the employee's scope of employment and that such settlement or compromise is in the interest of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, as determined by the Administrator or designee.
