# ยง 1261.413   Analysis of costs; automation; prevention of overpayments, delinquencies, or defaults.

The Office of the NASA Chief Financial Officer will:


(a) Issue internal procedures to provide for periodic comparison of costs incurred and amounts collected. Data on costs and corresponding recovery rates for debts of different types and in various dollar ranges should be used to compare the cost effectiveness of alternative collection techniques, establish guidelines with respect to points at which costs of further collection efforts are likely to exceed recoveries, and assist in evaluating offers in compromise.


(b) Consider the need, feasibility, and cost effectiveness of automated debt collection operation.


(c) Establish internal controls to identify causes, if any, of overpayments, delinquencies, and defaults, and establish procedures for corrective actions as needs dictate.
