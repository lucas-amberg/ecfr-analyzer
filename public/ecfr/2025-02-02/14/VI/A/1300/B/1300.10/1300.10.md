# § 1300.10   General standards for Board issuance of Federal credit instruments.

(a) In accordance with section 102(c)(1) of the Act, the Board may enter into agreements with one or more borrowers to issue Federal credit instruments only if the Board determines, in its discretion and in accordance with the minimum requirements set forth in this part, that— 


(1) The borrower is an air carrier for which credit is not reasonably available at the time of the transaction; 


(2) The intended obligation by the borrower is prudently incurred; and 


(3) Such agreement is a necessary part of maintaining a safe, efficient, and viable commercial aviation system in the United States. 


(b) In accordance with section 102(c)(2)(A) of the Act, the Board shall enter into an agreement to issue a Federal credit instrument in such form and on such terms and conditions and subject to such covenants, representations, warranties, and requirements (including requirements for audits) as the Board determines are appropriate for satisfying the requirements of this part and any supplemental requirements issued by the Board under section 102(c)(2)(B) of the Act. 


(c) In accordance with section 102(d)(1) of the Act, in entering into agreements to issue Federal credit instruments, the Board shall, to the extent feasible and practicable and in accordance with the requirements in this part, ensure that the Federal Government is compensated for the risk assumed in making guarantees. 


(d) In accordance with Section 102(d)(2) of the Act, the Board is authorized to enter into contracts under which the Federal Government, contingent on the financial success of the air carrier, would participate in the gains of the air carrier or its security holders through the use of such instruments as warrants, stock options, common or preferred stock, or other appropriate equity instruments, except that the Board shall not accept an equity interest in an air carrier that gives the Federal Government voting rights. 


(e) In accordance with Section 104(a) of the Act, the Board may only issue a Federal credit instrument to an air carrier after the air carrier enters into a legally binding agreement with the Board regarding certain employee compensation.
