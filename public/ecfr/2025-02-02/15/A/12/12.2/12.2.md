# § 12.2   Undue proliferation.

(a) *Information as to possible undue proliferation.* Any person or group, including a State or local governmental entity, is invited to communicate information to the Secretary concerning the possible existence of undue proliferation. Such communications should be in writing and include supporting information and explanations. 


(b) *Initiation of inquiry as to undue proliferation.* Upon receipt of information regarding the possible existence of undue proliferation, the Secretary will determine whether there has been a showing of good cause warranting an inquiry. If the Secretary determines that good cause exists, he shall initiate an inquiry for the purpose of finding facts concerning the existence of undue proliferation. 


(c) *Procedures for inquiry*—(1) *Cooperation with State and local officials.* Any inquiry initiated under paragraph (b) of this section may be conducted in cooperation with State and local weights and measures officials. 


(2) *Participation by interested persons.* The Secretary may, during the course of the inquiry, afford interested persons or groups an opportunity to submit in writing comments, data, arguments, views, or other information relevant to the inquiry. 


(d) *Proposed determination as to existence of undue proliferation.* (1) If, after consideration of all relevant information, the Secretary concludes that undue proliferation appears to exist, he shall publish a proposed determination to this effect. The proposed determination shall identify the particular consumer commodity or commodities involved and shall be accompanied by a concise statement of the facts upon which it is based. 


(2) Within 60 days after publication of the proposed determination, any interested party may submit in writing comments, data, arguments, views, or other information relevant to the proposed determination. All written submissions shall be made a part of the public record. 


(3) Within 30 days after the proposed determination has been published, any interested party may request in writing an oral hearing to present his views. The granting of such a hearing shall be at the discretion of the Secretary. Any such hearing shall be public and notice thereof shall be published at least 15 days in advance. A transcript of the hearing shall be made part of the public record. 


(e) *Final determination as to undue proliferation.* As soon as practicable following the conclusion of the proceedings described in paragraph (d) of this section, the Secretary shall either publish a final determination of undue proliferation, or he shall publish a notice withdrawing his proposed determination of undue proliferation. In no event shall the withdrawal of a proposed determination operate to preclude the initiation of another inquiry regarding the same or similar subject matter under paragraph (b) of this section.
