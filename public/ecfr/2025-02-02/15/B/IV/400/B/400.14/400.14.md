# § 400.14   Production—requirement for prior authorization.

(a) *In general.* Production activity in zones shall not be conducted without prior authorization from the Board. To obtain authorization, the notification process provided for in §§ 400.22 and 400.37 shall be used. If Board review of a notification under § 400.37 results in a determination that further review is warranted for all or part of the notified activity, the application process pursuant to §§ 400.23, 400.31 through 400.32, 400.34, and 400.36 shall apply to the activity. Notifications and applications requesting production authority may be submitted by the zone's grantee or by the operator that proposes to undertake the activity (provided the operator at the same time furnishes a copy of the notification or application to the grantee and that submissions by the operator are consistent with the grantee's zone schedule).


(b) *Scope of authority.* Production activity that may be conducted in a particular zone operation is limited to the specific foreign-status materials and components and specific finished products described in notifications and applications that have been authorized pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, including any applicable prohibitions or restrictions. A determination may be requested pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section as to whether particular activity falls within the scope of authorized activity. Unauthorized activity could be subject to penalties pursuant to the customs regulations on foreign-trade zones (19 CFR part 146).


(c) *Information about authorized production activity.* The Board shall make available via its Web site information regarding the materials, components, and finished products associated with individual production operations authorized under these and previous regulations, as derived from applications and notifications submitted to the Board.


(d) *Scope determinations.* Determinations may be made by the Executive Secretary as to whether changes in activity are within the scope of the production activity already authorized under this part. When warranted, the procedures of §§ 400.32 and 400.34 shall be followed.
