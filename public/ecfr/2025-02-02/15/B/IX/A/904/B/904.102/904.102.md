# ยง 904.102   Procedures upon receipt of a NOVA.

(a) The respondent has 30 days from receipt of the NOVA in which to respond. During this time the respondent may: 


(1) Accept the penalty or compromise penalty, if any, by taking the actions specified in the NOVA; 


(2) Seek to have the NOVA amended, modified, or rescinded under paragraph (b) of this section; 


(3) Request a hearing under ยง 904.201(a); 


(4) Request an extension of time to respond under paragraph (c) of this section; or 


(5) Take no action, in which case the NOVA becomes a final administrative decision in accordance with ยง 904.104. 


(b) The respondent may seek amendment or modification of the NOVA to conform to the facts or law as that person sees them by notifying Agency counsel at the telephone number or address specified in the NOVA. If amendment or modification is sought, Agency counsel will either amend the NOVA or decline to amend it, and so notify the respondent. 


(c) The respondent may, within the 30-day period specified in paragraph (a) of this section, request an extension of time to respond. Agency counsel may grant an extension of up to 30 days unless he or she determines that the requester could, exercising reasonable diligence, respond within the 30-day period. If Agency counsel does not respond to the request within 48 hours of its receipt, the request is granted automatically for the extension requested, up to a maximum of 30 days. A telephonic response to the request within the 48-hour period is considered an effective response, and will be followed by written confirmation.


(d) Agency counsel may, for good cause, grant an additional extension beyond the 30-day period specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
