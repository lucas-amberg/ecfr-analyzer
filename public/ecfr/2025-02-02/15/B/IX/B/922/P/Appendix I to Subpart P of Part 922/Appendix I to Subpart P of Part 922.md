(iv) 24 degrees 30 minutes north latitude, 81 degrees 23 minutes west longitude, 


(v) 24 degrees 25 minutes north latitude, 81 degrees 50 minutes west longitude, 


(vi) 24 degrees 22 minutes north latitude, 82 degrees 48 minutes west longitude, 


(vii) 24 degrees 37 minutes north latitude, 83 degrees 06 minutes west longitude, 


(viii) 24 degrees 46 minutes north latitude, 83 degrees 06 minutes west longitude, 


(ix) 24 degrees 46 minutes north latitude, 82 degrees 54 minutes west longitude, 


(x) 24 degrees 44 minutes north latitude, 81 degrees 55 minutes west longitude, 


(xi) 24 degrees 51 minutes north latitude, 81 degrees 26 minutes west longitude, and 


(xii) 24 degrees 55 minutes north latitude, 80 degrees 56 minutes west longitude; 


(d) Then follows the boundary of Everglades National Park in a southerly then northeasterly direction through Florida Bay, Buttonwood Sound, Tarpon Basin, and Blackwater Sound; 


(e) After Division Point, then departs from the boundary of Everglades National Park and follows the western shoreline of Manatee Bay, Barnes Sound, and Card Sound;

(g) then follows the eastern boundary of Biscayne National Park to the beginning point specified in paragraph (a). 


(2) The shoreward boundary of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary is the mean high-water mark except around the Dry Tortugas where the boundary is coterminous with that of the Dry Tortugas National Park, formed by connecting in succession the points at the following coordinates: 


(a) 24 degrees 34 minutes 0 seconds north latitude, 82 degrees 54 minutes 0 seconds west longitude; 


(b) 24 degrees 34 minutes 0 seconds north latitude, 82 degrees 58 minutes 0 second west longitude; 


(c) 24 degrees 39 minutes 0 seconds north latitude, 82 degrees 58 minutes 0 seconds west longitude; 


(d) 24 degrees 43 minutes 0 seconds north latitude, 82 degrees 54 minutes 0 seconds west longitude; 


(e) 24 degrees 43 minutes 32 seconds north latitude, 82 degrees 52 minutes 0 seconds west longitude; 


(f) 24 degrees 43 minutes 32 seconds north latitude, 82 degrees 48 minutes 0 seconds west longitude; 


(g) 24 degrees 42 minutes 0 seconds north latitude, 82 degrees 46 minutes, 0 seconds west longitude; 


(h) 24 degrees 40 minutes 0 seconds north latitude, 82 degrees 46 minutes 0 seconds west longitude; 


(i) 24 degrees 37 minutes 0 seconds north latitude, 82 degrees 48 minutes 0 seconds west longitude; and 


(j) 24 degrees 34 minutes 0 seconds north latitude, 82 degrees 54 minutes 0 seconds west longitude. 


(3) The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary also includes the area located within the boundary formed by connecting in succession the points at the following coordinates: 


(a) 24 degrees 33 minutes north latitude, 83 degrees 09 minutes west longitude, 


(b) 24 degrees 33 minutes north latitude, 83 degrees 05 minutes west longitude, and 


(c) 24 degrees 18 minutes north latitude, 83 degrees 05 minutes west longitude; 


(d) 24 degrees 18 minutes north latitude, 83 degrees 09 minutes west longitude; and 


(e) 24 degrees 33 minutes north latitude, 83 degrees 09 minutes west longitude.
