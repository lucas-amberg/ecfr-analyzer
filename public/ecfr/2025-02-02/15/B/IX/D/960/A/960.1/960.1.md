(a) The regulations in this part implement the Secretary's authority to license the operation of private remote sensing space systems under the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992, as amended, codified at 51 U.S.C. 60101 *et seq.,* and are intended to promote continued U.S. private sector innovation and leadership in the global remote sensing industry.


(b) In carrying out this part, the Secretary takes into account the following considerations:


(1) Technological changes in remote sensing;


(2) Non-technological changes in the remote sensing space industry, such as to business models and practices;


(3) The relative burden to licensees and benefits to national security and international policies of license conditions;


(4) Changes in the methods to mitigate risks to national security and international policies;


(5) International obligations of the United States;


(6) The availability of data from sources in other nations;


(7) The remote sensing regulatory environment in other nations; and


(8) The potential for overlapping regulatory burdens imposed by other U.S. Government agencies.
