(1) In addition to, or in lieu of, the imposition of any civil penalty under subpart J of this part, or in addition to the imposition of any fine under subpart J, suspend or revoke any permit issued under this part, or suspend or modify any particular activities under such a permit, if the permittee substantially fails to comply with any provision of the Act, this part, or any term, condition or restriction of the permit; and 


(2) Suspend or modify particular activities under any permit, if the President determines that such suspension or modification is necessary: 


(i) To avoid any conflict with any international obligation of the United States established by any treaty or convention in force with respect to the United States; or 


(ii) To avoid any situtation which may reasonably be expected to lead to a breach of international peace and security involving armed conflict. 


(b) Any action taken by the Administrator in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) will proceed pursuant to the procedures in ยง 971.1003. Any action taken in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) will proceed pursuant to paragraphs (c) through (i) of this section, other than paragraph (h)(2).

(1) The basis of the proposed action; and 


(2) If the basis for the proposed action is a deficiency which the Administrator believes the permittee can correct:


(i) The action necessary to correct the deficiency; and


(ii) The time within which any correctable deficiency must be corrected (not to exceed 180 days except as specified by the Administrator for good cause).


(d) The Administrator will take the proposed action:


(1) On the 30th day after the date notice is sent to the permittee, under paragraph (c) of this section, unless before the 30th day the permittee files with the Administrator a written request for an administrative review of the proposed action; or


(2) On the last day of the period established under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) in which the permittee must correct the deficiency, if such deficiency has not been corrected before that day and an administrative review requested pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) is not pending or in progress.


(e) If a timely request for administrative review of the proposed denial is made by the permittee under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Administrator will promptly begin a formal hearing in accordance with subpart I of this part. If the proposed denial is the result of a correctable deficiency, the administrative review will proceed concurrently with any attempt to correct the deficiency, unless the parties agree otherwise or the administrative law judge orders differently.


(f) The Administrator will serve on the permittee, and publish in the _Federal Register,_ written notice of the action taken including the reasons therefor.


(g) Any final determination by the Administrator to take the proposed action is subject to judicial review as provided in chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code.


(h) The issuance of any notice of proposed action under this section will not affect the continuation of commercial recovery activities by a permittee. The provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and the first sentence of this paragraph (h) of this section will not apply when:


(1) The President determines by Executive Order that an immediate suspension or modification of particular activities under that permit, is necessary for the reasons set forth in paragraph (a)(2); or


(2) The Administrator determines that immediate suspension of such a permit or immediate suspension or modification of particular activities under a permit, is necessary to prevent a significant adverse environmental effect or to preserve the safety of life or property at sea, and the Administrator issues an emergency order in accordance with ยง 971.1003(d)(4).


(i) The Administrator will immediately rescind the suspension order as soon as he has determined that the cause for suspension has been removed.
