# § 995.28   Use of NOAA emblem.

(a) Permission for the use of the NOAA emblem must be obtained by formally requesting such permission from NOAA and the Department of Commerce through NOAA's Office of Coast Survey.


(b) Use of the NOAA emblem must satisfy an interest of the Department; the use may not result in embarrassment to the Department; there must be no conflict with any trademark rights, as stated in § 995.24(a)(4)(ii) and (b)(3)(ii); and there can be no endorsement or favoritism toward the distributor or value added distributor using the emblem, or other appearance of impropriety.


(c) Certification under this part does not automatically grant the distributor or value added distributor the right to use the NOAA logo. Use of the NOAA logo without express permission from NOAA and the Department of Commerce will be considered grounds for denial of an application for certification or termination of certification.


(d) *Emblem use by certified distributors or certified value added distributors of NOAA electronic products.* (1) After receiving separate, written permission from NOAA and the Department of Commerce as described in paragraph (a) of this section, a CED or CEVAD may use the NOAA emblem in product labeling and advertising materials, but only in conjunction with the phrase “Certified NOAA ENC Distributor” or “Certified NOAA ENC Value Added Distributor,” as applicable, and only after receiving separate, written permission from NOAA and the Department of Commerce as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.


(2) If the NOAA emblem is used with products that include other data, clear indication must be provided to the customer indicating that the emblem and the phrase “Certified NOAA ENC Distributor” or “Certified NOAA ENC Value Added Distributor” does not apply to the entire product delivered. Information on the effects of such limitation must be provided to the customer (See § 995.24(a)(4) and (5) and (b)(3) and (4).)
