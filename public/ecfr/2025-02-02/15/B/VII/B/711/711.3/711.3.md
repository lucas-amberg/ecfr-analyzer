Information requested may relate to the production, processing, consumption, export, import, or other activities involving scheduled chemicals and unscheduled discrete organic chemicals described in parts 712 through 715 of the CWCR. Any person or facility subject to the CWCR and receiving such a request for information will be required to provide a response to BIS within 30 working days of receipt of the request.
