# ยง 730.4   Other control agencies and departments.

In addition to the departments and agencies mentioned in ยง 730.3 of this part, other departments and agencies have jurisdiction over certain narrower classes of exports and reexports. These include the Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which administers controls against certain countries that are the object of sanctions affecting not only exports and reexports, but also imports and financial dealings. For your convenience, supplement no. 3 to part 730 identifies other departments and agencies with regulatory jurisdiction over certain types of exports and reexports. This is not a comprehensive list, and the brief descriptions are only generally indicative of the types of controls administered and/or enforced by each agency.
