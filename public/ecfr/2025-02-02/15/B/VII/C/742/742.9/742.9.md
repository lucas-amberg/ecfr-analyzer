# § 742.9   Anti-terrorism: Syria.

(a) *License requirements.* (1) If AT Column 1 of the Country Chart (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a license is required for export and reexport to Syria for anti-terrorism purposes.


(2) The Secretary of State has designated Syria as a country whose government has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.


(3) In support of U.S. foreign policy against terrorism, BIS maintains two types of anti-terrorism controls on the export and reexport to Syria of items described in supplement no. 2 to part 742.


(i) Items described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of supplement no. 2 to part 742, if destined to military, police, intelligence or other end-users in Syria, are controlled under section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act, as amended (EAA).


(ii) Items listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of supplement no. 2 to part 742 destined to other end-users in Syria, as well as items to all end-users listed in (c)(6) through (c)(8), (c)(10) through (c)(14), (c)(16) through (c)(19), and (c)(22) through (c)(44) of supplement no. 2 to part 742, are controlled to Syria under section 6(a) of the EAA.


(b) *Licensing policy.* (1) Applications for export and reexport to all end-users in Syria of the following items will generally be denied:


(i) Items that are controlled for chemical and biological weapons proliferation reasons to any destination. These are items that contain CB Column 1, CB Column 2, or CB Column 3 in the Country Chart column of the “License Requirements” section of an ECCN on the CCL.


(ii) Military-related items controlled for national security reasons to any destination. These are items that contain NS Column 1 in the Country Chart column of the “License Requirements” section in an ECCN on the CCL and are controlled by equipment or material entries ending in the number “18.”


(iii) Items that are controlled for missile proliferation reasons to any destination. These are items that have an MT Column 1 in the Country Chart column of the “License Requirements” section of an ECCN on the CCL.


(iv) All aircraft (powered and unpowered), helicopters, engines, and related spare parts and components, except that parts and components intended to ensure the safety of civil aviation and the safe operation of commercial passenger aircraft will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, with a presumption of approval. These are items controlled to any destination for national security and missile technology reasons and items controlled to Syria for anti-terrorism purposes. Such items contain an NS Column 1, NS Column 2, MT Column 1, or AT Column 1 in the Country Chart column of the “License Requirements” section of an ECCN on the CCL. Note that, consistent with the general rule that applies to computing U.S. parts and components content incorporated into foreign made products, all aircraft-related items that require a license to Syria will be included as controlled U.S. content, except for ECCNs 6A998, 7A994, and 9A991.d, for purposes of such licensing requirements.


(v) Cryptographic, cryptoanalytic, and cryptologic items controlled to any destination for national security reasons. Such items contain an AT Column 1 and an NS Column 1 or NS Column 2 in the Country Chart column of the “License Requirements” section of an ECCN on the CCL.


(vi) Explosives detection equipment controlled under ECCN 2A983.


(vii) “Software” (ECCN 2D983) specially designed or modified for the “development”, “production” or “use” of explosives detection equipment controlled by 2A983. 


(viii) “Technology” (ECCN 2E983) specially designed or modified for the “development”, “production” or “use” of explosives detection equipment controlled by 2A983. 


(ix) Commercial charges and devices controlled under ECCN 1C992.


(x) Ammonium nitrate, including certain fertilizers containing ammonium nitrate, controlled under ECCN 1C997. 


(xi) Technology for the production of Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) Schedule 2 and 3 chemicals controlled under ECCN 1E355.


(xii) Concealed object detection equipment controlled under ECCN 2A984.


(xiii) “Software” (ECCN 2D984) “required” for the “development”, “production” or “use” of concealed object detection equipment controlled by 2A984.


(xiv) “Technology” (ECCN 2E984) “required” for the “development”, “production” or “use” of concealed object detection equipment controlled by 2A984, or the “development” of “software” controlled by 2D984.


(2) Applications for export and reexport to Syria of all other items described in paragraph (a) of this section, and not described by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, will generally be denied if the export or reexport is destined to a military end-user or for military end-use. Applications for non-military end-users or for non-military end-uses will be considered on a case-by-case basis.


(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2), of this section, applications for Syria will be considered on a case-by-case basis if:


(i) The transaction involves the reexport to Syria of items where Syria was not the intended ultimate destination at the time of original export from the United States, provided that the exports from the U.S. occurred prior to the applicable contract sanctity date (or, where the contract sanctity date is December 16, 1986, prior to June 18, 1987).


(ii) The U.S. content of foreign-produced commodities is 20% or less by value; or


(iii) The commodities are medical items.


(4) License applications for items reviewed under 6(a) controls will also be reviewed to determine the applicability of 6(j) controls to the transaction. When it is determined that an export or reexport could make a significant contribution to the military potential of Syria, including its military logistics capability, or could enhance Syria's ability to support acts of international terrorism, the Secretaries of State and Commerce will notify the Congress 30 days prior to issuance of a license.


(c) *Contract sanctity.* Contract sanctity dates and related licensing policies for Syria are set forth in supplement no. 2 to part 742. Applicants who wish a pre-existing contract to be considered must submit sufficient documentation to establish the existence of a contract.


(d) *U.S. controls.* Although the United States seeks cooperation from like-minded countries in maintaining anti-terrorism controls, at this time these controls are maintained only by the United States.


(e) Section 746.9 (Syria) of the EAR sets forth the export and reexport controls for Syria. Section 746.9 supersedes the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.
