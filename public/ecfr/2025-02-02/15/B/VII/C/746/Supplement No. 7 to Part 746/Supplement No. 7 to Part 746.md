# Supplement No. 7 to Part 746—Items That Require a License Under § 746.6 When Destined to the Temporarily Occupied Crimea Region of Ukraine, Under § 746.7 When Destined to Iran, and Under § 746.8 When Destined to Russia or Belarus




The items identified in this supplement are a subset of items that are identified in specific Export Control Classification Numbers or designated as EAR99 under the Commerce Control List (CCL) in supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR. Also see paragraph (f) of § 734.9 of the EAR for the Russia/Belarus/Temporarily occupied Crimea region of Ukraine Foreign Direct Product (FDP) rule and paragraph (j) for the Iran FDP rule. Both of these FDP rules include the items identified in this supplement as part of the criteria for what foreign made items are subject to the EAR.




(a) The source for the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS)-6 codes and descriptions in this list is the United States International Trade Commission (USITC)'s Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (2023). The items described in this supplement include any modified or designed “components,” “parts,” “accessories,” and “attachments” therefor regardless of the HTS Code or HTS Description of the “components,” “parts,” “accessories,” and “attachments,” apart from any “part” or minor “component” that is a fastener (*e.g.,* screw, bolt, nut, nut plate, stud, insert, clip, rivet, pin), washer, spacer, insulator, grommet, bushing, spring, wire, or solder. The exclusion of fasteners from this control does not apply to fasteners that are designated under an HTS Code under this supplement. Although generally fasteners (*e.g.,* screws, bolts, nuts, nut plates, studs, inserts, clips, rivets, pins), and washers, spacers, insulators, grommets, bushings, springs, wires, and solder are excluded from the scope of this supplement, see part 744 of the EAR for license requirements for Russia and Belarus that apply to all items “subject to the EAR,” *e.g.,* § 744.21 of the EAR and the Entity List license requirements, which in most cases extend to all items “subject to the EAR.” This supplement includes two columns consisting of the HTS Code and HTS Description to assist exporters, reexporters, and transferors in identifying the products in this supplement. For information on HTS codes in general, you may contact a local import specialist at U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the nearest port.








(b) The items classified under the provisions identified in the HTS-6 Code column of this supplement are subject to the license requirements under §§ 746.6(a)(1)(ii), 746.7(a)(1)(ii) and (iii), and 746.8(a)(2). The other column—HTS Description—is intended to assist exporters with their AES filing responsibilities. The license requirements extend to HTS Codes at the 8 and 10 digit level when those HTS-8 and HTS-10 codes begin with the HTS-6 Codes as the first 6 numbers of those longer HS Codes.
