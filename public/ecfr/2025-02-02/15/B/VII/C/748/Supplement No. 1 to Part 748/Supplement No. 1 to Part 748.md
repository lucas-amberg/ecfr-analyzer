All information must be legibly typed within the lines for each Block or Box, except where a signature is required. Enter only one typed line of text per Block or line. Where there is a choice of entering telephone numbers or facsimile numbers, and you wish to provide a facsimile number instead of a telephone number, identify the facsimile number with the letter “F” immediately after the number (e.g., 022-358-0-123456F). If you are completing this form to request classification of your item, you must complete Blocks 1 through 5, 14, 22 (a), (b), (c), (d), and (i), 24, and 25 only. 


Block 1: Contact Person. Enter the name of the person who can answer questions concerning the application.


Block 2: Telephone. Enter the telephone number of the person who can answer questions concerning the application.


Block 3: Facsimile. Enter the facsimile number, if available, of the person who can answer questions concerning the application.


Block 4: Date of Application. Enter the current date.


Block 5: Type of Application. *Export.* If the items are located within the United States, and you wish to export those items, mark the Box labeled “Export” with an (X). Reexport. If the items are located outside the United States, mark the Box labeled “Reexport” with an (X).


*Classification.* If you are requesting BIS to classify your item against the Commerce Control List (CCL), mark the Box labeled “Classification Request” with an (X). If you are submitting a License Exception STA eligibility request pursuant to § 740.20(g), mark the box labeled “Export” with an (X) and then proceed to Block 6 of this supplement for instructions specific to such requests.


Block 6: Documents submitted with Application. Review the documentation you are required to submit with your application in accordance with the provisions of part 748 of the EAR, and mark all applicable Boxes with an (X).


Mark the Box “Foreign Availability” with an (X) if you are submitting an assertion of foreign availability with your license application. See part 768 of the EAR for instructions on foreign availability submissions.


If you are *not* making a foreign availability assertion under part 768 of the EAR, you may still mark the box “Foreign Availability” with an (X), if you are submitting an assertion of foreign availability with your license application. Foreign availability assertions covered under part 768 are limited to items controlled for national security reasons. However, if an applicant intends to include foreign availability support material for items not controlled for national security reasons, applicants are permitted to do this as part of the license application by marking the box “Foreign Availability” with an (X) and including the foreign availability information, along with the support material for the license application. Applicants must clearly label this support material as “Foreign availability information—outside the scope of part 768”. Although this information is outside the scope of part 768, applicants should still use supplement no. 1 to part 768 for general guidance regarding what types of information may be suitable for demonstrating foreign availability. The purpose of submitting this type of foreign availability information will be to make the U.S. Government more aware of the foreign availability of items not controlled for national security reasons.


Mark the “Tech. Specs.” box with an (X) if you are submitting descriptive literature, brochures, technical specifications, etc. with your application. Mark the “Other” box with an (X) and insert the phrase “STA request” for the description of the support document to submit a request for License Exception STA eligibility pursuant to § 740.20(g). (See supplement no. 2 to part 748 under paragraph (w) for unique application and submission requirements for License Exception STA eligibility requests described under this Block 6.)

Block 15: Other Party Authorized to Receive License. If you would like BIS to transmit the approved license to another party designated by you, complete all information in this Block, including name, street address, city, country, postal code and telephone number. Leave this space blank if the license is to be sent to the applicant. Designation of another party to receive the license does not alter the responsibilities of the applicant.


Block 16: Purchaser. Enter the purchaser's complete name, street address, city, country, postal code, and telephone or facsimile number. Refer to § 748.5(c) of this part for a definition of “purchaser”. If the purchaser is also the ultimate consignee, enter the complete name and address.

A bank, freight forwarder, forwarding agent, or other intermediary may not be identified as the ultimate consignee. Government purchasing organizations are the sole exception to this requirement. This type of entity may be identified as the government entity that is the actual ultimate consignee in those instances when the items are to be transferred to the government entity that is the actual end-user, provided the actual end-user and end-use is clearly identified in Block 21 or in the additional documentation attached to the application. 


If your application is for the reexport of items previously exported, enter the new ultimate consignee's complete name, street address, city, country, postal code, and telephone or facsimile number.

If you are requesting approval of a reexport, provide a complete and detailed description of the end-use intended by the new ultimate consignee or end-user(s) and indicate any other countries for which resale or reexport is requested. If additional space is necessary, use Block 21 on Form BIS-748P-A or B. Be specific—vague descriptions such as “research”, “manufacturing”, or “scientific uses” are not acceptable. 


Block 22: For a license application, you must complete each of the sub-blocks contained in this Block. If you are submitting a classification request, you need not complete Blocks (e), (f), (g), and (h). If you wish to export, reexport, or have BIS classify more than one item, use Form BIS-748P-A for additional items. 


(a) ECCN. Enter the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) that corresponds to the item you wish to export or reexport. If you are asking BIS to classify your item, provide a recommended classification for the item in this Block.


(b) CTP. You must enter the “Adjusted Peak Performance” (“APP”) in this Block if your application includes a digital computer or equipment containing a computer as described in supplement no. 2 to this part. Instructions on calculating the APP are contained in a Technical Note at the end of Category 4 in the CCL.


(c) Model Number. Enter the correct model number for the item. 


(d) CCATS Number. If you have received a classification for this item from BIS, provide the CCATS number shown on the classification issued by BIS. 


(e) Quantity. Identify the quantity to be exported or reexported, in terms of the unit commonly used in the trade.


(f) Units. The unit of quantity used in Block 22(e) must be entered on all license applications submitted to BIS. This Block may be left blank on license applications for technology only. 


(g) Unit Price. Provide the fair market value of the items you wish to export or reexport. Round all prices to the nearest whole dollar amount. Give the exact unit price only if the value is less than $0.50. If normal trade practices make it impractical to establish a firm contract price, state in Block 24 the precise terms upon which the price is to be ascertained and from which the contract price may be objectively determined.


(h) Total Price. Provide the total price of the item(s) described in Block 22(j).


(i) Manufacturer. Provide the name only of the manufacturer, if known, for each of the items you wish to export, reexport, or have BIS classify, if different from the applicant.


(j) Technical Description. Provide a description of the item(s) you wish to export, reexport, or have BIS classify. Provide details when necessary to identify the specific item(s), include all characteristics or parameters shown in the applicable ECCN using measurements identified in the ECCN (e.g., basic ingredients, composition, electrical parameters, size, gauge, grade, horsepower, etc.). These characteristics must be identified for the items in the proposed transaction when they are different than the characteristics described in promotional brochure(s).


Block 23: Total Application Dollar Value. Enter the total value of all items contained on the application in U.S. Dollars. The use of other currencies is not acceptable.


Block 24: Additional Information. Enter additional data pertinent to the application as required in the EAR. Include special certifications, names of parties of interest not disclosed elsewhere, explanation of documents attached, etc. Do not include information concerning Block 22 in this space. 


If your application represents a previously denied application, you must provide the Application Control Number from the original application. 


If you are requesting BIS to classify your product, use this space to explain why you believe the ECCN entered in Block 22(a) is appropriate. This explanation must contain an analysis of the item in terms of the technical control parameters specified in the appropriate ECCN. If you have not identified a recommended classification in Block 22(a), you must state the reason you cannot determine the appropriate classification, identifying anything in the regulations that you believe precluded you from determining the correct classification. 


If additional space is necessary, use Block 24 on Form BIS-748P-A or B. 


This Block should be completed if your application includes a 9x515 or “600 series” item that is equivalent to a transaction previously approved under an ITAR license or other approval. Enter the previous State license number or other approval identifier in Block 24 of the BIS license application. If more than one previous State license number or other approval identifier is applicable, then enter the most recent one. Only those license applications where the particulars of the EAR license application are equivalent as previously authorized under the ITAR license or other approval in regard to the description of the item (including the item's function, performance capabilities, form and fit), purchaser, ultimate consignee and end users on the license will receive full consideration under this paragraph, which may result in a quicker processing time. The classification of the 9x515 or “600 series” item in question will no longer be the same because the item would no longer be “subject to the ITAR,” but all other aspects of the description of the item must be the same in order to be reviewed under this expedited process under paragraph (x) of supplement no. 2 to part 748 of the EAR.


Block 25: You, as the applicant or duly authorized agent of the applicant, must manually sign in this Block. Rubber-stamped or electronic signatures are not acceptable. If you are an agent of the applicant, in addition to providing your name and title in this Block, you must enter your company's name in Block 24. Type both your name and title in the space provided.
