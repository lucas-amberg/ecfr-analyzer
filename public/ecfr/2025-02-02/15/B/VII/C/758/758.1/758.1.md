# § 758.1   The Electronic Export Information (EEI) filing to the Automated Export System (AES).

(a) The *Electronic Export Information (EEI) filing to the Automated Export System (AES).* The EEI is used by the Bureau of Census to collect trade statistics and by the Bureau of Industry and Security for export control purposes. The EEI collects basic information such as the names and addresses of the parties to a transaction; the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) (when required), the Schedule B number or Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) number, the description, quantity and value of the items exported; and the license authority for the export. The EEI is a statement to the United States Government that the transaction occurred as described.


(b) *When is an EEI filing required to be filed in the AES.* Except when the export of items subject to the EAR is to take place electronically or in an otherwise intangible form, you must file EEI in the AES with the United States Government for items subject to the EAR, including exports by U.S. mail, in the following situations:


(1) For all exports of items subject to the EAR that are destined to a country in Country Group E:1 or E:2 of supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR regardless of value;


(2) For all exports subject to the EAR that require submission of a license application, regardless of value or destination;


(3) For all exports of 9x515 or “600 series” items enumerated or otherwise described in paragraphs .a through .x of a 9x515 or “600 series” ECCN regardless of value or destination, including exports to Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom;




(4) For all exports under license exception Strategic Trade Authorization (STA);


(5) For all exports of commodities and mass market software subject to the EAR when the value of the commodities or mass market software classified under a single Schedule B Number (or HTS) is over $2,500, except as exempted by the Foreign Trade Regulations (FTR) in 15 CFR Part 30 and referenced in paragraph (c) of this section;


(6) For all exports of items subject to the EAR that will be transshipped through Australia, Canada, or the United Kingdom to a third destination, where the export would require EEI or license if shipped directly to the final destination from the United States (see 15 CFR 30.36(b)(2) of the FTR);




(7) For all items exported under authorization Validated End-User (VEU);


(8) For all exports of tangible items subject to the EAR where parties to the transaction, as described in § 748.5(d) through (f) of the EAR, are listed on the Unverified List (supplement no. 6 to part 744 of the EAR), regardless of value or destination; or


(9) For all exports, except for exports authorized under License Exception BAG, as set forth in § 740.14 of the EAR, of commodities controlled under ECCNs 0A501.a or .b, 0A506, or 0A507, shotguns with a barrel length less than 18 inches controlled under ECCNs 0A502 or 0A508, or ammunition controlled under ECCN 0A505 except for .c, regardless of value or destination, including exports to Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom.




(10) For all exports of items on the Commerce Control List to the People's Republic of China, Russia, or Venezuela, regardless of value, unless the export may be made under the exemption listed under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.




(11) For all exports of items in ECCN 3A069 when destined to a destination in Country Group D.






(c) *Exemptions.* A complete list of exemptions from the EEI filing requirement is set forth in the 15 CFR 30.35 through 30.40 of the FTR. Some of these FTR exemptions have elements in common with certain EAR license exceptions. An FTR exemption may be narrower than an EAR license exception. The following references are provided in order to direct you to the FTR exemptions that relate to EAR license exceptions:


(1) License Exception Baggage (BAG), as set forth in § 740.14 of the EAR. See 15 CFR 30.37(x) of the FTR;


(2) License Exception Gift Parcels and Humanitarian Donations (GFT), as set forth in § 740.12 of the EAR. See 15 CFR 30.37(h) of the FTR;


(3) License Exception Aircraft and Vessels (AVS), as set forth in § 740.15 of the EAR. See 15 CFR 30.37(o) (5) of the FTR;


(4) License Exception Governments and International Organizations (GOV), as set forth in § 740.11 of the EAR. See 15 CFR 30.39 and 30.40 of the FTR;


(5) License Exception Technology and Software Under Restriction (TSR), as set forth in § 740.6 of the EAR. See 15 CFR 30.37(f) of the FTR; or


(6) License Exception Temporary Imports, Exports, and Reexports (TMP) “tools of trade”, as set forth in § 740.9(a)(1) of the EAR. See 15 CFR 30.37(b) of the FTR.


(d) *Notation on export documents for exports exempt from EEI filing requirements.* When an exemption from filing the EEI applies, the export authority (license exception or NLR) of all the items must be entered on the loading document (e.g., Cargo Declaration, manifest, bill of lading, (master) air waybill) by the person responsible for preparing the document, see 15 CFR 30.35 of the FTR. This requirement is intended to parallel the Bureau of Census requirement, so that notations as to the basis for the EEI exemption and the license authority are entered in the same place and manner (see 15 CFR 30.45(e) and (f) of the FTR for detailed requirements). The loading document must be available for inspection by government officials, along with the items, prior to lading on the carrier.


(e) *Filing the Electronic Export Information (EEI*) *to the AES.* The person who files the EEI to the AES must be in the United States at the time of filing. The person who transmits the EEI to the AES must be a certified AES participant in accordance with 15 CFR 30.5 of the FTR. The person who transmits EEI to the AES, whether exporter (U.S. principal party in interest) or agent, is responsible for the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the EEI, except insofar as that person can demonstrate that he or she reasonably relied on information furnished by others.


(f) *The EEI is an export control document.* The EEI is a statement to the United States Government. The EEI is an export control document as defined in Part 772 of the EAR. False statements made thereon may be a violation of § 764.2(g) of the EAR. When EEI is filed to the AES, the filer of the EEI represents the following:


(1) Export of the items described on the EEI filing is authorized under the terms and conditions of a license issued by BIS; is in accordance with the terms and conditions of a license exception; is authorized under “NLR” as no license is required for the shipment; or is not subject to the EAR;


(2) Statements on the EEI filing are in conformity with the contents of any license issued by BIS, with the possible exception of the USPPI and USPPI identification blocks in routed transactions or any name change approved by BIS in writing in accordance with § 750.7(c)(2) of the EAR; and


(3) All information shown on the EEI filing is true, accurate, and complete.


(g) *Export control information on the EEI filing in AES.* For each item on the EEI filing, you must report the license authority (license number, License Exception symbol, or No License Required (NLR) designator), the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) (when required), and the item description in the designated blocks. The item description must be stated in Commerce Control List (CCL) terms. If those terms are inadequate to meet the Bureau of Census requirements, the FTR requires that you give enough additional detail to permit verification of the Schedule B Number (or Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) number). See 15 CFR part 30, appendix B, part III of the FTR for license codes.


(1) *Exports under a license.* When exporting under the authority of a license, you must report on the EEI filing to the AES the license code that corresponds to the license, license number, the ECCN, and an item description identical to the item description on the license.


(2) *Exports under a license exception.* You must report on any required EEI filing to the AES the ECCN and the correct License Exception symbol (e.g., LVS, GBS, CIV) for the License Exception(s) and the license code/license exception code that corresponds to the license exception under which you are exporting. Items temporarily in the United States meeting the provisions of License Exception TMP, under § 740.9(b)(3), are exempted from entering the ECCN. See also § 740.1(d) of the EAR.


(3) *No License Required (NLR) exports.* You must report on any required EEI filing to the AES the correct license code/license exception code when using the “NLR” designation for the items that are subject to the EAR but not listed on the Commerce Control List (CCL) (*i.e.,* items are designated as EAR99) (FTR license code “C33”), and when the items to be exported are listed on the CCL but are not subject to a license requirement. In addition, you must enter the correct ECCN on any required EEI filing for all items being exported under the NLR provisions that have a reason for control other than or in addition to anti-terrorism (AT), unless the items are destined to China, Russia, or Venezuela. For items destined to China, Russia, or Venezuela, you must enter the correct ECCN on any required EEI filing regardless of reason for control.


(4) *Exports of firearms and related items.* This paragraph (g)(4) includes two separate requirements under paragraphs (g)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section that are used to better identify exports of certain firearms under the EAR. Paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section is limited to certain EAR authorizations. Paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section applies to all EAR authorizations that require EEI filing in AES.


(i) *Identifying firearms by manufacturer, model, caliber, and serial number in the EEI filing in AES.* For any export authorized under License Exception TMP or a BIS license authorizing a temporary export of items controlled under ECCNs 0A501.a or .b, 0A506, or 0A507 or shotguns with a barrel length less than 18 inches controlled under ECCNs 0A502 or 0A508, in addition to any other required data for the associated EEI filing, you must report the manufacturer, model, caliber, and serial number of the exported items. The requirements of this paragraph (g)(4)(i) also apply to any other export authorized under a BIS license that includes a condition or proviso on the license requiring the submission of this information specified in paragraph (g) of this section when the EEI is filed in AES.


(ii) *Identifying firearms and certain “parts,” “components,” devices, “accessories,” and “attachments” by “items” level classification or other control descriptor in the EEI filing in AES.* For any export of items controlled under ECCNs 0A501.a or .b, 0A506, 0A507, shotguns with a barrel length less than 18 inches controlled under ECCNs 0A502 or 0A508.a.1, or .a.2, or “parts,” “components,” devices, “accessories,” or “attachments” controlled under 0A509.a, .b, .c, or .d, in addition to any other required data for the associated EEI filing, the exporter must include the items paragraph classification or other control descriptor as specified in paragraphs (g)(4)(ii)(A) through (F) for ECCNs 0A501, 0A502, 0A506, 0A507, 0A508, or 0A509, as applicable, as the first text to appear in the Commodity description block in the EEI filing in AES. (*See* § 743.4 of the EAR for the use of this information for ECCNs 0A501.a or .b, 0A506.a or .b, and 0A507.a, or .b for conventional arms reporting).


(A) If exporting firearms controlled under 0A501, enter .a or .b, as applicable;


(B) If exporting shotguns with a barrel length less than 18 inches controlled under 0A502, enter .SB;


(C) If exporting semi-automatic rifles controlled under 0A506, enter .a or .b, as applicable;


(D) If exporting semi-automatic pistols controlled under 0A507, enter .a or .b, as applicable;


(E) If exporting semi-automatic shotguns controlled under 0A508, enter .a or .b, as applicable; *or*

(F) If exporting “parts,” “components,” devices, “accessories,” or “attachments” controlled under ECCN 0A509, enter .a, .b, .c, .d, or .e, as applicable.






(5) *Exports of .z items that meet or exceed the performance parameters of ECCN 3A090 or 4A090.* This paragraph (g)(5) imposes a requirement for identifying .z items by “items” level classification in the EEI filing in AES. For any export of .z items controlled under ECCNs 3A001, 4A003, 4A004, 4A005, 5A002, 5A004, 5A992, 5D002, or 5D992 in addition to any other required data for the associated EEI filing, you must include the items paragraph classification (*i.e.,* .z), when applicable, as the first text to appear in the Commodity description block in the EEI filing in AES.




(h) *Power of attorney or other written authorization.* In a “power of attorney” or other written authorization, authority is conferred upon an agent to perform certain specified acts or kinds of acts on behalf of a principal.


(1) An agent must obtain a power of attorney or other written authorization in the following circumstances:


(i) An agent that represents a foreign principal party in interest in a routed transaction must obtain a power of attorney or other written authorization that sets forth his authority; and


(ii) An agent that applies for a license on behalf of a principal party in interest must obtain a power of attorney or other written authorization that sets forth the agent's authority to apply for the license on behalf of the principal.


(2) This requirement for a power of attorney or other written authorization is a legal requirement aimed at ensuring that the parties to a transaction negotiate and understand their responsibilities. The absence of a power of attorney or other written authorization does not prevent BIS from using other evidence to establish the existence of an agency relationship for purposes of imposing liability.


(i) *Filing the Electronic Export Information (EEI).* The EEI must be filed with the United States Government in the manner prescribed by the Bureau of Census Foreign Trade Regulations (15 CFR part 30).
