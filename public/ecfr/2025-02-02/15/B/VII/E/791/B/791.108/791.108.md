(b) After considering the effect of any submission by a party to a transaction under § 791.107 consistent with paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary shall provide notice in writing of the proposed Final Determination and consult with and seek concurrence from all appropriate agency heads prior to issuing a Final Determination as to whether the Covered ICTS Transaction shall be prohibited, not prohibited, or permitted pursuant to the adoption of negotiated mitigation measures.


(c) If the appropriate agency heads under paragraph (b) of this section concur, the Secretary shall issue a Final Determination pursuant to § 791.109.
