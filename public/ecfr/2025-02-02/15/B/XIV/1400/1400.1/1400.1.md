# § 1400.1   Purpose and scope.

(a) The purpose of this part is to set forth regulations for determination of group eligibility for MBDA assistance.


(b) In order to be eligible to receive assistance from MBDA funded organizations, a concern must be a minority business enterprise as defined in 15 U.S.C. 9501(9). The purpose of this regulation is to provide guidance to groups not previously designated as eligible for assistance who believe they are entitled to formal designation as “socially or economically disadvantaged.” Upon adequate showing by representatives of the group that the group is, as a whole, socially or economically disadvantaged, the group will be so designated and its members will be eligible for MBDA assistance. Designation under this regulation will not establish eligibility for any other Federal or Federally funded program.
