Applications for the institution of proceedings for the cancellation of registration of trade, service, or certification marks under the Trade-Mark Act of 1946 may be filed with the Secretary of the Commission. Such applications shall be in writing, signed by or in behalf of the applicant, and should identify the registration concerned and contain a short and simple statement of the facts constituting the alleged basis for cancellation, the name and address of the applicant, together with all relevant and available information. If, after consideration of the application, or upon its own initiative, the Commission concludes that cancellation of the mark may be warranted, it will institute a proceeding before the Commissioner of Patents for cancellation of the registration.
