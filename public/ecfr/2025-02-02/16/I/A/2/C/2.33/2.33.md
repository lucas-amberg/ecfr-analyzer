# ยง 2.33   Compliance procedure.

The Commission may in its discretion require that a proposed agreement containing an order to cease and desist be accompanied by an initial report signed by the respondent setting forth in precise detail the manner in which the respondent will comply with the order when and if entered. Such report will not become part of the public record unless and until the accompanying agreement and order are accepted by the Commission. At the time any such report is submitted a respondent may request confidentiality for any portion thereof with a precise showing of justification therefor as set out in ยง 4.9(c) and the General Counsel or the General Counsel's designee will dispose of such requests in accordance with that section.
