# § 300.24   Representations as to fiber content.

(a) Words, coined words, symbols, or depictions which constitute or imply the name or designation of a fiber which is not present in the product shall not appear on labels. Any word or coined word which is phonetically similar to the name or designation of a fiber or which is only a slight variation in spelling from the name or designation of a fiber shall not be used in such a manner as to represent or imply that such fiber is present in the product when the fiber is not present as represented.


(b) Where a word, coined word, symbol, or depiction which connotes or implies the presence of a fiber is used on any label, whether required or non-required, a full fiber content disclosure with percentages shall be made on such label in accordance with the Act and regulations. Where a word, coined word, symbol, or depiction which connotes or implies the presence of a fiber is used on any hang-tag attached to a wool product that has a label providing required information and the hang-tag provides non-required information, such as a hang-tag providing information about a particular fiber's characteristics, the hang-tag need not provide a full fiber content disclosure; however, if the wool product contains any fiber other than the fiber identified on the hang-tag, the hang-tag must disclose clearly and conspicuously that it does not provide the product's full fiber content; for example:


“This tag does not disclose the product's full fiber content.” or


“See label for the product's full fiber content.”
