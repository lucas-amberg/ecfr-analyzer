# ยง 301.26   Registered identification numbers.

(a) Registered numbers for use as the required identification in lieu of the name on fur product labels as provided in section 4(2)(E) of the Act will be issued by the Commission to qualified persons residing in the United States upon receipt of an application duly executed on the Commission's Web site at *https://rn.ftc.gov* or by such means as the Commission or its designee may direct.


(b)(1) Registered identification numbers shall be used only by the person or concern to whom they are issued, and such numbers are not transferable or assignable.


(2) Registered identification numbers shall be subject to cancellation if the Federal Trade Commission fails to receive prompt notification of any change in name, business address, or legal business status of a person or firm to whom a registered identification number has been assigned, by application duly executed in the form and manner set out in paragraph (d) of this section, reflecting the current name, business address, and legal business status of the person or firm.


(3) Registered identification numbers shall be subject to cancellation whenever any such number was procured or has been used improperly or contrary to the requirements of the act and regulations, or when otherwise deemed necessary in the public interest.


(c) Registered identification numbers assigned under this rule may be used on labels required in labeling products subject to the provisions of the Wool Products Labeling Act and Textile Fiber Products Identification Act, and numbers previously assigned or to be assigned by the Commission under such Acts may be used as and for the required name in labeling under this Act. When so used by the person or firm to whom assigned, the use of the numbers shall be construed as identifying and binding the applicant as fully and in all respects as though assigned under the specific Act for which it is used.


(d) Requests for a registered identification number, to update information pertaining to an existing number, or to cancel an existing number shall be made through the Commission's Web site at *https://rn.ftc.gov.* Unless otherwise directed by the Commission or its designee, requests made by other means (including but not limited to email) will not be accepted and approved.
