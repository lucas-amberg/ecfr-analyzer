(2) *Labels for non-liquid alternative vehicle fuels (other than electricity) with disclosure of two components.* All type should be set in upper case (all caps) “Helvetica Black” throughout. Helvetica Black is available in a variety of computer desk-top and photo-typesetting systems. Its name may vary, but the type must conform in style and thickness to the sample provided here.
