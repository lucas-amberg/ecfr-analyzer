# § 455.6   State exemptions.

(a) If, upon application to the Commission by an appropriate State agency, the Commission determines, that—


(1) There is a State requirement in effect which applies to any transaction to which this rule applies; and


(2) That State requirement affords an overall level of protection to consumers which is as great as, or greater than, the protection afforded by this Rule; then the Commission's Rule will not be in effect in that State to the extent specified by the Commission in its determination, for as long as the State administers and enforces effectively the State requirement.


(b) Applications for exemption under subsection (a) should be directed to the Secretary of the Commission. When appropriate, proceedings will be commenced in order to make a determination described in paragraph (a) of this section, and will be conducted in accordance with subpart C of part 1 of the Commission's Rules of Practice.
