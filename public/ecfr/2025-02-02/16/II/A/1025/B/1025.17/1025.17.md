# § 1025.17   Intervention.

(a) *Participation as an intervenor.* Any person who desires to participate as a party in any proceedings subject to these rules shall file a written petition for leave to intervene with the Secretary and shall serve a copy of the petition on each party.


(1) A petition shall ordinarily be filed not later than the convening of the first prehearing conference. A petition filed after that time will not be granted unless the Presiding Officer determines that the petitioner has made a substantial showing of good cause for failure to file on time.


(2) A petition shall:


(i) Identify the specific aspect or aspects of the proceedings as to which the petitioner wishes to intervene,


(ii) Set forth the interest of the petitioner in the proceedings,


(iii) State how the petitioner's interest may be affected by the results of the proceedings, and


(iv) State any other reasons why the petitioner should be permitted to intervene as a party, with particular reference to the factors set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. Any petition relating only to matters outside the jurisdiction of the Commission shall be denied.


(3) Any person whose petition for leave to intervene is granted by the Presiding Officer shall be known as an “intervenor” and as such shall have the full range of litigating rights afforded to any other party.


(b) *Participation by a person not an intervenor.* Any person who desires to participate in the proceedings as a non-party shall file with the Secretary a request to participate in the proceedings and shall serve a copy of such request on each party to the proceedings.


(1) A request shall ordinarily be filed not later than the commencement of the hearing. A petition filed after that time will not be granted unless the Presiding Officer determines that the person making the request has made a substantial showing of good cause for failure to file on time.


(2) A request shall set forth the nature and extent of the person's alleged interest in the proceedings. Any request relating only to matters outside the jurisdiction of the Commission shall be denied.


(3) Any person who files a request to participate in the proceedings as a non-party and whose request is granted by the Presiding Officer shall be known as a “Participant” and shall have the right to participate in the proceedings to the extent of making a written or oral statement of position, filing proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law and a post hearing brief with the Presiding Officer, and filing an appellate brief before the Commission if an appeal is taken by a party or review is ordered by the Commission in accordance with § 1025.53 or § 1025.54, as applicable, of these rules.


(c) *Response to petition to intervene.* Any party may file a response to a petition for leave to intervene after the petition is filed with the Secretary, with particular reference to the factors set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.


(d) *Ruling by Presiding Officer on petition.* In ruling on a petition for leave to intervene, the Presiding Officer shall consider, in addition to all other relevant matters, the following factors:


(1) The nature of the petitioner's interest, under the applicable statute governing the proceedings, to be made a party to the proceedings;


(2) The nature and extent of the petitioner's interest in protecting himself/herself/itself or the public against unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products;


(3) The nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial or other substantial interest in the proceedings;


(4) Whether the petitioner would be aggrieved by any final order which may be entered in the proceedings;


(5) The extent to which the peititioner's intervention may reasonably be expected to assist in developing a sound record;


(6) The extent to which the petitioner's interest will be represented by existing parties;


(7) The extent to which the petitioner's intervention may broaden the issues or delay the proceedings; and


(8) The extent to which the petitioner's interest can be protected by other available means.


(e) *Ruling by Presiding Officer on request.* In ruling on a request to participate as a participant, the Presiding Officer, in the exercise of his/her discretion, shall be mindful of the Commission's mandate under its enabling legislation (see 15 U.S.C. 2051 *et seq.*) and its affirmative desire to afford interested persons, including consumers and consumer organizations, as well as governmental entities, an opportunity to participate in the agency's regulatory processes, including adjudicative proceedings. The Presiding Officer shall consider, in addition to all other relevant matters, the following factors:


(1) The nature and extent of the person's alleged interest in the proceedings;


(2) The possible effect of any final order which may be entered in the proceedings on the person's interest; and


(3) The extent to which the person's participation can be expected to assist the Presiding Officer and the Commission in rendering a fair and equitable resolution of all matters in controversy in the proceedings.


(f) *Designation of single representative.* If the Presiding Officer determines that a petitioner pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section or a person requesting to participate pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section is a member of a class of prospective intervenors or participants, as applicable, who share an identity of interest, the Presiding Officer may limit such intervention or participation, as applicable, through designation of a single representative by the prospective intervenors or participants, as applicable, or, if they are unable to agree, by designation of the Presiding Officer.
