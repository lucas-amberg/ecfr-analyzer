# ยง 1052.1   Scope and purpose.

(a) Section 9(d)(2) of the Consumer Product Safety Act, 15 U.S.C. 2058(d)(2), and section 4(d) of the Flammable Fabrics Act, 15 U.S.C. 1193(d), provide that certain rules under those statutes shall be promulgated pursuant to section 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, except that the Commission shall give interested persons an opportunity for the oral presentation of data, views or arguments in addition to the opportunity to make written submissions. Several rulemaking provisions of the statutes administered by the Commission are subject only to the rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act. Section 4(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act provides that the opportunity for oral presentations may or may not be granted in rulemaking under that section. In addition, section 27(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Act, 15 U.S.C. 2076(a), authorizes informal proceedings that can be conducted in non-rulemaking investigatory situations.


(b) This part sets forth rules of procedure for the oral presentation of data, views or arguments in the informal rulemaking or investigatory situations described in subsection (a) of this section. In situations where the opportunity for an oral presentation is not required by statute, the Commission will determine whether to provide the opportunity on a case-by-case basis.
