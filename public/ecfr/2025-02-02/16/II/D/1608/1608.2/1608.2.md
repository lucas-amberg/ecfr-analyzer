# ยง 1608.2   Form of separate guaranty.

The forms which follow are suggested forms of separate guaranties under section 8 of the act for use by guarantors residing in the United States. Representations contained in these suggested forms of separate guaranties with respect to reasonable and representative tests may be based upon a guaranty received and relied upon in good faith by the guarantor, tests performed by or for a guarantor, or class tests, where permitted under these rules. Where the forms are used as part of an invoice or other paper relating to the marketing or handling of products, fabrics, or related materials subject to the act, wording may be varied to limit the guaranty to specific items in such invoice or other paper. The name, address of the guarantor, and date on the invoice or other paper will suffice to meet the signature, address, and date requirements indicated on the forms.


(a) *General form.*

(b) *Form for guaranty based on guaranty.*
