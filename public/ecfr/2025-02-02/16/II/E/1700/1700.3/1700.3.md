# ยง 1700.3   Establishment of standards for special packaging.

(a) Pursuant to section 3 of the act, the Commission, after consultation with the technical advisory committee provided for by section 6 of the act, may establish by regulation standards for the special packaging of any household substance if the Commission finds:


(1) That the degree or nature of the hazard to children in the availability of such substance, by reason of its packaging, is such that special packaging is required to protect children from serious personal injury or serious illness resulting from handling, using, or ingesting such substance; and


(2) That the special packaging to be required by such standard is technically feasible, practicable, and appropriate for such substance.


(b) In establishing such a standard, the Commission shall consider:


(1) The reasonableness of such standard;


(2) Available scientific, medical, and engineering data concerning special packaging and concerning childhood accidental ingestions, illness, and injury caused by household substances;


(3) The manufacturing practices of industries affected by the act; and


(4) The nature and use of the household substance.


(c) In the process of establishing such a standard, the Commission shall publish its findings and reasons therefor and shall cite the sections of the act that authorize its action.


(d) In establishing such standards, the Commission shall not prescribe specific packaging designs, product content, package quantity, or labeling except for labeling under section 4(a)(2) of the act. Regarding a household substance for which special packaging is required by regulation, the Commission can prohibit the packaging of such substance in a package which the Commission determines is unnecessarily attractive to children.


(e) Promulgations pursuant to section 3 of the act shall be in accordance with section 5 of the act as to procedure.
