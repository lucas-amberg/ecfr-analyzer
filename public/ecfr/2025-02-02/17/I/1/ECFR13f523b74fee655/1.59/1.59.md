(ii) Employees of the self-regulatory organization from disclosing to any other person any material, non-public information which such employee obtains as a result of his or her employment at the self-regulatory organization where such employee has or should have a reasonable expectation that the information disclosed may assist another person in trading any commodity interest; *Provided, however,* That such rules shall not prohibit disclosures made in the course of an employee's duties, or disclosures made to another self-regulatory organization, linked exchange, court of competent jurisdiction or representative of any agency or department of the federal or state government acting in his or her official capacity.
