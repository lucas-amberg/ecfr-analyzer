(2) In the case of any applicant or registrant included within such consolidation, if equity capital of the applicant or registrant (inclusive of satisfactory subordination agreements which qualify as equity under paragraph (d) of this section) would be less than 30 percent of the required debt-equity total as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.


(f)(1) Every applicant or registrant, in computing its net capital pursuant to this section must, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(4) of this section, consolidate in a single computation, assets and liabilities of any subsidiary or affiliate for which it guarantees, endorses, or assumes directly or indirectly the obligations or liabilities.

(2)(i) If the consolidation, provided for in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, of any such subsidiary or affiliate results in the increase of the applicant's or registrant's adjusted net capital or decreases the minimum adjusted net capital requirement, and an opinion of counsel called for in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section has not been obtained, such benefits shall not be recognized in the applicant's or registrant's computation required by this section.


(ii) Except as provided for in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, consolidation shall be permitted with respect to any subsidiaries or affiliates which are majority owned and controlled by the applicant or registrant, and for which the applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the National Futures Association, or for which the registrant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commission and the designated self-regulatory organization, if any, by an opinion of counsel, that the net asset values or the portion thereof related to the parent's ownership interest in the subsidiary or affiliate, may be caused by the applicant or registrant or an appointed trustee to be distributed to the applicant or registrant within 30 calendar days. Such opinion must also set forth the actions necessary to cause such a distribution to be made, identify the parties having the authority to take such actions, identify and describe the rights of other parties or classes of parties, including but not limited to customers, general creditors, subordinated lenders, minority shareholders, employees, litigants, and governmental or regulatory authorities, who may delay or prevent such a distribution and such other assurances as the National Futures Association, the Commission or the designated self-regulatory organization by rule or interpretation may require. Such opinion must be current and periodically renewed in connection with the applicant's or registrant's annual audit pursuant to § 1.10 or upon any material change in circumstances.


(3) In preparing a consolidated computation of adjusted net capital pursuant to this section, the following minimum and non-exclusive requirements shall be observed;


(i) Consolidated adjusted net capital shall be reduced by the estimated amount of any tax reasonably anticipated to be incurred upon distribution of the assets of the subsidiary or affiliate.


(ii) Liabilities of a consolidated subsidiary or affiliate which are subordinated to the claims of present and future creditors pursuant to a satisfactory subordination agreement shall be deducted from consolidated adjusted net capital unless such subordination extends also to the claims of present or future creditors of the parent applicant or registrant and all consolidated subsidiaries.


(iii) Subordinated liabilities of a consolidated subsidiary or affiliate which are consolidated in accordance with paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section may not be prepaid, repaid, or accelerated if any of the entities included in such consolidation would otherwise be unable to comply with the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section. 


(iv) Each applicant or registrant included within the consolidation shall at all times be in compliance with the adjusted net capital requirement to which it is subject.


(4) No applicant or registrant shall guarantee, endorse, or assume directly or indirectly any obligation or liability of a subsidiary or affiliate unless the obligation or liability is reflected in the computation of adjusted net capital pursuant to this section except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.


(g)(1) The Commission may by order restrict, for a period of up to twenty business days, any withdrawal by a futures commission merchant of equity capital, or any unsecured advance or loan to a stockholder, partner, limited liability company member, sole proprietor, employee or affiliate if the Commission, based on the facts and information available, concludes that any such withdrawal, advance or loan may be detrimental to the financial integrity of the futures commission merchant, or may unduly jeopardize its ability to meet customer obligations or other liabilities that may cause a significant impact on the markets.


(2) The futures commission merchant may file with the Secretary of the Commission a written petition to request rescission of the order issued under paragraph (g)(1) of this section. The petition filed by the futures commission merchant must specify the facts and circumstances supporting its request for rescission. The Commission shall respond in writing to deny the futures commission merchant's petition for rescission, or, if the Commission determines that the order issued under paragraph (g)(1) of this section should not remain in effect, the order shall be rescinded.

The secured demand note agreement shall also require that following such transmittal:


(A) The lender, prior to noon of the business day next succeeding the transmittal of such notice, may pledge as collateral additional cash or securities sufficient, after giving effect to such pledge, to bring the sum of the amount of any cash plus the collateral value of any securities, then pledged as collateral to secure the secured demand note, up to an amount not less than the unpaid principal amount of the secured demand note; and


(B) Unless additional cash or securities are pledged by the lender as provided in paragraph (h)(2)(vi)(A) above, the applicant or registrant at noon on the business day next succeeding the transmittal of notice to the lender must commence sale, for the account of the lender, of such of the securities then pledged as collateral to secure the secured demand note and apply so much of the net proceeds thereof, together with such of the cash then pledged as collateral to secure the secured demand note as may be necessary to eliminate the unpaid principal amount of the secured demand note: *Provided, however,* That the unpaid principal amount of the secured demand note need not be reduced below the sum of the amount of any remaining cash, plus the collateral value of the remaining securities, then pledged as collateral to secure the secured demand note.

No special prepayment shall be made if, after giving effect thereto (and to all payments of payment obligations under any other subordination agreements then outstanding, the maturity or accelerated maturities of which are scheduled to fall due within six months after the date such special prepayment is to occur pursuant to this provision, or on or prior to the date on which the payment obligation in respect to such special prepayment is scheduled to mature disregarding this provision, whichever date is earlier) without reference to any projected profit or loss of the applicant or registrant, the adjusted net capital of the applicant or registrant is less than the greatest of:


(*1*) 200 percent of the appropriate minimum dollar amount required by paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) or (a)(1)(iii)(A) of this section;


(*2*) For a futures commission merchant or applicant therefor, 125 percent of the amount required by paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section;

(C)(*1*) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (h)(2)(vii)(A) and (h)(2)(vii)(B) of this section, in the case of an applicant, no prepayment or special prepayment shall occur without the prior written approval of the National Futures Association; in the case of a registrant, no prepayment or special prepayment shall occur without the prior written approval of the designated self-regulatory organization, if any, or of the Commission if the registrant is not a member of a self-regulatory organization. 


(*2*) A registrant may make a prepayment or special prepayment without the prior written approval of the designated self-regulatory organization: Provided, That the registrant: Is a securities broker or dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission; files a request to make a prepayment or special prepayment with its applicable securities designated examining authority, as defined in Rule 15c3-1(c)(12) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(12)), in the form and manner prescribed by the designated examining authority; files a copy of the prepayment request or special prepayment request with the designated self-regulatory organization at the time it files such request with the designated examining authority in the form and manner prescribed by the designated self-regulatory organization; and files a copy of the designated examining authority's approval of the prepayment or special prepayment with the designated self-regulatory organization immediately upon receipt of such approval. The approval of the prepayment or special prepayment by the designated examining authority will be deemed approval by the designated self-regulatory organization, unless the designated self-regulatory organization notifies the registrant that the designated examining authority's approval shall not constitute designated self-regulatory organization approval. 


(*3*) The designated self-regulatory organization shall immediately provide the Commission with a copy of any notice of approval issued where the requested prepayment or special prepayment will result in the reduction of the registrant's net capital by 20 percent or more or the registrant's excess adjusted net capital by 30 percent or more.


(viii) *Suspended repayment.* (A) The payment obligation of the applicant or registrant in respect of any subordination agreement shall be suspended and shall not mature if, after giving effect to payment of such payment obligation (and to all payments of payment obligations of the applicant or registrant under any other subordination agreement(s) then outstanding which are scheduled to mature on or before such payment obligation), the adjusted net capital of the applicant or registrant would be less than the greatest of:

(B) [Reserved]


(ix) *Accelerated maturity.* Obligation to repay to remain subordinate:


(A) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (h)(2)(viii) of this section, a subordination agreement may provide that the lender may, upon prior written notice to the applicant and the National Futures Association, or upon prior written notice to the registrant and the designated self-regulatory organization or, if the registrant is not a member of a designated self-regulatory organization, the Commission, given not earlier than six months after the effective date of such subordination agreement, accelerate the date on which the payment obligation of the borrower, together with accrued interest or compensation, is scheduled to mature to a date not earlier than six months after giving of such notice, but the right of the lender to receive payment, together with accrued interest or compensation, shall remain subordinate as required by the provisions of this paragraph (h)(2) of this section.


(B) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (h)(2)(viii) of this section, the payment obligation of the applicant or registrant with respect to a subordination agreement, together with accrued interest and compensation, shall mature in the event of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation pursuant to the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 or otherwise, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization whether or not pursuant to the bankruptcy laws, or any other marshalling of the assets and liabilities of the applicant or registrant, but the right of the lender to receive payment, together with accrued interest or compensation, shall remain subordinate as required by the provisions of paragraph (h)(2) of this section.


(x) *Accelerated maturity of subordination agreements on event of default and event of acceleration.* Obligation to repay to remain subordinate:


(A) A subordination agreement may provide that the lender may, upon prior written notice to the applicant and the National Futures Association, or upon prior written notice to the registrant and the designated self-regulatory organization or, if the registrant is not a member of a designated self-regulatory organization, the Commission, of the occurrence of any event of acceleration (as hereinafter defined) given no sooner than six months after the effective date of such subordination agreement, accelerate the date on which the payment obligation of the applicant or registrant, together with accrued interest or compensation, is scheduled to mature, to the last business day of a calendar month which is not less than six months after notice of acceleration is received by the applicant and by the National Futures Association, or by the registrant and the designated self-regulatory organization or, if the registrant is not a member of a designated self-regulatory organization, the Commission. Any subordination agreement containing such events of acceleration may also provide that, if upon such accelerated maturity date the payment obligation of the applicant or registrant is suspended as required by paragraph (h)(2)(viii) of this section and liquidation of the applicant or registrant has not commenced on or prior to such accelerated maturity date, notwithstanding paragraph (h)(2)(viii) of this section, the payment obligation of the applicant or registrant with respect to such subordination agreement shall mature on the day immediately following such accelerated maturity date and in any such event the payment obligations of the applicant or registrant with respect to all other subordination agreements then outstanding shall also mature at the same time but the rights of the respective lenders to receive payment, together with accrued interest or compensation, shall remain subordinate as required by the provisions of paragraph (h)(2) of this section. Events of acceleration which may be included in a subordination agreement complying with this paragraph (h)(2)(x) of this section shall be limited to:


(*1*) Failure to pay interest or any installment of principal on a subordination agreement as scheduled;


(*2*) Failure to pay when due other money obligations of a specified material amount;

Such agreement may also provide that, if liquidation of the business of the applicant or registrant has not already commenced, the rapid and orderly liquidation of the business of the applicant or registrant shall then commence upon the happening of an event of default. Any subordination agreement which so provides for maturity of the payment obligation upon the occurrence of an event of default shall also provide that the date on which such event of default occurs shall, if liquidation of the applicant or registrant has not already commenced, be the date on which the payment obligation of the applicant or registrant with respect to all other subordination agreements then outstanding shall mature but the rights of the respective lenders to receive payment, together with accrued interest or compensation, shall remain subordinate as required by the provisions of paragraph (h)(2) of this section.

(3) *Miscellaneous provisions—*(i) *Prohibited cancellation.* The subordination agreement shall not be subject to cancellation by either party; no payment shall be made with respect thereto and the agreement shall not be terminated, rescinded or modified by mutual consent or otherwise if the effect thereof would be inconsistent with the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.

(vi) *Filing.* An applicant shall file a signed copy of any proposed subordination agreement (including nonconforming subordination agreements) with the National Futures Association at least ten days prior to the proposed effective date of the agreement or at such other time as the National Futures Association for good cause shall accept such filing. A registrant that is not a member of any designated self-regulatory organization shall file two signed copies of any proposed subordination agreement (including nonconforming subordination agreements) with the regional office of the Commission nearest the principal place of business of the registrant at least ten days prior to the proposed effective date of the agreement or at such other time as the Commission for good cause shall accept such filing. A registrant that is a member of a designated self-regulatory organization shall file signed copies of any proposed subordination agreement (including nonconforming subordination agreements) with the designated self-regulatory organization in such quantities and at such time as the designated self-regulatory organization may require prior to the effective date. The applicant or registrant shall also file with said parties a statement setting forth the name and address of the lender, the business relationship of the lender to the applicant or registrant and whether the applicant or registrant carried funds or securities for the lender at or about the time the proposed agreement was so filed. A proposed agreement filed by an applicant with the National Futures Association shall be reviewed by the National Futures Association, and no such agreement shall be a satisfactory subordination agreement for the purposes of this section unless and until the National Futures Association has found the agreement acceptable and such agreement has become effective in the form found acceptable. A proposed agreement filed by a registrant shall be reviewed by the designated self-regulatory organization with whom such an agreement is required to be filed prior to its becoming effective or, if the registrant is not a member of any designated self-regulatory organization, by the regional office of the Commission where the agreement is required to be filed prior to its becoming effective. No proposed agreement shall be a satisfactory subordination agreement for the purposes of this section unless and until the designated self-regulatory organization or, if a registrant is not a member of any designated self-regulatory organization, the Commission, has found the agreement acceptable and such agreement has become effective in the form found acceptable: Provided, however, That a proposed agreement shall be a satisfactory subordination agreement for purpose of this section if the registrant: is a securities broker or dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission; files signed copies of the proposed subordination agreement with the applicable securities designated examining authority, as defined in Rule 15c3-1(c)(12) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(12)), in the form and manner prescribed by the designated examining authority; files signed copies of the proposed subordination agreement with the designated self-regulatory organization at the time it files such copies with the designated examining authority in the form and manner prescribed by the designated self-regulatory organization; and files a copy of the designated examining authority's approval of the proposed subordination agreement with the designated self-regulatory organization immediately upon receipt of such approval. The designated examining authority's determination that the proposed subordination agreement satisfies the requirements for a satisfactory subordination agreement will be deemed a like finding by the designated self-regulatory organization, unless the designated self-regulatory organization notifies the registrant that the designated examining authority's determination shall not constitute a like finding by the designated self-regulatory organization.


(vii) *Subordination agreements that incorporate adjusted net capital requirements in effect prior to September 30, 2004.* Any subordination agreement that incorporates the adjusted net capital requirements in paragraphs (h)(2)(vi)(C)(*2*), (h)(2)(vii)(A)(*2*) and (B)(*2*), (h)(2)(viii)(A)(*2*), (h)(3)(ii)(B), and (h)(3)(v)(B) of this section, as in effect prior to September 30, 2004, and which has been deemed to be satisfactorily subordinated pursuant to this section prior to September 30, 2004, shall continue to be deemed a satisfactory subordination agreement until the maturity of such agreement. In the event, however, that such agreement is amended or renewed for any reason, then such agreement shall not be deemed a satisfactory subordination agreement unless the amended or renewed agreement meets the requirements of this section.


(4) A designated self-regulatory organization and the Commission may allow debt with a maturity date of 1 year or more to be treated as meeting the provisions of this paragraph (h): *Provided,* (i) Such exemption shall only be given when the registrant's adjusted net capital is less than the minimum required by this section or by the capital rule of the designated self-regulatory organization to which such registrant is subject;


(ii) That such debt did not exist prior to its use under this paragraph (h)(4);


(iii) Such exemption shall be for a period of 30 days or such lesser period as the designated self-regulatory organization and the Commission may determine;


(iv) Such exemption shall not be allowed more than once in any 12 month period; and


(v) At all times during such exemption the registrant shall make a good faith effort to comply with the provisions of this section or the capital rule of the designated self-regulatory organization to which such registrant is subject exclusive of any benefits derived from this paragraph (h)(4).


(i) [Reserved]


(j) For the purposes of this section *cover* is defined as follows:


(1) *General definition.* Cover shall mean transactions or positions in a contract for future delivery on a board of trade or a commodity option where such transactions or positions normally represent a substitute for transactions to be made or positions to be taken at a later time in a physical marketing channel, and where they are economically appropriate to the reduction of risks in the conduct and management of a commercial enterprise, and where they arise from:


(i) The potential change in the value of assets which a person owns, produces, manufactures, processes, or merchandises or anticipates owning, producing, manufacturing, processing, or merchandising.


(ii) The potential change in the value of liabilities which a person owes or anticipates incurring, or


(iii) The potential change in the value of services which a person provides, purchases or anticipates providing or purchasing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no transactions or positions shall be classified as cover for the purposes of this section unless their purpose is to offset price risks incidental to commercial cash or spot operations and such positions are established and liquidated in accordance with sound commercial practices and unless the provisions of paragraphs (j) (2) and (3) of this section have been satisfied.


(2) *Enumerated cover transactions.* The definition of covered transactions and positions in paragraph (j)(1) of this section includes, but is not limited to, the following specific transactions and positions:


(i) Ownership or fixed-price purchase of any commodity which does not exceed in quantity (A) the sales of the same commodity for future delivery on a board of trade or (B) the purchase of a put commodity option of the same commodity for which the market value for the actual commodity or futures contract which is the subject of the option is less than the strike price of the option or (C) the ownership of a commodity option position established by the sale (grant) of a call commodity option of the same commodity for which the market value for the actual commodity or futures contract which is the subject of the option is more than the strike price of the option: *Provided,* That for purposes of paragraph (c)(5)(x) of this section the market value for the actual commodity or futures contract which is the subject of such option need not be more than the strike price of that option;


(ii) Fixed-price sale of any commodity which does not exceed in quantity (A) the purchase of the same commodity for future delivery on a board of trade or (B) the purchase of a call commodity option of the same commodity for which the market value for the actual commodity or futures contract which is the subject of such option is more than the strike price of the option or (C) ownership of a commodity option position established by the sale (grant) of a put commodity option of the same commodity for which the market value for the actual commodity or futures comtract which is the subject of the option is less than the strike price of the option: *Provided,* That for purposes of paragraph (c)(5)(x) of this section the market value for the actual commodity or futures contract which is the subject of such option need not be less than the strike price of that option; and


(iii) Ownership or fixed-price contracts of a commodity described in paragraphs (j)(2)(i) and (j)(2)(ii) of this section may also be covered other than by the same quantity of the same cash commodity, provided that the fluctuations in value of the position for future delivery or commodity option are substantially related to the fluctuations in value of the actual cash position.


(3) *Nonenumerated cases.* Upon specific request, the Commission may recognize transactions and positions other than those enumerated in paragraph (j)(2) of this section as cover in amounts and under the terms and conditions as it may specify. Any applicant or registrant who wishes to avail itself of the provisions of this paragraph (j)(3) must apply to the Commission in writing at its principal office in Washington, DC giving full details of the transaction including detailed information which will demonstrate that the transaction is economically appropriate to the reduction of risk exposure attendant to the conduct and management of a commercial enterprise.
