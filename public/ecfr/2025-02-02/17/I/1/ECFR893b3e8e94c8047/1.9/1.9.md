# § 1.9   Regulation of mixed swaps.

(a) *In general.* The term mixed swap has the meaning set forth in section 1a(47)(D) of the Commodity Exchange Act.


(b) *Regulation of bilateral uncleared mixed swaps entered into by dually-registered dealers or major participants.* A mixed swap that is neither executed on nor subject to the rules of a designated contract market, national securities exchange, swap execution facility, security-based swap execution facility, or foreign board of trade; that will not be submitted to a derivatives clearing organization or registered or exempt clearing agency to be cleared; and where at least one party is registered with the Commission as a swap dealer or major swap participant and also with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, shall be subject to:


(1) The following provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder:


(i) Examinations and information sharing: sections 4s(f) and 8 of the Commodity Exchange Act;


(ii) Enforcement: sections 2(a)(1)(B), 4(b), 4b, 4c, 4s(h)(1)(A), 4s(h)(4)(A), 6(c), 6(d), 6c, 6d, 9, 13(a), 13(b), and 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act;


(iii) Reporting to a swap data repository: section 4r of the Commodity Exchange Act;


(iv) Real-time reporting: section 2(a)(13) of the Commodity Exchange Act;


(v) Capital: section 4s(e) of the Commodity Exchange Act; and


(vi) Position Limits: section 4a of the Commodity Exchange Act; and


(2) The provisions of the Federal securities laws, as defined in section 3(a)(47) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(47)), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.


(c) *Process for determining regulatory treatment for other mixed swaps*—(1) *In general.* Any person who desires or intends to list, trade, or clear a mixed swap (or class thereof) that is not subject to paragraph (b) of this section may request the Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue a joint order permitting the requesting person (and any other person or persons that subsequently lists, trades, or clears that mixed swap) to comply, as to parallel provisions only, with specified parallel provisions of either the Commodity Exchange Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a *et seq.*), and the rules and regulations thereunder (collectively, *specified parallel provisions*), instead of being required to comply with parallel provisions of both the Commodity Exchange Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. For purposes of this paragraph (c), *parallel provisions* means comparable provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that were added or amended by the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010 with respect to swaps and security-based swaps, and the rules and regulations thereunder.


(2) *Request Process.* A person submitting a request pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section must provide the Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission with the following:


(i) All material information regarding the terms of the specified, or specified class of, mixed swap;


(ii) The economic characteristics and purpose of the specified, or specified class of, mixed swap;


(iii) The specified parallel provisions, and the reasons the person believes such specified parallel provisions would be appropriate for the mixed swap (or class thereof); and


(iv) An analysis of:


(A) The nature and purposes of the parallel provisions that are the subject of the request;


(B) The comparability of such parallel provisions;


(C) The extent of any conflicts or differences between such parallel provisions; and


(D) Such other information as may be requested by the Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission.


(3) *Request withdrawal.* A person may withdraw a request made pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section at any time prior to the issuance of a joint order under paragraph (c)(4) of this section by the Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission in response to the request.


(4) *Issuance of orders.* In response to a request under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as necessary to carry out the purposes of the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, may issue a joint order, after notice and opportunity for comment, permitting the requesting person (and any other person or persons that subsequently lists, trades, or clears that mixed swap) to comply, as to parallel provisions only, with the specified parallel provisions (or another subset of the parallel provisions that are the subject of the request, as the Commissions determine is appropriate), instead of being required to comply with parallel provisions of both the Commodity Exchange Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In determining the contents of such joint order, the Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission may consider, among other things:


(i) The nature and purposes of the parallel provisions that are the subject of the request;


(ii) The comparability of such parallel provisions; and


(iii) The extent of any conflicts or differences between such parallel provisions.


(5) *Timeframe.* (i) If the Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission determine to issue a joint order as described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, such joint order shall be issued within 120 days after receipt of a complete request for a joint order under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, which time period shall be stayed during the pendency of the public comment period provided for in paragraph (c)(4) of this section and shall recommence with the business day after the public comment period ends.


(ii) Nothing in this section shall require the Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue any joint order.


(iii) If the Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission do not issue a joint order within the time period described in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, each of the Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission shall publicly provide the reasons for not issuing such a joint order within that timeframe.
