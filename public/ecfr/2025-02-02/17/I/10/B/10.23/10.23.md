(b) *Content of answer.* The answer shall include:


(1) A statement that the respondent admits, denies, or does not have and is unable to obtain sufficient information to admit or deny each allegation; a statement of a lack of information shall have the effect of a denial; any allegation not expressly denied shall be deemed to be admitted;

(d) *Admission of all allegations of fact.* If a respondent's answer admits the truth of all the material allegations of fact contained in the complaint, it shall constitute a waiver of hearing on those allegations. However, the Administrative Law Judge may conduct a hearing, if so requested, by any of the parties. Following waiver, the parties may submit proposed findings and conclusions and briefs, as provided in § 10.82 and may appeal any initial decision to the Commission as provided in § 10.102 of these rules.
