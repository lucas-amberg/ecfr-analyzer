# ยง 10.69   Reopening hearings.

Any party may petition the Administrative Law Judge to reopen a hearing to adduce additional evidence at any time prior to issuance of the initial decision. The petition shall show that the evidence sought to be adduced is relevant and material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such evidence at the time of the original hearing.
