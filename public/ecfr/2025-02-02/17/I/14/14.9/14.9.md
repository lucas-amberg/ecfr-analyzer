# § 14.9   Duty to file information concerning adverse judicial or administrative action.

Any person appearing or practicing before the Commission who has been the subject of a conviction, suspension, disbarment, revocation, injunction or finding of the kind described in §§ 14.5 through 14.7, unless based on action instituted by the Commission, shall promptly file a copy of the relevant order, judgment or decree with the Secretariat of the Commission at the Commission's Washington, DC headquarters, together with any related opinion or statement of the agency or tribunal involved. Any person who has been the subject of administrative or judicial action of the kind described in §§ 14.5 through 14.7 and who has not filed a copy of the order, judgment or decree within thirty days after its entry shall for that reason alone be disqualified from appearing or practicing before the Commission until such time as the appropriate filing shall be made, but neither the filing of these documents nor the failure of a person to file them shall in any way affect the operations of any other provision of this part.
