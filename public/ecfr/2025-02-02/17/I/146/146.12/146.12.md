# § 146.12   Exemptions.

The Commission is exempting from certain provisions of the Privacy Act the systems of records set forth in this section. In addition, when these systems of records and any other of the Commission's systems of records maintain a record received from another system of records that is exempted from one or more provisions of the Privacy Act, the Commission will claim the same exemptions for that record that are claimed for the system of records from which it originated.


(a) *CFTC-1 Enforcement Matter Register and Matter Indices.* The system of records identified as CFTC-1 Enforcement Matter Register and Matter Indices contains an index and registry of enforcement investigations. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and subject to the requirements and limitations set forth therein, the Commission is exempting this system of records from the following provisions of the Privacy Act: 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d)(1) through (4); (e)(1); (e)(4)(G) through (I); and (f), and from the following corresponding sections of these rules: §§ 146.3; 146.5; 146.6(d); 146.11(a)(7) through (9); and 146.7(a). Exemptions from these particular sections of the Privacy Act and CFTC's rules promulgated thereunder are justified for the following reasons:


(1) From section (c)(3) (Accounting of Certain Disclosures), because release of the accounting of certain disclosures could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and the recipient entity. Release of such information to the subject of an investigation could reasonably be anticipated to impede and interfere with the Commission's efforts to identify and investigate unlawful activities.


(2) From sections (d)(1) through (4) (Access and Amendment), because individual access to these records could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and others. Providing a subject with access to these records could impair the effectiveness of the Commission's investigations and could significantly impede the investigation by providing the opportunity for the subject to destroy documentary evidence, improperly influence witnesses and confidential sources, fabricate testimony, and engage in other activities that could compromise the investigation. In addition, providing an individual with access to these records may reveal the identity of a source who furnished information under an express promise that their identity would remain confidential. Allowing the subject of the investigation to amend records in this system of records could likewise interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring law enforcement investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.


(3) From section (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information), because in the course of investigations into potential violations of law, the significance of certain information may not be clear or the information may not be strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation; but, effective law enforcement requires the retention of all information that may aid in establishing patterns of unlawful activity and providing investigative leads.


(4) From section (e)(4)(G) through (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because the Commission is not required to establish requirements, rules, or procedures related to access and amendment of records in a system of records that is exempt from the individual access and amendment provisions in section (d) of the Privacy Act.

Exemptions from these particular sections of the Privacy Act and CFTC's rules promulgated thereunder are justified for the following reasons:


(1) From section (c)(3) (Accounting of Certain Disclosures), because release of the accounting of certain disclosures could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and the recipient entity. Release of such information to the subject of an investigation could reasonably be anticipated to impede and interfere with the Commission's efforts to identify and investigate unlawful activities.


(2) From sections (d)(1) through (4) (Access and Amendment), because individual access to these records could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and others. Providing a subject with access to these records could impair the effectiveness of the Commission's investigations and could significantly impede the investigation by providing the opportunity for the subject to destroy documentary evidence, improperly influence witnesses and confidential sources, fabricate testimony, and engage in other activities that could compromise the investigation. In addition, providing an individual with access to these records may reveal the identity of a source who furnished information under an express promise that their identity would remain confidential. Allowing the subject of the investigation to amend records in this system of records could likewise interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring law enforcement investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.


(3) From section (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information), because in the course of investigations into potential violations of law, the significance of certain information may not be clear or the information may not be strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation; but, effective law enforcement requires the retention of all information that may aid in establishing patterns of unlawful activity and providing investigative leads.


(4) From sections (e)(4)(G) through (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because the Commission is not required to establish requirements, rules, or procedures related to access and amendment of records in a system of records that is exempt from the individual access and amendment provisions in section (d) of the Privacy Act.

(1) From section (c)(3) (Accounting of Certain Disclosures), because release of accountings of certain disclosures could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and the recipient entity. Release of such information to the subject of an investigation could reasonably be anticipated to impede and interfere with the Commission's efforts to identify and investigate unlawful activities.


(2) From sections (d)(1) through (4) (Access and Amendment), because individual access to these records could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and others. Providing a subject with access to these records could impair the effectiveness of the Commission's investigations and could significantly impede the investigation by providing the opportunity for the subject to destroy documentary evidence, improperly influence witnesses and confidential sources, fabricate testimony, and engage in other activities that could compromise the investigation.

(2) From sections (d)(1) through (4) (Access and Amendment), because individual access to these records could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and others.

Exemptions from these particular sections of the Privacy Act are justified for the following reasons:


(1) From section (c)(3) (Accounting of Certain Disclosures), because release of the accounting of certain disclosures could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and the recipient entity.

(2) From section (c)(4) (Notice of Correction), because this system is exempt from the access and amendment provisions of section (d), as noted below.


(3) From sections (d)(1) through (4) (Access and Amendment), because individual access to these records could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and others. Providing a subject with access to these records could impair the effectiveness of the Commission's investigations and could significantly impede the investigation by providing the opportunity for the subject to destroy documentary evidence, improperly influence witnesses and confidential sources, fabricate testimony, and engage in other activities that could compromise the investigation. In addition, providing an individual with access to these records may reveal the identity of a source who furnished information under an express promise that their identity would remain confidential. Allowing the subject of the investigation to amend records in this system of records could likewise interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring law enforcement investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.

(5) From section (e)(2) (Collect from Individual), because in a law enforcement investigation the requirement that information be collected to the greatest extent possible from the subject individual would present a serious impediment to law enforcement, in that the subject of the investigation would be informed of the existence of the investigation and would therefore be able to avoid detection, apprehension, or legal obligations or duties.


(6) From section (e)(3) (Privacy Act Statement), because to comply with the requirements of this section during the course of an investigation could impede the information gathering process and hamper the investigation.


(7) From sections (e)(4)(G) through (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because the Commission is not required to establish requirements, rules, or procedures related to access and amendment of records in a system of records that is exempt from the individual access and amendment provisions in section (d) of the Privacy Act.

Exemptions from these particular sections of the Privacy Act are justified for the following reasons:


(1) From sections (c)(3) (Accounting of Certain Disclosures), because release of the accounting of certain disclosures could alert the subject of an investigation to the extent of that investigation and reveal investigative interests of the Commission and the recipient entity that were previously unknown to the individual. Release of such information to the subject of an investigation could reasonably be anticipated to impede and interfere with the Commission's efforts to adequately assess an individual when making a decision about the individual's access to Commission facilities, information technology systems, and classified and confidential information.


(2) From sections (d)(1) through (4) (Access and Amendment), because the records contained in this system may be related to ongoing investigations, and individual access to these records could alert the subject of an investigation to the extent of that investigation and reveal investigative interests of the Commission and others that were previously unknown to the individual.

Amendment of the records in this system of records would interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring law enforcement investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.


(3) From section (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information), because in the course of conducting and adjudicating background investigations, the significance of certain information may not be clear or the information may not be strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation; but, effective investigations require the retention of all information that may aid in the investigation and provide investigative leads.

Release of such information to the subject of an investigation could reasonably be anticipated to impede and interfere with the Commission's efforts to identify and investigate unlawful activities.


(2) From sections (d)(1) through (4) (Access and Amendment), because individual access to these records could alert the subject of an investigation to the existence and extent of that investigation and reveal the investigative interests of the Commission and others.

Allowing the subject of the investigation to amend records in this system of records could likewise interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring law enforcement investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.


(3) From section (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information), because in the course of investigations, the significance of certain information may not be clear or the information may not be strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation; but, effective investigations require the retention of all information that may aid in the investigation or aid in establishing patterns of activity and provide investigative leads.
