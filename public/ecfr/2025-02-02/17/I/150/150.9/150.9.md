# § 150.9   Process for recognizing non-enumerated bona fide hedging transactions or positions with respect to Federal speculative position limits.

For purposes of Federal speculative position limits, a person with a position in a referenced contract seeking recognition of such position as a non-enumerated bona fide hedging transaction or position, in accordance with § 150.3(a)(1)(ii), shall apply to the Commission, pursuant to § 150.3(b), or apply to a designated contract market or swap execution facility in accordance with this section. If such person submits an application to a designated contract market or swap execution facility in accordance with this section, and the designated contract market or swap execution facility, with respect to its own speculative position limits established pursuant to § 150.5(a), recognizes the person's position as a non-enumerated bona fide hedging transaction or position, then the person may also exceed the applicable Federal speculative position limit for such position in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. The designated contract market or swap execution facility may approve such applications only if the designated contract market or swap execution facility complies with the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.


(a) *Approval of rules.* The designated contract market or swap execution facility must maintain rules that establish application processes and conditions for recognizing bona fide hedging transactions or positions consistent with the requirements of this section, and must seek approval of such rules from the Commission pursuant to § 40.5 of this chapter.


(b) *Prerequisites for a designated contract market or swap execution facility to recognize a bona fide hedging transaction or position in accordance with this section.* (1) The designated contract market or swap execution facility lists the applicable referenced contract for trading;


(2) The position meets the definition of bona fide hedging transaction or position in section 4a(c)(2) of the Act and the definition of bona fide hedging transaction or position in § 150.1; and


(3) The designated contract market or swap execution facility does not recognize as a bona fide hedging transaction or position any position involving a commodity index contract and one or more referenced contracts, including exemptions known as risk management exemptions.


(c) *Application process.* The designated contract market or swap execution facility's application process meets the following conditions:


(1) *Required application information.* The designated contract market or swap execution facility requires the applicant to provide, and can obtain from the applicant, all information needed to enable the designated contract market or swap execution facility and the Commission to determine whether the facts and circumstances demonstrate that the designated contract market or swap execution facility may recognize a position as a bona fide hedging transaction or position, including the following:


(i) A description of the position in the commodity derivative contract for which the application is submitted, including but not limited to, the name of the underlying commodity and the derivative position size;


(ii) An explanation of the hedging strategy, including a statement that the position complies with the requirements of section 4a(c)(2) of the Act and the definition of bona fide hedging transaction or position in § 150.1, and information to demonstrate why the position satisfies such requirements and definition;


(iii) A statement concerning the maximum size of all gross positions in commodity derivative contracts for which the application is submitted;


(iv) A description of the applicant's activity in the cash markets and the swaps markets for the commodity underlying the position for which the application is submitted, including, but not limited to, information regarding the offsetting cash positions; and


(v) Any other information the designated contract market or swap execution facility requires, in its discretion, to determine that the position complies with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, as applicable.


(2) *Timing of application.* (i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the designated contract market or swap execution facility requires the applicant to submit an application and receive a notice of approval of such application from the designated contract market or swap execution facility prior to the date that the position for which such application was submitted would be in excess of the applicable Federal speculative position limits.


(ii) A designated contract market or swap execution facility may adopt rules that allow a person, due to demonstrated sudden or unforeseen increases in its bona fide hedging needs, to file an application with the designated contract market or swap execution facility to request a recognition of a bona fide hedging transaction or position within five business days after the person established the position that exceeded the applicable Federal speculative position limit.


(A) The designated contract market or swap execution facility must require that any application filed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section include an explanation of the circumstances warranting the sudden or unforeseen increases in bona fide hedging needs.


(B) If an application filed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section is denied by the designated contract market, swap execution facility, or Commission, the applicant must bring its position within the applicable Federal speculative position limits within a commercially reasonable time as determined by the Commission in consultation with the applicant and the applicable designated contract market or swap execution facility.


(C) The Commission will not pursue an enforcement action for a position limits violation for the person holding the position during the period of the designated contract market, swap execution facility, or Commission's review nor once a determination has been issued, so long as the application was submitted in good faith and the person complies with paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.


(3) *Renewal of applications.* The designated contract market or swap execution facility requires each applicant to reapply with the designated contract market or swap execution facility to maintain such recognition at least on an annual basis by updating the initial application, and to receive a notice of extension of the original approval from the designated contract market or swap execution facility to continue relying on such recognition for purposes of Federal speculative position limits. If the facts and circumstances underlying a renewal application are materially different than the initial application, the designated contract market or swap execution facility is required to treat such application as a new request submitted through the § 150.9 process and subject to the Commission's 10/2-day review process in paragraph (e) of this section.


(4) *Exchange revocation authority.* The designated contract market or swap execution facility retains its authority to limit, condition, or revoke, at any time after providing notice to the applicant, any bona fide hedging transaction or position recognition for purposes of the designated contract market or swap execution facility's speculative position limits established under § 150.5(a), for any reason as determined in the discretion of the designated contract market or swap execution facility, including if the designated contract market or swap execution facility determines that the position no longer meets the conditions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, as applicable.


(d) *Recordkeeping.* (1) The designated contract market or swap execution facility keeps full, complete, and systematic records, which include all pertinent data and memoranda, of all activities relating to the processing of such applications and the disposition thereof. Such records include:


(i) Records of the designated contract market's or swap execution facility's recognition of any derivative position as a bona fide hedging transaction or position, revocation or modification of any such recognition, or the rejection of an application;


(ii) All information and documents submitted by an applicant in connection with its application, including documentation and information that is submitted after the disposition of the application, and any withdrawal, supplementation, or update of any application;


(iii) Records of oral and written communications between the designated contract market or swap execution facility and the applicant in connection with such application; and


(iv) All information and documents in connection with the designated contract market or swap execution facility's analysis of, and action(s) taken with respect to, such application.


(2) All books and records required to be kept pursuant to this section shall be kept in accordance with the requirements of § 1.31 of this chapter.


(e) *Process for a person to exceed Federal speculative position limits on a referenced contract*—(1) *Notification to the Commission.* The designated contract market or swap execution facility must submit to the Commission a notification of each initial determination to recognize a bona fide hedging transaction or position in accordance with this section, concurrently with the notice of such determination the designated contract market or swap execution facility provides to the applicant.


(2) *Notification requirements.* The notification in paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall include, at a minimum, the following information:


(i) Name of the applicant;


(ii) Brief description of the bona fide hedging transaction or position being recognized;


(iii) Name of the contract(s) relevant to the recognition;


(iv) The maximum size of the position that may exceed Federal speculative position limits;


(v) The effective date and expiration date of the recognition;


(vi) An indication regarding whether the position may be maintained during the last five days of trading during the spot month, or the time period for the spot month; and


(vii) A copy of the application and any supporting materials.


(3) *Exceeding Federal speculative position limits on referenced contracts.* A person may exceed Federal speculative position limits on a referenced contract after the designated contract market or swap execution facility issues the notification required pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, unless the Commission notifies the designated contract market or swap execution facility and the applicant otherwise, pursuant to paragraph (e)(5) or (6) of this section, before the ten business day period expires.


(4) *Exceeding Federal speculative position limits on referenced contracts due to sudden or unforeseen circumstances.* If a person files an application for a recognition of a bona fide hedging transaction or position in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, then such person may rely on the designated contract market or swap execution facility's determination to grant such recognition for purposes of Federal speculative position limits two business days after the designated contract market or swap execution facility issues the notification required pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, unless the Commission notifies the designated contract market or swap execution facility and the applicant otherwise, pursuant to paragraph (e)(5) or (6) of this section, before the two business day period expires.


(5) *Commission stay of pending applications and requests for additional information.* The Commission may stay an application that requires additional time to analyze, and/or may request additional information to determine whether the position for which the application is submitted meets the conditions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The Commission shall notify the applicable designated contract market or swap execution facility and the applicant of a Commission determination to stay the application and/or request any supplemental information, and shall provide an opportunity for the applicant to respond. The Commission will have an additional 45 days from the date of the stay notification to conduct the review and issue a determination with respect to the application. If the Commission stays an application and the applicant has not yet exceeded Federal speculative position limits, then the applicant may not exceed Federal speculative position limits unless the Commission approves the application. If the Commission stays an application and the applicant has already exceeded Federal speculative position limits, then the applicant may continue to maintain the position unless the Commission notifies the designated contract market or swap execution facility and the applicant otherwise, pursuant to paragraph (e)(6) of this section.


(6) *Commission determination for pending applications.* If, during the Commission's ten or two business day review period in paragraphs (e)(3) and (4) of this section, the Commission determines that a position for which the application is submitted does not meet the conditions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the Commission shall:


(i) Notify the designated contract market or swap execution facility and the applicant within ten or two business days, as applicable, after the designated contract market or swap execution facility issues the notification required pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section;


(ii) Provide an opportunity for the applicant to respond to such notification;


(iii) Issue a determination to deny the application, or limit or condition the application approval for purposes of Federal speculative position limits and, as applicable, require the person to reduce the derivatives position within a commercially reasonable time, as determined by the Commission in consultation with the applicant and the applicable designated contract market or swap execution facility, or otherwise come into compliance; and


(iv) The Commission will not pursue an enforcement action for a position limits violation for the person holding the position during the period of the Commission's review nor once the Commission has issued its determination, so long as the application was submitted in good faith and the person complies with any requirement to reduce the position pursuant to paragraph (e)(6)(iii) of this section, as applicable.


(f) *Commission revocation of applications previously approved.* (1) If a designated contract market or a swap execution facility limits, conditions, or revokes any recognition of a bona fide hedging transaction or position for purposes of the respective designated contract market's or swap execution facility's speculative position limits established under § 150.5(a), then such recognition will also be deemed limited, conditioned, or revoked for purposes of Federal speculative position limits.


(2) If the Commission determines, at any time, that a position that has been recognized as a bona fide hedging transaction or position for purposes of Federal speculative position limits is no longer consistent with section 4a(c)(2) of the Act or the definition of bona fide hedging transaction or position in § 150.1, the following applies:


(i) The Commission shall notify the person holding the position and the relevant designated contract market or swap execution facility. After providing such person and such designated contract market or swap execution facility an opportunity to respond, the Commission may, in its discretion, limit, condition, or revoke its determination for purposes of Federal speculative position limits and require the person to reduce the derivatives position within a commercially reasonable time as determined by the Commission in consultation with such person and such designated contract market or swap execution facility, or otherwise come into compliance;


(ii) The Commission shall include in its notification a brief explanation of the nature of the issues raised and the specific provisions of the Act or the Commission's regulations with which the position or application is, or appears to be, inconsistent; and


(iii) The Commission will not pursue an enforcement action for a position limits violation for the person holding the position during the period of the Commission's review, nor once the Commission has issued its determination, provided the person submitted the application in good faith and reduces the position within a commercially reasonable time, as determined by the Commission in consultation with such person and the relevant designated contract market or swap execution facility, or otherwise comes into compliance.


(g) *Delegation of authority to the Director of the Division of Market Oversight*—(1) *Commission delegations.* The Commission hereby delegates, until it orders otherwise, to the Director of the Division of Market Oversight, or such other employee or employees as the Director may designate from time to time, the authority to request additional information, pursuant to paragraph (e)(5) of this section, from the applicable designated contract market or swap execution facility and applicant.


(2) *Commission consideration of delegated matter.* The Director of the Division of Market Oversight may submit to the Commission for its consideration any matter which has been delegated in this section.
