# Appendix C to Part 150—Guidance Regarding the Definition of Referenced Contract 


This appendix C provides guidance regarding the “referenced contract” definition in § 150.1, which provides in paragraph (3) of the definition of referenced contract that the term referenced contract does not include a location basis contract, a commodity index contract, a swap guarantee, a trade option that meets the requirements of § 32.3 of this chapter, a monthly average pricing contract, or an outright price reporting agency index contract. The term “referenced contract” is used throughout part 150 of the Commission's regulations to refer to contracts that are subject to Federal position limits. A position in a contract that is not a referenced contract is not subject to Federal position limits, and, as a consequence, cannot be netted with positions in referenced contracts for purposes of Federal position limits. This guidance is intended to clarify the types of contracts that would qualify as a location basis contract, commodity index contract, monthly average pricing contract, or outright price reporting agency index contract.


Compliance with this guidance does not diminish or replace, in any event, the obligations and requirements of any person to comply with the regulations provided under this part, or any other part of the Commission's regulations. The guidance is for illustrative purposes only and does not state the exclusive means for a contract to qualify, or not qualify, as a referenced contract as defined in § 150.1, or to comply with any other provision in this part.


(a) *Guidance.* (1) As provided in paragraph (3) of the “referenced contract” definition in § 150.1, the following types of contracts are not deemed referenced contracts, meaning such contracts are not subject to Federal position limits and cannot be netted with positions in referenced contracts for purposes of Federal position limits: location basis contracts; commodity index contracts; swap guarantees; trade options that meet the requirements of § 32.3 of this chapter; monthly average pricing contracts; and outright price reporting agency index contracts.


(2) *Location basis contract.* For purposes of the referenced contract definition in § 150.1, a location basis contract means a commodity derivative contract that is cash-settled based on the difference in:


(i) The price, directly or indirectly, of:


(A) A particular core referenced futures contract; or


(B) A commodity deliverable on a particular core referenced futures contract, whether at par, a fixed discount to par, or a premium to par; and


(ii) The price, at a different delivery location or pricing point than that of the same particular core referenced futures contract, directly or indirectly, of:


(A) A commodity deliverable on the same particular core referenced futures contract, whether at par, a fixed discount to par, or a premium to par; or


(B) A commodity that is listed in appendix D to this part as substantially the same as a commodity underlying the same core referenced futures contract.


(3) *Commodity index contract.* For purposes of the referenced contract definition in § 150.1, a commodity index contract means an agreement, contract, or transaction that is based on an index comprised of prices of commodities that are not the same or substantially the same, and that is not a location basis contract, a calendar spread contract, or an intercommodity spread contract as such terms are defined in this guidance, where:


(i) A calendar spread contract means a cash-settled agreement, contract, or transaction that represents the difference between the settlement price in one or a series of contract months of an agreement, contract, or transaction and the settlement price of another contract month or another series of contract months' settlement prices for the same agreement, contract, or transaction; and


(ii) An intercommodity spread contract means a cash-settled agreement, contract, or transaction that represents the difference between the settlement price of a referenced contract and the settlement price of another contract, agreement, or transaction that is based on a different commodity.


(4) *Monthly average pricing contract* means a contract that satisfies one of the following:


(i) The contract's price is calculated based on the equally-weighted arithmetic average of the daily prices of the underlying referenced contract for the entire corresponding calendar month or trade month, as applicable; or


(ii) In determining the price of such contract, the component daily prices, in the aggregate, during the spot month of the underlying referenced contract comprise no more than 40 percent of such contract's weighting.


(5) *Outright price reporting agency index contract* means any outright commodity derivative contract whose settlement price is based solely on an index published by a price reporting agency that surveys cash-market transaction prices, *provided, however,* that this term does not include any commodity derivative contract that settles at a basis, or differential, between a referenced contract and a price reporting agency index.
