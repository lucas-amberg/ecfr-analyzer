(i) A Form 8-R, properly completed in accordance with the instructions thereto; and 


(ii) The sponsor's certification required by ยง 3.12(c): *Provided, however,* that the fingerprints of the applicant on a fingerprint card provided by the National Futures Association for that purpose must be filed with the National Futures Association within 20 days following the date the temporary license is issued; *and, provided further,* that failure to file the fingerprints within this period will result in the termination of the temporary license immediately upon notice to the applicant's sponsor that the National Futures Association has not received the applicant's fingerprints. 


(2) The National Futures Association may grant a temporary license to any applicant for registration as a floor broker or individual floor trader upon the contemporaneous filing with the National Futures Association of: 


(i) A Form 8-R, properly completed in accordance with the instructions thereto; 


(ii) The fingerprints of the applicant on a fingerprint card provided by the National Futures Association for that purpose; 


(iii) A Supplemental Sponsor Certification Statement executed by a sponsor meeting the requirements under ยง 3.60(b)(2)(i), if the applicant is subject to an order imposing conditions on the applicant's registration; and 


(iv) Evidence that the applicant has been granted trading privileges by a contract market or swap execution facility that has filed with the National Futures Association a certification signed by its chief operating officer with respect to the review of an applicant's employment, credit and other history in connection with the granting of trading privileges. 


(b) The failure of an applicant or the applicant's sponsor to respond to a request by the Commission or the National Futures Association for clarification of any information set forth in the application of the applicant or for the resubmission of fingerprints in accordance with such request will be deemed to constitute a withdrawal of the applicant's registration application and shall result in the immediate termination of the applicant's temporary license. 


(c) Subject to the provisions of ยง 3.42 and all of the obligations imposed on such registrants under the Act (in particular, section 14 thereof) and the rules, regulations, and orders thereunder, an applicant for registration as an associated person who has received notification that a temporary license has been granted may act in the capacity of an associated person, an applicant for registration as a floor trader who has received written notification that a temporary license has been granted may act in the capacity of a floor trader, and an applicant for registration as a floor broker who has received written notification that a temporary license has been granted may act in the capacity of a floor broker.
