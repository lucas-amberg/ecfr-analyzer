# ยง 33.6   Suspension or revocation of designation as a contract market for the trading of commodity options.

The Commission may, after notice and opportunity for a hearing on the record, suspend or revoke the designation of any board of trade as a contract market in a commodity option for which it is designated if the Commission determines that:


(a) The board of trade, or any director, officer, agent, or employee thereof, is violating or has violated any of the provisions of this part.


(b) Cause exists which, under ยง 33.2 or ยง 33.4, would warrant the denial of a designation;


(c) The option market is not used on more than an occasional basis for other than speculative purposes by producers, processors, merchants or commercial users engaged in handling or utilizing the commodity (including the products, by-products or source commodity thereof) underlying an option, in interstate commerce; or


(d) Option trading on the contract market in that contract is contrary to the protection of option customers or the underlying futures or cash markets, or is otherwise contrary to the public interest: *Provided,* That pending completion of any proceeding under this section, the Commission may suspend such designation for the duration of the proceedings, if in the Commission's judgment, the continuation of such trading presents a substantial risk to the public interest.
