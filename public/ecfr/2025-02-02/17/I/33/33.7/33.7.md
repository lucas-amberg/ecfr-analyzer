(i) Furnishes the option customer with a separate written disclosure statement as set forth in this section or another statement approved under § 1.55(c) of this chapter and set forth in appendix A to § 1.55 which the Commission finds satisfies this requirement, or includes either such statement in a booklet containing the customer account agreement and other disclosure statements required by Commission rules; *provided, however,* that if the statement contained in § 33.7 is used it must follow the statement required by § 1.55; and


(ii) Subject to the provisions of § 1.55(d) of this chapter, receives from the option customer an acknowledgment signed and dated by the option customer that he received and understood the disclosure statement.
