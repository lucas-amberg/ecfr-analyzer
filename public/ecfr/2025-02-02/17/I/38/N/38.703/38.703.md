# ยง 38.703   Notice of charges.

If compliance staff authorized by a designated contract market or a designated contract market disciplinary panel determines that a reasonable basis exists for finding a violation and that adjudication is warranted, it must direct that the person or entity alleged to have committed the violation be served with a notice of charges and must proceed in accordance with the rules of this section. A notice of charges must adequately state the acts, conduct, or practices in which the respondent is alleged to have engaged; state the rule, or rules, alleged to have been violated (or about to be violated); and prescribe the period within which a hearing on the charges may be requested. The notice must also advise that the charged respondent is entitled, upon request, to a hearing on the charges.
