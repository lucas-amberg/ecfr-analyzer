# § 41.25   Additional conditions for trading for security futures products.

(a) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section:


*Estimated deliverable supply* means the quantity of the security underlying a security futures product that reasonably can be expected to be readily available to short traders and salable by long traders at its market value in normal cash marketing channels during the specified delivery period. For guidance on estimating deliverable supply, designated contract markets may refer to appendix A of this subpart.


*Same side of the market* means the aggregate of long positions in physically-delivered security futures products and cash-settled security futures products, in the same security, and, separately, the aggregate of short positions in physically-delivered security futures products and cash-settled security futures products, in the same security.


(b) *Common provisions*—(1) *Reporting of data.* The designated contract market shall comply with part 16 of this chapter requiring the daily reporting of market data.


(2) *Regulatory trading halts.* The rules of a designated contract market that lists or trades one or more security futures products must include the following provisions: 


(i) Trading of a security futures product based on a single security shall be halted at all times that a regulatory halt has been instituted for the underlying security; and 


(ii) Trading of a security futures product based on a narrow-based security index shall be halted at all times that a regulatory halt has been instituted for one or more underlying securities that constitute 50 percent or more of the market capitalization of the narrow-based security index. 


(3) *Speculative position limits.* A designated contract market shall have rules in place establishing position limits or position accountability procedures for the expiring futures contract month as specified in this paragraph (b)(3).


(i) *Limits for equity security futures products.* For a security futures product on a single equity security, including a security futures product on an underlying security that represents ownership in a group of securities, e.g., an exchange traded fund, a designated contract market shall adopt a position limit no greater than 25,000 100-share contracts (or the equivalent if the contract size is different than 100 shares), either net or on the same side of the market, applicable to positions held during the last three trading days of an expiring contract month; except where:


(A) For a security futures product on a single equity security where the estimated deliverable supply of the underlying security exceeds 20 million shares, a designated contract market may adopt, if appropriate in light of the liquidity of trading in the underlying security, a position limit no greater than the equivalent of 12.5 percent of the estimated deliverable supply of the underlying security, either net or on the same side of the market, applicable to positions held during the last three trading days of an expiring contract month; or


(B) For a security futures product on a single equity security where the six-month total trading volume in the underlying security exceeds 2.5 billion shares and there are more than 40 million shares of estimated deliverable supply, a designated contract market may adopt a position accountability rule in lieu of a position limit, either net or on the same side of the market, applicable to positions held during the last three trading days of an expiring contract month. Upon request by a designated contract market, traders who hold positions greater than 25,000 100-share contracts (or the equivalent if the contract size is different than 100 shares), or such lower level specified pursuant to the rules of the designated contract market, must provide information to the designated contract market and consent to halt increasing their positions when so ordered by the designated contract market.


(ii) *Limits for physically-delivered basket equity security futures products.* For a physically-delivered security futures product on more than one equity security, e.g., a basket of deliverable securities, a designated contract market shall adopt a position limit, either net or on the same side of the market, applicable to positions held during the last three trading days of an expiring contract month and the criteria in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section must apply to the underlying security with the lowest estimated deliverable supply. For a physically-delivered security futures product on more than one equity security with a contract size different than 100 shares per underlying security, an appropriate adjustment to the limit must be made. If each of the underlying equity securities in the basket of deliverable securities is eligible for a position accountability level under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section, then the security futures product is eligible for a position accountability level in lieu of position limits.


(iii) *Limits for cash-settled equity index security futures products.* For a security futures product cash settled to a narrow-based security index of equity securities, a designated contract market shall adopt a position limit, either net or on the same side of the market, applicable to positions held during the last three trading days of an expiring contract month. For guidance on setting limits for a cash-settled equity index security futures product, designated contract markets may refer to paragraph (b) of appendix A to this subpart.


(iv) *Limits for debt security futures products.* For a security futures product on one or more debt securities, a designated contract market shall adopt a position limit, either net or on the same side of the market, applicable to positions held during the last three trading days of an expiring contract month. For guidance on setting limits for a debt security futures product, designated contract markets may refer to paragraph (c) of appendix A to this subpart.


(v) *Required minimum position limit time period.* For position limits required under this section where the security futures product permits delivery before the termination of trading, a designated contract market shall apply such position limits for a period beginning no later than the first day that long position holders may be assigned delivery notices, if such period is longer than the last three trading days of an expiring contract month.


(vi) *Requirements for resetting levels of position limits.* A designated contract market shall calculate estimated deliverable supply and six-month total trading volume no less frequently than semi-annually.


(A) If the estimated deliverable supply data supports a lower speculative limit for a security futures product, then the designated contract market shall lower the position limit for that security futures product pursuant to the submission requirements of § 41.24. If the data require imposition of a reduced position limit for a security futures product, the designated contract market may permit any trader holding a position in compliance with the previous position limit, but in excess of the reduced limit, to maintain such position through the expiration of the security futures contract; provided, that the designated contract market does not find that the position poses a threat to the orderly expiration of such contract.


(B) If the estimated deliverable supply or six-month total trading volume data no longer supports a position accountability rule in lieu of a position limit for a security futures product, then the designated contract market shall establish a position limit for that security futures product pursuant to the submission requirements of § 41.24.


(C) If the estimated deliverable supply data supports a higher speculative limit for a security futures product, as provided under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section, then the designated contract market may raise the position limit for that security futures product pursuant to the submission requirements of § 41.24.


(vii) *Restriction on netting of positions.* If the designated contract market lists both physically-delivered contracts and cash-settled contracts in the same security, it shall not permit netting of positions in the physically-delivered contract with that of the cash-settled contract for purposes of determining applicability of position limits.


(c) *Final settlement prices for security futures products.* (1) The final settlement price of a cash-settled security futures product must fairly reflect the opening price of the underlying security or securities; 


(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if an opening price for one or more securities underlying a security futures product is not readily available, the final settlement price of the security futures product shall fairly reflect:


(i) The price of the underlying security or securities during the most recent regular trading session for such security or securities; or


(ii) The next available opening price of the underlying security or securities.


(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section, if a derivatives clearing organization registered under section 5b of the Act or a clearing agency exempt from registration pursuant to section 5b(a)(2) of the Act, to which the final settlement price of a security futures product is or would be reported determines, pursuant to its rules, that such final settlement price is not consistent with the protection of customers and the public interest, taking into account such factors as fairness to buyers and sellers of the affected security futures product, the maintenance of a fair and orderly market in such security futures product, and consistency of interpretation and practice, the clearing organization shall have the authority to determine, under its rules, a final settlement price for such security futures product.


(d) *Special requirements for physical delivery contracts.* For security futures products settled by actual delivery of the underlying security or securities, payment and delivery of the underlying security or securities must be effected through a clearing agency that is registered pursuant to section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


(e) *Exemptions.* The Commission may exempt a designated contract market from the provisions of paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of this section, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, if the Commission determines that such exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of customers. An exemption granted pursuant to this paragraph (e) shall not operate as an exemption from any Securities and Exchange Commission rule. Any exemption that may be required from such rules must be obtained separately from the Securities and Exchange Commission.
