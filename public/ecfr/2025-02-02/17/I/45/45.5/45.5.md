# ยง 45.5   Unique transaction identifiers.

Each swap shall be identified in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting pursuant to this part by the use of a unique transaction identifier, which shall be created, transmitted, and used for each swap as provided in paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section.


(a) *Swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market.* For each swap executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market, the swap execution facility or designated contract market shall create and transmit a unique transaction identifier as provided in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.


(1) *Creation.* The swap execution facility or designated contract market shall generate and assign a unique transaction identifier at, or as soon as technologically practicable following, the time of execution of the swap, and prior to the reporting of required swap creation data. The unique transaction identifier shall consist of a single data element with a maximum length of 52 characters that contains two components:


(i) The legal entity identifier of the swap execution facility or designated contract market; and


(ii) An alphanumeric code generated and assigned to that swap by the automated systems of the swap execution facility or designated contract market, which shall be unique with respect to all such codes generated and assigned by that swap execution facility or designated contract market.


(2) *Transmission.* The swap execution facility or designated contract market shall transmit the unique transaction identifier electronically as follows:


(i) To the swap data repository to which the swap execution facility or designated contract market reports required swap creation data for the swap, as part of that report;


(ii) To each counterparty to the swap, as soon as technologically practicable after execution of the swap;


(iii) To the derivatives clearing organization, if any, to which the swap is submitted for clearing, as part of the required swap creation data transmitted to the derivatives clearing organization for clearing purposes.


(b) *Off-facility swaps with a financial entity reporting counterparty.* For each off-facility swap where the reporting counterparty is a financial entity, the reporting counterparty shall create and transmit a unique transaction identifier as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.


(1) *Creation.* The reporting counterparty shall generate and assign a unique transaction identifier as soon as technologically practicable after execution of the swap and prior to both the reporting of required swap creation data and the transmission of swap data to a derivatives clearing organization if the swap is to be cleared. The unique transaction identifier shall consist of a single data element with a maximum length of 52 characters that contains two components:


(i) The legal entity identifier of the reporting counterparty; and


(ii) An alphanumeric code generated and assigned to that swap by the automated systems of the reporting counterparty, which shall be unique with respect to all such codes generated and assigned by that reporting counterparty.


(2) *Transmission.* The reporting counterparty shall transmit the unique transaction identifier electronically as follows:


(i) To the swap data repository to which the reporting counterparty reports required swap creation data for the swap, as part of that report;


(ii) To the non-reporting counterparty to the swap, no later than the applicable deadline in ยง 45.3(b) for reporting required swap creation data; and


(iii) To the derivatives clearing organization, if any, to which the swap is submitted for clearing, as part of the required swap creation data transmitted to the derivatives clearing organization for clearing purposes.


(c) *Off-facility swaps with a non-SD/MSP/DCO reporting counterparty that is not a financial entity.* For each off-facility swap for which the reporting counterparty is a non-SD/MSP/DCO counterparty that is not a financial entity, the reporting counterparty shall either: Create and transmit a unique transaction identifier as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section; or request that the swap data repository to which required swap creation data will be reported create and transmit a unique transaction identifier as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.


(1) *Creation.* The swap data repository shall generate and assign a unique transaction identifier as soon as technologically practicable following receipt of the request from the reporting counterparty. The unique transaction identifier shall consist of a single data element with a maximum length of 52 characters that contains two components:


(i) The legal entity identifier of the swap data repository; and


(ii) An alphanumeric code generated and assigned to that swap by the automated systems of the swap data repository, which shall be unique with respect to all such codes generated and assigned by that swap data repository.


(2) *Transmission.* The swap data repository shall transmit the unique transaction identifier electronically as follows:


(i) To the counterparties to the swap, as soon as technologically practicable following creation of the unique transaction identifier; and


(ii) To the derivatives clearing organization, if any, to which the swap is submitted for clearing, as soon as technologically practicable following creation of the unique transaction identifier.


(d) *Off-facility swaps with a derivatives clearing organization reporting counterparty.* For each off-facility swap where the reporting counterparty is a derivatives clearing organization, the reporting counterparty shall create and transmit a unique transaction identifier as provided in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.


(1) *Creation.* The derivatives clearing organization shall generate and assign a unique transaction identifier upon, or as soon as technologically practicable after, acceptance of an original swap by the derivatives clearing organization for clearing or execution of a clearing swap that does not replace an original swap, and prior to the reporting of required swap creation data for the clearing swap. The unique transaction identifier shall consist of a single data element with a maximum length of 52 characters that contains two components:


(i) The legal entity identifier of the derivatives clearing organization; and


(ii) An alphanumeric code generated and assigned to that clearing swap by the automated systems of the derivatives clearing organization, which shall be unique with respect to all such codes generated and assigned by that derivatives clearing organization.


(2) *Transmission.* The derivatives clearing organization shall transmit the unique transaction identifier electronically as follows:


(i) To the swap data repository to which the derivatives clearing organization reports required swap creation data for the clearing swap, as part of that report; and


(ii) To its counterparty to the clearing swap, as soon as technologically practicable after acceptance of a swap by the derivatives clearing organization for clearing or execution of a clearing swap that does not replace an original swap.


(e) *Allocations.* For swaps involving allocation, unique transaction identifiers shall be created and transmitted as follows.


(1) *Initial swap between reporting counterparty and agent.* The unique transaction identifier for the initial swap transaction between the reporting counterparty and the agent shall be created as required by paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, as applicable, and shall be transmitted as follows:


(i) If the unique transaction identifier is created by a swap execution facility or designated contract market, the swap execution facility or designated contract market must include the unique transaction identifier in its swap creation data report to the swap data repository, and must transmit the unique identifier to the reporting counterparty and to the agent.


(ii) If the unique transaction identifier is created by the reporting counterparty, the reporting counterparty must include the unique transaction identifier in its swap creation data report to the swap data repository, and must transmit the unique identifier to the agent.


(2) *Post-allocation swaps.* The reporting counterparty must create a unique transaction identifier for each of the individual swaps resulting from allocation, as soon as technologically practicable after it is informed by the agent of the identities of its actual counterparties, and must transmit each such unique transaction identifier to:


(i) The non-reporting counterparty for the swap in question.


(ii) The agent; and


(iii) The derivatives clearing organization, if any, to which the swap is submitted for clearing, as part of the required swap creation data transmitted to the derivatives clearing organization for clearing purposes.


(f) *Use.* Each registered entity and swap counterparty shall include the unique transaction identifier for a swap in all of its records and all of its swap data reporting concerning that swap, from the time it creates or receives the unique transaction identifier as provided in this section, throughout the existence of the swap and for as long as any records are required by the Act or Commission regulations to be kept concerning the swap, regardless of any life cycle events concerning the swap, including, without limitation, any changes with respect to the counterparties to the swap.


(g) *Third-party service provider.* If a registered entity or reporting counterparty required by this part to report required swap creation data or required swap continuation data contracts with a third-party service provider to facilitate reporting pursuant to ยง 45.9, the registered entity or reporting counterparty shall ensure that such third-party service provider creates and transmits the unique transaction identifier as otherwise required for such category of swap by paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. The unique transaction identifier shall consist of a single data element with a maximum length of 52 characters that contains two components:


(1) The legal entity identifier of the third-party service provider; and


(2) An alphanumeric code generated and assigned to that swap by the automated systems of the third-party service provider, which shall be unique with respect to all such codes generated and assigned by that third-party service provider.


(h) *Cross-jurisdictional swaps.* Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section, if a swap is also reportable to one or more other jurisdictions with a regulatory reporting deadline earlier than the deadline set forth in ยง 45.3 or in part 43 of this chapter, the same unique transaction identifier generated according to the rules of the jurisdiction with the earliest regulatory reporting deadline shall be transmitted pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section and used in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting pursuant to this part.
