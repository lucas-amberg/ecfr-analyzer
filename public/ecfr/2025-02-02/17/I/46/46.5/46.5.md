# ยง 46.5   Determination of which counterparty must report.

(a) Determination of which counterparty must report data concerning each pre-enactment or transition swap shall be made as follows:


(1) If only one counterparty is a swap dealer, the swap dealer shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.


(2) If neither party is an swap dealer, and only one counterparty is an major swap participant, the major swap participant shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.


(3) If both counterparties are non-SD/MSP/DCO counterparties, and only one counterparty is a financial entity as defined in CEA section 2(h)(7)(C), the counterparty that is a financial entity shall be the reporting counterparty.


(4) For each pre-enactment swap or transition swap for which both counterparties are swap dealers, or both counterparties are major swap participants, or both counterparties are non-SD/MSP/DCO counterparties that are financial entities as defined in CEA section 2(h)(7)(C), or both counterparties are non-SD/MSP/DCO counterparties and neither counterparty is a financial entity as defined in CEA section 2(h)(7)(C), the counterparties shall agree which counterparty shall fulfill reporting obligations with respect to that swap; and the counterparty so selected shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.


(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, for pre-enactment or transition swaps for which both counterparties are non-SD/MSP/DCO counterparties, if only one counterparty is a U.S. person, that counterparty shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.


(b) For pre-enactment and transition swaps in existence as of the compliance date, determination of the reporting counterparty shall be made by applying the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to the current counterparties to the swap as of the compliance date, regardless of whether either or both were original counterparties to the swap when it was first executed.


(c) For pre-enactment and transition swaps for which reporting is required, but which have expired or been terminated prior to the compliance date, determination of the reporting counterparty shall be made by applying the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section to the counterparties to the swap as of the date of its expiration or termination (except for determination of a counterparty's status as an SD or MSP, which shall be made as of the compliance date), regardless of whether either or both were original counterparties to the swap when it was first executed.


(d) After the initial report required by ยง 46.3 is made, if a reporting counterparty selected pursuant to this section ceases to be a counterparty to a swap due to an assignment or novation, the reporting counterparty for reporting of required swap continuation data following the assignment or novation shall be selected from the two current counterparties as provided in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section.


(1) If only one counterparty is a swap dealer, the swap dealer shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.


(2) If neither counterparty is a swap dealer, and only one counterparty is a major swap participant, the major swap participant shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.


(3) If both counterparties are non-SD/MSP/DCO counterparties, and only one counterparty is a U.S. person, that counterparty shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all counterparty reporting obligations.


(4) In all other cases, the counterparty that replaced the previous reporting counterparty by reason of the assignment or novation shall be the reporting counterparty, unless otherwise agreed by the counterparties.
