# § 48.10   Additional contracts.

(a) *Generally.* A registered foreign board of trade that wishes to make an additional futures, option or swap contract available for trading by identified members or other participants located in the United States with direct access to its electronic trading and order matching system must submit a written request prior to offering the contracts from within the United States. Such a written request must include the terms and conditions of the additional futures, option or swap contracts and a certification that the additional contracts meet the requirements of § 48.8(c), if applicable, and that the foreign board of trade and the clearing organization continue to satisfy the requirements and conditions of registration. The foreign board of trade can make available for trading by direct access the additional contracts ten business days after the date of receipt by the Commission of the written request, unless the Commission notifies the foreign board of trade that additional time is needed to complete its review of policy or other issues pertinent to the additional contracts. A registered foreign board of trade may list for trading by direct access an additional futures or option contract on a non-narrow-based security index pursuant to the Commission certification procedures set forth in § 30.13(d) and appendix D to part 30 of this chapter.


(b) *Option contracts on previously approved futures contracts.* (1) If the option is on a futures contract that is not a linked contract, the option contract may be made available for trading by direct access by filing with the Commission no later than the business day preceding the initial listing of the contract:


(i) A copy of the terms and conditions of the additional contract and


(ii) A certification that the foreign board of trade and the clearing organization continue to satisfy the conditions of its registration.


(2) If the option is on a futures contract that is a linked contract, the option contract may be made available for trading by direct access by filing with the Commission no later than the business day preceding the initial listing of the contract:


(i) A copy of the terms and conditions of the additional contract; and


(ii) A certification that the foreign board of trade and the clearing organization continue to satisfy the conditions of its registration, including the conditions specifically applicable to linked contracts set forth in § 48.8(c).


(3) If the option is on a non-narrow-based security index futures contract which may be offered or sold in the United States pursuant to a Commission certification issued pursuant to § 30.13 of this chapter, the option contract may be listed for trading by direct access without further action by either the registered foreign board of trade or the Commission.
