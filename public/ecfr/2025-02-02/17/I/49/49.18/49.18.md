Such confidentiality arrangement must include, either as Exhibit A to the form set forth in appendix B of this part or similarly appended, a description of the appropriate domestic regulator's or appropriate foreign regulator's jurisdiction. Once a swap data repository is notified, in writing, that a confidentiality arrangement received from an appropriate domestic regulator or appropriate foreign regulator no longer is in effect, the swap data repository shall not provide access to swap data to such appropriate domestic regulator or appropriate foreign regulator.

(c) *Reporting failures to fulfill the terms of a confidentiality arrangement.* A swap data repository shall immediately report to the Commission any known failure to fulfill the terms of a confidentiality arrangement that it receives pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.


(d) *Failures to fulfill the terms of the confidentiality arrangement.* The Commission may, if an appropriate domestic regulator or appropriate foreign regulator fails to fulfill the terms of a confidentiality arrangement described in paragraph (a) of this section, direct, in writing, each swap data repository to limit, suspend or revoke such appropriate domestic regulator's or appropriate foreign regulator's access to swap data held by such swap data repository.
