(ii) A third party, directly or indirectly, holds a majority ownership interest in both counterparties, and the third party reports its financial statements on a consolidated basis under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or International Financial Reporting Standards, and such consolidated financial statements include the financial results of both of the swap counterparties.


(2) For purposes of this section:

(ii) The term “eligible affiliate counterparty” means an entity that meets the requirements of this paragraph; and


(iii) The term “United States” means the United States of America, its territories and possessions, any State of the United States, and the District of Columbia.
