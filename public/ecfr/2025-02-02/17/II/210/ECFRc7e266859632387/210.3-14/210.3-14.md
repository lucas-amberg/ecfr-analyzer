# § 210.3-14   Special instructions for financial statements of real estate operations acquired or to be acquired.

(a) *Financial statements required.* (1) Financial statements (except the related schedules specified in § 210.12) prepared and audited in accordance with Regulation S-X (including the independence standards in § 210.2-01 or, alternatively if the real estate operation is not a registrant, the applicable independence standards) for the periods specified in paragraph (b) of this section and the supplemental information specified in paragraph (f) of this section must be filed if any of the following conditions exist:


(i) During the most recent fiscal year or subsequent interim period for which a balance sheet is required by § 210.3-01, an acquisition of a real estate operation has occurred; or


(ii) After the date of the most recent balance sheet filed pursuant to § 210.3-01, consummation of an acquisition of a real estate operation has occurred or is probable.


(2) For purposes of determining whether the provisions of this section apply:


(i) The term *real estate operation* means a business (as set forth in § 210.11-01(d)) that generates substantially all of its revenues through the leasing of real property.


(ii) The acquisition of a real estate operation encompasses the acquisition of an interest in a real estate operation accounted for by the registrant under the equity method or, in lieu of the equity method, the fair value option.


(3) Acquisitions of a group of related real estate operations that are probable or that have occurred subsequent to the latest fiscal year-end for which audited financial statements of the registrant have been filed will be treated under this section as if they are a single acquisition. The required financial statements may be presented on a combined basis for any periods they are under common control or management. For purposes of this section, acquisitions will be deemed to be related if:


(i) They are under common control or management;


(ii) A registrant, other than a foreign private issuer required to file reports on Form 6-K (§ 249.306 of this chapter) or shell company (other than a business combination related shell company), that omits from its initial registration statement financial statements of a recently consummated acquisition of a real estate operation pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section must file those financial statements and any pro forma information specified by §§ 210.11-01 through 210.11-03 (Article 11) under cover of Form 8-K (§ 249.308 of this chapter) no later than 75 days after consummation of the acquisition. When a predecessor to a shell company (other than a business combination related shell company) acquires a real estate operation and the financial statements of that recently consummated acquisition of a real estate operation are omitted from a registration statement or proxy statement pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, refer to § 210.15-01(d)(2).


(iii) Each acquisition is conditioned on a single common event.


(4) This section does not apply to a real estate operation that is totally held by the registrant prior to consummation of the transaction.


(b) *Periods to be presented.* (1) If registering an offering of securities to the security holders of the real estate operation to be acquired, then the financial statements specified in paragraph (c) of this section and the supplemental information specified in paragraph (f) of this section must be filed for the real estate operation to be acquired for the periods specified in §§ 210.3-01 and 210.3-02, except as provided otherwise for filings on Form S-4 or F-4 (§ 239.25 or § 239.34 of this chapter). The financial statements covering fiscal years must be audited except as provided in Item 14 of Schedule 14A (§ 240.14a-101 of this chapter) with respect to certain proxy statements or in registration statements filed on Form S-4 or F-4 (§ 239.25 or § 239.34 of this chapter).


(2) In all cases not specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, financial statements of the real estate operation acquired or to be acquired must be filed for the periods specified in this paragraph (b)(2) or such shorter period as the real estate operation has been in existence. The periods for which such financial statements are to be filed must be determined using the investment test condition specified in the definition of significant subsidiary in § 210.1-02(w)(1)(i) modified as follows:


(i)(A) If the condition does not exceed 20 percent, financial statements are not required.


(B) If the condition exceeds 20 percent, financial statements of the real estate operation for at least the most recent fiscal year and the most recent interim period specified in §§ 210.3-01 and 210.3-02 must be filed.


(C) If the aggregate impact of acquired or to be acquired real estate operations since the date of the most recent audited balance sheet filed for the registrant, for which financial statements are either not required by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section or are not yet required based on paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, exceeds 50 percent, the registrant must provide the disclosures specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(C)(*1*) and (b)(2)(i)(C)(*2*) of this section. If there are also businesses acquired or to be acquired as described in § 210.3-05(b)(2)(iv), the requirements in § 210.3-05(b)(2)(iv) will apply instead.


(*1*) Pro forma financial information pursuant to §§ 210.11-01 through 210.11-02 that depicts the aggregate impact of these acquired or to be acquired real estate operations in all material respects; and


(*2*) Financial statements covering at least the most recent fiscal year and the most recent interim period specified in §§ 210.3-01 and 210.3-02 for any acquired or to be acquired real estate operation for which financial statements are not yet required based on paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.


(ii) When the investment test is based on the total assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated, include any assumed debt secured by the real properties in the “investments in” the tested real estate operation.


(iii) The determination must be made using § 210.11-01(b)(3) and (4).


(3) Financial statements required for the periods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be omitted to the extent specified as follows:


(i) Registration statements not subject to the provisions of § 230.419 of this chapter and proxy statements need not include separate financial statements of the acquired or to be acquired real estate operation if neither the real estate operation nor the aggregate impact specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section exceeds the condition of significance in the definition of significant subsidiary in § 210.1-02(w)(1)(i), as modified by paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section, at the 50 percent level computed in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and either:


(A) The consummation of the acquisition has not yet occurred; or


(B) The date of the final prospectus or prospectus supplement relating to an offering as filed with the Commission pursuant to § 230.424(b) of this chapter, or mailing date in the case of a proxy statement, is no more than 74 days after consummation of the acquisition of the real estate operation, and the financial statements have not previously been filed by the registrant.


(ii) A registrant, other than a foreign private issuer required to file reports on Form 6-K (§ 249.306 of this chapter), that omits from its initial registration statement financial statements of a recently consummated acquisition of a real estate operation pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section must file those financial statements and any pro forma information specified by §§ 210.11-01 through 210.11-03 (Article 11) under cover of Form 8-K (§ 249.308 of this chapter) no later than 75 days after consummation of the acquisition.


(iii) Separate financial statements of the acquired real estate operation specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section need not be presented once the operating results of the acquired real estate operation have been reflected in the audited consolidated financial statements of the registrant for at least nine months.


(c) *Presentation of the financial statements.* (1) The financial statements prepared and audited in accordance with Regulation S-X may be only statements of revenues and expenses excluding expenses not comparable to the proposed future operations such as mortgage interest, leasehold rental, depreciation, amortization, corporate overhead and income taxes.


(2) The notes to the financial statements must include the following disclosures:


(i) The type of omitted expenses and the reason(s) why they are excluded from the financial statements;


(ii) A description of how the financial statements presented are not indicative of the results of operations of the acquired real estate operation going forward because of the omitted expenses; and


(iii) Information about the real estate operation's operating, investing and financing cash flows, to the extent available.


(d) *Financial statements of a foreign real estate operation.* Financial statements of an acquired or to be acquired foreign business (as defined in § 210.1-02(l)) that is a real estate operation, specified in paragraph (c) of this section and meeting the requirements of Item 17 of Form 20-F (§ 249.220f of this chapter), will satisfy this section. Such financial statements may be reconciled to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS-IASB) if the registrant is a foreign private issuer that prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS-IASB. This reconciliation must generally follow the form and content requirements in Item 17(c) of Form 20-F; however, accommodations in Item 17(c)(2) of Form 20-F that would be inconsistent with IFRS-IASB may not be applied, and IFRS 1, *First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards,* may be applied.


(e) *Financial statements of an acquired or to be acquired real estate operation that would be a foreign private issuer if it were a registrant.* Financial statements of an acquired or to be acquired real estate operation that is not a foreign business (as defined in § 210.1-02(l)), but would qualify as a foreign private issuer (as defined in §§ 230.405 and 240.3b-4 of this chapter) if it were a registrant, may be prepared in accordance with IFRS-IASB without reconciliation to U.S. GAAP or, if the registrant is a foreign private issuer that prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS-IASB, may be prepared according to a comprehensive basis of accounting principles other than U.S. GAAP or IFRS-IASB and must be reconciled to IFRS-IASB or to U.S. GAAP. This reconciliation must generally follow the form and content requirements in Item 17(c) of Form 20-F; however, accommodations in Item 17(c)(2) of Form 20-F that would be inconsistent with IFRS-IASB may not be applied, and IFRS 1, *First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards,* may be applied.


(f) *Supplemental information.* For each real estate operation for which financial statements are required to be filed by paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(B) and (b)(2)(i)(C)(*2*) of this section, material factors considered by the registrant in assessing the real estate operation must be described with specificity in the filing, including sources of revenue (including, but not limited to, competition in the rental market, comparative rents, and occupancy rates) and expense (including, but not limited to, utility rates, property tax rates, maintenance expenses, and capital improvements anticipated). The disclosure must also indicate that the registrant is not aware of any other material factors relating to the specific real estate operation that would cause the reported financial statements not to be indicative of future operating results.


*Instruction 1 to paragraph (f):* When the financial statements are presented in Form S-11 (§ 239.18 of this chapter), the discussion of material factors considered should supplement the disclosures required by Item 15 of Form S-11.
