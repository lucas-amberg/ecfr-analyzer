For the purposes of this subpart 229.900:


(a) *General partner* means the person or persons responsible under state law for managing or directing the management of the business and affairs of a partnership that is the subject of a roll-up transaction including, but not limited to, the general partner(s), board of directors, board of trustees, or other person(s) having a fiduciary duty to such partnership.

(2)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this Item (§ 229.901(b)(2)(ii)), a limited partnership or other entity is “finite-life” if:


(A) It operates as a conduit vehicle for investors to participate in the ownership of assets for a limited period of time; and

(ii) A real estate investment trust as defined in I.R.C. section 856 is not *finite-life* solely because of the distribution to investors of net income as provided by the I.R.C. if its policies or purposes do not include the distribution to investors of proceeds from the sale, financing or refinancing of assets, rather than the reinvestment of such proceeds in the business.

2/3% of the outstanding units of each of the participating partnerships; and


(B) As a result of the transaction, the existing general partners will receive only compensation to which they are entitled as expressly provided for in the preexisting partnership agreements;


(v) A transaction in which the securities offered to investors are securities of another entity that are reported under a transaction reporting plan declared effective before December 17, 1993 by the Commission under Section 11A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78k-1), if:
