(a) A registration statement on Form N-1A (§ 239.15A and § 274.11A of this chapter), Form N-2 (§ 239.14 and § 274.11a-1 of this chapter), Form N-3 (§ 239.17a and § 274.11b of this chapter), Form N-4 (§ 239.17b and § 274.11c of this chapter), or Form N-6 (§ 239.17c and § 274.11d of this chapter), shall consist of the facing sheet of the applicable form; a prospectus containing the information called for by such form; the information, list of exhibits, undertakings and signatures required to be set forth in such form; financial statements and schedules; exhibits; and other information or documents filed as part of the registration statement; and all documents or information incorporated by reference in the foregoing (whether or not required to be filed).


(b) All general instructions, instructions to items of the form, and instructions as to financial statements, exhibits, or prospectuses are to be omitted from the registration statement in all cases.


(c) In the case of a registration statement filed on Form N-1A (§§ 239.15A and 274.11A of this chapter), Form N-2 (§§ 239.14 and 274.11a-1 of this chapter), Form N-3 (§§ 239.17a and 274.11b of this chapter), Form N-4 (§§ 239.17b and 274.11c of this chapter), or Form N-6 (§§ 239.17c and 274.11d of this chapter), Parts A and B shall contain the information called for by each of the items of the applicable Part, except that unless otherwise specified, no reference need be made to inapplicable items, and negative answers to any item may be omitted. Copies of Parts A and B may be filed as part of the registration statement in lieu of furnishing the information in item-and-answer form. Wherever such copies are filed in lieu of information in item-and-answer form, the text of the items of the form is to be omitted from the registration statement, as well as from Parts A and B, except to the extent provided in paragraph (d) of the section. 


(d) In the case of a registration statement filed on Form N-1A (§§ 239.15A and 274.11A of this chapter), Form N-2 (§§ 239.14 and 274.11a-1 of this chapter), Form N-3 (§§ 239.17a and 274.11b of this chapter), Form N-4 (§§ 239.17b and 274.11c of this chapter), or Form N-6 (§§ 239.17c and 274.11d of this chapter), where any item of those forms calls for information not required to be included in Parts A and B (generally Part C of such form), the text of such items, including the numbers and captions thereof, together with the answers thereto, shall be filed with Parts A or B under cover of the facing sheet of the form as part of the registration statement. However, the text of such items may be omitted, provided the answers are so prepared as to indicate the coverage of the item without the necessity of reference to the text of the item. If any such item is inapplicable, or the answer thereto is in the negative, a statement to that effect shall be made. Any financial statements not required to be included in Parts A and B shall also be filed as part of the registration statement proper, unless incorporated by reference pursuant to § 230.411.


(e) *Electronic filings.* When ascertaining the date of filing, electronic filers should not presume a registration statement has been accepted until notice of acceptance has been received from the Commission.
