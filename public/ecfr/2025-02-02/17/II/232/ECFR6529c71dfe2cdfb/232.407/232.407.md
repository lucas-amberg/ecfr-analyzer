# § 232.407   Interactive data financial report filings.

Section 407 of Regulation S-T (§ 232.407) applies to electronic filers that file Interactive Data Financial Reports (§ 232.11) as required by Rule 13n-11(f)(5) (§ 240.13n-11(f)(5) of this chapter). Section 407 imposes content, format, and filing requirements for Interactive Data Financial Reports, but does not change the substantive content requirements for the financial and other disclosures in the Related Official Financial Report Filing (§ 232.11). Rule 13n-11(f)(5) specifies the circumstances under which an Interactive Data Financial Report must be filed as an exhibit.


(a) *Content, format, and filing requirements—General.* Interactive Data Financial Reports must:


(1) Comply with the content, format, and filing requirements of this section;


(2) Be filed only by an electronic filer that is required to file an Interactive Data Financial Report pursuant to Rule 13n-11(f)(5) (§ 240.13n-11(f)(5) of this chapter) as an exhibit to a filing; and


(3) Be filed in accordance with the EDGAR Filer Manual and Rules 13n-11(f)(5) and (g) (§ 240.13n-11(f)(5) and (g) of this chapter).


(b) *Content—categories of information presented.* An Interactive Data Financial Report must consist of only a complete set of information for all periods required to be presented in the corresponding data in the Related Official Financial Report Filing, no more and no less, for the following categories, as applicable:


(1) The complete set of the electronic filer's financial statements (which includes the face of the financial statements and all footnotes); and


(2) All schedules set forth in Article 12 of Regulation S-X (§§ 210.12-01 through 210.12-29 of this chapter) related to the electronic filer's financial statements.


(c) *Format—Generally.* An Interactive Data Financial Report must comply with the following requirements, except as modified by paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, as applicable, with respect to the corresponding data in the Related Official Financial Report Filing consisting of footnotes to financial statements or financial statement schedules as set forth in Article 12 of Regulation S-X (§§ 210.12-01 through 210.12-29 of this chapter):


(1) *Data elements and labels*—(i) *Element accuracy.* Each data element (*i.e.,* all text, line item names, monetary values, percentages, numbers, dates and other labels) contained in the Interactive Data Financial Report reflects the same information in the corresponding data in the Related Official Financial Report Filing;


(ii) *Element specificity.* No data element contained in the corresponding data in the Related Official Financial Report Filing is changed, deleted or summarized in the Interactive Data Financial Report;


(iii) *Standard and special labels and elements.* Each data element contained in the Interactive Data Financial Report is matched with an appropriate tag from the most recent version of the standard list of tags specified by the EDGAR Filer Manual. A tag is appropriate only when its standard definition, standard label, and other attributes as and to the extent identified in the list of tags match the information to be tagged, except that:


(A) *Labels.* An electronic filer must create and use a new special label to modify a tag's existing standard label when that tag is an appropriate tag in all other respects (*i.e.*, in order to use a tag from the standard list of tags only its label needs to be changed); and


(B) *Elements.* An electronic filer must create and use a new special element if and only if an appropriate tag does not exist in the standard list of tags for reasons other than or in addition to an inappropriate standard label; and


(2) *Additional mark-up related content.* The Interactive Data Financial Report contains any additional mark-up related content (e.g., the eXtensible Business Reporting Language tags themselves, identification of the core XML documents used and other technology-related content) not found in the corresponding data in the Related Official Financial Report Filing that is necessary to comply with the EDGAR Filer Manual requirements.


(d) *Format—Footnotes—Generally.* The part of the Interactive Data Financial Report for which the corresponding data in the Related Official Financial Report Filing consists of footnotes to financial statements must comply with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, as modified by this paragraph (d). Each complete footnote must be block-text tagged.


(e) *Format—Schedules—Generally.* The part of the Interactive Data Financial Report for which the corresponding data in the Related Official Financial Report Filing consists of financial statement schedules as set forth in Article 12 of Regulation S-X (§§ 210.12-01 through 210.12-29 of this chapter) must comply with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, as modified by this paragraph (e).
