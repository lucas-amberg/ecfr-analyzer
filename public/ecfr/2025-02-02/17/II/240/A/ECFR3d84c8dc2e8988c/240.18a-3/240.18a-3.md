# § 240.18a-3   Non-cleared security-based swap margin requirements for security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants for which there is not a prudential regulator.

(a) Every security-based swap dealer and major security-based swap participant for which there is not a prudential regulator must comply with this section.


(b) *Definitions.* For the purposes of this section:


(1) The term *account* means an account carried by a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant that holds one or more non-cleared security-based swaps for a counterparty.


(2) The term *commercial end user* means a counterparty that qualifies for an exception from clearing under section 3C(g)(1) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-3(g)(1)) and implementing regulations or satisfies the criteria in section 3C(g)(4) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-3(g)(4)) and implementing regulations.


(3) The term *counterparty* means a person with whom the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant has entered into a non-cleared security-based swap transaction.


(4) The term *initial margin amount* means the amount calculated pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.


(5) The term *non-cleared security-based swap* means a security-based swap that is not, directly or indirectly, submitted to and cleared by a clearing agency registered pursuant to section 17A of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78q-1) or by a clearing agency that the Commission has exempted from registration by rule or order pursuant to section 17A of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78q-1).


(6) The term *security-based swap legacy account* means an account that holds no security-based swaps entered into after the compliance date of this section and that only is used to hold one or more security-based swaps entered into prior to the compliance date of this section and collateral for those security-based swaps.


(c) *Margin requirements*—(1) *Security-based swap dealers*—(i) *Calculation required.* A security-based swap dealer must calculate with respect to each account of a counterparty as of the close of each business day:


(A) The amount of the current exposure in the account of the counterparty; and


(B) The initial margin amount for the account of the counterparty.


(ii) *Account equity requirements.* Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, a security-based swap dealer must take an action required in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section by no later than the close of business of the first business day following the day of the calculation required under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section or, if the counterparty is located in another country and more than four time zones away, the second business day following the day of the calculation required under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section:


(A)(*1*) Collect from the counterparty collateral in an amount equal to the current exposure that the security-based swap dealer has to the counterparty; or


(*2)* Deliver to the counterparty collateral in an amount equal to the current exposure that the counterparty has to the security-based swap dealer, provided that such amount does not include the initial margin amount collected from the counterparty under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section; and


(B) Collect from the counterparty collateral in an amount equal to the initial margin amount.


(iii) *Exceptions*—(A) *Commercial end users.* The requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section do not apply to an account of a counterparty that is a commercial end user.


(B) *Counterparties that are financial market intermediaries.* The requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section do not apply to an account of a counterparty that is a security-based swap dealer, swap dealer, broker or dealer, futures commission merchant, bank, foreign bank, or foreign broker or dealer.


(C) *Counterparties that use third-party custodians.* The requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section do not apply to an account of a counterparty that delivers the collateral to meet the initial margin amount to an independent third-party custodian.


(D) *Security-based swap legacy accounts.* The requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section do not apply to a security-based swap legacy account.


(E) *Bank for International Settlements, European Stability Mechanism, and Multilateral development banks.* The requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section do not apply to an account of a counterparty that is the Bank for International Settlements or the European Stability Mechanism, or is the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, the International Finance Corporation, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, the European Investment Fund, the Nordic Investment Bank, the Caribbean Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, the Council of Europe Development Bank, or any other multilateral development bank that provides financing for national or regional development in which the U.S. government is a shareholder or contributing member.


(F) *Sovereign entities.* The requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section do not apply to an account of a counterparty that is a central government (including the U.S. government) or an agency, department, ministry, or central bank of a central government if the security-based swap dealer has determined that the counterparty has only a minimal amount of credit risk pursuant to policies and procedures or credit risk models established pursuant to § 240.15c3-1 or § 240.18a-1 (as applicable).


(G) *Affiliates.* The requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section do not apply to an account of a counterparty that is an affiliate of the security-based swap dealer.


(H) *Threshold amount.* (*1*) A security-based swap dealer may elect not to collect the initial margin amount required under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section to the extent that the sum of that amount plus all other credit exposures resulting from non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps of the security-based swap dealer and its affiliates with the counterparty and its affiliates does not exceed $50 million. For purposes of this calculation, a security-based swap dealer need not include any exposures arising from non-cleared security based swap transactions with a counterparty that is a commercial end user, and non-cleared swap transactions with a counterparty that qualifies for an exception from margin requirements pursuant to section 4s(e)(4) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 6s(e)(4)).


(*2*) *One-time deferral.* Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(H)(*1*) of this section, a security-based swap dealer may defer collecting the initial margin amount required under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section for up to two months following the month in which a counterparty no longer qualifies for this threshold exception for the first time.


(I) *Minimum transfer amount.* Notwithstanding any other provision of this rule, a security-based swap dealer is not required to collect or deliver collateral pursuant to this section with respect to a particular counterparty unless and until the total amount of collateral that is required to be collected or delivered, and has not yet been collected or delivered, with respect to the counterparty is greater than $500,000.


(2) *Major security-based swap participants*—(i) *Calculation required.* A major security-based swap participant must with respect to each account of a counterparty calculate as of the close of each business day the amount of the current exposure in the account of the counterparty.


(ii) *Account equity requirements.* Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, a major security-based swap participant must take an action required in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section by no later than the close of business of the first business day following the day of the calculation required under paragraph (c)(2)(i) or, if the counterparty is located in another country and more than four time zones away, the second business day following the day of the calculation required under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section:


(A) Collect from the counterparty collateral in an amount equal to the current exposure that the major security-based swap participant has to the counterparty; or


(B) Deliver to the counterparty collateral in an amount equal to the current exposure that the counterparty has to the major security-based swap participant.


(iii) *Exceptions*—(A) *Commercial end users.* The requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section do not apply to an account of a counterparty that is a commercial end user.


(B) *Security-based swap legacy accounts.* The requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section do not apply to a security-based swap legacy account.


(C) *Bank for International Settlements, European Stability Mechanism, and Multilateral development banks.* The requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section do not apply to an account of a counterparty that is the Bank for International Settlements or the European Stability Mechanism, or is the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, the International Finance Corporation, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, the European Investment Fund, the Nordic Investment Bank, the Caribbean Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, the Council of Europe Development Bank, or any other multilateral development bank that provides financing for national or regional development in which the U.S. government is a shareholder or contributing member.


(D) *Minimum transfer amount.* Notwithstanding any other provision of this rule, a major security-based swap participant is not required to collect or deliver collateral pursuant to this section with respect to a particular counterparty unless and until the total amount of collateral that is required to be collected or delivered, and has not yet been collected or delivered, with respect to the counterparty is greater than $500,000.


(3) *Deductions for collateral.* (i) The fair market value of collateral delivered by a counterparty or the security-based swap dealer must be reduced by the amount of the standardized deductions the security-based swap dealer would apply to the collateral pursuant to § 240.15c3-1 or § 240.18a-1, as applicable, for the purpose of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.


(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the fair market value of assets delivered as collateral by a counterparty or the security-based swap dealer may be reduced by the amount of the standardized deductions prescribed in 17 CFR 23.156 if the security-based swap dealer applies these standardized deductions consistently with respect to the particular counterparty.


(4) *Collateral requirements.* A security-based swap dealer or a major security-based swap participant when calculating the amounts under paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section may take into account the fair market value of collateral delivered by a counterparty provided:


(i) The collateral:


(A) Has a ready market;


(B) Is readily transferable;


(C) Consists of cash, securities, money market instruments, a major foreign currency, the settlement currency of the non-cleared security-based swap, or gold;


(D) Does not consist of securities and/or money market instruments issued by the counterparty or a party related to the security-based swap dealer, the major security-based swap participant, or the counterparty; and


(E) Is subject to an agreement between the security-based swap dealer or the major security-based swap participant and the counterparty that is legally enforceable by the security-based swap dealer or the major security-based swap participant against the counterparty and any other parties to the agreement; and


(ii) The collateral is either:


(A) Subject to the physical possession or control of the security-based swap dealer or the major security-based swap participant and may be liquidated promptly by the security-based swap dealer or the major security-based swap participant without intervention by any other party; or


(B) The collateral is carried by an independent third-party custodian that is a bank as defined in section 3(a)(6) of the Act or a registered U.S. clearing organization or depository that is not affiliated with the counterparty or, if the collateral consists of foreign securities or currencies, a supervised foreign bank, clearing organization, or depository that is not affiliated with the counterparty and that customarily maintains custody of such foreign securities or currencies.


(5) *Qualified netting agreements.* A security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant may include the effect of a netting agreement that allows the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant to net gross receivables from and gross payables to a counterparty upon the default of the counterparty, for the purposes of the calculations required pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(2)(i) of this section, if:


(i) The netting agreement is legally enforceable in each relevant jurisdiction, including in insolvency proceedings;


(ii) The gross receivables and gross payables that are subject to the netting agreement with a counterparty can be determined at any time; and


(iii) For internal risk management purposes, the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant monitors and controls its exposure to the counterparty on a net basis.


(6) *Frequency of calculations increased.* The calculations required pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(2)(i) of this section must be made more frequently than the close of each business day during periods of extreme volatility and for accounts with concentrated positions.


(7) *Liquidation.* A security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant must take prompt steps to liquidate positions in an account that does not meet the margin requirements of this section to the extent necessary to eliminate the margin deficiency.


(d) *Calculating initial margin amount.* A security-based swap dealer must calculate the initial margin amount required by paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section for non-cleared security-based swaps as follows:


(1) *Standardized approach*—(i) *Credit default swaps.* For credit default swaps, the security-based swap dealer must use the method specified in § 240.18a-1(c)(1)(vi)(B)(*1*) or, if the security-based swap dealer is registered with the Commission as a broker or dealer, the method specified in § 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(P)(*1*).


(ii) *All other security-based swaps.* For security-based swaps other than credit default swaps, the security-based swap dealer must use the method specified in § 240.18a-1(c)(1)(vi)(B)(*2*) or, if the security-based swap dealer is registered with the Commission as a broker or dealer, the method specified in § 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(P)(*2*).


(2) *Model approach.* (i) For security-based swaps other than equity security-based swaps, a security-based swap dealer may apply to the Commission for authorization to use and be responsible for a model to calculate the initial margin amount required by paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section subject to the application process in § 240.15c3-1e or § 240.18a-1(d), as applicable. The model must use a 99 percent, one-tailed confidence level with price changes equivalent to a ten business-day movement in rates and prices, and must use risk factors sufficient to cover all the material price risks inherent in the positions for which the initial margin amount is being calculated, including foreign exchange or interest rate risk, credit risk, equity risk, and commodity risk, as appropriate. Empirical correlations may be recognized by the model within each broad risk category, but not across broad risk categories.


(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, a security-based swap dealer that is not registered as a broker or dealer pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o(b)), other than as an OTC derivatives dealer, may apply to the Commission for authorization to use a model to calculate the initial margin amount required by paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section for equity security-based swaps, subject to the application process and model requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section; provided, however, the account of the counterparty subject to the requirements of this paragraph may not hold equity security positions other than equity security-based swaps and equity swaps.


(e) *Risk monitoring and procedures.* A security-based swap dealer must monitor the risk of each account and establish, maintain, and document procedures and guidelines for monitoring the risk of accounts as part of the risk management control system required by § 240.15c3-4. The security-based swap dealer must review, in accordance with written procedures, at reasonable periodic intervals, its non-cleared security-based swap activities for consistency with the risk monitoring procedures and guidelines required by this section. The security-based swap dealer also must determine whether information and data necessary to apply the risk monitoring procedures and guidelines required by this section are accessible on a timely basis and whether information systems are available to adequately capture, monitor, analyze, and report relevant data and information. The risk monitoring procedures and guidelines must include, at a minimum, procedures and guidelines for:


(1) Obtaining and reviewing account documentation and financial information necessary for assessing the amount of current and potential future exposure to a given counterparty permitted by the security-based swap dealer;


(2) Determining, approving, and periodically reviewing credit limits for each counterparty, and across all counterparties;


(3) Monitoring credit risk exposure to the security-based swap dealer from non-cleared security-based swaps, including the type, scope, and frequency of reporting to senior management;


(4) Using stress tests to monitor potential future exposure to a single counterparty and across all counterparties over a specified range of possible market movements over a specified time period;


(5) Managing the impact of credit exposure related to non-cleared security-based swaps on the security-based swap dealer's overall risk exposure;


(6) Determining the need to collect collateral from a particular counterparty, including whether that determination was based upon the creditworthiness of the counterparty and/or the risk of the specific non-cleared security-based swap contracts with the counterparty;


(7) Monitoring the credit exposure resulting from concentrated positions with a single counterparty and across all counterparties, and during periods of extreme volatility; and


(8) Maintaining sufficient equity in the account of each counterparty to protect against the largest individual potential future exposure of a non-cleared security-based swap carried in the account of the counterparty as measured by computing the largest maximum possible loss that could result from the exposure.
