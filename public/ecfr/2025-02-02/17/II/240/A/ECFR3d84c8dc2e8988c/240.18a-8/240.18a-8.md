The notice must specify the security-based swap dealer's net capital requirement and its current amount of net capital. If a security-based swap dealer is informed by the Commission that it is, or has been, in violation of § 240.18a-1 and the security-based swap dealer has not given notice of the capital deficiency under this section, the security-based swap dealer, even if it does not agree that it is, or has been, in violation of § 240.18a-1, must give notice of the claimed deficiency, which notice may specify the security-based swap dealer's reasons for its disagreement.


(ii) Every security-based swap dealer for which there is no prudential regulator whose tentative net capital declines below the minimum amount required pursuant to § 240.18a-1 must give notice of such deficiency that same day in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section. The notice must specify the security-based swap dealer's tentative net capital requirement and its current amount of tentative net capital. If a security-based swap is informed by the Commission that it is, or has been, in violation of § 240.18a-1 and the security-based swap dealer has not given notice of the capital deficiency under this section, the security-based swap dealer, even if it does not agree that it is, or has been, in violation of § 240.18a-1, must give notice of the claimed deficiency, which notice may specify the security-based swap dealer's reasons for its disagreement.


(2) Every major security-based swap participant for which there is no prudential regulator who fails to maintain a positive tangible net worth pursuant to § 240.18a-2 must give notice of such deficiency that same day in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section. The notice must specify the extent to which the firm has failed to maintain positive tangible net worth. If a major security-based swap participant is informed by the Commission that it is, or has been, in violation of § 240.18a-2 and the major security-based swap participant has not given notice of the capital deficiency under this section, the major security-based swap participant, even if it does not agree that it is, or has been, in violation of § 240.18a-2, must give notice of the claimed deficiency, which notice may specify the major security-based swap participant's reasons for its disagreement.
