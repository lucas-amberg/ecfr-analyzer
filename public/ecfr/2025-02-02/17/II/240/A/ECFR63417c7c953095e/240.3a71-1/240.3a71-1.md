# § 240.3a71-1   Definition of “security-based swap dealer.”

(a) *General.* The term *security-based swap dealer* in general means any person who:


(1) Holds itself out as a dealer in security-based swaps;


(2) Makes a market in security-based swaps;


(3) Regularly enters into security-based swaps with counterparties as an ordinary course of business for its own account; or


(4) Engages in any activity causing it to be commonly known in the trade as a dealer or market maker in security-based swaps.


(b) *Exception.* The term *security-based swap dealer* does not include a person that enters into security-based swaps for such person's own account, either individually or in a fiduciary capacity, but not as a part of regular business.


(c) *Scope of designation.* A person that is a security-based swap dealer in general shall be deemed to be a security-based swap dealer with respect to each security-based swap it enters into, regardless of the type, class, or category of the security-based swap or the person's activities in connection with the security-based swap, unless the Commission limits the person's designation as a security-based swap dealer to specified types, classes, or categories of security-based swaps or specified activities of the person in connection with security-based swaps.


(d) *Inter-affiliate activities*—(1) *General.* In determining whether a person is a security-based swap dealer, that person's security-based swaps with majority-owned affiliates shall not be considered.


(2) *Meaning of majority-owned.* For these purposes the counterparties to a security-based swap are majority-owned affiliates if one counterparty directly or indirectly owns a majority interest in the other, or if a third party directly or indirectly owns a majority interest in both counterparties to the security-based swap, where “majority interest” is the right to vote or direct the vote of a majority of a class of voting securities of an entity, the power to sell or direct the sale of a majority of a class of voting securities of an entity, or the right to receive upon dissolution or the contribution of a majority of the capital of a partnership.
