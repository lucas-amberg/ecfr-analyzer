# § 240.3a71-2A   Report regarding the “security-based swap dealer” and “major security-based swap participant” definitions (Appendix A to 17 CFR 240.3a71-2).

Appendix A to § 240.3a71-2 sets forth guidelines applicable to a report that the Commission has directed its staff to make in connection with the rules and interpretations further defining the Act's definitions of the terms “security-based swap dealer” (including the *de minimis* exception to that definition) and “major security-based swap participant.” The Commission intends to consider this report in reviewing the effect and application of these rules based on the evolution of the security-based swap market following the implementation of the registration and regulatory requirements of Section 15F of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-10). The report may also be informative as to potential changes to the rules further defining those terms. In producing this report, the staff shall consider security-based swap data collected by the Commission pursuant to other Title VII rules, as well as any other applicable information as the staff may determine to be appropriate for its analysis.


(a) *Report topics.* As appropriate, based on the availability of data and information, the report should address the following topics:


(1) *De minimis exception.* In connection with the *de minimis* exception to the definition of “security-based swap dealer,” the report generally should assess whether any of the *de minimis* thresholds set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of § 240.3a71-2 should be increased or decreased;


(2) *General security-based swap dealer analysis.* In connection with the definition of “security-based swap dealer,” the report generally should consider the factors that are useful for identifying security-based swap dealing activity, including the application of the dealer-trader distinction for that purpose, and the potential use of more objective tests or safe harbors as part of the analysis;


(3) *General major security-based swap participant analysis.* In connection with the definition of “major security-based swap participant,” the report generally should consider the tests used to identify the presence of a “substantial position” in a major category of security-based swaps, and the tests used to identify persons whose security-based swap positions create “substantial counterparty exposure,” including the potential use of alternative tests or thresholds;


(4) *Commercial risk hedging exclusion.* In connection with the definition of “major security-based swap participant,” the report generally should consider the definition of “hedging or mitigating commercial risk,” including whether that latter definition inappropriately permits certain positions to be excluded from the “substantial position” analysis, and whether the continued availability of the exclusion for such hedging positions should be conditioned on a person assessing and documenting the hedging effectiveness of those positions;


(5) *Highly leveraged financial entities.* In connection with the definition of “major security-based swap participant,” the report generally should consider the definition of “highly leveraged,” including whether alternative approaches should be used to identify highly leveraged financial entities;


(6) *Inter-affiliate exclusions.* In connection with the definitions of “security-based swap dealer” and “major security-based swap participant,” the report generally should consider the impact of rule provisions excluding inter-affiliate transactions from the relevant analyses, and should assess potential alternative approaches for such exclusions; and


(7) *Other topics.* Any other analysis of security-based swap data and information the Commission or the staff deem relevant to this rule.


(b) *Timing of report.* The report shall be completed no later than three years following the data collection initiation date, established pursuant to § 240.3a71-2(a)(2)(iii).


(c) *Public comment on the report.* Following completion of the report, the report shall be published in the _Federal Register_ for public comment.
