(a) *Determinations*—(1) *In general.* Subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the Commission may, conditionally or unconditionally, by order, make a determination with respect to a foreign financial regulatory system that compliance with specified requirements under such foreign financial regulatory system by a registered security-based swap dealer and/or by a registered major security-based swap participant (each a “security-based swap entity”), or class thereof, may satisfy the corresponding requirements identified in paragraph (d) of this section that would otherwise apply to such security-based swap entity (or class thereof).


(2) *Standard.* The Commission shall not make a substituted compliance determination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section unless the Commission:


(i) Determines that the requirements of such foreign financial regulatory system applicable to such security-based swap entity (or class thereof) or to the activities of such security-based swap entity (or class thereof) are comparable to otherwise applicable requirements, after taking into account such factors as the Commission determines are appropriate, such as the scope and objectives of the relevant foreign regulatory requirements (taking into account the applicable criteria set forth in paragraph (d) of this section), as well as the effectiveness of the supervisory compliance program administered, and the enforcement authority exercised, by a foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities in such system to support its oversight of such security-based swap entity (or class thereof) or of the activities of such security-based swap entity (or class thereof); and


(ii) Has entered into a supervisory and enforcement memorandum of understanding and/or other arrangement with the relevant foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities under such foreign financial regulatory system addressing supervisory and enforcement cooperation and other matters arising under the substituted compliance determination.


(3) *Withdrawal or modification.* The Commission may, on its own initiative, by order, modify or withdraw a substituted compliance determination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, after appropriate notice and opportunity for comment.


(b) *Reliance by security-based swap entities.* A registered security-based swap entity may satisfy the requirements described in paragraph (d) of this section by complying with corresponding law, rules and regulations under a foreign financial regulatory system, provided:


(1) The Commission has made a substituted compliance determination pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section regarding such foreign financial regulatory system providing that compliance with specified requirements under such foreign financial regulatory system by such registered security-based swap entity (or class thereof) may satisfy the corresponding requirements described in paragraph (d) of this section; and


(2) Such registered security-based swap entity satisfies any conditions set forth in a substituted compliance determination made by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


(c) *Requests for determinations.* (1) A party or group of parties that potentially would comply with specified requirements pursuant to paragraph (a)(1), or any foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities supervising such a party or its security-based swap activities, may file an application, pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 240.0-13, requesting that the Commission make a substituted compliance determination pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, with respect to one or more requirements described in paragraph (d) of this section.


(2) Such a party or group of parties may make a request under paragraph (c)(1) of this section only if:


(i) Each such party, or the party's activities, is directly supervised by the foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities with respect to the foreign regulatory requirements relating to the applicable requirements described in paragraph (d) of this section; and


(ii) Each such party provides the certification and opinion of counsel as described in § 240.15Fb2-4(c), as if the party were subject to that requirement at the time of the request.


(3) Such foreign financial authority or authorities may make a request under paragraph (c)(1) of this section only if each such authority provides adequate assurances that no law or policy of any relevant foreign jurisdiction would impede the ability of any entity that is directly supervised by the foreign financial regulatory authority and that may register with the Commission as a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant to provide prompt access to the Commission to such entity's books and records or to submit to onsite inspection or examination by the Commission.


(d) *Eligible requirements.* The Commission may make a substituted compliance determination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to permit security-based swap entities that are not U.S. persons (as defined in § 240.3a71-3(a)(4)), but not security-based swap entities that are U.S. persons, to satisfy the following requirements by complying with comparable foreign requirements:
