(2) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an OTC derivatives dealer or broker or dealer permitted to compute net capital pursuant to the alternative method of § 240.15c3-1e must also provide notice if its tentative net capital falls below the minimum amount required pursuant to § 240.15c3-1. The notice must specify the tentative net capital requirements, and current amount of net capital and tentative net capital, of the OTC derivatives dealer or the broker or dealer permitted to compute net capital pursuant to the alternative method of § 240.15c3-1e.

(c) Every broker or dealer that fails to make and keep current the books and records required by § 240.17a-3, must give notice of this fact that same day in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section, specifying the books and records which have not been made or which are not current. The broker or dealer must also transmit a report in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section within 48 hours of the notice stating what the broker or dealer has done or is doing to correct the situation.


(d) Whenever any broker or dealer discovers, or is notified by an independent public accountant under § 240.17a-12(i)(2), of the existence of any material inadequacy as defined in § 240.17a-12(h)(2), or whenever any broker or dealer discovers, or is notified by an independent public accountant under § 240.17a-5(h), of the existence of any material weakness as defined in § 240.17a-5(d)(3)(iii), the broker or dealer must:
