(*3*) All terms of the security-based swap shall conform to the product specifications of the cleared security-based swap established under the clearing agency's rules; and *Provided further,* That if a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant receives notice that a security-based swap transaction has not been accepted for clearing by a clearing agency, the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant shall be required to comply with the requirements of this section in all respects promptly after receipt of such notice.


(2) *Policies and procedures.* Each security-based swap dealer and major security-based swap participant shall establish, maintain, and follow written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant executes written security-based swap trading relationship documentation with its counterparty that complies with the requirements of this section. The policies and procedures shall be approved in writing by a senior officer of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, and a record of the approval shall be retained. Other than trade acknowledgements and verifications of security-based swap transactions under § 240.15Fi-2, the security-based swap trading relationship documentation shall be executed prior to, or contemporaneously with, executing a security-based swap with any counterparty.

(A) Alternative methods for determining the value of the security-based swap for the purposes of complying with this paragraph (b)(4) in the event of the unavailability or other failure of any input required to value the security-based swap for such purposes; or


(B) A valuation dispute resolution process by which the value of the security-based swap shall be determined for the purposes of complying with this paragraph (b)(4).


(iii) A security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant is not required to disclose to the counterparty confidential, proprietary information about any model it may use to value a security-based swap.
