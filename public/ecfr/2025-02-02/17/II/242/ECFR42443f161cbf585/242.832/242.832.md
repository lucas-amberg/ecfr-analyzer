(2) A non-U.S. person whose performance under a security-based swap is guaranteed by a U.S. person; or


(3) A non-U.S. person who, in connection with its security-based swap dealing activity, uses U.S. personnel located in a U.S. branch or office, or personnel of an agent of such non-U.S. person located in a U.S. branch or office, to arrange, negotiate, or execute a transaction.
