# § 242.901   Reporting obligations.

(a) *Assigning reporting duties.* A security-based swap, including a security-based swap that results from the allocation, termination, novation, or assignment of another security-based swap, shall be reported as follows:


(1) *Platform-executed security-based swaps that will be submitted to clearing.* If a security-based swap is executed on a platform and will be submitted to clearing, the platform on which the transaction was executed shall report to a registered security-based swap data repository the counterparty ID or the execution agent ID of each direct counterparty, as applicable, and the information set forth in paragraph (c) of this section (except that, with respect to paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the platform need indicate only if both direct counterparties are registered security-based swap dealers) and paragraphs (d)(9) and (10) of this section.


(2) *All other security-based swaps.* For all security-based swaps other than platform-executed security-based swaps that will be submitted to clearing, the reporting side shall provide the information required by §§ 242.900 through 242.909 to a registered security-based swap data repository. The reporting side shall be determined as follows:


(i) *Clearing transactions.* For a clearing transaction, the reporting side is the registered clearing agency that is a counterparty to the transaction.


(ii) *Security-based swaps other than clearing transactions.* (A) If both sides of the security-based swap include a registered security-based swap dealer, the sides shall select the reporting side.


(B) If only one side of the security-based swap includes a registered security-based swap dealer, that side shall be the reporting side.


(C) If both sides of the security-based swap include a registered major security-based swap participant, the sides shall select the reporting side.


(D) If one side of the security-based swap includes a registered major security-based swap participant and the other side includes neither a registered security-based swap dealer nor a registered major security-based swap participant, the side including the registered major security-based swap participant shall be the reporting side.


(E) If neither side of the security-based swap includes a registered security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based swap participant:


(*1*) If both sides include a U.S. person, the sides shall select the reporting side.


(*2*) If one side includes a non-U.S. person that falls within § 242.908(b)(5) or a U.S. person and the other side includes a non-U.S. person that falls within § 242.908(b)(5), the sides shall select the reporting side.


(*3*) If one side includes only non-U.S. persons that do not fall within § 242.908(b)(5) and the other side includes a non-U.S. person that falls within § 242.908(b)(5) or a U.S. person, the side including a non-U.S. person that falls within § 242.908(b)(5) or a U.S. person shall be the reporting side.


(*4*) If neither side includes a U.S. person and neither side includes a non-U.S. person that falls within § 242.908(b)(5) but the security-based swap is effected by or through a registered broker-dealer (including a registered security-based swap execution facility), the registered broker-dealer (including a registered security-based swap execution facility) shall report the counterparty ID or the execution agent ID of each direct counterparty, as applicable, and the information set forth in paragraph (c) of this section (except that, with respect to paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the registered broker-dealer (including a registered security-based swap execution facility) need indicate only if both direct counterparties are registered security-based swap dealers) and paragraphs (d)(9) and (10) of this section.


(3) *Notification to registered clearing agency.* A person who, under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section, has a duty to report a security-based swap that has been submitted to clearing at a registered clearing agency shall promptly provide that registered clearing agency with the transaction ID of the submitted security-based swap and the identity of the registered security-based swap data repository to which the transaction will be reported or has been reported.


(b) *Alternate recipient of security-based swap information.* If there is no registered security-based swap data repository that will accept the report required by § 242.901(a), the person required to make such report shall instead provide the required information to the Commission.


(c) *Primary trade information.* The reporting side shall report the following information within the timeframe specified in paragraph (j) of this section:


(1) The product ID, if available. If the security-based swap has no product ID, or if the product ID does not include the following information, the reporting side shall report:


(i) Information that identifies the security-based swap, including the asset class of the security-based swap and the specific underlying reference asset(s), reference issuer(s), or reference index;


(ii) The effective date;


(iii) The scheduled termination date;


(iv) The terms of any standardized fixed or floating rate payments, and the frequency of any such payments; and


(v) If the security-based swap is customized to the extent that the information provided in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section does not provide all of the material information necessary to identify such customized security-based swap or does not contain the data elements necessary to calculate the price, a flag to that effect;


(2) The date and time, to the second, of execution, expressed using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC);


(3) The price, including the currency in which the price is expressed and the amount(s) and currenc(ies) of any up-front payments;


(4) The notional amount(s) and the currenc(ies) in which the notional amount(s) is expressed;


(5) If both sides of the security-based swap include a registered security-based swap dealer, an indication to that effect;

(7) If applicable, any flags pertaining to the transaction that are specified in the policies and procedures of the registered security-based swap data repository to which the transaction will be reported.


(d) *Secondary trade information.* In addition to the information required under paragraph (c) of this section, for each security-based swap for which it is the reporting side, the reporting side shall report the following information within the timeframe specified in paragraph (j) of this section:


(1) The counterparty ID or the execution agent ID of each counterparty, as applicable;


(2) As applicable, the branch ID, broker ID, execution agent ID, trader ID, and trading desk ID of the direct counterparty on the reporting side;


(3) To the extent not provided pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the terms of any fixed or floating rate payments, or otherwise customized or non-standard payment streams, including the frequency and contingencies of any such payments;


(4) For a security-based swap that is not a clearing transaction and that will not be allocated after execution, the title and date of any master agreement, collateral agreement, margin agreement, or any other agreement incorporated by reference into the security-based swap contract;


(5) To the extent not provided pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section or other provisions of this paragraph (d), any additional data elements included in the agreement between the counterparties that are necessary for a person to determine the market value of the transaction;


(6) If applicable, and to the extent not provided pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the name of the clearing agency to which the security-based swap will be submitted for clearing;


(7) If the direct counterparties do not intend to submit the security-based swap to clearing, whether they have invoked the exception in Section 3C(g) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c-3(g));


(8) To the extent not provided pursuant to the other provisions of this paragraph (d), if the direct counterparties do not submit the security-based swap to clearing, a description of the settlement terms, including whether the security-based swap is cash-settled or physically settled, and the method for determining the settlement value;


(9) The platform ID, if applicable, or if a registered broker-dealer (including a registered security-based swap execution facility) is required to report the security-based swap by § 242.901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(*4*), the broker ID of that registered broker-dealer (including a registered security-based swap execution facility); and


(10) If the security-based swap arises from the allocation, termination, novation, or assignment of one or more existing security-based swaps, the transaction ID of the allocated, terminated, assigned, or novated security-based swap(s), except in the case of a clearing transaction that results from the netting or compression of other clearing transactions.


(e) *Reporting of life cycle events.* (1)(i) *Generally.* A life cycle event, and any adjustment due to a life cycle event, that results in a change to information previously reported pursuant to paragraph (c), (d), or (i) of this section shall be reported by the reporting side, except that the reporting side shall not report whether or not a security-based swap has been accepted for clearing.


(ii) *Acceptance for clearing.* A registered clearing agency shall report whether or not it has accepted a security-based swap for clearing.


(2) All reports of life cycle events and adjustments due to life cycle events shall, within the timeframe specified in paragraph (j) of this section, be reported to the entity to which the original security-based swap transaction will be reported or has been reported and shall include the transaction ID of the original transaction.

(i) *Reporting of pre-enactment and transitional security-based swaps.* With respect to any pre-enactment security-based swap or transitional security-based swap in a particular asset class, and to the extent that information about such transaction is available, the reporting side shall report all of the information required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section to a registered security-based swap data repository that accepts security-based swaps in that asset class and indicate whether the security-based swap was open as of the date of such report.


(j) *Interim timeframe for reporting.* The reporting timeframe for paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section shall be 24 hours after the time of execution (or acceptance for clearing in the case of a security-based swap that is subject to regulatory reporting and public dissemination solely by operation of § 242.908(a)(1)(ii)), or, if 24 hours after the time of execution or acceptance, as applicable, would fall on a day that is not a business day, by the same time on the next day that is a business day.
