(A) The company has reasonable procedures in place to ensure that the specified materials are available in the manner required by paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (v) of this section; and


(B) The company takes prompt action to ensure that the specified materials become available in the manner required by paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (v) of this section, as soon as practicable following the earlier of the time at which it knows or reasonably should have known that the materials are not available in the manner required by paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (v) of this section.

(ii) [Reserved]


(d) Each report shall be transmitted within 60 days after the close of the period for which such report is being made.


(e) The period of time within which any report prescribed by this rule shall be transmitted may be extended by the Commission upon written request showing good cause therefor. Section 270.0-5 shall not apply to such requests.


(f)(1) A company will be considered to have transmitted a report to shareholders who share an address if:


(i) The company transmits a report to the shared address;


(ii) The company addresses the report to the shareholders as a group (for example, “ABC Fund [or Corporation] Shareholders,” “Jane Doe and Household,” “The Smith Family”) or to each of the shareholders individually (for example, “John Doe and Richard Jones”); and


(iii) The shareholders consent in writing to delivery of one report.


(2) The company need not obtain written consent from a shareholder under paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section if all of the following conditions are met:


(i) The shareholder has the same last name as the other shareholders, or the company reasonably believes that the shareholders are members of the same family;


(ii) The company has transmitted a notice to the shareholder at least 60 days before the company begins to rely on this section concerning transmission of reports to that shareholder. The notice must be a separate written statement and:


(A) State that only one report will be delivered to the shared address unless the company receives contrary instructions;


(B) Include a toll-free telephone number or be accompanied by a reply form that is pre-addressed with postage provided, that the shareholder can use to notify the company that he or she wishes to receive a separate report;

(F) Contain the following prominent statement, or similar clear and understandable statement, in bold-face type: “Important Notice Regarding Delivery of Shareholder Materials”. This statement also must appear on the envelope in which the notice is delivered. Alternatively, if the notice is delivered separately from other communications to investors, this statement may appear either on the notice or on the envelope in which the notice is delivered;


(iii) The company has not received the reply form or other notification indicating that the shareholder wishes to continue to receive an individual copy of the report, within 60 days after the company sent the notice; and


(iv) The company transmits the report to a post office box or to a residential street address. The company can assume a street address is a residence unless it has information that indicates it is a business.


(3) At least once a year, the company must explain to shareholders who have consented under paragraph (f)(1)(iii) or paragraph (f)(2) of this section how they can revoke their consent. The explanation must be reasonably designed to reach these investors. If a shareholder, orally or in writing, revokes consent to delivery of one report to a shared address, the company must begin sending individual copies to that shareholder within 30 days after the company receives the revocation.


(4) For purposes of this section, *address* means a street address, a post office box number, an electronic mail address, a facsimile telephone number, or other similar destination to which paper or electronic documents are transmitted, unless otherwise provided in this section. If the company has reason to believe that the address is a street address of a multi-unit building, the address must include the unit number.
