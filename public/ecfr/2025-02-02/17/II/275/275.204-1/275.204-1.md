# § 275.204-1   Amendments to Form ADV.

(a) *When amendment is required.* You must amend your Form ADV (17 CFR 279.1):


(1) Parts 1 and 2:


(i) At least annually, within 90 days of the end of your fiscal year; and


(ii) More frequently, if required by the instructions to Form ADV.


(2) Part 3 at the frequency required by the instructions to Form ADV.


(b) *Electronic filing of amendments.* (1) Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, you must file all amendments to Part 1A, Part 2A, and Part 3 of Form ADV electronically with the IARD, unless you have received a continuing hardship exemption under § 275.203-3. You are not required to file with the Commission amendments to brochure supplements required by Part 2B of Form ADV.


(2) If you have received a continuing hardship exemption under § 275.203-3, you must, when you are required to amend your Form ADV, file a completed Part 1A, Part 2A and Part 3 of Form ADV on paper with the SEC by mailing it to FINRA.


(c) *Filing fees.* You must pay FINRA (the operator of the IARD) an initial filing fee when you first electronically file Part 1A of Form ADV. After you pay the initial filing fee, you must pay an annual filing fee each time you file your annual updating amendment. No portion of either fee is refundable. The Commission has approved the filing fees. Your amended Form ADV will not be accepted by FINRA, and thus will not be considered filed with the Commission, until you have paid the filing fee.


(d) *Amendments to Form ADV are reports.* Each amendment required to be filed under this section is a “report” within the meaning of sections 204 and 207 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80b-4 and 80b-7). 


(e) *Transition to Filing Form CRS.* If you are registered with the Commission or have an application for registration pending with the Commission prior to June 30, 2020, you must amend your Form ADV by electronically filing with IARD your initial Form CRS that satisfies the requirements of Part 3 of Form ADV (as amended effective September 30, 2019) beginning on May 1, 2020 and by no later than June 30, 2020.
