# ยง 300.305   Excluded contracts.

Notwithstanding the fact that an open contractual commitment described in ยง 300.300(c) meets the requirements of ยง 300.301 and the other requirements of these rules, a court shall not be precluded from canceling such commitment, awarding damages, or granting such other remedy as it shall deem fair and equitable if, on application of the trustee or SIPC, it determines that such commitment was not entered into in the ordinary course of business or was entered into by the debtor, or the broker or dealer or his customer, for the purposes of creating a commitment in contemplation of a liquidation proceeding under the Act. Such a determination shall be made after notice and opportunity for hearing by the debtor, such broker or dealer, or such customer, and may be made before or after the delivery of securities or payment of the contract price or before or after any buy-in or sell-out of the open contractual commitment, or otherwise.
