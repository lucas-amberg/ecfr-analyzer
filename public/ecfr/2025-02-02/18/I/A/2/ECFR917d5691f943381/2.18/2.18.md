# ยง 2.18   Phased electric rate increase filings.

(a) In general, when a public utility files a phased rate increase, the Commission will determine the appropriate suspension period based on the total increase requested in all phases. If a utility files a rate increase within sixty days after filing another rate increase, the Commission will consider the filings together to be a phased rate increase request.


(b) This policy will not be applied if the increase is phased:


(1) To coordinate with new facilities coming on line;


(2) To implement a rate moderation plan;


(3) To avoid price squeeze;


(4) To comply with a settlement approved by the Commission; or


(5) If the utility makes a convincing showing that application of the policy would be harsh and inequitable and that, therefore, good cause has been shown not to apply the policy in the case.
