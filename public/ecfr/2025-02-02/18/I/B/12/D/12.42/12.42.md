# ยง 12.42   Preliminary reports.

At least 30 days prior to the performance of a periodic inspection or comprehensive assessment, a preliminary report prepared by the independent consultant team must be filed by the licensee with the Regional Engineer to document the initial findings, understanding, and preparation of the independent consultant team.


(a) For any periodic inspection, the 30-day period is measured from the scheduled date of the physical field inspection.


(b) For any comprehensive assessment, the 30-day period is measured from the scheduled date of the physical field inspection, potential failure mode analysis, or risk analysis, whichever occurs first.


(c) If the Regional Engineer determines that the preliminary report does not clearly demonstrate that the independent consultant team is adequately prepared for the inspection, the Regional Engineer may require the inspection to be postponed. Any such postponement shall not constitute good cause for an extension of time under ยง 12.40(d).


(d) If any required supporting team member information was not provided with the independent consultant team proposal required by ยง 12.34(b), it must be provided with the preliminary report.
