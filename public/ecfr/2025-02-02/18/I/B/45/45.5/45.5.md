(a) *Required by Commission.* Applicants under this part shall upon request of the Commission and within such time as may be allowed, supplement any application or any supplemental application with any information required by the Commission. 


(b) *Notice of changes.* In the event of the applicant's resignation, withdrawal, or failure of reelection or appointment in respect to any of the positions for which authorization has been granted by the Commission, or in the event of any other material or substantial change therein, the applicant shall, within 60 days after any such change occurs, give notice thereof to the Commission setting forth the position, corporation, and date of termination therewith, or other material or substantial change.
