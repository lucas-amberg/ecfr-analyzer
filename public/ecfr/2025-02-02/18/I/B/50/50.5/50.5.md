(d) *Director's notice.* (1) When the Director finds that an applicant seeking authority to site and construct an electric transmission facility has adequately addressed the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, and any other requirements determined at the Initial Consultation meeting, the Director will so notify the applicant.

(ii) Expert witness testimony and other relevant information submitted with the State siting application(s), where applicable.


(8) Within 30 days, file the full reports of the System Impact Study for the proposed project if the reports are already completed. If the reports are not already completed at this time, the applicant must alternatively submit a status report that includes when during the pre-filing process the full reports will be submitted.


(9) Within 30 days of submission of the full System Impact Study reports, file a draft Exhibit H—System analysis data required in § 50.7. The pre-filing process will not be concluded until all submittals required in paragraphs (e)(8) and (9) of this section are submitted.
