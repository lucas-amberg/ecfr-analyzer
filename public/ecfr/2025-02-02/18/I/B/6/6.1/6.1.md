# ยง 6.1   Application for surrender.

(a) Every application for surrender of a license shall state the reason therefor; and, except in the case of an application for surrender of a license for a minor project, or for a transmission line only, shall be executed by the licensee and filed in the same form and manner as the application for license, and shall be accompanied by the license and all amendments thereof. Public notice of such application shall be given at least 30 days prior to action upon the application.


(b) For any surrender that requires certification under section 401(a)(1) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act), a certifying authority is deemed to have waived the certification requirements of section 401(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act if the certifying authority has not denied, expressly waived, or granted certification by one year after the date the certifying authority received a written request for certification.
