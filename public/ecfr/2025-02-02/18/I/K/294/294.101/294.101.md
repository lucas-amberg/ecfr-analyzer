(ii) It will report any modifications to its contingency plans for accommodating shortages within 15 days to:

(4) An estimate of the effects (reduced power and energy usage) of use of these procedures upon the utility's wholesale and retail customers; and 


(5) The name, title, address and telephone number of an officer or employee of the utility who may be contacted for further information regarding the shortage and planned actions of the utility.


(d) *Reports to other government entities.* Any report filed with another governmental entity that contains the information that must be reported under this part may be filed to comply with this part.
