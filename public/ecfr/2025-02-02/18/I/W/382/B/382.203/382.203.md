# ยง 382.203   Annual charges under the Interstate Commerce Act.

(a) The adjusted costs of administration of the oil regulatory program will be assessed against each oil pipeline company based on the proportion of the total operation revenues of each oil pipeline company for the immediately preceding calendar year to the sum of the operating revenues for the immediately preceding calendar year of all oil pipeline companies being assessed annual charges. 


(b) No oil pipeline company's annual charge may exceed a maximum charge established each year by the Commission to equal 6.339 percent of the adjusted costs of administration of the oil regulatory program. The maximum charge will be rounded to the nearest $1000. For every company with an annual charge determined to be above the maximum charge, that company's annual charge will be set at the maximum charge, and any amount above the maximum charge will be reapportioned to the remaining companies. The reapportionment will be computed using the method outlined in paragraph (a) of this section (but excluding any company whose annual charge is already set at the maximum amount). This procedure will be repeated until no company's annual charge exceeds the maximum charge.
