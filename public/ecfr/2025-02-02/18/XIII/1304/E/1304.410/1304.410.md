# § 1304.410   Navigation restrictions.

(a) Except for the placement of riprap along the shoreline, structures, land based or water use, shall not be located within the limits of safety harbors and landings established for commercial navigation. 


(b) Structures shall not be located in such a way as to block the visibility of navigation aids. Examples of navigation aids are lights, dayboards, and directional signs. 


(c) The establishment of “no-wake” zones outside approved harbor limits is prohibited at marinas or community dock facilities that are adjacent to or near a commercial navigation channel. In such circumstances, facility owners may, upon approval from TVA, install a floating breakwater along the harbor limit to reduce wave and wash action.
