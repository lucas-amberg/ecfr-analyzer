# ยง 1314.4   Law governing the rights and obligations of TVA and Reserve Banks; law governing the rights of any Person against TVA and Reserve Banks; law governing other interests.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the following rights and obligations are governed solely by the book-entry regulations contained in this part 1314, the Securities Documentation (but not including any choice of law provisions in such documentation), and Reserve Bank Operating Circulars:


(1) The rights and obligations of TVA and Reserve Banks with respect to:


(i) A Book-entry TVA Power Security or Security Entitlement; and


(ii) The operation of the Book-entry System as it applies to TVA Power Securities; and


(2) The rights of any Person, including a Participant, against TVA and Reserve Banks with respect to:


(i) A Book-entry TVA Power Security or Security Entitlement; and


(ii) The operation of the Book-entry System as it applies to TVA Power Securities.


(b) A security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Reserve Bank from a Participant and that is not recorded on the books of a Reserve Bank pursuant to ยง 1314.5(c) is governed by the law (not including the conflict-of-law rules) of the jurisdiction where the head office of the Reserve Bank maintaining the Participant's Security Account is located. A security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Reserve Bank from a Person that is not a Participant, and that is not recorded on the books of a Reserve Bank pursuant to ยง 1314.5(c), is governed by the law determined in the manner specified in paragraph (d) of this section.


(c) If the jurisdiction specified in the first sentence of paragraph (b) of this section is a State that has not adopted Revised Article 8, then the law specified in paragraph (b) of this section shall be the law of that State as though Revised Article 8 had been adopted by that State.


(d) To the extent not otherwise inconsistent with this part 1314, and notwithstanding any provision in the Securities Documentation setting forth a choice of law, the provisions set forth in 31 CFR 357.11 regarding law governing other interests apply and should be read as though modified to effectuate the application of 31 CFR 357.11 to Book-entry TVA Power Securities.
