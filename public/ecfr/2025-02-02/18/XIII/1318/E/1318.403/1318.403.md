# ยง 1318.403   DEIS preparation, transmittal, and review.

(a) Based on information obtained and decisions made during the scoping process, the NEPA compliance staff, in cooperation with the initiating TVA entity and other interested TVA entities, will prepare the preliminary DEIS using an appropriate format (see 40 CFR 1502.10).


(b) During preparation of the DEIS, the NEPA compliance staff will involve any cooperating agencies to obtain their input. If a cooperating agency's analysis of an environmental issue or impact differs from TVA's, those differences should be resolved before the DEIS is released for public comment or the cooperating agency's position should be set forth and addressed in the DEIS.


(c) After approval of the DEIS by the official responsible for NEPA compliance, the senior manager of the initiating TVA entity, and TVA legal counsel, the NEPA compliance staff will make the DEIS available to the public; other interested Federal, State, and local agencies; and other entities and individuals who have expressed an interest in the type of action or commented on the scope of the EIS. The NEPA compliance staff will then file the DEIS with EPA for publication of its notice of availability in the _Federal Register_.


(d) TVA will make the DEIS available on its public website and provide it by other means upon request.


(e) A minimum of 45 days from the date of publication of the notice of availability in the _Federal Register_ must be provided for public comment. TVA may extend the public comment period in its discretion.


(f) Materials to be made available to the public should be provided to the public without charge to the extent practicable.
