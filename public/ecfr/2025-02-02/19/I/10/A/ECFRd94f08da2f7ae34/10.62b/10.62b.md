# § 10.62b   Aircraft turbine fuel.

(a) *General.* Unless otherwise provided, aircraft turbine fuel withdrawn from a Customs bonded warehouse for use under section 309, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1309), may be commingled with domestic or other aircraft turbine fuel after such withdrawal only if such commingling is approved by the appropriate Customs official for the port where the commingling occurs. The appropriate Customs official may approve such commingling if the fueling system in which the commingling will occur contains adequate physical safeguards to prevent the possible unauthorized entry into the Customs territory of the bonded fuel. Such commingled fuel must be accounted for in the same 24-hour period in which it was commingled and must be—


(1) Exported within that 24-hour period;


(2) Used under section 309 within that 24-hour period; or


(3) Entered or withdrawn for consumption, with duty deposited, as required under the applicable regulations (see part 144 of this chapter).


(b) *Duty-free withdrawal from warehouse of aircraft turbine fuel under section 557(a), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1557(a)).* Turbine fuel intended for use as supplies on aircraft under section 309, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and withdrawn from a Customs bonded warehouse shall be entitled to the privileges provided for in section 309 if an amount equal to or exceeding the quantity of such fuel is established, as provided for in paragraph (c) of this section, to have been used on aircraft qualifying for the privileges provided for in section 309 within 30 days after the withdrawal of the fuel from the Customs bonded warehouse. Withdrawal of aircraft turbine fuel under this paragraph shall be in accordance with the procedures in §§ 10.59 through 10.64, unless otherwise provided in this section. Withdrawals under this paragraph shall be annotated with the term “Withdrawal under 19 CFR 10.62b(b)”.


(c) *Establishment of use of fuel by qualifying aircraft.* (1) The person withdrawing aircraft turbine fuel under paragraph (b) of this section must establish that an aircraft qualifying for the privileges provided for in section 309, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, used fuel in an amount equal to or exceeding the quantity of the fuel withdrawn that is not entered and upon which duties are not paid by submitting to Customs, at the port where the bonded warehouse entry was filed, within the time provided in paragraph (d) of this section, either—


(i) Records prepared in the normal course of business effecting the transfer to identified (*e.g.,* by aircraft company name, flight number, flight origin and destination, and date of flight) aircraft of fuel in an amount equal to or exceeding the quantity of the fuel withdrawn which is not entered and on which duties are not paid and objective evidence that the aircraft to which the fuel was transferred were actually used in trade qualifying for the privileges provided in section 309, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended; or


(ii) A certification (documentary or electronic) that:


(A) All of the fuel withdrawn was intended for use on aircraft entitled to the privileges provided for in section 309;


(B) Within 30 days of the date of withdrawal from warehouse, an amount of fuel equal to or exceeding the quantity of the fuel withdrawn which is not entered and on which duties are not paid was transferred as supplies to aircraft entitled to the privileges provided for in section 309;


(C) All of the aircraft into which fuel is loaded hereunder were used in a trade provided for in section 309; and


(D) The person making the certification possesses evidence (documentary or electronic) available for Customs inspection at a named place which supports each of the above statements.


(2) Upon request by Customs, the person who submits the certification provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall promptly provide the evidence required to support the claim for treatment under this section (including the records described in § 10.62b(c)(1)(i)) and §§ 10.62 and 19.6(d) and each of the statements in the certification.


(d) *Time for establishment of use of fuel by qualifying aircraft.* The person withdrawing aircraft turbine fuel under paragraph (b) of this section shall submit the records or certification provided for in paragraph (c) of this section by the 40th day after the date of withdrawal of the fuel unless the fuel was withdrawn under a blanket withdrawal under paragraph (g) of this section. If the fuel was withdrawn under a blanket withdrawal, the person withdrawing aircraft turbine fuel under this section shall submit the records or certification provided for in paragraph (c) of this section by the 40th day after all of the fuel covered by the blanket permit to withdraw has been withdrawn.


(e) *Treatment of turbine fuel withdrawn but not used on qualifying aircraft within 30 days.* If turbine fuel is withdrawn from a Customs bonded warehouse under paragraph (b) of this section but fuel in an amount less than the quantity withdrawn is established to have been used within 30 days of the date of withdrawal from warehouse on aircraft qualifying for the privileges provided for in section 309, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, a withdrawal for consumption shall be filed and duties shall be deposited for the excess of fuel so withdrawn over that used on aircraft so qualifying. Such withdrawal shall be filed and such duties shall be deposited by the 40th day after the date of withdrawal of the fuel in accordance with the procedures in § 144.38 of this chapter. Interest shall be payable and deposited with such duties, calculated from the date of withdrawal at the rate of interest established under 26 U.S.C. 6621.


(f) *Liquidated damages.* Failure to account for turbine fuel withdrawn under paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section shall result in liquidated damages against the person withdrawing the turbine fuel, as provided for under § 113.62 of this chapter.
