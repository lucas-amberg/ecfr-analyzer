# § 10.176   Country of origin criteria.

(a) *Merchandise produced in a beneficiary developing country or any two or more countries which are members of the same association of countries*—(1) *General.* Except as otherwise provided in this section, any article which either is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of, or is a new or different article of commerce that has been grown, produced, or manufactured in, a beneficiary developing country may qualify for duty-free entry under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). No article will be considered to have been grown, produced, or manufactured in a beneficiary developing country by virtue of having merely undergone simple (as opposed to complex or meaningful) combining or packaging operations or mere dilution with water or mere dilution with another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the article. Duty-free entry under the GSP may be accorded to an article only if the sum of the cost or value of the materials produced in the beneficiary developing country or any two or more countries that are members of the same association of countries and are treated as one country under section 507(2) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2467(2)), plus the direct costs of processing operations performed in the beneficiary developing country or member countries, is not less than 35 percent of the appraised value of the article at the time it is entered. 


(2) *Combining, packaging, and diluting operations.* No article which has undergone only a simple combining or packaging operation or a mere dilution in a beneficiary developing country within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be entitled to duty-free treatment even though the processing operation causes the article to meet the value requirement set forth in that paragraph. For purposes of this section: 


(i) Simple combining or packaging operations and mere dilution include, but are not limited to, the following: 


(A) The addition of batteries to devices; 


(B) Fitting together a small number of components by bolting, glueing, soldering, etc.; 


(C) Blending foreign and beneficiary developing country tobacco; 


(D) The addition of substances such as anticaking agents, preservatives, wetting agents, etc.; 


(E) Repacking or packaging components together; 


(F) Reconstituting orange juice by adding water to orange juice concentrate; and


(G) Diluting chemicals with inert ingredients to bring them to standard degrees of strength; 


(ii) Simple combining or packaging operations and mere dilution will not be taken to include processes such as the following: 


(A) The assembly of a large number of discrete components onto a printed circuit board; 


(B) The mixing together of two bulk medicinal substances followed by the packaging of the mixed product into individual doses for retail sale; 


(C) The addition of water or another substance to a chemical compound under pressure which results in a reaction creating a new chemical compound; and


(D) A simple combining or packaging operation or mere dilution coupled with any other type of processing such as testing or fabrication (for example, a simple assembly of a small number of components, one of which was fabricated in the beneficiary developing country where the assembly took place); and


(iii) The fact that an article has undergone more than a simple combining or packaging operation or mere dilution is not necessarily dispositive of the question of whether that processing constitutes a substantial transformation for purposes of determining the country of origin of the article. 


(b) [Reserved]


(c) *Merchandise grown, produced, or manufactured in a beneficiary developing country.* Merchandise which is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary developing country, or an association of countries treated as one country under section 507(2) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2467(2)) and § 10.171(b), and manufactured products consisting of materials produced only in such country or countries, shall normally be presumed to meet the requirements set forth in this section.
