# § 10.301   Scope and applicability.

The provisions of §§ 10.302 through 10.311 of this part relate to the procedures for obtaining duty preferences on imported goods under the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement (the Agreement) entered into on January 2, 1988, and the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1988 (102 Stat. 1851). The United States and Canada agreed to suspend operation of the Agreement with effect from January 1, 1994, to coincide with the entry into force of the North American Free Trade Agreement (see part 181 of this chapter) and, accordingly, the provisions of §§ 10.302 through 10.311 of this part apply only to goods imported from Canada that were entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, during the period January 1, 1989, through December 31, 1993. In situations involving goods subject to bilateral restrictions or prohibitions, or country of origin marking, other criteria for determining origin may be applicable pursuant to Article 407 of the Agreement.
