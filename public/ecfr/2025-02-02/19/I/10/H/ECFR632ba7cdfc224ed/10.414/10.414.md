# ยง 10.414   Certification or other information not required.

(a) *General.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an importer will not be required to submit a certification or other information demonstrating that the good qualifies as originating under ยง 10.411(a) of this subpart for:


(1) A non-commercial importation of a good; or


(2) A commercial importation of a good whose value does not exceed U.S. $2,500, or the equivalent amount in Chilean currency.


(b) *Exception.* If the Center director determines that an importation described in paragraph (a) of this section may reasonably be considered to have been carried out or planned for the purpose of evading compliance with the rules and procedures governing claims for preference under the US-CFTA, the Center director will notify the importer in writing that for that importation the importer must submit to CBP a valid certification or other information demonstrating that the good qualifies as originating. The importer must submit such a certification or other information within 30 calendar days from the date of the written notice. Failure to timely submit the certification or other information will result in denial of the claim for preferential tariff treatment.
