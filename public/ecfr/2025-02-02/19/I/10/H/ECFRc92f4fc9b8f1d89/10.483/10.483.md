# § 10.483   Framework for correcting declarations and certifications.

(a) *“Voluntarily” defined.* For purposes of this subpart, the making of a corrected declaration or the providing of written notification of an incorrect certification will be deemed to have been done voluntarily if:


(1) Done before the commencement of a formal investigation; or


(2) Done before any of the events specified in § 162.74(i) of this chapter have occurred; or


(3) Done within 30 calendar days after either the U.S. importer, exporter or producer had reason to believe that the declaration or certification was not correct; and is


(4) Accompanied by a written statement setting forth the information specified in paragraph (c) of this section; and


(5) In the case of a corrected declaration, accompanied or followed by a tender of any actual loss of duties and merchandise processing fees, if applicable, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.


(b) *Cases involving fraud.* Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a person who acted fraudulently in making an incorrect declaration or certification may not make a voluntary correction. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “fraud” will have the meaning set forth in paragraph (B)(3) of appendix B to part 171 of this chapter.


(c) *Statement.* For purposes of this subpart, each corrected declaration or notification of an incorrect certification must be accompanied by a statement, submitted in writing or via an authorized electronic data interchange system, which:


(1) Identifies the class or kind of good to which the incorrect declaration or certification relates;


(2) In the case of a corrected declaration, identifies each affected import transaction, including each port of importation and the approximate date of each importation, and in the case of a notification of an incorrect certification, identifies each affected exportation transaction, including each port of exportation and the approximate date of each exportation. A U.S. producer who provides written notification that certain information in a certification of origin is incorrect and who is unable to identify the specific export transactions under this paragraph must provide as much information concerning those transactions as the producer, by the exercise of good faith and due diligence, is able to obtain;


(3) Specifies the nature of the incorrect statements or omissions regarding the declaration or certification; and


(4) Sets forth, to the best of the person's knowledge, the true and accurate information or data which should have been covered by or provided in the declaration or certification, and states that the person will provide any additional pertinent information or data which is unknown at the time of making the corrected declaration or certification within 30 calendar days or within any extension of that 30-day period as CBP may permit in order for the person to obtain the information or data.


(d) *Substantial compliance.* For purposes of this section, a person will be deemed to have voluntarily corrected a declaration or certification even though that person provides corrected information in a manner which does not conform to the requirements of the written statement specified in paragraph (c) of this section, provided that:


(1) CBP is satisfied that the information was provided before the commencement of a formal investigation; and


(2) The information provided includes, orally or in writing, substantially the same information as that specified in paragraph (c) of this section.


(e) *Tender of actual loss of duties.* A U.S. importer who makes a corrected declaration must tender any actual loss of duties at the time of making the corrected declaration, or within 30 calendar days thereafter, or within any extension of that 30-day period as CBP may allow in order for the importer to obtain the information or data necessary to calculate the duties owed.


(f) *Applicability of prior disclosure provisions.* Where a person fails to meet the requirements of this section because the correction of the declaration or the written notification of an incorrect certification is not considered to be done voluntarily as provided in this section, that person may nevertheless qualify for prior disclosure treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1592(c)(4) and § 162.74 of this chapter.
