(2) In the case of a material acquired by the producer in the territory where the good is produced, except for a material to which paragraph (a)(3) of this section applies, the adjusted value of the material with reasonable modifications to the provisions of the Customs Valuation Agreement so as to permit their application to the domestic acquisition by the producer. Such reasonable modifications include, but are not limited to, treating a domestic purchase by the producer as if it were a sale for export to the country of importation; or


(3) In the case of a self-produced material, or in a case in which the relationship between the producer of the good and the seller of the material influenced the price actually paid or payable for the material, including a material obtained without charge, the sum of:

(ii) A reasonable amount for profit.

(ii) Duties, taxes, and customs brokerage fees on the material paid in the territory of one or both of the Parties, other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable or otherwise recoverable, including credit against duty or tax paid or payable; and


(iii) The cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the production of the good, less the value of renewable scrap or by-product; and


(2) *Deductions from non-originating materials.* For non-originating materials, if included under paragraph (a) of this section, the following expenses may be deducted from the value of the non-originating material:


(i) The costs of freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the material to the location of the producer;

(iii) The cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the production of the good, less the value of renewable scrap or by-products;


(iv) The cost of processing incurred in the territory of Singapore or the United States in the production of the non-originating material; and


(v) The cost of originating materials used in the production of the non-originating material in the territory of Singapore or the United States.
