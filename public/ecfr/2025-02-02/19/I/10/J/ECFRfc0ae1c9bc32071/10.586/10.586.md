# § 10.586   Certification not required.

(a) *General.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an importer will not be required to submit a copy of a certification under § 10.584 of this subpart for:


(1) A non-commercial importation of a good; or


(2) A commercial importation for which the value of the originating goods does not exceed U.S. $2,500.


(b) *Exception.* If the Center director determines that an importation described in paragraph (a) of this section is part of a series of importations carried out or planned for the purpose of evading compliance with the certification requirements of § 10.584 of this subpart, the Center director will notify the importer that for that importation the importer must submit to CBP a copy of the certification. The importer must submit such a copy within 30 days from the date of the notice. Failure to timely submit a copy of the certification will result in denial of the claim for preferential tariff treatment.
