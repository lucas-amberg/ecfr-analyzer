(a) *General.* A good described in § 10.709(a)(1)(ii) may be eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the US-JFTA only if the sum of the cost or value of the materials produced in Jordan, plus the direct costs of processing operations performed in Jordan, is not less than 35 percent of the appraised value of the good at the time it is entered.


(b) *Materials produced in the United States.* For purposes of determining the percentage referred to paragraph (a) of this section, an amount not to exceed 15 percent of the appraised value of the good at the time it is entered may be attributed to the cost or value of materials produced in the customs territory of the United States.

(2) Subject to the exceptions specified in § 10.709(b) of this subpart, substantially transformed in the United States into a new and different article of commerce that has a new name, character, or use, which is then used in Jordan in the production or manufacture of a new or different article of commerce that is imported into the United States. Except where the context otherwise requires, the examples set forth in § 10.196(a) of this part will apply for purposes of this paragraph.

(D) Taxes and/or duties imposed on the materials by a Party, provided they are not remitted upon exportation.


(ii) Where a material is provided to the manufacturer without charge, or at less than fair market value, its cost or value will be determined by computing the sum of:


(A) All expenses incurred in the growth, production, or manufacture of the material, including general expenses;


(B) An amount for profit; and


(C) Freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the material to the manufacturer's plant.
