# ยง 10.706   Declaration not required.

(a) *General.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an importer will not be required to submit a declaration under ยง 10.704 of this subpart for:


(1) A non-commercial importation of a good; or


(2) A commercial importation for which the value of the goods does not exceed U.S. $2,500.


(b) *Exception.* If the Center director determines that an importation described in paragraph (a) of this section may reasonably be considered to have been carried out or planned for the purpose of evading compliance with the rules and procedures governing claims for preference under the US-JFTA, the Center director will notify the importer that for that importation the importer must submit to CBP a declaration. The importer must submit such a declaration within 30 days from the date of the notice. Failure to timely submit the declaration will result in denial of the claim for preferential tariff treatment.
