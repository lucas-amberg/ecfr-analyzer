# § 10.725   Importer obligations.

(a) *General.* An importer who makes a claim under § 10.723(a) of this subpart:


(1) Is responsible for the truthfulness of the claim and of all the information and data contained in the supporting statement provided for in § 10.724 of this subpart; and


(2) Is responsible for submitting any supporting documents requested by CBP and for the truthfulness of the information contained in those documents. If CBP requests the submission of supporting documents, CBP will allow for the direct submission by the exporter or producer of business confidential or other sensitive information, including cost and sourcing information.


(b) *Information provided by exporter or producer.* The fact that the importer has made a claim or submitted a supporting statement based on information provided by an exporter or producer will not relieve the importer of the responsibility referred to in the first sentence of paragraph (a) of this section.


(c) *Exemption from penalties.* An importer will not be subject to civil or administrative penalties under 19 U.S.C. 1592 for making an invalid claim for preferential tariff treatment or submitting an incorrect supporting statement, provided that the importer promptly and voluntarily corrects the claim or supporting statement and pays any duty owing pursuant to §§ 10.746 and 10.747 of this subpart.
