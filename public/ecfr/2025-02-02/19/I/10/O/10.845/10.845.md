# § 10.845   Retroactive application of duty-free treatment for certain apparel articles.

(a) *General.* Notwithstanding 19 U.S.C. 1514 or any other provision of law, if apparel articles, as described in § 10.843(a) of this subpart, of a producer or entity controlling production are ineligible for duty-free treatment in an applicable one-year period because the apparel articles of the producer or entity controlling production did not meet the requirements of § 10.843(a) of this subpart or the applicable value-content requirement set forth in § 10.844(a) of this subpart, and the apparel articles of the producer or entity controlling production satisfy the increased value-content percentage set forth in § 10.844(a)(4)(iii) of this subpart in that same applicable one-year period, the entry of any such articles made during that applicable one-year period will be liquidated or reliquidated free of duty, and CBP will refund any customs duties paid with respect to such entry, with interest accrued from the date of entry, provided that the conditions and requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section are met.


(b) *Conditions and requirements.* The conditions and requirements referred to in paragraph (a) of this section are as follows:


(1) The articles in such entry would have received duty-free treatment if they had satisfied the requirements of § 10.843(a) and the applicable value-content requirement set forth in § 10.844(a) of this subpart;


(2) A declaration of compliance with the increased value-content percentage is submitted to CBP within 30 days following the end of the applicable one-year period during which the increased percentage is met (*see* § 10.844(a)(4)(v) of this subpart); and


(3) A request for liquidation or reliquidation with respect to such entry is filed with CBP before the 90th day after CBP determines and notifies the importer that the apparel articles of the producer or entity controlling production satisfy the increased value-content percentage set forth in § 10.844(a)(4)(iii) of this subpart during that applicable one-year period.
