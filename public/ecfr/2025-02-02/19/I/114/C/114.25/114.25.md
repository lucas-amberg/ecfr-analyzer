In the case of destruction, loss, or theft of an A.T.A. or TECRO/AIT carnet while the goods which it covers are in the Customs territory of the United States, the director of the port where such goods were imported may, upon request of the association which issued the carnet abroad, accept a replacement document, the validity of which expires on the same date as that of the carnet which it replaces, provided the port director determines that the description of merchandise in the replacement document fully corresponds to the description set forth in the importation voucher from the carnet to be replaced.
