# § 122.49c   Master crew member list and master non-crew member list requirement for commercial aircraft arriving in, departing from, continuing within, and overflying the United States.

(a) *General requirement.* Air carriers subject to the provisions of §§ 122.49b and 122.75b, with respect to the flights covered in those sections, must electronically transmit to Customs and Border Protection (CBP), by means of an electronic data interchange system approved by CBP, a master crew member list and a master non-crew member list containing the information set forth in paragraph (c) of this section covering, respectively, all crew members and non-crew members operating and servicing its flights. The initial transmission of a list must be made at least two days in advance of any flight a crew member or non-crew member on the list will be operating, serving on, or traveling on and must contain the information set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. After review of the master crew list and the master non-crew list by TSA, TSA will advise the carrier of any crew members or non-crew members that must be removed from the list. Only those persons on the TSA-approved master crew and master non-crew lists will be permitted to operate, serve on, or travel on flights covered by this section. Until a carrier becomes a participant in the CBP-approved electronic interchange system, it must submit the required information in a format provided by TSA.


(b) *Changes to master lists.* After the initial transmission of the master crew member and non-crew member lists to CBP, the carrier is obligated to update the lists as necessary. To add a name to either list, along with the required information set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, or to add or change information relative to a name already submitted, the carrier must transmit the information to CBP at least 24 hours in advance of any flight the added or subject crew member or non-crew member will be operating, serving on, or traveling on. A carrier must submit deletions from the lists as expeditiously as possible.


(c) *Master list information.* The electronic master crew lists required under paragraph (a) of this section must contain the following information with respect to each crew member or non-crew member that operates, serves on, or travels on a carrier's flights that are covered by this section except that the information specified in paragraphs (c)(4), (5), (6), (7), and (10) of this section must be included on the manifest only on or after October 4, 2005:


(1) Full name (last, first, and, if available, middle);


(2) Gender;


(3) Date of birth;


(4) Place of birth (city, state—if applicable, and country);


(5) Citizenship;


(6) Country of residence;


(7) Address of permanent residence;


(8) Passport number, if passport required;


(9) Passport country of issuance, if passport required;


(10) Passport expiration date, if passport required;


(11) Pilot certificate number and country of issuance, if applicable;


(12) Status onboard the aircraft.


(d) *Exception.* The master crew member and non-crew member list requirements of this section do not apply to aircraft chartered by the U.S. Department of Defense.


(e) *Superseding amendments issued by TSA.* One or more of the requirements of this section may be superseded by specific provisions of, amendments to, or alternative procedures authorized by TSA for compliance with an aviation security program, emergency amendment, or security directive issued by the TSA to an air carrier subject to the provisions of 49 CFR part 1544, 1546, or 1550. The amendments will have superseding effect only for the air carrier to which issued and only for the period of time specified in the amendment.
