(a) *Manifest required.* A manifest in duplicate covering the in-transit merchandise which is to proceed under the provisions of this subpart shall be presented by the carrier to the Customs officer at each port of lading of a vessel, or at the port of exit of a vehicle. Where the merchandise is transported under Customs red in-bond seals and is accompanied by a transportation in-bond manifest, a separate in-transit manifest is not required.


(b) *Additional copies.* In the following cases additional copies of the manifest shall be presented:


(1) When the merchandise is to be transshipped in foreign territory under Customs supervision, a copy of the manifest for each place of transshipment shall be presented.


(2) When a Customs officer requests an extra copy of the manifest as a record of the transaction.


(c) *Manifest forms to be used.* The in-transit manifest forms to be used are:


(1) For trucks, railroad cars or other overland carriers transiting Mexico a manifest on Customs Form 7512-B or 7533-C shall be presented.

(3) For rail cars transiting Canada, a manifest on Customs Form 7533-C (Canada A4-1/2) shall be presented. For trains which will remain intact while transiting Canadian territory, a consolidated train manifest containing all the information included in the individual car manifests and the train sheet required by § 123.23 may be used in lieu of individual car manifests. For a number of cars which will transit Canada as a group, a consolidated manifest may be used, but a train sheet shall also be presented.


(4) In all other cases where no in-transit manifest form is specified in this subpart, or in subpart E relating to truck shipments on the Canadian border, subpart F relating to commercial traveler's samples, and subpart G relating to baggage, Customs Form 7512-B or 7533-C shall be presented.


(d) *Contents of in-transit manifest.* The information contained in the manifest shall correspond to the information contained in the waybill accompanying the shipment, except that:


(1) The conveyance shall be identified in a suitable manner in the place provided for such identification.


(2) The description of ladings made up of several shipments which are to go forward in a conveyance or compartment sealed with Customs seals shall be “miscellaneous shipments.”


(3) When an in-transit rail shipment will enter and reenter Canada in a continuing movement en route to a final destination in the United States, only the final United States port of reentry shall be shown on the manifest.
