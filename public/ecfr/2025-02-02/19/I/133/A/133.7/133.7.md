# § 133.7   Renewal of trademark recordation.

(a) *Application to renew.* To continue uninterrupted CBP protection for trademarks, the trademark owner shall submit a written application to renew CBP recordation to the IPR & Restricted Merchandise Branch not later than 3 months after the date of expiration of the current 20-year trademark registration issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. A timely application to renew a CBP recordation must include the following:


(1) A status copy of the certificate of registration certified by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office showing renewal of the trademark and title to be in the name of the applicant;


(2) A statement describing any change of ownership or in the name of owner, in compliance with §§ 133.5 and 133.6 of this part, and any change of addresses of owners or places of manufacture; and


(3) A fee of $80 for each renewal of a trademark recordation. Where the trademark covers several classes, a fee of $80 is required for each class. A check or money order shall be made payable to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.


(b) *Delayed application.* Upon request made during the grace period of 3 months afforded by paragraph (a) of this section, a trademark owner whose application for renewal of recordation is unavoidably delayed may be afforded a reasonable extended period within which to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. The request shall be in writing, addressed to the IPR & Restricted Merchandise Branch, and shall set forth the circumstances due to which application is delayed.


(c) *Untimely application.* Failure of the trademark owner to submit a renewal application within the 3-month grace period afforded in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section or within an extension of time granted in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, shall deprive the trademark owner of the renewal process. A delinquent applicant will be required to apply anew to record the renewed trademark in accordance with the procedures and requirements of §§ 133.2 and 133.3.
