If the participant files a written appeal with the Assistant Commissioner, Information and Technology, within 10 days following the date of the written notice of action to suspend or revoke participation as provided in §§ 143.6 and 143.7, the suspension or revocation of participation shall not take effect until the appeal is decided, except in those cases where the Executive Director, Trade Policy and Programs, Office of International Trade, or the Director, User Support Services Division, respectively, determines that participation was obtained through fraud or the misstatement of a material fact, or that continued participation would pose a potential risk of significant harm to the integrity and functioning of the system. The CBP officer who receives the appeal shall stamp the date of receipt of the appeal and the stamped date is the date of receipt for purposes of the appeal. The Assistant Commissioner shall inform the participant of the date of receipt and the date that a response is due under this paragraph. The Assistant Commissioner shall render his decision to the participant, in writing, stating his reasons therefor, by letter mailed within 30 working days following receipt of the appeal, unless this period is extended with due notification to the participant.
