# ยง 143.35   Procedure for electronic entry summary.

In order to obtain entry summary processing electronically, the filer will submit certified entry summary data electronically through ABI. Data will be validated and, if the transmission is found error-free, will be accepted. If it is determined through selectivity criteria and review of data that documentation is required for further processing of the entry summary, Customs will so notify the filer. Documentation submitted before being requested by Customs will not be accepted or retained by Customs. The entry summary will be scheduled for liquidation once payment is made under statement processing (see ยง 24.25 of this chapter).
