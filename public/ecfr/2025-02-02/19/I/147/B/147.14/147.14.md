# § 147.14   Articles not to be immediately entered and delivered to a fair.

(a) *Placed in bonded warehouses.* If for any reason articles imported for a fair are not to be entered and delivered to a fair upon their arrival, the fair operator should request the port director, in writing, to cause such articles to be placed in a bonded warehouse under a “general order permit” at the risk and expense of the fair operator. If no request is made and the articles remain unentered after 5 days from the date of arrival, they will be placed in general order. 


(b) *Entry within 1 year.* At any time within 1 year from the date such articles are imported or brought in, they may be entered under this part for a fair or entered under the general tariff law, or for exportation. 


(c) *Abandonment.* If not entered within such period, they will be regarded as abandoned to the Government.
