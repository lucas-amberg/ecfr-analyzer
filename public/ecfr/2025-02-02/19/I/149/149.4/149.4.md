# § 149.4   Bulk and break bulk cargo.

(a) *Bulk cargo exempted from filing requirement.* For bulk cargo that is exempt from the requirement set forth in § 4.7(b)(2) of this chapter that a cargo declaration be filed with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 24 hours before such cargo is laden aboard the vessel at the foreign port, ISF Importers, as defined in § 149.1 of this part, of bulk cargo are also exempt from filing an Importer Security Filing with respect to that cargo.


(b) *Break bulk cargo exempted from time requirement.* For break bulk cargo that is exempt from the requirement set forth in § 4.7(b)(2) of this chapter for carriers to file a cargo declaration with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 24 hours before such cargo is laden aboard the vessel at the foreign port, ISF Importers, as defined in § 149.1 of this part, of break bulk cargo are also exempt with respect to that cargo from the requirement set forth in § 149.2 of this part to file an Importer Security Filing with CBP 24 hours before such cargo is laden aboard the vessel at the foreign port.

These ISF Importers must still report 24 hours in advance of loading any containerized or non-qualifying break bulk cargo they will be importing.
