(a) *Offer.* An offer made pursuant to section 617, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1617), in compromise of a Government claim arising under the Customs laws and the terms upon which it is made shall be stated in writing addressed to the Commissioner of Customs. The offer shall be limited to the civil liability of the proponent in the matter which is the subject of the Government's claim. 


(b) *Deposit of specific sum tendered.* No offer in which a specific sum of money is tendered in compromise of a Government claim under the Customs laws will be considered by the Commissioner of Customs until due notice is received that such sum has been properly deposited in the name of the person submitting the offer with the Treasurer of the United States or a Federal Reserve bank.
