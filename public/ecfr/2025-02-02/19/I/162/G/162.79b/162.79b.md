Whether or not a monetary penalty is assessed under this subpart, the appropriate Customs field officer will require the deposit of any actual loss of duties, taxes and fees resulting from a violation of section 592, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592) or any actual loss of revenue resulting from a violation of section 593A, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1593a), notwithstanding that the liquidation of the entry to which the loss is attributable has become final.

Any determination of actual loss of duties, taxes and fees or actual loss of revenue under this section is subject to review upon written application to the Commissioner of Customs.
