(1) Name of the interested party making the allegation and identification of the agent filing on its behalf, if any, and the email address for communication and service purposes;


(2) An explanation as to how the interested party qualifies as an interested party pursuant to § 165.1;


(3) Name and address of importer against whom the allegation is brought;

(d) *Signature.* The person signing the allegation on behalf of the interested party must include his or her name, position in the company or other affiliation, and provide contact information.

(i) *Small businesses.* Small businesses are entitled to technical assistance upon request. In general, small businesses are eligible to make such requests if they have neither adequate internal resources nor financial ability to obtain qualified outside assistance in preparing and submitting for CBP's consideration allegations of evasion. Small businesses must satisfy the applicable standards set forth in 15 U.S.C. 632 and implemented in 13 CFR part 121.
