# ยง 172.22   Decisions not protestable.

(a) *Mitigation decision not subject to protest.* Any decision to remit or mitigate a penalty or cancel a claim for liquidated damages upon payment of a lesser amount is not a protestable decision as defined under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1514. Any payment made in compliance with any decision to remit or mitigate a penalty or cancel a claim for liquidated damages upon payment of a lesser amount is not a charge or exaction and therefore is not a protestable action as defined under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1514. 


(b) *Payment of mitigated or cancellation amount as accord and satisfaction.* Payment of a mitigated or cancellation amount in compliance with an administrative decision on a petition or supplemental petition for relief will be considered an election of administrative proceedings and full disposition of the case. Payment of a mitigated or cancellation amount will act as an accord and satisfaction of the Government claim. Payment of a mitigated or cancellation amount will never serve as a bar to filing a supplemental petition for relief.
