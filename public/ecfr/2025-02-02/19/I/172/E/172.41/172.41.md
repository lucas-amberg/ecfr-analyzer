If the petitioner is not satisfied with a decision of the deciding official on an original petition for relief, a supplemental petition may be filed with the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer having jurisdiction in the port where the violation occurred. The petitioner must file such a supplemental petition within 60 days from the date of notice to the petitioner of the decision from which further relief is requested or within 60 days following an administrative or judicial decision with respect to issues serving as the basis for the claim for liquidated damages (whichever is later) unless another time to file such a supplemental petition is prescribed in the decision. A supplemental petition may be filed whether or not the mitigated amount designated in the decision on the original petition is paid.
