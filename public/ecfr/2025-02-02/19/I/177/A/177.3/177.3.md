# ยง 177.3   Nonconforming requests for rulings.

A person submitting a request for a ruling that does not comply with all of the provisions of this part will be so notified in writing, and the requirements that have not been met will be pointed out. Except in the case of ruling requests submitted to Area or District offices, such person will be given a period of thirty (30) days from the date of the notice (or such longer period as the notice may provide) to supply any additional information that is requested or otherwise conform the ruling request to the requirements referred to in the notice. The Customs Service file with respect to ruling requests which are not brought into compliance with the provisions of this part within the period of time allowed will be administratively closed and the request removed from active consideration until such time as the deficiencies cited in the notice are corrected. A request for a ruling that is removed from active consideration by reason of failing to comply with the provisions of this part may be treated as withdrawn. In the case of ruling requests made to Area or District offices, a failure to comply with the provisions of this part will result in the return of the ruling request with the notice specifying the deficiencies and such requests will not be considered as having been filed until such deficiencies are corrected.
