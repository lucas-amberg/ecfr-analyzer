(a) *Administrative review*—(1) *Submission of request for review.* Any person who received an advance ruling issued under this subpart, or an authorized agent of such person, may request administrative review, at CBP Headquarters, of that advance ruling, including any modification or revocation thereof, by letter addressed to the Executive Director, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC 20229. Such request shall be filed within 30 calendar days after issuance of the advance ruling and shall set forth the following information:


(i) The name and address of the person seeking review and the name and address of his authorized agent if the request is signed by such an agent;


(ii) The Customs identification number or employer identification number in the case of a U.S. importer and authorized agent thereof, the employer number or importer/exporter number assigned by Revenue Canada in the case of a Canadian exporter or producer and authorized agent thereof, and the federal taxpayer registry number (RFC) in the case of a Mexican exporter or producer and authorized agent thereof;


(iii) The number and date of the advance ruling at issue;


(iv) The numbers and dates of any involved entries for consumption or warehouse withdrawals for consumption;


(v) The nature of, and justification for, the objection to the advance ruling set forth distinctly and specifically with respect to each aspect of the advance ruling for which administrative review is sought; and


(vi) Whether an oral discussion of the issues, as provided in § 181.95 of this part, is desired.


(2) *Issuance of review decision.* Customs will normally issue a written decision within 120 days of receipt of the request for administrative review submitted under this section. However, Customs will, upon a reasonable showing of business necessity, issue a written decision within 60 days of receipt of the request for administrative review. For purposes of this paragraph, the date of receipt of the request for administrative review shall be the date on which all information necessary to process the request, including any information provided after submission of the request in connection with a conference, is filed with Customs.


(b) *Judicial review.* Any person whose claims with regard to a request for administrative review of an advance ruling have been denied in whole or in part under this section may seek judicial review by filing a civil action in the United States Court of International Trade in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 2632 within 180 days after the date of mailing of notice of the denial.
