# § 182.11   Filing of claim for preferential tariff treatment upon importation.

(a) *Basis of claim.* An importer may make a claim for USMCA preferential tariff treatment, including an exemption from the merchandise processing fee, based on a written or electronic certification of origin, as specified in § 182.12, completed by the importer, exporter, or producer for the purpose of certifying that a good qualifies as an originating good.


(b) *Making a claim.* The claim is made by including on the entry summary, or equivalent documentation, or by the method specified for equivalent reporting via a CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system, the letters “S” or “S+” as a prefix to the subheading of the HTSUS under which each originating good is classified.


(c) *Corrected claim.* If, after making the claim specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the importer has reason to believe that the certification of origin is based on inaccurate information or is otherwise invalid, the importer must promptly and voluntarily correct the claim or certification of origin, pay any duties that may be due, and submit a statement either in writing to the CBP office where the original claim was filed or via a CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system in accordance with § 182.124 of this part (*see* §§ 182.122 and 182.124 of this part).
