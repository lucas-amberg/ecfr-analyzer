# § 182.74   Verification visit procedures.

(a) *Written consent required.* Prior to conducting a verification visit in Canada or Mexico, CBP must obtain the written consent of the exporter or producer whose premises are to be visited. The exporter or producer must submit this written consent, requested in the notification of a verification visit under § 182.73(b)(3), to CBP through one of the communication means specified in § 182.73(d)(2), within the time period provided in § 182.73(f)(2), unless a postponement is requested in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) *Postponement of a verification visit*—(1) *Request for postponement by an exporter or producer.* Within 15 days of confirmed receipt of the notification of a verification visit, the exporter or producer may, on a single occasion, using one of the communication means specified in § 182.73(d)(2), request the postponement of the verification visit for a period not to exceed 30 days from the proposed date of the visit.


(2) *Notification of a postponement.* CBP will notify the exporter or producer when a postponement request under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is received and will provide the new date of the verification visit. The Mexican or Canadian customs administration where the verification visit will occur may also, within 15 days of confirmed receipt of the notification of a verification visit, postpone the verification visit for a period not to exceed 60 days from the proposed date of the visit or for a longer period as CBP and the Mexican or Canadian customs administration may decide. CBP will notify the exporter or producer if the verification visit is postponed at the request of the Mexican or Canadian customs administration.


(c) *Availability of records*—(1) *Verification of a good.* The exporter or producer must make the records, which are required to be maintained to demonstrate that the good qualifies for preferential tariff treatment under the USMCA, available for inspection by a CBP official conducting a verification and provide facilities for that inspection during the verification visit. CBP may deny the claim for preferential tariff treatment of the good for failure to maintain these records or if a CBP official is denied access to these records.


(2) *Verification of a material.* During the verification of a material, any records in the material producer's possession demonstrating that the material qualifies as originating must be made available for inspection by a CBP official conducting a verification. CBP may consider the material that is the used in the production of the good and is the subject of the verification visit to be non-originating material if a CBP official is denied access to these records.


(d) *Observers.* The exporter or producer may designate up to two observers to be present during the verification visit, if the exporter or producer chooses, provided that:


(1) The observers do not participate in a manner other than as observers;


(2) The failure of the exporter or producer to designate observers does not result in the postponement of the visit; and


(3) The exporter or producer identifies to CBP any observers designated to be present during the visit.
