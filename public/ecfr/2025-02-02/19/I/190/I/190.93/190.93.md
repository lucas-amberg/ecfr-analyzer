# § 190.93   Combined applications.

An applicant for the procedures provided for in §§ 190.91 and 190.92 may apply for only one procedure, both procedures separately, or both procedures in one application package (*see* also § 190.195 regarding combined applications for certification in the drawback compliance program and waiver of prior notice and/or approval of accelerated payment of drawback). In the latter instance, the intent to apply for both procedures must be clearly stated. In all instances, all of the requirements for the procedure(s) applied for must be met (for example, in a combined application for both procedures, all of the information required for each procedure, all required sample documents for each procedure, and all required certifications must be included in and with the application).
