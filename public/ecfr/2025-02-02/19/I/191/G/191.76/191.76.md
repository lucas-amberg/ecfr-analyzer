(a) *Requirement.* Prior to the liquidation of the drawback entry, Customs may require a landing certificate for every aircraft departing from the United States under its own power if drawback is claimed on the aircraft or a part thereof, except for the exportation of supplies under ยง 309 of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1309).

(d) *Inability to produce landing certificates.* A landing certificate shall be waived by the requiring Customs authority if the claimant demonstrates inability to obtain a certificate and offers other satisfactory evidence of export.
