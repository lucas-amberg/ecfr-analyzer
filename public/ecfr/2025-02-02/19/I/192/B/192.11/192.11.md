# § 192.11   Description of the AES.

The Automated Export System (AES) is the information system for collecting Electronic Export Information (EEI) from persons exporting goods from the United States, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands; between Puerto Rico and the United States; and to the U.S. Virgin Islands from the United States or Puerto Rico. Pursuant to the Census Bureau's Foreign Trade Regulations (FTR), all commodity export information for which EEI is required must be filed through the AES. This system is the CBP-approved electronic data interchange system used for purposes of filing EEI as required by § 192.14. AES is also the system by which certain sea carriers may report required outbound vessel information electronically (*see,* §§ 4.63, 4.75, and 4.76 of this chapter). Eligibility and application procedures are found in the General Requirements section of the FTR, codified at 15 CFR part 30, subpart A. The Census Bureau's FTR (15 CFR part 30, subpart A) provides that exporters may choose to submit export information through AES by any one of three electronic filing options available. Only Option 4, the complete post-departure submission of export information, requires prior approval by participating agencies before it can be used by AES participants.
