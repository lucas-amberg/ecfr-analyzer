# § 4.85   Vessels with residue cargo for domestic ports.

(a) Any foreign vessel or documented vessel with a registry endorsement, arriving from a foreign port with cargo or passengers manifested for ports in the United States other than the port of first arrival, may proceed with such cargo or passengers from port to port, provided a bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.64 of this chapter relating to international carriers in a suitable amount is on file with the director of the port of first entry. 
115 No additional bond shall be required at subsequent ports of entry. Before the vessel departs from the port of first arrival, the master shall obtain from the port director a certified copy of the complete inward foreign manifest (hereinafter referred to as the traveling manifest). The certified copy shall have a legend similar to the following endorsed on the Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement, Customs Form 1300:


(b)(1) Before a vessel proceeds from one domestic port to another with cargo or passengers on board as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the master must present to the director of such port of departure an application in triplicate on Customs Form 1300 for a permit to proceed to the next port. When a port director grants the permit on Customs Form 1300, the following legend must be endorsed on the form:


(2) The duplicate must be attached to the traveling manifest and the triplicate (the permit to proceed to be delivered at the next port) must be returned to the master, together with the traveling manifest and the vessel's document, if on deposit. If no inward foreign cargo or passengers are to be discharged at the next port, that fact must be indicated on Customs Form 1300 by inserting “To load only” in parentheses after the name of the port to which the vessel is to proceed. The traveling Crew's Effects Declaration covering articles acquired abroad by officers and members of the crew, together with the unused crewmembers' declarations prepared for such articles, will be placed in a sealed envelope addressed to the appropriate Customs officer at the next port and given to the master for delivery. 


(c)(1) Upon the arrival of a vessel at the next and each succeeding domestic port with inward foreign cargo or passengers still on board, the master must immediately report its arrival and make entry within 48 hours. To make such entry, he must deliver to the port director the vessel's document, the permit to proceed (Customs Form 1300 endorsed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section), the traveling manifest, and the traveling Crew's Effects Declaration (Customs Form 1304), together with the crewmembers' declarations received on departure from the previous port. The master must also present an abstract manifest consisting of a newly executed Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement, Customs Form 1300, a Cargo Declaration, Customs Form 1302, and a Crew's Effects Declaration in duplicate of all unentered articles acquired abroad by officers and crewmembers which are still on board, a Ship's Stores Declaration, Customs Form 1303, in duplicate of the sea or ship's stores remaining on board, and if applicable, the Cargo Declaration required by § 4.86. The master must also update the data elements required on CBP Form I-418 that were electronically submitted via an electronic data interchange system approved by CBP for any passengers on board that are manifested for discharge at that port. If no inward foreign cargo or passengers are to be discharged, the Cargo Declaration or Passenger List may be omitted from the abstract manifest, and the following legend must be placed in item 15 of the Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement:


(2) The traveling manifest, together with a copy of the newly executed Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement, will serve the purpose of a copy of an abstract manifest at the port where it is finally surrendered. 


(d) If boarding is required before the port director will issue a permit or special license to lade or unlade, the abstract manifest described in paragraph (c) of this section shall be ready for presentation to the boarding officer.


(e) The traveling manifest shall be surrendered to the director of the final domestic port of discharge of the cargo, except that if residue foreign cargo remains on board for discharge at a foreign port or ports, the traveling manifest shall be surrendered at the final port of departure from the United States. However, it shall not be surrendered at the port from which the vessel departs for another United States port, via an intermediate foreign port, under § 4.89 if residue foreign cargo remains on board for discharge at a subsequent U.S. port. The traveling Crew's Effects Declaration shall be finally surrendered to the director of any port from which the vessel will depart directly for a foreign port.
