# ยง 200.735-114a   Employees not required to submit statements.

(a) Employees in positions that meet the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1) or (c)(1) of ยง 200.735-114 of this subpart may be exempted from the reporting requirement of ยง 200.735-114 if the Director of Personnel, upon obtaining the advice of the General Counsel, determines that:


(1) The duties of a position are such that the likelihood of the incumbent's involvement in a conflict-of-interest situation is remote;


(2) The duties of a position are at such a level of responsibility that the submission of a statement of employment and financial interests is not necessary because of the degree of supervision and review over the incumbent or the inconsequential effect on the integrity of the Government.


(b) All determinations made pursuant to paragraph (a) shall be documented in a writing which shall be annexed to the listings required by paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(2) of ยง 200.735-114 of this subpart. The factual bases and reasons for determinations under paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall be specified by the Director of Personnel in said writing. Said writing shall refer to the *position* only and shall not include the name, or other identifying particular, of the incumbent occupying the position.


(c) A statement of employment and financial interests from commissioners is not required by this subpart. Such employees are subject to separate reporting requirements under section 401 of Executive Order 11222 (3 CFR 306 (1964-1965 Comp.)).
