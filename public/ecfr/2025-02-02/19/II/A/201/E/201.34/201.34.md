# § 201.34   Definitions.

For the purpose of this subpart: 


(a)(1) Except as hereinafter provided, the term *meeting* means the deliberations of at least the number of individual Commissioners required to take action on behalf of the Commission where such deliberations determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of official Commission business. 


(2) The consideration by individual Commissioners of business which is circulated sequentially in writing (circulation by “action jacket”) is not considered a meeting under paragraph (a)(1) of this section because circulation by action jacket does not determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of Commission business until ratification thereof by formal vote of the Commissioners in a meeting as defined by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, although action proposed by action jacket may be taken before or after formal ratification thereof by vote at a Commission meeting. 


(3) Conference telephone calls among the Commissioners are considered meetings as defined by paragraph (a)(1) of this section if they involve the number of Commissioners requisite for Commission action, and where the deliberations of the Commissioners determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of official Commission business.


(4) Deliberations of a majority of the entire membership of the Commission with the *sole* purpose of determining whether or not to call a meeting at a date earlier than the requisite public notice period as specified in § 201.35 of this subpart are not considered to constitute a meeting or portion of a meeting as defined by paragraph (a)(1) of this section. 


(5) Deliberations of a majority of the entire membership of the Commission with the *sole* purpose of determining whether or not to close a portion or portions of a meeting or series of meetings pursuant to § 201.36 of this subpart are not considered to constitute a meeting or portion of a meeting within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. 


(6) Deliberations of a majority of the entire membership of the Commission with the *sole* purpose of determining whether or not to change the subject matter of a publicly announced meeting, or to change the determination of the Commission to open or close a meeting, or portion thereof, to the public, following a public notice, as permitted under § 201.37(b) of this subpart, are not considered to constitute a meeting or portion of a meeting under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
