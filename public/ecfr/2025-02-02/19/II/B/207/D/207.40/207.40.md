# § 207.40   Termination and suspension of investigation.

(a) An investigation under title VII may be terminated by the Commission by giving notice in the _Federal Register_ to all parties to the investigation, upon withdrawal of the petition by the petitioner, or upon issuance of a final negative determination or termination of its investigation by the administering authority under section 303, 705 or 735 of the Act. The Commission may not terminate an investigation upon withdrawal of the petition by the petitioner, however, before a determination is made by the administering authority under section 702(c), 703(b), 732(c) or 733(b) of the Act. 


(b) Upon receipt of notice of suspension of an investigation by the administering authority under section 704 (b) or (c) or 734(b), (c), or (1), of the Act, the Secretary shall issue a notice of suspension of the Commission investigation. Such suspension shall not prevent the Director from conducting such other investigative activities as he deems appropriate with respect to the subject matter of the suspended investigation. 


(c) *Resumption of suspended investigation*—(1) *Purpose.* If the administering authority determines pursuant to section 704(i) or 734(i) of the Act to resume a suspended investigation and so notifies the Commission of its determination, and in the event that the suspended investigation was not terminated, the Commission shall resume the investigation.


(2) *Procedures.* The procedures set forth in subpart C shall apply to all investigations instituted under this section.
