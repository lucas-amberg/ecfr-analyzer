# § 210.40   Briefs and notices of supplemental authority.

(a) At the time a motion for summary determination under § 210.18(a) or a motion for termination under § 210.21(a) is made, or when it is found that a party is in default under § 210.16, or at the close of the reception of evidence in any hearing held pursuant to this part (except as provided in § 210.63), or within a reasonable time thereafter fixed by the administrative law judge, any party may file briefs in support of that party's positions, in the form specified by the administrative law judge, for the administrative law judge's consideration. Such briefs shall be in writing, shall be served upon all parties in accordance with § 210.4(g), and shall contain adequate references to the record and the authorities on which the submitter is relying.


(b) If pertinent and significant authorities come to a party's attention after the party's brief has been filed but before the final initial determination has issued, the party may promptly advise the administrative law judge by filing a written notice of supplemental authority, no more than two (2) double-spaced pages in length. The notice must be served on all other parties and must describe the relevance of the supplemental authority, with reference to specific pages in either the party's briefs or the transcript of the evidentiary hearing. Any other party may file a response of no more than two (2) double-spaced pages within five (5) business days after the date of service of the notice of supplemental authority.
