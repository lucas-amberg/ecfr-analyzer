# ยง 210.71   Information gathering.

(a) *Power to require information.* (1) Whenever the Commission issues an exclusion order, the Commission may require any person to report facts available to that person that will help the Commission assist the U.S. Customs Service in determining whether and to what extent there is compliance with the order. Similarly, whenever the Commission issues a cease and desist order or a consent order, it may require any person to report facts available to that person that will aid the Commission in determining whether and to what extent there is compliance with the order or whether and to what extent the conditions that led to the order are changed.


(2) The Commission may also include provisions that exercise any other information-gathering power available to the Commission by law, regardless of whether the order at issue is an exclusion order, a cease and desist order, or a consent order. The Commission may at any time request the cooperation of any person or agency in supplying it with information that will aid the Commission or the U.S. Customs Service in making the determinations described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. 


(b) *Form and detail of reports.* Reports under paragraph (a) of this section are to be in writing, under oath, and in such detail and in such form as the Commission prescribes. 


(c) *Power to enforce informational requirements.* Terms and conditions of exclusion orders, cease and desist orders, and consent orders for reporting and information gathering shall be enforceable by the Commission by a civil action under 19 U.S.C. 1333, or, at the Commission's discretion, in the same manner as any other provision of the exclusion order, cease and desist order, or consent order is enforced. 


(d) *Term of reporting requirement.* An exclusion order, cease and desist order, or consent order may provide for the frequency of reporting or information gathering and the date on which these activities are to terminate. If no date for termination is provided, reporting and information gathering shall terminate when the exclusion order, cease and desist order, or consent order or any amendment to it expires by its own terms or is terminated.
