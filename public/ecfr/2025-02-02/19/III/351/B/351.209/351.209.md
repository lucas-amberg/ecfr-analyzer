# § 351.209   Violation of suspension agreement.

(a) *Introduction.* A suspension agreement remains in effect until the underlying investigation is terminated (*see* §§ 351.207 and 351.222). However, if the Secretary finds that a suspension agreement has been violated or no longer meets the requirements of the Act, the Secretary may either cancel or revise the agreement. This section contains rules regarding cancellation and revision of suspension agreements.


(b) *Immediate determination.* If the Secretary determines that a signatory has violated a suspension agreement, the Secretary, without providing interested parties an opportunity to comment, will:


(1) Order the suspension of liquidation in accordance with section 704(i)(1)(A) or section 734(i)(1)(A) of the Act (whichever is applicable) of all entries of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the later of:


(i) 90 days before the date of publication of the notice of cancellation of the agreement; or


(ii) The date of first entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption of the merchandise the sale or export of which was in violation of the agreement;


(2) If the investigation was not completed under section 704(g) or section 734(g) of the Act, resume the investigation as if the Secretary had made an affirmative preliminary determination on the date of publication of the notice of cancellation and impose provisional measures by instructing U.S. Customs and Border Protection to require for each entry of the subject merchandise suspended under paragraph (b)(1) of this section a cash deposit or bond at the rates determined in the affirmative preliminary determination;


(3) If the investigation was completed under section 704(g) or section 734(g) of the Act, issue an antidumping order or countervailing duty order (whichever is applicable) and, for all entries subject to suspension of liquidation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to require for each entry of the merchandise suspended under this paragraph a cash deposit at the rates determined in the affirmative final determination;


(4) Notify all persons who are or were parties to the proceeding, the Commission, and, if the Secretary determines that the violation was intentional, the Commissioner of Customs; and


(5) Publish in the _Federal Register_ notice of “Antidumping (Countervailing Duty) Order (Resumption of Antidumping (Countervailing Duty) Investigation); Cancellation of Suspension Agreement.”


(c) *Determination after notice and comment.* (1) If the Secretary has reason to believe that a signatory has violated a suspension agreement, or that an agreement no longer meets the requirements of section 704(d)(1) or section 734(d) of the Act, but the Secretary does not have sufficient information to determine that a signatory has violated the agreement (*see* paragraph (b) of this section), the Secretary will publish in the _Federal Register_ notice of “Invitation for Comment on Antidumping (Countervailing Duty) Suspension Agreement.”


(2) After publication of the notice inviting comment and after consideration of comments received the Secretary will:


(i) Determine whether any signatory has violated the suspension agreement; or


(ii) Determine whether the suspension agreement no longer meets the requirements of section 704(d)(1) or section 734(d) of the Act.


(3) If the Secretary determines that a signatory has violated the suspension agreement, the Secretary will take appropriate action as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section.


(4) If the Secretary determines that a suspension agreement no longer meets the requirements of section 704(d)(1) or section 734(d) of the Act, the Secretary will:


(i) Take appropriate action as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section; except that, under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the Secretary will order the suspension of liquidation of all entries of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the later of:


(A) 90 days before the date of publication of the notice of suspension of liquidation; or


(B) The date of first entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption of the merchandise the sale or export of which does not meet the requirements of section 704(d)(1) of the Act;


(ii) Continue the suspension of investigation by accepting a revised suspension agreement under section 704(b) or section 734(b) of the Act (whether or not the Secretary accepted the original agreement under such section) that, at the time the Secretary accepts the revised agreement, meets the applicable requirements of section 704(d)(1) or section 734(d) of the Act, and publish in the _Federal Register_ notice of “Revision of Agreement Suspending Antidumping (Countervailing Duty) Investigation”; or


(iii) Continue the suspension of investigation by accepting a revised suspension agreement under section 704(c), section 734(c), or section 734(l) of the Act (whether or not the Secretary accepted the original agreement under such section) that, at the time the Secretary accepts the revised agreement, meets the applicable requirements of section 704(d)(1) or section 734(d) of the Act, and publish in the _Federal Register_ notice of “Revision of Agreement Suspending Antidumping (Countervailing Duty) Investigation.” If the Secretary continues to suspend an investigation based on a revised agreement accepted under section 704(c), section 734(c), or section 734(l) of the Act, the Secretary will order suspension of liquidation to begin. The suspension will not end until the Commission completes any requested review of the revised agreement under section 704(h) or section 734(h) of the Act. If the Commission receives no request for review within 20 days after the date of publication of the notice of the revision, the Secretary will order the suspension of liquidation ended on the 21st day after the date of publication, and will instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to release any cash deposit or bond. If the Commission undertakes a review under section 704(h) or section 734(h) of the Act, the provisions of sections 704(h)(2) and (3) and sections 734(h)(2) and (3) of the Act will apply.


(5) If the Secretary decides neither to consider the suspension agreement violated nor to revise the agreement, the Secretary will publish in the _Federal Register_ notice of the Secretary's decision under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, including a statement of the factual and legal conclusions on which the decision is based.


(d) *Additional signatories.* If the Secretary decides that a suspension agreement no longer will completely eliminate the injurious effect of exports to the United States of subject merchandise under section 704(c)(1) or section 734(c)(1) of the Act, or that the signatory exporters no longer account for substantially all of the subject merchandise, the Secretary may revise the agreement to include additional signatory exporters.


(e) *Definition of “violation.”* Under this section, “violation” means noncompliance with the terms of a suspension agreement caused by an act or omission of a signatory, except, at the discretion of the Secretary, an act or omission which is inadvertent or inconsequential.
