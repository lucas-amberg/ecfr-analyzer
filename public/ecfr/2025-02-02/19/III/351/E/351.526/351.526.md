# § 351.526   Subsidy extinguishment from changes in ownership.

(a) *In general.* The Secretary will normally presume that non-recurring subsidies continue to benefit a recipient in full over an allocation period determined consistent with §§ 351.507(d), 351.508(c)(1), or 351.524, notwithstanding an intervening change in ownership.


(b) *Rebutting the presumption of subsidy continuation notwithstanding a change in ownership.* (1) An interested party may rebut the presumption in paragraph (a) of this section by demonstrating with sufficient evidence that, during the allocation period, a change in ownership occurred in which the seller sold its ownership of all or substantially all of a company or its assets, retaining no control of the company or its assets, and


(i) In the case of a government-to-private sale, that the sale was an arm's-length transaction for fair market value, or


(ii) In the case of a private-to-private sale, that the sale was an arm's-length transaction, unless a party demonstrates that the sale was not for fair market value.


(2) *Arm's-length.* In determining whether the evidence presented in paragraph (b)(1) of this section demonstrates that the transaction was conducted at arm's length, the Secretary will be guided by the SAA, which defines an arm's-length transaction as a transaction negotiated between unrelated parties, each acting in its own interest, or between related parties such that the terms of the transaction are those that would exist if the transaction had been negotiated between unrelated parties.


(3) *Fair Market Value.* (i) In determining whether the evidence presented by parties pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section demonstrates that the transaction was for fair market value, the Secretary will determine whether the seller, including in the case of a privatization through the government in its capacity as seller, acted in a manner consistent with the normal sales practices of private, commercial sellers in that country, taking into account evidence regarding whether the seller failed to maximize its return on what it sold.


(ii) In making the determination under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the Secretary may consider information regarding comparable benchmark prices as well as information regarding the process through which the sale was made. The following is a non-exhaustive list of specific considerations that the Secretary may find to be relevant in this regard:


(A) *Objective analysis.* Whether the seller performed or obtained an objective analysis in determining the appropriate sales price and, if so, whether it implemented the recommendations of such objective analysis for maximizing its return on the sale, including in regard to the sales price recommended in the analysis;


(B) *Artificial barriers to entry.* Whether the seller-imposed restrictions on foreign purchasers or purchasers from other industries, overly burdensome or unreasonable bidder qualification requirements, or any other restrictions that artificially suppressed the demand for, or the purchase price of, the company;


(C) *Highest bid.* Whether the seller accepted the highest bid, reflecting the full amount that the company or its assets (including the value of any subsidy benefits) were actually worth under the prevailing market conditions and whether the final purchase price was paid through monetary or close equivalent compensation; and


(D) *Committed investment.* Whether there were price discounts or other inducements in exchange for promises of additional future investment that private, commercial sellers would not normally seek (for example, retaining redundant workers or unwanted capacity) and, if so, whether such committed investment requirements were a barrier to entry or in any way distorted the value that bidders were willing to pay for what was being sold.


(4) *Deadline to rebut the presumption under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.* The Secretary will normally not consider information submitted by a respondent or government on the record to be sufficient to rebut the presumption of subsidy continuation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section unless that submitted information is timely filed as part of the respondent's or government's initial questionnaire response.


(5) *Market distortion.* Information presented under paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section notwithstanding, the Secretary will not find the presumption in paragraph (a) of this section to be rebutted if an interested party has demonstrated that, at the time of the change in ownership, the broader market conditions necessary for the transaction price to accurately reflect the subsidy benefit were not present or were severely distorted by government action or inaction such that the transaction price was meaningfully different from what it would otherwise have been absent the distortive government action or inaction. In assessing such claims, the Secretary may consider, among other things, the following factors:


(i) *Fundamental conditions.* Whether the fundamental requirements for a properly functioning market are sufficiently present in the economy in general as well as in the particular industry or sector, including, for example, free interplay of supply and demand, broad-based and equal access to information, sufficient safeguards against collusive behavior, and effective operation of the rule of law; and


(ii) *Legal and fiscal incentives.* Whether the government has used the prerogatives of government in a special or targeted way that makes possible or otherwise significantly distorts the terms of a change in ownership in a way that a private seller could not. Examples of such incentives include, but are not limited to, the following:


(A) Special tax or duty rates that make the sale more attractive to potential purchasers;


(B) Regulatory exemptions particular to the privatization (or to privatizations generally) affecting worker retention or environmental remediation; or


(C) Subsidization or support of other companies to an extent that severely distorts the normal market signals regarding company and asset values in the industry in question.


(c) *Subsidy benefit extinguishment*—(1) *In general.* If the Secretary determines that any evidence presented by interested parties under paragraph (b) of this section rebuts the presumption under paragraph (a) of this section, the full amount of pre-transaction subsidy benefits, including the benefit of any concurrent subsidy meeting the criteria in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, will be found to be extinguished and therefore not countervailable. Absent such a finding, the Secretary will not find that a change in ownership extinguishes subsidy benefits.


(2) *Concurrent subsidies.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, concurrent subsidies are those subsidies given to facilitate or encourage or that are otherwise bestowed concurrent with a change in ownership. The Secretary will normally consider the value of a concurrent subsidy to be fully reflected in the fair market value price of an arm's-length change in ownership and, therefore, to be fully extinguished in such a transaction under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if the following criteria are met:


(i) The nature and value of the concurrent subsidies are fully transparent to all potential bidders and, therefore, reflected in the final bid values of the potential bidders,


(ii) The concurrent subsidies are bestowed prior to the sale, and


(iii) There is no evidence otherwise on the record demonstrating that the concurrent subsidies are not fully reflected in the transaction price.
