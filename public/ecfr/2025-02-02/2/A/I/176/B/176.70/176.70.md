# § 176.70   Policy.

Except as provided in § 176.80 or § 176.90—


(a) None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by the Recovery Act may be used for a project for the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a public building or public work (see definitions at §§ 176.140 and 176.160) unless—


(1) The public building or public work is located in the United States; and


(2) All of the iron, steel, and manufactured goods used in the project are produced or manufactured in the United States.


(i) Production in the United States of the iron or steel used in the project requires that all manufacturing processes must take place in the United States, except metallurgical processes involving refinement of steel additives. These requirements do not apply to iron or steel used as components or subcomponents of manufactured goods used in the project.


(ii) There is no requirement with regard to the origin of components or subcomponents in manufactured goods used in the project, as long as the manufacturing occurs in the United States.


(b) Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply where the Recovery Act requires the application of alternative Buy American requirements for iron, steel, and manufactured goods.
