# ยง 180.45   Do these guidelines cover persons who are disqualified, as well as those who are excluded from nonprocurement transactions?

A Federal agency may add a subpart covering disqualifications to its regulation implementing these guidelines, but the guidelines in subparts A through I:


(a) Address disqualified persons only to:


(1) Provide for their inclusion in the System for Award Management (SAM.gov) Exclusions; and


(2) State the responsibilities of Federal agencies and participants to check for disqualified persons before entering into covered transactions.


(b) Do not specify the:


(1) Transactions for which a disqualified person is ineligible. Those transactions vary on a case-by-case basis because they depend on the language of the specific statute, Executive order, or regulation that caused the disqualification;


(2) Entities to which a disqualification applies; or


(3) Process that a Federal agency uses to disqualify a person. Unlike exclusion under subparts A through I of this part, disqualification is frequently not a discretionary action that a Federal agency takes and may include special procedures.
