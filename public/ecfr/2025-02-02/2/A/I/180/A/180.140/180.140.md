# ยง 180.140   Does an exclusion under the nonprocurement system affect a person's eligibility for Federal procurement contracts?

When a Federal agency excludes a person under Executive Order 12549 or Executive Order 12689 on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible for Federal procurement transactions under the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Therefore, an exclusion under this part has a reciprocal effect on Federal procurement transactions.
