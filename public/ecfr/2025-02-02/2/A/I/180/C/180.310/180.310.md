# ยง 180.310   What must I do if a Federal agency excludes a person with whom I am already doing business in a covered transaction?

(a) As a participant, you may continue covered transactions with an excluded person if the transactions were in existence when the Federal agency excluded the person. However, you are not required to continue the transactions, and you may consider termination. You should decide whether to terminate and the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.


(b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any excluded person unless the Federal agency responsible for the transaction grants an exception under ยง 180.135.
