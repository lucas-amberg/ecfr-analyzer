# § 180.730   What information must I provide to the suspending official if I contest the suspension?

(a) In addition to any information and argument in opposition, as a respondent, your submission to the suspending official must identify:


(1) Specific facts that contradict the statements contained in the Notice of Suspension. A general denial is insufficient to raise a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension;


(2) All existing, proposed, or prior exclusions under regulations implementing Executive Order 12549 and all similar actions taken by Federal, State, or local agencies, including administrative agreements that affect only those agencies;


(3) All criminal and civil proceedings not included in the Notice of Suspension that grew out of facts relevant to the cause(s) stated in the notice; and


(4) All of your affiliates.


(b) Your submission must also identify any of the paragraphs in § 180.730(a) that do not apply to you.


(c) If you fail to disclose this information or provide false information, the Federal agency taking the action may seek further criminal, civil, or administrative action against you, as appropriate.
