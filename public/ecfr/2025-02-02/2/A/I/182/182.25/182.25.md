# § 182.25   What must a Federal agency address in its implementation of the guidance?

Each Federal agency's implementing regulation:


(a) Must establish drug-free workplace policies and procedures for that Federal agency's Federal awards consistent with this guidance. When adopted by a Federal agency, the provisions of the guidance have a regulatory effect on that Federal agency's awards.

(1) State whether the Federal agency:


(i) Has a central point to which a recipient may send the notification of a conviction that is required under § 182.225(a) or § 182.300(b); or


(ii) Requires the recipient to send the notification to the Federal agency awarding official or their designee for each Federal award.


(2) Either:


(i) State that the Federal agency head is the official authorized to determine under § 182.500 or § 182.505 that a recipient has violated the drug-free workplace requirements; or


(ii) Provide the title of the official designated to make that determination.


(c) May also, at the Federal agency's option, identify any specific types of financial assistance awards, in addition to grants and cooperative agreements, to which the Federal agency makes this guidance applicable.
