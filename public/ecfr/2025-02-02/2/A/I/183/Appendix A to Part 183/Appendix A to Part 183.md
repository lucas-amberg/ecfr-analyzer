(2) Terminate or void in whole or in part any subaward or contract with a person or entity listed in the System for Award Management (*SAM.gov*) as a prohibited or restricted source pursuant to subtitle E of Title VIII of the NDAA for FY 2015, unless the Federal agency provides written approval to continue the subaward or contract.

(c) The Federal agency has the authority to terminate or void this grant or cooperative agreement, in whole or in part, if the Federal agency becomes aware that you have failed to exercise due diligence as required by paragraph (a) of this clause or if the Federal agency becomes aware that any funds received under this grant or cooperative agreement have been provided directly or indirectly to a person or entity who is actively opposing coalition forces involved in a contingency operation in which members of the Armed Forces are actively engaged in hostilities.


(a) In addition to any other existing examination-of-records authority, the Federal Government is authorized to examine any of your records and the records of your subawards or contracts to the extent necessary to ensure that funds, including supplies and services, available under this grant or cooperative agreement are not provided, directly or indirectly, to a person or entity that is actively opposing the United States or coalition forces involved in a contingency operation in which members of the Armed Forces are actively engaged in hostilities, except for awards awarded by the Department of Defense on or before Dec 19, 2017, that will be performed in the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) theater of operations.
