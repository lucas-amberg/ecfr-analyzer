# ยง 200.326   Bonding requirements.

The Federal agency or pass-through entity may accept the recipient's or subrecipient's bonding policy and requirements for construction or facility improvement contracts or subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. Before doing so, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must determine that the Federal interest is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements must be as follows:


(a) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The bid guarantee must consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of the bid, execute any required contractual documents within the specified timeframe.


(b) A performance bond on the contractor's part for 100 percent of the contract price. A performance bond is a bond executed in connection with a contract to secure the fulfillment of all the contractor's requirements under a contract.


(c) A payment bond on the contractor's part for 100 percent of the contract price. A payment bond is a bond executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by the law of all persons supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for under a contract.
