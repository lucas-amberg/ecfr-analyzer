(a) *Records of recipients and subrecipients.* The Federal agency or pass-through entity, Inspectors General, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their authorized representatives must have the right of access to any records of the recipient or subrecipient pertinent to the Federal award to perform audits, execute site visits, or for any other official use. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to the recipient's or subrecipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents or the Federal award in general.


(b) *Extraordinary and rare circumstances.* The recipient or subrecipient and Federal agency or pass-through entity must take measures to protect the name of victims of a crime when access to the victim's name is necessary. Only under extraordinary and rare circumstances would such access include a review of the true name of victims of a crime. Routine monitoring cannot be considered extraordinary and rare circumstances that would necessitate access to this information. Any such access, other than under a court order or subpoena pursuant to a bona fide confidential investigation, must be approved by the head or delegate of the Federal agency.


(c) *Expiration of right of access.* The Federal agency's or pass-through entity's rights of access are not limited to the required retention period of this part but last as long as the records are retained. Federal agencies or pass-through entities must not impose any other access requirements upon recipients and subrecipients.
