(1) Conducted in accordance with GAGAS or applicable international attestation standards, as appropriate;


(2) Paid for and arranged by the pass-through entity; and


(3) Limited in scope to one or more of the following types of compliance requirements: activities allowed or unallowed; allowable costs/cost principles; eligibility; and reporting.
