# ยง 930.140   Disclosure of information.

(a) For all other transaction (OT) agreements, trade secrets and commercial or financial information that would be protected from disclosure requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (codified at 5 U.S.C. 552) if obtained from a person other than a Federal agency:


(1) For a period of five years after the date on which the information is developed; or


(2) For up to thirty years after the date on which the information is developed, if the Secretary or delegee of the Secretary determines that the nature of the technology under the transaction, including nuclear technology, could reasonably require an extended period of protection from disclosure to reach commercialization.


(b) As provided in 42 U.S.C. 7256(g)(1) incorporating certain provisions of 10 U.S.C. 4021, disclosure is not required, and may not be compelled, under FOIA during that period if:


(1) A proposer submits the information in a competitive or noncompetitive process that could result in the award of an OT agreement; and


(2) The type of information is among the following types that are exempt:


(i) Proposals, proposal abstracts, and supporting documents; and


(ii) Business plans and technical information submitted on a confidential basis.


(c) If proposers desire to protect business plans and technical information for five years from FOIA disclosure requirements, they must mark them with a legend identifying them as documents submitted on a confidential basis. After the five-year period, information may be protected for longer periods if it meets any of the criteria in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) (as implemented by the DOE in 10 CFR part 1004) for exemption from FOIA disclosure requirements.
