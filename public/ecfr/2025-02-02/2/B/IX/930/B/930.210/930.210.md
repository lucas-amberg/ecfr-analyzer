(2) Costs must be allocated to DOE and other projects in accordance with the relative benefits the projects receive.


(3) Costs allocated to DOE projects must be given consistent treatment with costs allocated to the participants' other RD&D activities (*e.g.,* activities supported by the participants themselves or by non-Federal sponsors).


(4) The standards must also state that the Federal funds and funds counted as participants' cost sharing will be used only for costs that are consistent with the purposes stated in the governing Congressional authorizations and appropriations.
