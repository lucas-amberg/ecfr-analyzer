# § 1108.300   Procurement contract.

*Procurement contract* means a legal instrument which, consistent with 31 U.S.C. 6303, reflects a relationship between the Federal Government and a State, a local government, or other recipient when the principal purpose of the instrument is to acquire property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government. A procurement contract is a prime-tier transaction and therefore distinct from a recipient's or subrecipient's “procurement transaction” or “contract” as defined in this subpart.
