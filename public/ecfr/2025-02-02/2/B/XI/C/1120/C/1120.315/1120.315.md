# ยง 1120.315   Availability of general terms and conditions.

(a) A DoD Component that issues a funding opportunity announcement under which grants or cooperative agreements may be awarded must maintain on the internet the general terms and conditions for those awards if:


(1) The distribution of the funding opportunity announcement is unlimited; and


(2) The DoD Component anticipates making 10 or more awards per year using those general terms and conditions.


(b) Each DoD Component that maintains a set of general terms and conditions on the internet must also maintain an archive of previous versions of that set at the same internet location, for use by recipients, post-award administrators, auditors, and others. Each version must be labeled with its effective dates.


(c) If a DoD Component has a set of general terms and conditions that is not subject to the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section and the DoD Component chooses not to maintain that set on the internet:


(1) It must tell potential applicants or proposers in the funding opportunity announcement, if there is one, how they may view or obtain a copy of the general terms and conditions; or


(2) If there is no funding opportunity announcement (*e.g.,* if it is a noncompetitive program for which all recipients are known in advance), the DoD Component must provide the general terms and conditions to each recipient no later than the time of award.
