# ยง 1120.515   Incorporation of administrative requirements into general terms and conditions by reference.

(a) For cost-type awards to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes, DoD Components are strongly encouraged to construct the portion of their general terms and conditions addressing administrative requirements by:


(1) Incorporating the standard wording of each article of administrative requirements provided in subchapter D of this chapter (the standard wording of the articles is in the appendices to 2 CFR parts 1128 through 1138) into those general terms and conditions by reference; and


(2) Stating any variations from that standard wording (*e.g.,* any sections or paragraphs that the DoD Component adds, revises, or omits, consistent with the DoDGARs prescription for use of the standard wording).


(b) Incorporating that standard wording into general terms and conditions by reference, rather than including the full text of each article of the general terms and conditions, will make it easier for those who must use terms and conditions of multiple DoD Components' awards (*e.g.,* recipients, DoD Components' post-award administrators, and auditors) to quickly identify how each Component's general terms and conditions differ from the DoD standard wording.
