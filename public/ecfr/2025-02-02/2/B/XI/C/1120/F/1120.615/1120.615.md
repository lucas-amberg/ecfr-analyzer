# ยง 1120.615   Incorporation of national policy requirements into general terms and conditions by reference.

For the same reason given in ยง 1120.515(b), DoD Components are strongly encouraged to construct the portion of their general terms and conditions addressing national policy requirements for awards to all types of recipient entities, including for-profit entities, by:


(a) Incorporating the standard wording of each article of national policy requirements provided in the appendices to 2 CFR part 1122 into those general terms and conditions by reference; and


(b) Stating any variations from that standard wording (*e.g.,* any added, omitted, or revised paragraphs, based on which national policy requirements apply to programs and recipients for which the general terms and conditions are used).
