# Appendix C to Part 1122—Terms and Conditions for NP Article III, “National Policy Requirements Concerning Live Organisms”


A DoD Component must use the following wording for NP Article III of its general terms and conditions in accordance with the provisions of Subpart B of this part.


*Section A. Cross-cutting requirements concerning live organisms.*

1. *Human subjects.*

a. You must protect the rights and welfare of individuals who participate as human subjects in research under this award and comply with the requirements at 32 CFR part 219, DoD Instruction (DoDI) 3216.02, 10 U.S.C. 980, and when applicable, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations.


b. You must not begin performance of research involving human subjects, also known as human subjects research (HSR), that is covered under 32 CFR part 219, or that meets exemption criteria under 32 CFR 219.101(b), until you receive a formal notification of approval from a DoD Human Research Protection Official (HRPO). Approval to perform HSR under this award is received after the HRPO has performed a review of your documentation of planned HSR activities and has officially furnished a concurrence with your determination as presented in the documentation.


c. In order for the HRPO to accomplish this concurrence review, you must provide sufficient documentation to enable his or her assessment as follows:


i. If the HSR meets an exemption criterion under 32 CFR 219.101(b), the documentation must include a citation of the exemption category under 32 CFR 219.101(b) and a rationale statement.


ii. If your activity is determined as “non-exempt research involving human subjects”, the documentation must include:


(A) Assurance of Compliance (*i.e.,* Department of Health and Human Services Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) Federalwide Assurance (FWA)) appropriate for the scope of work or program plan; and


(B) Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, as well as all documentation reviewed by the IRB to make their determination.


d. The HRPO retains final judgment on what activities constitute HSR, whether an exempt category applies, whether the risk determination is appropriate, and whether the planned HSR activities comply with the requirements in paragraph 1.a of this section.


e. You must notify the HRPO immediately of any suspensions or terminations of the Assurance of Compliance.


f. DoD staff, consultants, and advisory groups may independently review and inspect your research and research procedures involving human subjects and, based on such findings, DoD may prohibit research that presents unacceptable hazards or otherwise fails to comply with DoD requirements.


g. Definitions for terms used in paragraph 1 of this article are found in DoDI 3216.02.


2. *Animals.*

a. Prior to initiating any animal work under the award, you must:


i. Register your research, development, test, and evaluation or training facility with the Secretary of Agriculture in accordance with 7 U.S.C. 2136 and 9 CFR 2.30, unless otherwise exempt from this requirement by meeting the conditions in 7 U.S.C. 2136 and 9 CFR parts 1-4 for the duration of the activity.


ii. Have your proposed animal use approved in accordance with Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 3216.01, Use of Animals in DoD Programs by a DoD Component Headquarters Oversight Office.


iii. Furnish evidence of such registration and approval to the grants officer.


b. You must make the animals on which the research is being conducted, and all premises, facilities, vehicles, equipment, and records that support animal care and use available during business hours and at other times mutually agreeable to you, the United States Department of Agriculture Office of Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA/APHIS) representative, personnel representing the DoD component oversight offices, as well as the grants officer, to ascertain that you are compliant with 7 U.S.C. 2131 *et seq.,* 9 CFR parts 1-4, and DoDI 3216.01.


c. Your care and use of animals must conform with the pertinent laws of the United States, regulations of the Department of Agriculture, and regulations, policies, and procedures of the Department of Defense (see 7 U.S.C. 2131 *et seq.,* 9 CFR parts 1-4, and DoDI 3216.01).


d. You must acquire animals in accordance with DoDI 3216.01.


3. *Use of Remedies.*

Failure to comply with the applicable requirements in paragraphs 1-2 of this section may result in the DoD Component's use of remedies, *e.g.,* wholly or partially terminating or suspending the award, temporarily withholding payment under the award pending correction of the deficiency, or disallowing all or part of the cost of the activity or action (including the federal share and any required cost sharing or matching) that is not in compliance. See OAR Article III.
