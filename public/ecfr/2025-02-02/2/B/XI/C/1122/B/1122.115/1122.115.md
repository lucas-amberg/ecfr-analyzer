# ยง 1122.115   Cross-cutting national policy requirements.

(a) *General requirement to include applicable cross-cutting requirements.* A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the standard wording provided in appendices A through D to this part for each national policy requirement addressed in Section A of NP Articles I, II, III, and IV, respectively, that may apply either to:


(1) A recipient of an award using those general terms and conditions; or


(2) A subrecipient of a subaward under an award using those general terms and conditions.


(b) *Authority to reserve or omit inapplicable paragraphs.* A DoD Component may reserve or omit any paragraph appendices A through D to this part provide for Section A of NP Articles I, II, III, and IV of its general terms and conditions if it determines that the national policy requirement addressed in that paragraph will not apply to any awards using those terms and conditions nor to any subawards under them.


(c) *Authority to use alternate wording.* (1) A DoD Component may use different wording for a national policy requirement than is provided in appendices A through D to this part if it is authorized or required to do so by a statute or a regulation published in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment.


(2) A DoD Component in that case:


(i) Must include the wording required by the statute or regulation in Section B of the appropriate article. This will help a recipient recognize the wording as a variation of the usual DoD wording for the requirement.


(ii) May either reserve the paragraph of Section A of the article in which that national policy requirement otherwise would appear or insert in that paragraph wording to refer the recipient to the paragraph in Section B of the article in which the requirement does appear.
