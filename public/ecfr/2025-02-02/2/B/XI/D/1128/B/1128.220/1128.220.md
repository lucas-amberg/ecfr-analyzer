# § 1128.220   Electronic funds transfer and other payment procedural instructions or information.

(a) *Policy.* A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that payments will be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT) unless a recipient is excepted in accordance with Department of the Treasury regulations at 31 CFR part 208 from the Governmentwide requirement to use EFT.


(b) *Award terms and conditions*—(1) *Electronic funds transfer.* Appendix B provides wording for Section C of FMS Article II that a DoD Component must use to specify payment by EFT, when awards are not excepted from the Governmentwide requirement.


(2) *Other payment procedures or instructions.* A DoD Component may insert one or more paragraphs in its general terms and conditions in lieu of the reserved paragraph C.2 in appendix B, to provide procedural instructions or information regarding payments that is common to awards using those terms and conditions. For example, it may insert wording to give detailed instructions on where and how recipients are to submit payment requests. All forms, formats, and data elements for payment requests must be OMB-approved information collections.
