(b) *Award terms and conditions*—(1) *General.* A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section D of FMS Article VI if, in FMS Article VII of those terms and conditions, the DoD Component specifies that recipients dispose of program income using either:


(i) The cost sharing or matching alternative described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of § 1128.720; or


(ii) A combination alternative, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of § 1128.720, that includes use of at least some program income as cost sharing or matching.


(2) *Exception.* A DoD Component may reserve Section D of FMS Article VI if FMS Article VII of those terms and conditions does not provide that recipients will use any program income as cost sharing or matching.
