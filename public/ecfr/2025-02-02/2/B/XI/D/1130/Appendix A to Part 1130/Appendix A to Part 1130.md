# Appendix A to Part 1130—Terms and Conditions for PROP Article I, “Title to Property”


Unless a DoD Component inserts or adds wording or reserves sections of the article, as provided in §§ 1130.105 through 1130.125, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for PROP Article I.


*Section A. Title to property acquired under this award.*

1. *General.* Other than any property identified in paragraph A.2 of this section as exempt property:


a. Title to real property, equipment, and supplies that you acquire (whether by purchase, construction or fabrication, development, or otherwise) and charge as direct project costs under this award vests in you, the recipient. Title to intangible property that you acquire (other than by developing or producing it) under this award also vests in you.


b. That title is a conditional title, subject to the terms and conditions in PROP Articles II-IV, Section D of PROP Article VI, and REP Article III of this award.


c. There is a Federal interest in the property, other than intangible property that you develop or produce under the award. For real property, equipment, and intangible property, we retain this Federal interest until final disposition of the property under PROP Article III (for real property), PROP Article IV (for equipment and supplies), or Section D of PROP Article VI (for intangible property that is acquired, other than by developing or producing it), a period that in some cases may extend beyond closeout of this award.


2. *Exempt property.* [Reserved]


*Section B. Property trust relationship.*

1. *Basic requirement.* Other than intangible property that you develop or produce under the award, you hold any real property, equipment, or intangible property that you acquire or improve under this award in trust for the beneficiaries of the project or program that you are carrying out under the award.


2. *Notices of record.* [Reserved]


*Section C. Federally owned property.* Title to any federally owned property that we provide to you under this award (or for which accountability is transferred to this award from another Federal award) remains with the Federal Government.


*Section D. Federal interest in donated real property or equipment.* If real property or equipment is acquired under this award through your donation of the property to the project or program (*i.e.,* counting the value of the remaining life of the property recorded in your accounting records or the fair market value as permitted under FMS Article VI of this award as part of your share of project costs to meet any cost sharing or matching requirements, rather than charging depreciation):


1. The Federal Government acquires through that donation an interest in the real property or equipment, the value of which at any given time is the product of:


a. The Federal share of the project costs under this award; and


b. The current fair market value of the property at that time.


2. The real property or equipment is subject to Section B of this article and the terms and conditions of PROP Articles II-IV and REP Article III that are applicable to property acquired under the award.


3. The Federal interest in the real property or equipment must be addressed at the time of property disposition.


*Section E. Federal interest in property improved under the award.*

1. The Federal Government has an interest in improvements (as distinct from ordinary repairs and maintenance) you make to an item of real property or equipment if you charge the costs of the improvements as direct costs to this award.


2. We thereby acquire an interest in the property if the Government did not previously have one. If the Government already had an interest in the property, the value of that Federal interest in the property increases by the amount of the Federal interest in the improvements.


3. The property is subject to Section B of this article and the terms and conditions of PROP Articles II-IV and REP Article III that are applicable to real property or equipment acquired under the award.


4. The Federal interest must be addressed at the time of property disposition.
