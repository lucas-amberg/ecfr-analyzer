# Appendix D to Part 1130—Terms and Conditions for PROP Article IV, “Use and Disposition of Equipment and Supplies”


As specified in §§ 1130.405 through 1130.425, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for PROP Article IV.


*Section A. Property subject to this article.* This article specifies requirements for use and disposition of equipment and supplies. If a provision of PROP Article I identifies any type of equipment or supplies as exempt property, requirements of this Article apply to that exempt property only to the extent specified in that provision of PROP Article I or an award-specific term or condition. The types of non-exempt property to which this article applies are:


1. Supplies that you acquire either by purchase or by donation as cost sharing or matching under this award; and


2. Equipment for which title is vested conditionally in you. That includes equipment with a conditional title resulting from your having, either under this award or under a previous award from which you transferred accountability for the equipment to this award:


a. Directly charged as project costs, in whole or in part, the acquisition (by purchase, construction or fabrication, or development) of equipment;


b. Donated the equipment to the project or program by counting the value of the remaining life of the property recorded in your accounting records or the fair market value toward any cost sharing or matching requirements under the award, rather than charging depreciation (see PROP Article I, Section D); or


c. Directly charged as project costs improvements to the equipment that meet the criteria given in paragraph E.1 of PROP Article I.


*Section B. Requirements for a State's use and disposition of equipment.* You:


1. Must use the equipment for the authorized purposes of the project or program during the period of performance, or until the property is no longer needed for those purposes.


2. May not encumber the property without the prior written approval of the award administration office.


3. Must use and dispose of the equipment in accordance with your State laws and procedures.


*Section C. Use of equipment by an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, local government, or Indian tribe.* You:


1. Must use the equipment for the authorized purposes of the project or program under this award until the equipment is no longer needed for those purposes, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by this award.


2. May not encumber the equipment without the prior written approval of the award administration office.


3. During the time that the equipment is used for the project or program under this award:


a. You must make the equipment available for use on other projects or programs but only if that use will not interfere with the equipment's use as needed for the project or program supported by this award.


i. First preference must be given to other projects or programs supported or previously supported by DoD Components


ii. Second preference to projects or programs supported or previously supported by other Federal agencies.


iii. Third preference is for other projects or programs not supported by the Federal Government. You should charge user fees for use of the equipment in those cases, if it is at all practicable.


b. You may use the equipment, if you need to acquire replacement equipment, as a trade-in or sell it (using sales procedures designed to ensure the highest possible return) and use the proceeds from the sale to offset the cost of the replacement equipment.


4. When the equipment is no longer needed for the project or program under this award, you may defer final disposition of the equipment and continue to use it on other federally sponsored projects or programs. You must give first priority to other projects or programs supported by DoD Components.


5. Notwithstanding the encouragement in FMS Article VII to earn program income, you may not use equipment in which there currently is a Federal interest—whether you acquired it under this award or are otherwise accountable for it under this award—to provide services for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services.


*Section D. Disposition of equipment by an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, local government, or Indian tribe.* You must request disposition instructions from the award administration office when either original or replacement equipment acquired under this award with a current fair market value that exceeds $5,000 is no longer needed for the original project or program or for other federally sponsored activities as described in paragraph C.4 of this article. For each item of equipment with a current fair market value of $5,000 or less, you may retain, sell, or otherwise dispose of the item with no further obligation to the Federal Government.


1. We may issue disposition instructions that:


a. Allow you to retain or sell any item of equipment after compensating us for the Federal interest in the property, which is to be computed as specified in the definition of “Federal interest;” or


b. Require you to transfer title to the equipment to a Federal agency or a third party, in which case you are entitled to compensation from us for the non-Federal interest in the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred.


2. If we fail to provide disposition instructions for any item of equipment within 120 calendar days of receiving your request, you may retain or sell the equipment, but you must compensate us for the amount of the Federal interest in the equipment.


3. If you sell the equipment:


a. You must use sales procedures designed to ensure the highest possible return; and


b. You may deduct and retain for selling and handling expenses either $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less.


*Section E. Use and disposition of supplies acquired under this award.*

1. *Use.* As long as we retain a Federal interest in supplies acquired under this award either by purchase or by donation as cost sharing or matching, you may not use the supplies to provide services to other organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, notwithstanding the encouragement in FMS Article VII to earn program income.


2. *Disposition.* If you have a residual inventory of unused supplies with aggregate value exceeding $5,000 at the end of the period of performance under this award, and the supplies are not needed for any other Federal award, you must retain the supplies or sell them but must in either case compensate us for the amount of the Federal interest in the supplies. You may deduct and retain for selling and handling expenses either $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less.
