# Appendix E to Part 1130—Terms and Conditions for PROP Article V, “Use and Disposition of Federally Owned Property”


Unless a DoD Component reserves the article, as specified in § 1130.505, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for PROP Article V.


*Section A. Use.* During the time that federally owned property for which you are accountable under this award is used for the project or program supported by the award, you:


1. Also may make the property available for use on other federally supported projects or programs, but only if that use will not interfere with the property's use for the project or program supported by this award. You must give first priority to other projects or programs supported by DoD Components.


2. May use the property for purposes other than federally supported projects or programs only with the prior approval of the awarding office or, if you request approval after the award is made, the award administration office.


*Section B. Disposition.* You must request disposition instructions from the award administration office for any federally owned property under this award, including any property for which a subrecipient is accountable under a subaward you make under this award, either:


1. At any time during the period of performance if the property is no longer needed for the project or program supported by this award; or


2. At the end of the period of performance.
