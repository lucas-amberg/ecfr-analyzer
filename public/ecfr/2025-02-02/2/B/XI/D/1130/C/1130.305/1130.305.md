# ยง 1130.305   Use of real property.

(a) *OMB guidance.* OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.311(b) states that, except as otherwise provided by Federal statute or the Federal awarding agency, a recipient must use real property acquired or improved under a grant or cooperative agreement for the originally authorized purpose as long as needed for that purpose, during which time the recipient must not dispose of the property or encumber its title or other interests.


(b) *DoD implementation.* Unless a statute or program regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment specifies otherwise, DoD awards must permit recipients to do the following:


(1) While real property acquired or improved under an award still is needed for the authorized purpose, also use it for other projects or programs that either are supported by DoD Components or other Federal agencies or not federally supported, as long as that use does not interfere with the property's use for the authorized purpose.


(2) After the real property no longer is needed for the authorized purpose, with the written approval of the award administration office, use the property on other federally supported projects or programs that have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by the DoD Component that made the award under which the property was acquired or improved.


(c) *Award terms and conditions.* A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must either:


(1) Include the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section A of PROP Article III; or


(2) If a statute or program regulation in the Code of Federal Regulations specifies different requirements for recipients' use of real property, substitute alternative wording for Section A to specify those requirements.
