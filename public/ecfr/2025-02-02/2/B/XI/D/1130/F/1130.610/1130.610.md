# § 1130.610   Inventions developed under awards.

(a) *OMB guidance.* OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.315(c) states that recipients of grants and cooperative agreements are subject to applicable regulations concerning patents and inventions, including Department of Commerce regulations at 37 CFR part 401.


(b) *DoD implementation.* In implementing 2 CFR 200.315(c) for awards for the performance of experimental, developmental, or research work, DoD:


(1) Extends to other entities the patent rights provisions of chapter 18 of Title 35 of the U.S. Code and 37 CFR part 401 that directly apply to small business firms and nonprofit organizations. This broadened applicability is in accordance with the February 18, 1983, Presidential memorandum on Government patent policy, referred to in Executive Order 12591, “Facilitating Access to Science and Technology.”


(2) Establishes a requirement for recipients to provide final reports listing all subject inventions under their awards or stating there were none, a requirement that 37 CFR 401.5(f)(1) provides as an agency option.


(3) Incorporates the prohibition in 35 U.S.C. 212 on asserting Federal Government rights in inventions made by recipients of scholarships, fellowships, training grants, or other awards made primarily for educational purposes.


(c) *Award terms and conditions.* (1) *Awards for research, developmental, or experimental work.* A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for awards for the performance of experimental, developmental, or research work funded in whole or in part by the Federal Government must include the wording appendix F to this part provides for Section B of PROP Article VI, with one permitted exception. The exception is that a DoD Component may reserve or substitute alternative wording for paragraph B.2.b of Section B of PROP Article VI, as appropriate, if it elects to:


(i) Omit the requirement for final invention reports;


(ii) Substitute “120 calendar days” for “90 calendar days” to provide an additional 30 days for recipient's submissions of final reports after the end date of the period of performance; or


(iii) Include a requirement for recipients to submit information about each patent application they submit for a subject invention, interim listings of all subject inventions, or both, which the Department of Commerce regulations at 37 CFR 401.5(f)(2) and (3) permit agencies to require.


(2) *Awards for primarily educational purposes.* A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for awards to support scholarships or fellowships, training grants, or other awards for primarily educational purposes must replace the wording appendix F to this part provides for Section B of PROP Article VI with an alternative award provision stating that the Federal Government will have no rights to inventions made by recipients.


(3) A*wards for other purposes.* A DoD Component developing general terms and conditions for awards other than those described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section should:


(i) Consult its intellectual property counsel if it anticipates that recipients may develop patentable inventions under its awards, to identify any applicable statutes or regulations and determine an appropriate substitute for the wording appendix F to this part provides for Section B of PROP Article VI; or


(ii) Reserve Section B of PROP Article VI if it does not expect development of any patentable inventions under those awards.
