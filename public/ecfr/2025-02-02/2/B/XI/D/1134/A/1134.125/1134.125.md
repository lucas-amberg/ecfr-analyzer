# § 1134.125   Due dates and reporting periods for final performance reports under non-construction awards.

(a) *OMB guidance.* OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1) states that each final performance report will be due 90 calendar days after the end date of the period of performance. It also states that an agency may extend the due date if a recipient submits a justified request.


(b) *DoD implementation*—(1) *Due dates.* Consistent with 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1):


(i) *General.* A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that the due date for each recipient's submission of its final performance report is:


(A) 90 calendar days after the end of the period of performance for non-construction awards other than research.


(B) 120 calendar days after the end of the period of performance for research awards.


(ii) *Exception.* A DoD Component may pre-approve a 30-day extension to the due date in its general terms and conditions for non-construction awards other than research by specifying that each recipient's final performance report is due 120 calendar days after the end of the period of performance. Doing so would be especially helpful to recipients that have subawards and need time to assimilate subrecipient inputs into the final report for the project or program as a whole.


(2) *Reporting periods*—(i) *Non-construction awards other than research.* A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards other than research may require each recipient to submit a final report that is cumulative and covers the entire period of performance, as that may more effectively document the project or program for future reference.


(ii) *Research.* Final reports for research awards must be cumulative (*i.e.,* each final report must cover the entire period of performance under the award and not just the period since the previous interim performance report) because a primary purpose of a final report for a research award is to document the overall project or program, as described in § 1134.110(b)(2).


(c) *Award terms and conditions.* To implement the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a DoD Component in its general terms and conditions for non-construction awards:


(1) Must either:


(i) Specify that the due date for final performance reports is either 90 or 120 calendar days after the end of the period of performance, as indicated in paragraph (b)(1)(i), by including the wording that appendix A to this part provides for paragraph C.1 of REP Article I and modifying the bracketed language in that wording by removing the brackets and showing only the number of days (*i.e.,* 90 or 120 calendar days) appropriate for the type of awards; or


(ii) Pre-approve a 30-day extension to the 90 calendar day due date, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section for non-construction awards other than research, by including the wording that appendix A to this part provides for paragraph C.1 of REP Article I and modifying the bracketed language in that wording by removing the brackets and showing only “120 calendar days” in lieu of “90 calendar days.”


(2) Must insert wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph C.2 of REP Article I, to specify the reporting period for final reports (*e.g.,* that research awards require cumulative final reports).
