*Section A. Real property.* Paragraphs A.1 through A.4 apply to real property for which you are accountable under this award, for as long as there is a Federal interest in the property (whether that interest is due to you or a subrecipient having acquired or improved the property under this award, or a transfer of the accountability for the property to this award from another award).

a. *Frequency and duration of reporting requirement.* [Reserved]


b. *Due dates.* [Reserved]


c. *Other submission instructions.* [Reserved]


2. *Notifications of critical changes.* You must notify the award administration office of any critical change in the status of real property as soon as feasible after you become aware of it.

*Section B. Equipment and supplies.* Paragraphs B.1 through B.4 apply to equipment or supplies for which you are accountable under this award and in which there is a Federal interest (whether that interest is due to you or a subrecipient having acquired or improved the property under this award, or a transfer of the accountability for the property to this award from another award).

3. *Intangible property acquired, but not developed or produced, under the award.* You must comply with requirements in Section D of PROP Article VI to request disposition instructions for intangible property acquired, but not developed or produced, under the award.
