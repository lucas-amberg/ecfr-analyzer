*Section A. System for Award Management.*

1. Unless you are exempted from this requirement in accordance with OMB guidance in 2 CFR 25.110, you must maintain the currency of information about yourself in the system the Federal Government specifies as the repository for information about its business partners (currently the System for Award Management (SAM)).

*Section B. Reporting of Performance and Integrity Information.*

1. *General reporting requirement.* If the total value of your currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal agencies exceeds $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of this award, then during that period of time you must maintain in SAM the currency of information required by paragraph B.2 of this section. Note that:

a. Current procedures are to submit the information as part of the maintenance of your information in the SAM that Section A of this article requires.


b. You do not need to submit the information again under this award if you already reported current information to the SAM under another Federal grant, cooperative agreement, or procurement contract.


4. *Reporting frequency.* During any period of time when you are subject to the requirement in paragraph B.1 of this section, you must report to SAM at least semiannually following your initial report of any information required in paragraph B.2 of this section, either to provide new information not reported previously or affirm that there is no new information to report.
