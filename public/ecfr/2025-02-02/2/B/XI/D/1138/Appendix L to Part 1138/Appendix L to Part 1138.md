# Appendix L to Part 1138—Terms and Conditions for SUB Article XII, “Fixed-Amount Subawards”


Unless modified as provided in § 1138.5 or 1138.1205, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for SUB Article XII.


*Section A. Limitations on use.*

1. You may not use a fixed-amount subaward:


a. If the total value over the life of the subaward will exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.


b. Unless the project or program scope is specific, with definite outcomes, and you are able to establish a reasonable estimate of the actual costs of accomplishing those outcomes.


c. If you will predetermine a set amount or percentage of cost sharing or matching that the subrecipient must provide under the subaward.


d. If the subrecipient will acquire any real property or equipment under the subaward.


2. For fixed-amount subawards not prohibited by paragraph 1 of this section and except as provided in Section B of this article, you must obtain our prior approval before making a fixed-amount type of subaward.


a. If Section B of FMS Article IV requires you to obtain our prior approval before you make any subaward, and you do not identify the subaward as a fixed-amount subaward when you obtain that approval, then you must subsequently request separate approval before awarding it as a fixed-amount type of subaward.


b. If a subaward is identified as a fixed-amount type of subaward in the budget you submit for our approval, then our approval of the budget is the required prior approval.


*Section B. Fixed-amount subawards that do not require prior approval.* You are not required to obtain our prior approval before using a fixed-amount type of subaward if:


1. The subaward is to either:


a. A foreign public entity; or


b. An organizational unit of a foreign organization, if that unit does not have a place of business in the United States, regardless of whether another organizational unit of that foreign organization has one.


2. You determine that the portion of the project or program under this award which the subrecipient will be carrying out under the subaward has one or more specific outcomes with the following characteristics:


a. You can define the outcomes well enough to specify them at the time you make the subaward. Note that:


i. Outcomes are distinct from inputs needed to achieve the outcomes, such as amounts or percentages of time that subrecipient employees or other participants will spend on the project or program.


ii. The inherently unpredictable nature of basic or applied research makes it rarely, if ever, possible to define specific research outcomes in advance, which makes fixed-amount subawards inappropriate for research. Note that technical performance reports serve to document research outcomes but are not themselves outcomes, notwithstanding the definition of “performance goals” in OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.76.


b. The accomplishment of each outcome will be observable and verifiable by you when it occurs, so that you will not need to rely solely on the subrecipient's assurance of that accomplishment.


c. The subrecipient associates its estimated costs with outcomes in the proposal it submits to you, and you are confident that the costs of accomplishment of the outcomes will equal or exceed the subaward amount. This requires either that you have a high degree of confidence:


i. In your estimate of the costs associated with accomplishing the well-defined and observable outcomes, based on the prospective subrecipient's proposal (and using the applicable cost principles in FMS Article III as a guide); or


ii. That those costs will be within a finite range, rather than a specific amount, so that you may provide an amount of funding under the subaward that does not exceed the lower end of the range, with the provision that the subrecipient agrees to provide any balance above that amount that ultimately is needed to accomplish the outcomes. Your subaward then would include a term or condition to reflect the subrecipient's agreement to provide that balance (which would be in an amount to be post-determined, when the outcomes are accomplished). Note that this is distinct from a situation in which you predetermine a set amount or percentage of cost sharing or matching that the subrecipient must provide under its subaward, a situation in which paragraph A.1.c of this article prohibits use of a fixed-amount subaward.


3. a. The subaward is based on a fixed rate per unit of outcome (or “unit cost”) and you have both the confidence:


i. That is described in paragraph B.2.c of this article in the estimated costs associated with each unit of outcome; and


ii. In the subrecipient's guarantee that it can accomplish at least the number of units of outcome on which your total subaward amount will be based (*i.e.,* the product of the unit cost and the number of units of outcome the subrecipient guarantees to accomplish).


b. Note, however, that not every fixed rate subaward is also a fixed-amount subaward. If you have confidence in the unit cost but not also in the subrecipient's ability to guarantee the number of units of outcome that it will accomplish, then you should set a not-to-exceed award amount based on the number of units desired and reduce the subaward amount at the end if the subrecipient accomplishes fewer than that number. Examples of activities for which it may be appropriate to award this type of fixed rate subaward that is not a fixed-amount subaward include:


i. A clinical trial for which the unit cost is the cost of treating each participant. The not-to-exceed amount would be based on the number of participants the subrecipient planned to recruit and the final award on the number who actually participated, documentation for which would be subject to audit.


ii. Labor costs for performance of a portion of the project or program under this award by a for-profit entity that treats its indirect cost rate as proprietary information. The unit cost in that case may be “loaded” labor rates for the entity's employees that include indirect costs. The final award amount would depend on the number of labor hours the entity's employees expended under the subaward, documentation for which may be audited without exposing proprietary details associated with the actual costs.


*Section C. Informational content of fixed-amount subawards.* You must include in each fixed-amount subaward the informational content, other than the indirect cost rate, that is described in SUB Article III of this award.


*Section D. Terms and conditions addressing administrative requirements.*

1. *General.* This section:


a. Specifies the minimum set of terms and conditions (in lieu of the more extensive set specified in SUB Articles IV through X for cost-type subawards) addressing administrative requirements that you must include in each fixed-amount subaward:


i. To an entity other than a foreign organization, as applicable; and


ii. To the maximum extent practicable, to a foreign organization.


b. Does not preclude the inclusion of other requirements that you need in order to meet your responsibilities under this award for performance of the project or program and compliance with applicable administrative and national policy requirements.


2. *Financial and program management requirements.*

a. *Financial management system standards.* For a subaward to other than a for-profit entity, your subaward must require the subrecipient to include the information specified in paragraph B.1 of FMS Article I in its financial management system, for the purposes of the non-Federal audits required by paragraph 2.d of this section.


b. *Payments.* Your payments must be based on accomplishment of the outcomes and associated costs that you used to establish the award amount, rather than on subrecipient expenditures for project or program purposes. Milestone payments before the end of the subaward's period of performance may be appropriate if there are outcomes that the subrecipient will accomplish at different times during that period.


c. *Revision of budget and program plans.* If our prior approval was required under paragraph A.2 of this article for use of a fixed-amount type of subaward, then you must:


i. Request our prior approval for any change in scope or objective of the subaward; and


ii. Include a requirement in the subaward for the subrecipient to request that approval through you.


d. *Non-Federal audits.* You must include the requirement for non-Federal audits described in Section F of SUB Article IV. The audits are intended to focus on compliance with the performance requirements in the subaward terms and conditions and not to review actual costs as they would for a cost-type subaward.


3. *Property requirements.*

a. *Federally owned property*. If the subrecipient will be accountable for federally owned property, you must include the property management system, use, and disposition requirements described in Sections C and F of SUB Article V that are applicable to federally owned property.


b. *Intangible property.* You must include the applicable intangible property requirements described in Section G of SUB Article V.


4. *Reporting requirements.* You must include requirements for reporting that you need in order to meet your responsibilities under this award for reporting to us.


5. *Other administrative requirements.*

a. *Integrity-related information.* You must include the substance of the provision in Section C of OAR Article I in any subaward you make under this award. The provision must require the subrecipient's disclosure of any evidence directly to the Inspector General, DoD.


b. *Records retention and access*.


i. You must include the requirements for records retention and access in paragraph A.3 and Sections B and F of OAR Article II, as applicable, if the subaward is to an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, State, local government, or Indian tribe. You may not impose any other records retention or access requirements on the subrecipient.


ii. You must include the corresponding requirements of 32 CFR 34.42 if the subaward is to a for-profit entity.


c. *Remedies and termination.* You must include:


i. The requirements concerning remedies and termination that are described in paragraphs D.1 and 2 of SUB Article VIII;


ii. Provisions addressing any hearing and appeal rights the subrecipient has, as described in Section E of SUB Article VIII; and


iii. Terms and conditions addressing adjustment of the amount of the subaward if it is terminated before the subrecipient accomplishes all of the specified outcomes.


d. *Continuing responsibilities.* You must include requirements concerning continuing responsibilities for audits and records retention and access that are described in paragraphs B.1 and 3 of OAR Article VII.


e. *Collection of amounts due.* You should consider including requirements concerning collection of amounts due, as described in Section F of SUB Article VIII.


*Section E. National policy requirements for fixed-amount subawards.* You must include in the terms and conditions of each fixed-amount subaward the national policy requirements that SUB Article IX of this award specifies, as applicable.


*Section F. Subrecipient monitoring and other post-award administration.* You must carry out the subrecipient monitoring and post-award administration actions specified in SUB Article X, as applicable.


*Section G. Fixed-amount subawards at lower tiers.*

1. *Authority.*

a. If Section B of this article authorizes you to use a fixed-amount type of subaward without our prior approval in some situations, a cost-type subaward that you make may authorize the subrecipient to use fixed-amount subawards at the next lower tier in those same situations without our prior approval.


b. If you wish to allow a subrecipient of a cost-type subaward to use fixed-amount subawards at the next tier in other situations (*i.e.,* situations in which this article requires you to obtain our prior approval before using a fixed-amount type of subaward), your subaward terms and conditions must require the subrecipient to submit a request through you to obtain our prior approval for use of that type of subaward.


2. *Subaward requirements.* If your subrecipient is authorized to use lower-tier fixed-amount subawards, as described in paragraphs 1.a and b of this section, your subaward's terms and conditions must:


a. Require the subrecipient, before it makes any lower-tier fixed-amount subaward, to:


i. Ensure that the lower-tier transaction is a subaward, rather than a procurement, by making the determination that SUB Article I of this award requires you to make for your subawards.


ii. Conduct the pre-award risk assessment of its intended subrecipient that Section B of SUB Article II of this award requires you to make for your subawards.


b. Include the requirements specified in Sections A through F of this article.
