# ยง 1532.1400   How may I appeal a decision denying my request for reinstatement?

(a) If the EPA debarring official denies your request for reinstatement under the CAA or CWA, you can ask for review of the debarring official's decision in two ways:


(1) You may ask the debarring official to reconsider the decision for material errors of fact or law that you believe will change the outcome of the matter; and/ or


(2) You may request the Director, Office of Grants and Debarment (OGD Director), to review the debarring official's denial within 30 days of your receipt of the debarring official's decision under ยง 1532.1230 or paragraph (a)(1) of this section. However, the OGD Director can reverse the debarring official's decision denying reinstatement only where the OGD Director finds that there is a clear error of material fact or law, or where the OGD Director finds that the debarring official's decision was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.


(b) A request for review under this section must be in writing and state the specific findings you believe to be in error and include the reasons or legal bases for your position.


(c) A review under this section is solely within the discretion of the OGD Director.


(d) The OGD Director must notify you of his or her decision under this section, in writing, using the notice procedures at 2 CFR 180.615 and 180.975.
