# ยง 2800.313   Equipment.

Title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Public Law 90-351, section 808 (42 U.S.C. 3789), creates a special rule for disposition and use of equipment and supplies purchased by funds made available under that Title, which rule, where applicable, supersedes any conflicting provisions of 2 CFR 200.313. Section 808 currently provides that such equipment and supplies shall vest in the criminal justice agency or nonprofit organization that purchased the property if such agency or nonprofit certifies to the appropriate State office (as indicated in the statute) that it will use the property for criminal justice purposes, and further provides that, if such certification is not made, title to the property shall vest in the State office, which shall seek to have the property used for criminal justice purposes elsewhere in the State prior to using it or disposing of it in any other manner.
