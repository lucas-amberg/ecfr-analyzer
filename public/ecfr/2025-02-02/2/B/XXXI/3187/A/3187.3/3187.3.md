(d)(1) Except as set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an institution exhibits objects to the general public for the purposes of this section if such exhibition is a primary purpose of the institution.


(2) An institution that does not have as a primary purpose the exhibition of objects to the general public but which can demonstrate that it exhibits objects to the general public on a regular basis as a significant, separate, distinct, and continuing portion of its activities, and that it otherwise meets the requirements of this section, may be determined to be a museum under this section. In order to establish its eligibility, such an institution must provide information regarding the following:

(ii) The period of time that such museum functions have been carried out by the institution over the course of the institution's history.


(iii) Appropriate financial information for such functions presented separately from the financial information of the institution as a whole.


(iv) The percentage of the institution's total space devoted to such museum functions.


(v) Such other information as the Director requests.
