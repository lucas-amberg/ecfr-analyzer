(a) Complete and submit Form CA-1 to the employing agency as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days from the date the traumatic injury occurred.


(b) Ensure that medical evidence supporting disability resulting from the claimed traumatic injury, including a statement as to when the employee can return to his or her date of injury job, is provided to the employer within 10 calendar days after filing the claim for COP.


(c) Ensure that relevant medical evidence is submitted to OWCP, and cooperate with OWCP in developing the claim.


(d) Ensure that the treating physician specifies work limitations and provides them to the employer and/or representatives of OWCP.


(e) Provide to the treating physician a description of any specific alternative positions offered the employee, and ensure that the treating physician responds promptly to the employer and/or OWCP, with an opinion as to whether and how soon the employee could perform that or any other specific position.
