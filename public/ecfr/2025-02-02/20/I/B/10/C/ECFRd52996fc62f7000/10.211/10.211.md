# ยง 10.211   What are the employer's responsibilities in COP cases?

Once the employer learns of a traumatic injury sustained by an employee, it shall:


(a) Provide a Form CA-1 and Form CA-16 to authorize medical care in accordance with ยง 10.300. Failure to do so may mean that OWCP will not uphold any termination of COP by the employer.


(b) Advise the employee of the right to receive COP, and the need to elect among COP, annual or sick leave or leave without pay, for any period of disability.


(c) Inform the employee of any decision to controvert COP and/or terminate pay, and the basis for doing so.


(d) Complete Form CA-1 and transmit it, along with all other available pertinent information, (including the basis for any controversion), to OWCP within 10 working days after receiving the completed form from the employee.
