# § 10.311   What are the special rules for the services of chiropractors?

(a) The services of chiropractors that may be reimbursed are limited by the FECA to treatment to correct a spinal subluxation. The costs of physical and related laboratory tests performed by or required by a chiropractor to diagnose such a subluxation are also payable.


(b) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8101(3), a diagnosis of spinal “subluxation as demonstrated by X-ray to exist” must appear in the chiropractor's report before OWCP can consider payment of a chiropractor's bill.


(c) A chiropractor may interpret his or her x-rays to the same extent as any other physician. To be given any weight, the medical report must state that x-rays support the finding of spinal subluxation. OWCP will not necessarily require submittal of the x-ray, or a report of the x-ray, but the report must be available for submittal on request.


(d) A chiropractor may also provide services in the nature of physical therapy under the direction of, and as prescribed by, a qualified physician.
