# ยง 30.17   Is a beneficiary who defrauds the government in connection with a claim for EEOICPA benefits still entitled to those benefits?

When a beneficiary either pleads guilty to or is found guilty on either federal or state criminal charges of defrauding the federal or a state government in connection with a claim for benefits under the Act or any other federal or state workers' compensation law, the beneficiary forfeits (effective the date either the guilty plea is accepted or a verdict of guilty is returned after trial) any entitlement to any further benefits for any injury, illness or death covered by this part for which the time of injury was on or before the date of such guilty plea or verdict. Any subsequent change in or recurrence of the beneficiary's medical condition does not affect termination of entitlement under this section.
