# § 30.212   How does a claimant establish that the employee contracted cancer after beginning employment at a DOE facility, an atomic weapons employer facility or a RECA section 5 facility?

(a) Proof of employment by the DOE or a DOE contractor at a DOE facility, or by an atomic weapons employer at an atomic weapons employer facility, or at a RECA section 5 facility, may be made by the submission of any trustworthy records that, on their face or in conjunction with other such records, establish that the employee was so employed and the time period(s) of such employment.


(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if the evidence shows that exposure occurred while the employee was employed at a facility during a time frame that is outside the relevant period indicated for that facility, OWCP may request that DOE provide additional information on the facility. OWCP will determine whether the evidence of record supports enlarging the relevant period for that facility.


(2) OWCP may choose not to request that DOE provide additional information on an atomic weapons employer facility that NIOSH reported had a potential for significant residual radiation contamination in its report dated October 2003 and titled “Report on Residual Radioactive and Beryllium Contamination at Atomic Weapons Employer Facilities and Beryllium Vendor Facilities,” or any update to that report, if the evidence referred to in paragraph (a) of this section establishes that the employee was employed at that facility during a period when NIOSH reported that it had a potential for significant residual radiation contamination.


(c) If the evidence shows that exposure occurred while the employee was employed by an employer that would have to be designated by DOE as an atomic weapons employer under section 7384l(4) of the Act to be a covered employer, and that the employer has not been so designated, OWCP will deny the claim on the ground that the employer is not a covered atomic weapons employer.


(d) Records from the following sources may be considered as evidence for purposes of establishing employment or presence at a covered facility:


(1) Records or documents created by any federal government agency (including verified information submitted for security clearance), any tribal government, or any state, county, city or local government office, agency, department, board or other entity, or other public agency or office.


(2) Records or documents created as a byproduct of any regularly conducted business activity or by an entity that acted as a contractor or subcontractor to the DOE.
