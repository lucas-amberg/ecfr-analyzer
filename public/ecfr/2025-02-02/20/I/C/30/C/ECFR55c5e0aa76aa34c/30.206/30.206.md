# § 30.206   How does a claimant prove that the employee was a “covered beryllium employee” exposed to beryllium dust, particles or vapor in the performance of duty?

(a) Proof of employment or physical presence at a DOE facility, or a beryllium vendor facility as defined in § 30.5(j), because of employment by the United States, a beryllium vendor, or a contractor or subcontractor of a beryllium vendor during a period when beryllium dust, particles or vapor may have been present at such facility, may be made by the submission of any trustworthy records that, on their face or in conjunction with other such records, establish that the employee was employed or present at a covered facility and the time period of such employment or presence.


(b) If the evidence shows that exposure occurred while the employee was employed or present at a facility during a time frame that is outside the relevant time frame indicated for that facility, OWCP may request that DOE provide additional information on the facility. OWCP will determine whether the evidence of record supports enlarging the relevant time frame for that facility.


(c) If the evidence shows that exposure occurred while the employee was employed or present at a facility that would have to be designated by DOE as a beryllium vendor under section 7384m of the Act to be a covered facility, and that the facility has not been so designated, OWCP will deny the claim on the ground that the facility is not a covered facility.


(d) Records from the following sources may be considered as evidence for purposes of establishing employment or presence at a covered facility:


(1) Records or documents created by any federal government agency (including verified information submitted for security clearance), any tribal government, or any state, county, city or local government office, agency, department, board or other entity, or other public agency or office.


(2) Records or documents created by any vendor, processor, or producer of beryllium or related products designated as a beryllium vendor by the DOE in accordance with section 7384m of the Act.


(3) Records or documents created as a by product of any regularly conducted business activity or by an entity that acted as a contractor or subcontractor to the DOE.
