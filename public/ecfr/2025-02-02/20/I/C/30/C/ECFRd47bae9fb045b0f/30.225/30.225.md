# ยง 30.225   What are the criteria for eligibility for benefits under Part B of EEOICPA for certain uranium employees?

In order to be eligible for benefits under this section, the claimant must establish the criteria set forth in either paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this section:


(a) The Attorney General has determined that the claimant is a covered uranium employee who is entitled to payment of $100,000 as compensation due under section 5 of RECA for a claim made under that statute (there is, however, no requirement that the claimant or surviving eligible beneficiary has actually received payment pursuant to RECA). If a deceased employee's survivor(s) has been determined to be entitled to such an award, his or her survivor(s), if any, will only be entitled to EEOICPA compensation in accordance with section 7384u(e) of the Act.


(b) The covered uranium employee has been diagnosed with an injury, illness, impairment or disease that arose as a consequence of the medical condition for which he or she was determined to be entitled to payment of $100,000 as compensation due under section 5 of RECA.
