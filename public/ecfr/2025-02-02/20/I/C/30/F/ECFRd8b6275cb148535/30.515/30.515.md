# ยง 30.515   Is a recipient responsible for an overpayment that resulted from an error made by OWCP?

(a) The fact that OWCP may have erred in making the overpayment does not by itself relieve the recipient of the overpayment from liability for repayment if the recipient also was at fault in accepting the overpayment.


(b) However, OWCP may find that the recipient was not at fault if failure to report an event affecting compensation benefits, or acceptance of an incorrect payment, occurred because:


(1) The recipient relied on misinformation given in writing by OWCP regarding the interpretation of a pertinent provision or EEOICPA of this part; or


(2) OWCP erred in calculating either the percentage of impairment or wage-loss under Part E of EEOICPA.
