# ยง 30.606   Under what circumstances must a recovery of money or other property in connection with an illness for which benefits are payable under EEOICPA be reported to OWCP?

Any person who has filed an EEOICPA claim that has been accepted by OWCP (whether or not compensation has been paid), or who has received EEOICPA benefits in connection with a claim filed by another, is required to notify OWCP of the receipt of money or other property as a result of a settlement or judgment in connection with the circumstances of that claim.
