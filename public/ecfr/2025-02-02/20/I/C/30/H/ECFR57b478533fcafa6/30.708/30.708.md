# ยง 30.708   Does the fee schedule apply to every kind of procedure?

Where the time, effort and skill required to perform a particular procedure vary widely from one occasion to the next, OWCP may choose not to assign a relative value to that procedure. In this case the allowable charge for the procedure will be set individually based on consideration of a detailed medical report and other evidence. At its discretion, OWCP may set fees without regard to schedule limits for specially authorized consultant examinations, for directed medical examinations, and for other specially authorized services.
