# ยง 30.718   How is a provider notified of OWCP's intent to exclude him or her?

Following receipt of the investigative report, OWCP will determine if there exists a reasonable basis to exclude the provider or providers. If OWCP determines that such a basis exists, OWCP shall initiate the exclusion process by sending the provider a letter, by certified mail and with return receipt requested (or equivalent services from a commercial carrier), which shall contain the following:


(a) A concise statement of the grounds upon which exclusion shall be based;


(b) A summary of the information, with supporting documentation, upon which OWCP has relied in reaching an initial decision that exclusion proceedings should begin;


(c) An invitation to the provider to:


(1) Resign voluntarily from participation in the EEOICPA program without admitting or denying the allegations presented in the letter; or


(2) Request a decision on exclusion based upon the existing record and any additional documentary information the provider may wish to furnish;


(d) A notice of the provider's right, in the event of an adverse ruling by the deciding official, to request a formal hearing before an administrative law judge;


(e) A notice that should the provider fail to respond (as described in ยง 30.719) the letter of intent within 60 days of receipt, the deciding official may deem the allegations made therein to be true and may order exclusion of the provider without conducting any further proceedings; and


(f) The address to where the response from the provider should be sent.
