# ยง 30.905   How may an impairment evaluation be obtained?

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, OWCP may request that an employee undergo an evaluation of his or her permanent impairment that specifies the percentage points that are the result of the employee's covered illness or illnesses. To be of any probative value, such evaluation must be performed by a physician who meets the criteria OWCP has identified for physicians performing impairment evaluations for the pertinent covered illness or illnesses in accordance with the AMA's *Guides.*

(b) In lieu of submitting an evaluation requested by OWCP under paragraph (a) of this section, an employee may obtain an impairment evaluation at his own initiative and submit it to OWCP for consideration. Such an evaluation will be deemed to have sufficient probative value to be considered in the adjudication of impairment benefits by OWCP only if:


(1) The evaluation was performed by a physician who meets the criteria identified by OWCP for the covered illness or illnesses in question;


(2) The evaluation was performed no more than one year before the date that it was received by OWCP; and


(3) The evaluation conforms to all applicable requirements set out in this part.
