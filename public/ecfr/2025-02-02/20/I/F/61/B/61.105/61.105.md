(a) The Office may pay benefits, as they accrue, directly to any entitled beneficiary in lieu of reimbursement of a carrier.


(b) The Office will not accept a case for direct payment until the right of the person or persons entitled to benefits has been established and the Office finds that the carrier would be entitled to reimbursement for continuing benefits.
