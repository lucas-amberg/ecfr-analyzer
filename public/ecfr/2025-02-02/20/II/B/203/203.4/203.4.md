# § 203.4   When service is compensated.

Service shall be “compensated” if it is performed for compensation, as that term is defined in part 222 of this chapter: *Provided, however,* That service prior to September 1941 of a station employee whose duties consisted of or included the carrying of passengers' hand baggage and otherwise assisting passengers at passenger stations shall be considered compensated service although the individual's remuneration was, in whole or in part, in the form of tips. (For the effect of compensation of less than $3.00 per month earned after December 31, 1936, for service to a local lodge or division of a railway-labor-organization employer, see part 222 of this chapter.)
