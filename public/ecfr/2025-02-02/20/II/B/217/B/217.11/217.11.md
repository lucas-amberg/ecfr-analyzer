(a) An applicant has “good cause” for a delay in the filing of an application for a lump-sum death payment or an annuity unpaid at death, as shown in § 217.9(c)(1) and (2), if the delay was due to—


(1) Circumstances beyond the applicant's control, such as extended illiness, mental or physical incapacity, or communication difficulties; or


(2) Incorrect or incomplete information furnished by the Board; or


(3) Efforts by the applicant to secure evidence without realizing that evidence could be submitted after filing an application; or


(4) Unusual or unavoidable circumstances which show that the applicant could not reasonably be expected to have been aware of the need to file an application within the set time limit.
