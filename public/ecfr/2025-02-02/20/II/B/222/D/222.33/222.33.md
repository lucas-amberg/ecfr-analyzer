# § 222.33   Relationship resulting from legal adoption.

(a) *Adopted by employee.* A claimant will be considered to be the child of the employee for both annuity and lump-sum payment purposes if the employee legally adopted the claimant in accordance with applicable State law. Legal adoption differs from equitable adoption in that in the case of legal adoption formal adoption proceedings have been completed in accordance with applicable State law and such proceedings are not defective.


(b) *Adopted by widow or widower.* A claimant who is legally adopted by the widow or widower of the employee after the employee's death will be considered to be the child of the employee for annuity but not for lump-sum payment purposes if—


(1) Either the claimant is adopted by the widow or widower within two years after the date on which the employee died, or the employee commenced proceedings to legally adopt the claimant before the employee's death; and


(2) The claimant was living in the employee's household at the time of the employee's death; and


(3) The claimant was not receiving regular support contributions from any other person other than the employee or spouse at the time of the employee's death.


(c) The adoption laws of the state or foreign country where the adoption took place, not the state inheritance laws, will determine whether the claimant is the employee's adopted child.
