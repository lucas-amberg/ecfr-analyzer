# § 327.1   Introduction.

The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act provides for the payment of unemployment benefits to qualified railroad employees for days of unemployment. Under section 1(k) of the Act, an unemployed employee must be “available for work” as a condition of eligibility for unemployment benefits for any day claimed as a day of unemployment. This part defines the phrase “available for work” and explains how the Board will apply that phrase to claims for unemployment benefits.
