If, after submitting notification of liability for a debt to another agency, the Board:


(a) Determines that an error has been made with respect to the information contained in the notification;


(b) Receives a payment or credits a payment to the account of the debtor named in the notification that reduces the amount of the debt referred to the other agency for offset; or


(c) Receives notification that the debtor has filed for bankruptcy under title 11 of the United States Code or has been adjudicated bankrupt and the debt has been discharged; the Board will promptly notify the other agency. If the amount of a debt is reduced after referral by the Board and offset by the other agency, the Board will refund to the debtor any excess amount and will promptly notify the other agency of any refund made by the Board. If the amount of debt has increased after referral by the Board but prior to offset by the other agency, then the Board will promptly notify the other agency of such increase.
