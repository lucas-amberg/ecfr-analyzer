(1) What constitutes a proper request for records;


(2) How to make a FOIA request;

(4) What fees may be charged to process a request for records;


(5) The timing of determinations regarding release;


(6) The exemptions that permit the withholding of records;


(7) Requesters' right to seek assistance from the FOIA Public Liaison;


(8) Requesters' right to appeal the agency's FOIA determination;


(9) Requesters' right to seek assistance from the Office of Government Information Services and then go to court if they still disagree with our release determination; and


(10) The records available for public inspection.


(c) The rules in this part do not revoke, modify, or supersede SSA's regulations relating to disclosure of information in part 401 or 403 of this chapter.
