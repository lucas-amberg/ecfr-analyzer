# ยง 402.30   Requirements of a FOIA request.

(a) To be considered a FOIA request under this part, the following must occur:


(1) The request must be written (either by hand or electronically);


(2) The request must be submitted in accordance with ยง 402.35;


(3) The requester must provide the following required contact information: Requester's name, U.S. or foreign postal address, description of records sought, and fee willing to pay. While not required, we encourage requesters to provide us with their email address and phone number; and


(4) The request must clearly state and reasonably describe what SSA records are being requested in sufficient detail to enable OPD to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Broad, sweeping requests and vague requests are not reasonably described. When known, requests should identify the records sought by providing the name/title of the record, applicable date range, subject matter, offices or employees involved, and record type. If the request is for electronic communications, such as email records, the request may identify the names, position titles, or other identifying information about the agency employees involved, as well as the applicable timeframe. Absent sufficient details, the agency may be unable to search for or locate the records sought. The greater the date range, the longer it may take to process the request and the greater amount of fees that may be charged.


(b) Requests that do not meet the required criteria in paragraph (a) of this section are not considered proper FOIA requests.
