(a) *General.* Unless the Commissioner grants a waiver, you must pay fees for our services in providing information, records, or testimony. You must pay the fees as prescribed by the Commissioner. In addition, the Commissioner may require that you pay the fees in advance as a condition of providing the information, records, or testimony. Make fees payable to the Social Security Administration by check or money order.

(c) *Testimony.* Unless the Commissioner grants a waiver, you must pay fees calculated to reimburse the United States Government for the full cost of providing the testimony. Those costs include, but are not limited to—

(2) Other travel costs. 


(d) *Waiver or reduction of fees.* The Commissioner may waive or reduce fees for providing information, records, or testimony under this part. The rules in 20 CFR § 402.185 apply in determining whether to waive fees for the production of records. In deciding whether to waive or reduce fees for testimony or for production of information that does not constitute a record, the Commissioner may consider other factors, including but not limited to—


(1) The ability of the party responsible for the application to pay the full amount of the chargeable fees; 


(2) The public interest, as described in 20 CFR § 402.185, affected by complying with the application; 


(3) The need for the testimony or information in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice; 


(4) The extent to which providing the testimony or information serves SSA's interest; and


(5) The burden on SSA's resources required to provide the information or testimony.
