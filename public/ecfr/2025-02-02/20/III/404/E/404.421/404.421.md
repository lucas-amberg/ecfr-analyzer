# § 404.421   How are deductions made when a beneficiary fails to have a child in his or her care?

Deductions for failure to have a child in care (as defined in subpart D of this part) are made as follows: 


(a) *Wife's or husband's benefit.* A deduction is made from the wife's or husband's benefits to which he or she is entitled for any month if he or she is under full retirement age and does not have in his or her care a child of the insured entitled to child's benefits. However, a deduction is not made for any month in which he or she is age 62 or over, but under full retirement age, and there is in effect a certificate of election for him or her to receive actuarially reduced wife's or husband's benefits for such month (see subpart D of this part). 


(b) *Mother's or father's benefits*—(1) *Widow or widower.* A deduction is made from the mother's or father's benefits to which he or she is entitled as the widow or widower (see subpart D of this part) of the deceased individual upon whose earnings such benefit is based, for any month in which he or she does not have in his or her care a child who is entitled to child's benefits based on the earnings of the deceased insured individual. 


(2) *Surviving divorced mother or father.* A deduction is made from the mother's or father's benefits to which he or she is entitled as the surviving divorced mother or father (see subpart D of this part) of the deceased individual upon whose earnings record such benefit is based, for any month in which she or he does not have in care a child of the deceased individual who is her or his son, daughter, or legally adopted child and who is entitled to child's benefits based on the earnings of the deceased insured individual. 


(c) *Amount to be deducted.* The amount deducted from the benefits, as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, is equal to the amount of the benefits which is otherwise payable for the month in which she or he does not have a child in his or her care. 


(d) *When a child is considered not entitled to benefits.* For purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a person is considered not entitled to child's benefits for any month in which she or he is age 18 or over and is entitled to child's benefits because she or he is a full-time student at an educational institution. This paragraph applies to benefits for months after December 1964.
