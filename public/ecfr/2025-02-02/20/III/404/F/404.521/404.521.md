(b) That we will collect the overpayment by requesting that the Department of the Treasury reduce any amounts payable to the overpaid person as refunds of Federal and State income taxes by an amount equal to the amount of the overpayment unless, within 60 calendar days from the date of our notice, the overpaid person:


(1) Repays the overpayment in full; or


(2) Provides evidence to us at the address given in our notice that the overpayment is not past due or legally enforceable; or


(3) Asks us to waive collection of the overpayment under section 204(b) of the Act.
