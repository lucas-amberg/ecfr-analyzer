# ยง 404.611   How do I file an application for Social Security benefits?

(a) *General rule.* You must apply for benefits on an application that we prescribe. *See* ยง 422.505(a) of this chapter for the types of applications we will accept. *See* ยง 404.614 for places where you can file your application for benefits. 


(b) *What if I file a claim with the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB)?* If you file an application with the RRB on one of its forms for an annuity under section 2 of the Railroad Retirement Act, as amended, we will consider this an application for title II Social Security benefits, which you may be entitled to, unless you tell us otherwise. 


(c) *What if I file a claim with the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA)?* If you file an application with the DVA on one of its forms for survivors' dependency and indemnity compensation (*see* section 3005 of title 38 U.S.C.), we will consider this an application for Social Security survivors' benefits, except for the lump sum death payment.
