# ยง 404.750   Evidence of a parent's support.

If you apply for parent's benefits, we will ask you for evidence to show that you received at least one-half of your support from the insured person in the one-year period before he or she died or became disabled. We may also ask others who know the facts for a signed statement about your sources of support. We will ask you for the following evidence:


(a) The parent's signed statement showing his or her income, any other sources of support, and the amount from each source over the one-year period.


(b) If the statement described in paragraph (a) of this section cannot be obtained, other convincing evidence that the parent received one-half of his or her support from the insured person.
