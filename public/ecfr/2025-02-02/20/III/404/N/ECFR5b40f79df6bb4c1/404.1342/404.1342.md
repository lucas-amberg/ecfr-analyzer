# ยง 404.1342   Limits on granting World War II and post-World War II wage credits.

(a) You get wage credits for World War II or post-World War II active service only if the use of the wage credits results in entitlement to a monthly benefit, a higher monthly benefit, or a lump-sum death payment.


(b) You may get wage credits for active service in July 1947 for either the World War II period or the post-World War II period but not for both. If your active service is before and on or after July 25, 1947, we add the $160 wage credit to the period which is most advantageous to you.


(c) You do not get wage credits for the World War II period if another Federal benefit (other than one payable by the Veterans Administration) is determined by a Federal agency or an instrumentality owned entirely by the United States to be payable to you, even though the Federal benefit is not actually paid or is paid and then terminated, based in part on your active service during the World War II period except as explained in ยง 404.1343.


(d) You do not get wage credits for the post-World War II period if another Federal benefit (other than one payable by the Veterans Administration) is determined by a Federal agency or an instrumentality owned entirely by the United States to be payable to you, even though the Federal benefit is not actually paid or is paid and then terminated, based in part on your active service during the post-World War II period except as explained in ยง 404.1343.
