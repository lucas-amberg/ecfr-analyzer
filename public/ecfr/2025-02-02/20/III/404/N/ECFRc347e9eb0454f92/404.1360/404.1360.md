# § 404.1360   Veterans Administration pension or compensation payable.

(a) *Before we determine and certify payment.* If we are informed by the Veterans Administration that a pension or compensation is payable to you before we determine and certify payment of benefits based on deemed insured status, we compute your monthly benefit or lump-sum death payment based on the death of the World War II veteran without using the wage credits discussed in § 404.1350.


(b) *After we determine and certify payment.* If we are informed by the Veterans Administration that a pension or compensation is payable to you after we determine and certify payment of benefits based on deemed insured status, we—


(1) Stop payment of your benefits or recompute the amount of any further benefits that can be paid to you; and


(2) Determine whether you were erroneously paid and the amount of any erroneous payment.
