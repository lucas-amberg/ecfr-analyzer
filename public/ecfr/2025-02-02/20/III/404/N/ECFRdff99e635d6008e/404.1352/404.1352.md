# § 404.1352   Benefits and payments based on deemed insured status.

(a) *Our determination.* We determine your monthly benefit or lump-sum death payment under the deemed insured status provisions in §§ 404.1350 and 404.1351 regardless of whether the Veterans Administration has determined that any pension or compensation is payable to you.


(b) *Certification for payment.* If we determine that you can be paid a monthly benefit or lump-sum death payment, we certify these benefits for payment. However, the amount of your monthly benefit or lump-sum death payment may be changed if we are informed by the Veterans Administration that a pension or compensation is payable because of the veteran's death as explained in § 404.1360.


(c) *Payments not considered as pension or compensation.* We do not consider as pension or compensation—


(1) National Service Life Insurance payments;


(2) United States Government Life Insurance payments; or


(3) Burial allowance payments made by the Veterans Administration.
