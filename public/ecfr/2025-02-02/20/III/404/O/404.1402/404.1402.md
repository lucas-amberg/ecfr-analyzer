# § 404.1402   When are railroad industry services by a non-vested worker covered under Social Security?

If you are a non-vested worker, we (the Social Security Administration) will consider your services in the railroad industry to be “employment” as defined in section 210 of the Social Security Act for the following purposes: 


(a) To determine entitlement to, or the amount of, any monthly benefits or lump-sum death payment on the basis of your wages and self-employment income; 


(b) To determine entitlement to, or the amount of, any survivor monthly benefit or any lump-sum death payment on the basis of your wages and self-employment income provided you did not have a “current connection” with the railroad industry, as defined in section 1(o) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, as amended, (45 U.S.C. 231(o)), at the time of your death; (in such cases, survivor benefits are not payable under the Railroad Retirement Act); 


(c) To determine entitlement to a period of disability (*see* subpart B of this part) on the basis of your wages and self-employment income; or 


(d) To apply the provisions of section 203 of the Social Security Act concerning deductions from benefits under the annual earnings test (*see* subpart E of this part).
