# § 408.206   What happens when you apply for SVB?

(a) *General rule.* When you apply for SVB, we will ask you for documents and other information that we need to determine if you meet all the requirements for qualification. You must give us complete information (*see* subpart D of this part for our rules on evidence). If you do not meet all of the requirements for qualification listed in § 408.202, or if one of the conditions listed in § 408.204 exists, we will deny your claim. 


(b) *If you are a qualified individual residing in the United States.* If you meet all the requirements for qualification listed in § 408.202 and if none of the conditions listed in § 408.204 exist, we will send you a letter telling you the following: 


(1) You are qualified for SVB; 


(2) In order to become entitled to SVB, you will have to begin residing outside the United States by the end of the fourth calendar month after the month in which your notice of qualification is dated. For example, if our letter is dated May 15, you must establish residence outside the United States before October 1 of that year; and 


(3) What documents and information you must give us to establish that you are residing outside the United States.
