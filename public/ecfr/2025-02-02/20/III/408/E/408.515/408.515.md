# ยง 408.515   When do we make SVB payments?

SVB payments are made on the first day of each month and represent payment for that month. If the first day of the month falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal legal holiday, payment will be made on the first day preceding such day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal legal holiday.
