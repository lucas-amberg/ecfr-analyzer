# ยง 411.250   How will SSA evaluate a PM?

(a) We will periodically conduct a formal evaluation of the PM. The evaluation will include, but not be limited to, an assessment examining the following areas:


(1) Quality of services;


(2) Cost control;


(3) Timeliness of performance;


(4) Business relations; and


(5) Customer satisfaction.


(b) Our Project Officer will perform the evaluation. The PM will have an opportunity to comment on the evaluation, and then the Contracting Officer will determine the PM's final rating.


(c) These performance evaluations will be made part of our database on contractor past performance to which any Federal agency may have access.


(d) Failure to comply with the standards used in the evaluation may result in early termination of our agreement with the PM.
