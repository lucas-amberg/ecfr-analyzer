(a) We will periodically review the results of the work of each EN to ensure effective quality assurance in the provision of services by ENs.


(b) In conducting such a review, we will solicit and consider the views of the individuals the EN serves and the PM which monitors the EN.


(c) ENs must make the results of these periodic reviews available to disabled beneficiaries to assist them in choosing among available ENs.
