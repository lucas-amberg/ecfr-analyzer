# ยง 411.585   Can a State VR agency and an EN both receive payment for serving the same beneficiary?

Yes. A State VR agency and an EN can both receive payment for serving the same beneficiary, but the ticket can only be assigned to one EN, including a State VR agency acting as an EN, at a time. It also cannot be assigned to an EN and placed in the VR cost reimbursement status at the same time.


(a) A State VR agency may act as an EN and serve a beneficiary. In this case, both the State VR agency acting as an EN and another EN may be eligible for payment based on the same ticket (see ยง 411.560).


(b) If a State VR agency is paid by us under the VR cost reimbursement option, such payment does not preclude payment by us to an EN or to another State VR agency acting as an EN under its elected EN payment system. A subsequent VR agency also may choose to be paid under the VR cost reimbursement option.


(c) If an EN or a State VR agency acting as an EN is paid by us under one of the EN payment systems, that does not preclude payment by us to a different State VR agency under the VR cost reimbursement option. The subsequent State VR agency also may choose to be paid under its elected EN payment system.
