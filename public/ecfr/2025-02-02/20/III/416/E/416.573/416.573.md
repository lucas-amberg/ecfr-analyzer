# ยง 416.573   How much will we withhold from your title II and title VIII benefits to recover a title XVI overpayment?

(a) If past-due benefits are payable to you, we will withhold the lesser of the entire overpayment balance or the entire amount of past-due benefits.


(b)(1) We will collect the overpayment from current monthly benefits due in a month by withholding the lesser of the amount of the entire overpayment balance or 10 percent of the monthly title II benefits and monthly title VIII benefits payable to you in the month.


(2) If we are already recovering a title II, title VIII or title XVI overpayment from your monthly title II benefit, we will figure your monthly withholding from title XVI payments (as described in ยง 416.571) without including your title II benefits in your total countable income.


(3) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply if:


(i) You request and we approve a different rate of withholding, or


(ii) You or your spouse willfully misrepresented or concealed material information in connection with the overpayment.


(c) In determining whether to grant your request that we withhold less than the amount described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, we will use the criteria applied under ยง 416.571 to similar requests about withholding from title XVI benefits.


(d) If you or your spouse willfully misrepresented or concealed material information in connection with the overpayment, we will collect the overpayment by withholding the lesser of the overpayment balance or the entire amount of title II benefits and title VIII benefits payable to you. We will not collect at a lesser rate. (See ยง 416.571 for what we mean by concealment of material information.)
