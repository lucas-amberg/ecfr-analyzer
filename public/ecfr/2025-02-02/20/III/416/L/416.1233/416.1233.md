# ยง 416.1233   Exclusion of certain underpayments from resources.

(a) *General.* In determining the resources of an eligible individual (and spouse, if any), we will exclude, for 9 months following the month of receipt, the unspent portion of any title II or title XVI retroactive payment received on or after March 2, 2004. *Exception:* We will exclude for 6 months following the month of receipt the unspent portion of any title II or title XVI retroactive payment received before March 2, 2004. This exclusion also applies to such payments received by any other person whose resources are subject to deeming under this subpart.


(b) *Retroactive payments.* For purposes of this exclusion, a retroactive payment is one that is paid after the month in which it was due. A title XVI retroactive payment includes any retroactive amount of federally administered State supplementation.


(c) *Limitation on exclusion.* This exclusion applies only to any unspent portion of retroactive payments made under title II or XVI. Once the money from the retroactive payment is spent, this exclusion does not apply to items purchased with the money, even if the 6-month or 9-month period, whichever is applicable (see paragraph (a) of this section), has not expired. However, other exclusions may be applicable. As long as the funds from the retroactive payment are not spent, they are excluded for the full 6-month or 9-month period, whichever is applicable.


(d) *Funds must be identifiable.* Unspent money from a retroactive payment must be identifiable from other resources for this exclusion to apply. The money may be commingled with other funds but, if this is done in such a fashion that the retroactive amount can no longer be separately identified, that amount will count toward the resource limit described in ยง 416.1205.


(e) *Written notice.* We will give each recipient a written notice of the exclusion limitation when we make the retroactive payment.
