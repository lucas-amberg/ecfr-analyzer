# § 416.1240   Disposition of resources.

(a) Where the resources of an individual (and spouse, if any) are determined to exceed the limitations prescribed in § 416.1205, such individual (and spouse, if any) shall not be eligible for payment except under the conditions provided in this section. Payment will be made to an individual (and spouse, if any) if the individual agrees in writing to:


(1) Dispose of, at current market value, the nonliquid resources (as defined in § 416.1201(c)) in excess of the limitations prescribed in § 416.1205 within the time period specified in § 416.1242; and


(2) Repay any overpayments (as defined in § 416.1244) with the proceeds of such disposition.


(b) Payment made for the period during which the resources are being disposed of will be conditioned upon the disposition of those resources as prescribed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section. Any payments so made are (at the time of disposition) considered overpayments to the extent they would not have been paid had the disposition occurred at the beginning of the period for which such payments were made.


(c) If an individual fails to dispose of the resources as prescribed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, regardless of the efforts he or she makes to dispose of them, the resources will be counted at their current market value and the individual will be ineligible due to excess resources. We will use the original estimate of current market value unless the individual submits evidence establishing a lower value (e.g., an estimate from a disinterested knowledgeable source).
