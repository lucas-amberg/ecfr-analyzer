# ยง 422.607   Limited reopening of assignments.

On our own initiative, we may reopen and revise an assignment, whether or not it has been reviewed as described in this subpart, under the following conditions:


(a) The assignment reflects an error on the face of our records or the assignment was based upon fraud; and


(b) We sent to the assigned operator (or related person) notice of the assignment within 12 months of the time we decided to reopen that assignment.
