# ยง 431.110   Expedited review procedures for certain kinds of research involving no more than minimal risk, and for minor changes in approved research.

(a) The Secretary of HHS has established, and published as a Notice in the _Federal Register,_ a list of categories of research that may be reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure. The Secretary will evaluate the list at least every 8 years and amend it, as appropriate, after consultation with other federal departments and agencies and after publication in the _Federal Register_ for public comment. A copy of the list is available from the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office.


(b)(1) An IRB may use the expedited review procedure to review the following:


(i) Some or all of the research appearing on the list described in paragraph (a) of this section, unless the reviewer determines that the study involves more than minimal risk;


(ii) Minor changes in previously approved research during the period for which approval is authorized; or


(iii) Research for which limited IRB review is a condition of exemption under ยง 431.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), and (d)(7) and (8).


(2) Under an expedited review procedure, the review may be carried out by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the chairperson from among members of the IRB. In reviewing the research, the reviewers may exercise all of the authorities of the IRB except that the reviewers may not disapprove the research. A research activity may be disapproved only after review in accordance with the nonexpedited procedure set forth in ยง 431.108(b).


(c) Each IRB that uses an expedited review procedure shall adopt a method for keeping all members advised of research proposals that have been approved under the procedure.


(d) The department or agency head may restrict, suspend, terminate, or choose not to authorize an institution's or IRB's use of the expedited review procedure.
