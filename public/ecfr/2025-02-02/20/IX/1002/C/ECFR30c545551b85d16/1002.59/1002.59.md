# § 1002.59   Are there any circumstances in which special categories of persons are considered to perform “service in the uniformed services?”

Yes. In time of war or national emergency the President has authority to designate any category of persons as a “uniformed service” for purposes of USERRA. If the President exercises this authority, service as a member of that category of persons would be “service in the uniformed services” under USERRA.
