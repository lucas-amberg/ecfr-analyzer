If the payment is delayed, interest on the delayed payment will accrue from the normal due date (*i.e.*, September 30) and in the same manner as if the interest due on the advance(s) was an advance made on such due date. The Governor of a State which has decided to delay such interest payment shall notify the Secretary of Labor no later than September 1 of the year with respect to which the delay is applicable.
