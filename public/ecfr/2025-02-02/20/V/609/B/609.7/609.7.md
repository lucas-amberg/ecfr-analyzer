(b) *Rights of appeal and fair hearing.* The provisions on right to appeal and opportunity for a fair hearing with respect to claims for UCFE shall be consistent with this part and with sections 303(a)(1) and 303(a)(3) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 503(a)(1) and 503(a)(3).


(c) *Promptness on appeals.* (1) Decisions on appeals under the UCFE Program shall accord with the Secretary's “Standard for Appeals Promptness—Unemployment Compensation” in part 650 of this chapter, and with § 609.1(d).


(2) Any provision of an applicable State law for advancement or priority of unemployment compensation cases on judicial calendars, or otherwise intended to provide for the prompt payment of unemployment compensation when due, shall apply to proceedings involving claims for UCFE.


(d) *Appeal and review by Federal agency.* If a Federal agency believes that a State agency's determination or redetermination of an individual's eligibility for or entitlement to UCFE is incorrect, the Federal agency may seek appeal and review of such determination or redetermination in the same manner as an interested employer may seek appeal and review under the applicable State law.
