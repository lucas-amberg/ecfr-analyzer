Teleworkers do not have to be physically based at the location of the subject firm or in the same city or same State of the location that is identified on the determination document to be members of the certified worker group.


(k) *Successor-in-interest.* The Department considers workers employed by a firm that is a successor-in-interest to be members of a worker group even if they are not mentioned specifically within the determination document issued under ยง 618.235.
