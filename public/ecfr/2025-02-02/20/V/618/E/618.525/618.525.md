# § 618.525   Determinations, redeterminations, and appeals.

(a) *Determinations, redeterminations, and appeals.* States must apply the requirements of §§ 618.820 (determinations of eligibility; notices to individuals) and 618.828 (appeals and hearings), respectively, to all determinations, redeterminations, and appeals under this subpart.


(1) Before issuing a determination or redetermination, the State must verify and document the AAW's age, reemployment, and wages in determining whether the worker has met eligibility requirements of § 618.505(a).


(2) A determination of eligibility issued to an AAW must include a notice that the benefit amount will be regularly recomputed (as required by § 618.515(d)) and will change if the eligible AAW's reemployment wages change.


(3) An AAW denied individual eligibility based on nonqualifying reemployment may file a new application for a subsequent reemployment.


(4) A State may approve an RTAA payment retroactively if an AAW becomes reemployed before the Department issues a certification under subpart B of this part, provided that the AAW otherwise meets the eligibility requirements of § 618.505(a).


(b) *Recordkeeping requirements.* The recordkeeping and disclosure of information requirements of § 618.852 apply to the State's administration of RTAA.
