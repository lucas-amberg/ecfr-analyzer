# § 618.820   Determinations of eligibility; notices to individuals.

(a) *Determinations on initial applications.* The State whose State law is the applicable State law must, upon the filing of an initial application by an individual, promptly determine the individual's eligibility for TAA Program benefits under this part and may accept for such purposes information and findings supplied by another State.


(b) *Determinations on subsequent applications.* The State must, upon the filing of an application for payment of TRA, RTAA, subsistence and transportation, job search allowance, or relocation allowance, promptly determine whether the individual is eligible for such payment and, if eligible, the amount of such payment.


(c) *Redeterminations.* The provision for redeterminations under the applicable State law applies to determinations of eligibility for any benefit under this part.


(d) *Use of State law.* In making determinations or redeterminations under this section, or in reviewing such determinations or redeterminations under § 618.820, a State must apply the regulations in this part. As to matters committed by this part to be decided under the applicable State law, a CSA, a hearing officer, or a State court must apply the applicable State law and regulations thereunder, including the procedural requirements of the applicable State law or regulations, except that no provision of State law or State regulations on good cause for waiver of any time limit, or for late filing of any claim, will apply to any time limitation referred to or specified in this part, unless such State law or regulation is made applicable by a specific provision of this part. However, States must follow the good cause provision at § 618.730.


(e) *Notices to individuals.* The State must notify individuals in writing of any determination or redetermination of eligibility to TAA Program benefits. Each determination or redetermination must inform the individual of the reason for the determination or redetermination and of the right to reconsideration or appeal in the same manner as determinations of entitlement to UI are subject to redetermination or appeal under the applicable State law.


(f) *Promptness.* States must make full payment of TAA Program benefits when due with the greatest promptness that is administratively feasible.


(g) *Procedure.* Except where otherwise required by the Act or this part, the procedures for making and furnishing determinations, the promptness standards, and written notices of determinations to individuals, must be consistent with the Department's “Standard for Claim Determinations—Separation Information,” Employment Security Manual, part V, sections 6010 through 6015 (appendix B of this part).


(h) *Successor-in-interest.* (1) States are authorized to determine whether a firm is a successor-in-interest to a firm named as the employer of a worker group on a determination issued under subpart B of this part.


(2) The factors to be used to determine whether or not there is a successor-in-interest are established in § 618.110.


(3) If, after reviewing the successor-in-interest factors, the State believes that a denial of benefits is warranted, the State must file a new petition requesting an amendment to the certification under § 618.250.
