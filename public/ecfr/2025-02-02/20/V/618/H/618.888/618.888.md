# ยง 618.888   Equitable tolling.

(a) A TAA Program deadline must be equitably tolled when:


(1) An extraordinary circumstance prevented an individual's timely action; and


(2) The individual otherwise acted with diligence.


(b)(1) When an individual fails to take timely action because the State failed to give notice required under this part, that failure is prima facie evidence of an extraordinary circumstance.


(2) If the individual did not receive the required notice, but otherwise received actual notice with sufficient time to take timely action, the lack of receipt of the required notice is not evidence of an extraordinary circumstance.


(c) A TAA Program deadline equitably tolled under this section is tolled for the time period during which the extraordinary circumstance exists. Once that circumstance is resolved, the time period that was tolled begins to run again.


(d) Equitable tolling may extend an otherwise expired TAA Program deadline by no more than 36 months.
