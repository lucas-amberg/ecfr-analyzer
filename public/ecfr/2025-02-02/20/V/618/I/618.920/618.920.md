# ยง 618.920   Reserve fund distributions.

(a) The 35 percent of the TaOA funds for a fiscal year that remains after the initial allocation will be held by the Department as a reserve. Reserve funds will be used, as needed, for additional distributions to States during the remainder of the fiscal year, including distributions to those States that did not receive an initial allocation. The amount of any distributions of reserve funds will be determined by the Department within the time frame described in ยง 618.930, as appropriate, considering the information provided in reserve fund requests submitted by States as described in paragraph (b) of this section and the level of reserve funds available.


(b) A State requesting reserve funds must demonstrate that:


(1) At least 50 percent of its TaOA funds from the current year (if any were received) and previous fiscal years have been expended; or


(2) The State needs additional TaOA funds to meet demands for services due to unusual and unexpected events, which includes an unexpected increase in the number of trade-affected workers eligible for TaOA.


(c) A State requesting reserve funds under paragraph (b) of this section also must provide a documented estimate of funding needs through the end of the fiscal year. That estimate must be based on an analysis that includes at least the following:


(1) The average cost of training in the State;


(2) The expected number of participants in training through the end of the fiscal year; and


(3) The remaining TaOA funds the State has available.
