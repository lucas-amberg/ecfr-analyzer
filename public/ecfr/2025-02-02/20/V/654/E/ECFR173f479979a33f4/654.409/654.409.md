(a) All living quarters and service rooms must be provided with properly installed, operable heating equipment capable of maintaining a temperature of at least 68 degrees Fahrenheit ( °F) if during the period of normal occupancy the temperature in such quarters falls below 68 °F.


(b) Any stoves or other sources of heat utilizing combustible fuel must be installed and vented in such a manner as to prevent fire hazards and a dangerous concentration of gases.
