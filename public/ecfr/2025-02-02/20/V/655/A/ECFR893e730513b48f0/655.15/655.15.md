# § 655.15   Application filing requirements.

All registered employers that desire to hire H-2B workers must file an *Application for Temporary Employment Certification* with the NPC designated by the Administrator, OFLC. Except for employers that qualify for emergency procedures at § 655.17, employers that fail to register under the procedures in § 655.11 and/or that fail to submit a PWD obtained under § 655.10 will not be eligible to file an *Application for Temporary Employment Certification* and their applications will be returned without review.


(a) *What to file.* A registered employer seeking H-2B workers must file a completed *Application for Temporary Employment Certification* (ETA Form 9142B and the appropriate appendices and valid PWD), a copy of the job order being submitted concurrently to the SWA serving the area of intended employment, as set forth in § 655.16, and copies of all contracts and agreements with any agent and/or recruiter, executed in connection with the job opportunities and all information required, as specified in §§ 655.8 and 655.9.


(b) *Timeliness.* A completed *Application for Temporary Employment Certification* must be filed no more than 90 calendar days and no less than 75 calendar days before the employer's date of need.


(c) *Location and method of filing.* The employer must submit the *Application for Temporary Employment Certification* and all required supporting documentation to the NPC either electronically or by mail.


(d) *Original signature.* The *Application for Temporary Employment Certification* must bear the original signature of the employer (and that of the employer's authorized attorney or agent if the employer is so represented). If the *Application for Temporary Employment Certification* is filed electronically, the employer must satisfy this requirement by signing the *Application for Temporary Employment Certification* as directed by the CO.


(e) *Requests for multiple positions.* Certification of more than one position may be requested on the *Application for Temporary Employment Certification* as long as all H-2B workers will perform the same services or labor under the same terms and conditions, in the same occupation, in the same area of intended employment, and during the same period of employment.


(f) *Separate applications.* Except as otherwise permitted by this paragraph (f), only one *Application for Temporary Employment Certification* may be filed for worksite(s) within one area of intended employment for each job opportunity with an employer for each period of employment. Except where otherwise permitted under § 655.4, an association or other organization of employers is not permitted to file master applications on behalf of its employer-members under the H-2B program.


(1) Subject to paragraph (f)(2) of this section, if a petition for H-2B nonimmigrants filed by an employer in the seafood industry is granted, the employer may bring the nonimmigrants described in the petition into the United States at any time during the 120-day period beginning on the start date for which the employer is seeking the services of the nonimmigrants without filing another petition.


(2) An employer in the seafood industry may not bring H-2B nonimmigrants into the United States after the date that is 90 days after the start date for which the employer is seeking the services of the nonimmigrants unless the employer conducts new recruitment, that begins at least 45 days after, and ends before the 90th day after, the certified start date of need as follows:


(i) Completes a new assessment of the local labor market by—


(A) Listing the job orders in local newspapers on 2 separate Sundays; and


(B) Placing new job orders for the job opportunity with the State Workforce Agency serving the area of intended employment and posting the job opportunity at the place of employment for at least 10 days; and


(C) Offering the job to an equally or better qualified United States worker who—


(*1*) Applies for the job; and


(*2*) Will be available at the time and place of need.


(3) In order to comply with this provision, employers in the seafood industry must—


(*1*) Sign and date an attestation form stating the employer's compliance with this subparagraph. The attestation form is available at *http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/form.cfm;*

(*2*) Provide each H-2B nonimmigrant worker seeking admission to the United States a copy of the signed and dated attestation, with instructions that the worker must present the documentation upon request to the Department of State's consular officers when they apply for a visa and/or the Department of Homeland Security's U.S Customs and Border Protection officers when seeking admission to the United States. Without this attestation, an H-2B nonimmigrant may be denied a visa or admission to the United States if seeking to enter at any time other than the start date stated in the petition. (The attestation is not necessary when filing an amended petition based on a worker who is being substituted in accordance with DHS regulations.) The attestation presented by an H-2B nonimmigrant worker must be the official attestation downloaded from OFLC's Web site and may not be altered or revised in any manner; and


(*3*) Retain the additional recruitment documentation, together with their prefiling recruitment documentation, for a period of 3 years from the date of certification, consistent with the document retention requirements under § 655.56. Seafood industry employers who conduct the required additional recruitment should not submit proof of the additional recruitment to the Office of Foreign Labor Certification.


(g) *One-time occurrence.* Where a one-time occurrence lasts longer than 1 year, the CO will instruct the employer on any additional recruitment requirements with respect to the continuing validity of the labor market test or offered wage obligation.


(h) *Information dissemination.* Information received in the course of processing a request for an *H-2B Registration,* an *Application for Temporary Employment Certification* or program integrity measures such as audits may be forwarded from OFLC to WHD, or any other Federal agency as appropriate, for investigative and/or enforcement purposes.
