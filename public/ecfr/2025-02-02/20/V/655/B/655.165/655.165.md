# ยง 655.165   Partial certification.

The CO may issue a partial certification, reducing either the period of employment or the number of H-2A workers being requested or both for certification, based upon information the CO receives during the course of processing the *Application for Temporary Employment Certification,* an audit, or otherwise. The number of workers certified will be reduced by one for each U.S. worker who is able, willing, and qualified, and who will be available at the time and place needed and has not been rejected for lawful, job-related reasons, to perform the labor or services. If a partial labor certification is issued, the CO will send the Final Determination notice approving partial certification using the procedures at ยง 655.162. The Final Determination notice will:


(a) State the reason(s) the period of employment and/or the number of H-2A workers requested has been reduced, citing the relevant regulatory standards;


(b) Offer the employer an opportunity to request an expedited administrative review or a de novo administrative hearing before an ALJ of the partial certification under ยง 655.171; and


(c) State that if the employer does not request an expedited administrative judicial review or a de novo hearing before an ALJ in accordance with ยง 655.171, the partial certification is final, and the Department will not accept any appeal on that *Application for Temporary Employment Certification*.
