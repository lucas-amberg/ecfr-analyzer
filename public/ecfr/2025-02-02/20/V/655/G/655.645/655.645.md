Posthearing briefs will not be permitted except at the request of the administrative law judge. When permitted, any such brief shall be limited to the issue or issues specified by the administrative law judge, shall be due within the time prescribed by the administrative law judge, and shall be served on each other party in accordance with § 655.640 of this part. 


(e) In reaching a decision, the administrative law judge shall, in accordance with the Act, impose the following burden of proof— 


(1) The attesting employer shall have the burden of producing facts and evidence to establish the matters required by the attestation at issue; 


(2) The burden of proof as to the applicability of the automated vessel exception shall be on the party to the hearing who is asserting that the employer is not eligible for the exception.
