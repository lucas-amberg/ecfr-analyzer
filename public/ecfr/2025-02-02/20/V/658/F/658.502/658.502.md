For final debarment orders, the SWA must specify the time period for which the employer is debarred from participating in one of the Department's foreign labor certification programs. The SWA must notify the employer that all ES services will be terminated unless the employer within 20 working days:

(ii) Provides adequate evidence that, as applicable:


(A) The Department's debarment is no longer in effect; and


(B) The employer has completed all required actions imposed by the enforcement agency as a consequence of the violation, including payment of any fines or restitution to remediate the violation; and


(iii) Provides assurances that any policies, procedures, or conditions responsible for the violation have been corrected and the same or similar violations are not likely to occur in the future.


(5) Where the decision is based on § 658.501(a)(5), the SWA must specify which ES regulation, as defined in § 651.10, the employer has violated and must provide basic facts to explain the violation. The SWA must notify the employer that all ES services will be terminated unless the employer within 20 working days:

The SWA must notify the employer that all ES services will be terminated unless the employer within 20 working days:


(i) Provides adequate evidence that the workers were accepted; or


(ii) Provides adequate evidence that the workers were not available to accept the job; or


(iii) Provides adequate evidence that the workers were not qualified; or


(iv) Provides adequate evidence that the workers were referred after the time period described in § 655.135(d) of this chapter elapsed; or


(v) Provides adequate evidence that:


(A) After refusal, the employer accepted the qualified workers referred; or


(B) Appropriate restitution has been made or other remedial action taken; and


(vi) Provides assurances that qualified workers referred in the future will be accepted or, if the time period described in § 655.135(d) of this chapter has lapsed, provides assurances that qualified workers referred on all future criteria clearance orders will be accepted.


(7) Where the decision is based on § 658.501(a)(7), the SWA must explain how the employer did not cooperate in the field check. The SWA must notify the employer that all ES services will be terminated unless the employer within 20 working days:

(b) SWA officials must discontinue services immediately in accordance with § 658.503, without providing the notice described in this section, if an employer has met any of the bases for discontinuation of services under § 658.501(a) and, in the judgment of the State Administrator, exhaustion of the administrative procedures set forth in this section would cause substantial harm to workers.
