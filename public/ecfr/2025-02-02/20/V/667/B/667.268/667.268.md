# ยง 667.268   What prohibitions apply to the use of WIA title I funds to encourage business relocation?

(a) WIA funds may not be used or proposed to be used for: 


(1) The encouragement or inducement of a business, or part of a business, to relocate from any location in the United States, if the relocation results in any employee losing his or her job at the original location; 


(2) Customized training, skill training, or on-the-job training or company specific assessments of job applicants or employees of a business or a part of a business that has relocated from any location in the United States, until the company has operated at that location for 120 days, if the relocation has resulted in any employee losing his or her jobs at the original location. 


(b) *Pre-award review.* To verify that an establishment which is new or expanding is not, in fact, relocating employment from another area, standardized pre-award review criteria developed by the State must be completed and documented jointly by the local area with the establishment as a prerequisite to WIA assistance. 


(1) The review must include names under which the establishment does business, including predecessors and successors in interest; the name, title, and address of the company official certifying the information, and whether WIA assistance is sought in connection with past or impending job losses at other facilities, including a review of whether WARN notices relating to the employer have been filed. 


(2) The review may include consultations with labor organizations and others in the affected local area(s). (WIA sec. 181(d).)
