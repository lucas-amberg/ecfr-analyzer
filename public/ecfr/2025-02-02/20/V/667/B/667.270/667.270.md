# ยง 667.270   What safeguards are there to ensure that participants in Workforce Investment Act employment and training activities do not displace other employees?

(a) A participant in a program or activity authorized under title I of WIA must not displace (including a partial displacement, such as a reduction in the hours of non-overtime work, wages, or employment benefits) any currently employed employee (as of the date of the participation). 


(b) A program or activity authorized under title I of WIA must not impair existing contracts for services or collective bargaining agreements. When a program or activity authorized under title I of WIA would be inconsistent with a collective bargaining agreement, the appropriate labor organization and employer must provide written concurrence before the program or activity begins. 


(c) A participant in a program or activity under title I of WIA may not be employed in or assigned to a job if: 


(1) Any other individual is on layoff from the same or any substantially equivalent job; 


(2) The employer has terminated the employment of any regular, unsubsidized employee or otherwise caused an involuntary reduction in its workforce with the intention of filling the vacancy so created with the WIA participant; or 


(3) The job is created in a promotional line that infringes in any way on the promotional opportunities of currently employed workers. 


(d) Regular employees and program participants alleging displacement may file a complaint under the applicable grievance procedures found at ยง 667.600. (WIA sec. 181.)
