# ยง 669.160   How do we consult with NFJP organizations in developing rules, regulations and standards of accountability, and other policy guidance for the NFJP?

(a) We consider the NFJP grantee community as a full partner in the development of policies for the NFJPs under the Act. 


(b) We have established and continue to support the Federal MSFW Employment and Training Advisory Committee. Through the Advisory Committee, we actively seek and consider the views of the grantee community before establishing policies and/or program regulations, according to the requirements of WIA section 167.
