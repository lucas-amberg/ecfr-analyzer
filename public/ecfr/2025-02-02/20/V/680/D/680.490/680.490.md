(b) Program-specific performance information must include:


(1) The information described in WIOA sec. 122(b)(2)(A) for individuals participating in the programs of training services who are receiving assistance under WIOA. This information includes indicators of performance as described in WIOA secs. 116(b)(2)(I)-(IV) and § 680.460(g)(1) through (4);

(d) Governors must establish a procedure by which a provider can demonstrate that providing additional information required under this section would be unduly burdensome or costly. If the Governor determines that providers have demonstrated such extraordinary costs or undue burden:


(1) The Governor must provide access to cost-effective methods for the collection of the information;


(2) The Governor may provide additional resources to assist providers in the collection of the information from funds for statewide workforce investment activities reserved under WIOA secs. 128(a) and 133(a)(1); or


(3) The Governor may take other steps to assist eligible training providers in collecting and supplying required information such as offering technical assistance.
