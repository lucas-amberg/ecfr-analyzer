# ยง 681.280   Is a youth with a disability eligible for youth services under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act if his or her family income exceeds the income eligibility criteria?

Yes, for an individual with a disability, income level for eligibility purposes is based on the individual's own income rather than his or her family's income. WIOA sec. 3(36)(A)(vi) states that an individual with a disability whose own income meets the low-income definition in clause (ii) (income that does not exceed the higher of the poverty line or 70 percent of the lower living standard income level), but who is a member of a family whose income exceeds this income requirement is eligible for youth services. Furthermore, only ISY with a disability must be low income. OSY with a disability are not required to be low-income.
