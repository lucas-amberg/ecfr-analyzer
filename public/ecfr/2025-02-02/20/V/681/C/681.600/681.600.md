# ยง 681.600   What are work experiences?

(a) Work experiences are a planned, structured learning experience that takes place in a workplace for a limited period of time. Work experience may be paid or unpaid, as appropriate. A work experience may take place in the private for-profit sector, the non-profit sector, or the public sector. Labor standards apply in any work experience where an employee/employer relationship, as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act or applicable State law, exists. Consistent with ยง 680.840 of this chapter, funds provided for work experiences may not be used to directly or indirectly aid in the filling of a job opening that is vacant because the former occupant is on strike, or is being locked out in the course of a labor dispute, or the filling of which is otherwise an issue in a labor dispute involving a work stoppage. Work experiences provide the youth participant with opportunities for career exploration and skill development.

(c) The types of work experiences include the following categories:


(1) Summer employment opportunities and other employment opportunities available throughout the school year;


(2) Pre-apprenticeship programs;


(3) Internships and job shadowing; and


(4) On-the-job training (OJT) opportunities as defined in WIOA sec. 3(44) and in ยง 680.700 of this chapter.
