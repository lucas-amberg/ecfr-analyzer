# ยง 683.210   What audit requirements apply to the use of Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act title I and Wagner-Peyser Act funds?

All recipients of WIOA title I and Wagner-Peyser Act funds that expend more than the minimum amounts specified in 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, in Federal awards during their fiscal year must have a program specific or single audit conducted in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart F.


(a) *Commercial or for-profit.* Grant recipients and subrecipients of title I and Wagner-Peyser Act funds that are commercial or for-profit entities must adhere to the requirements contained in 2 CFR part 200, subpart F.


(b) *Subrecipients and contractors.* An auditee may simultaneously be a recipient, a subrecipient, and a contractor depending on the substance of its agreements with Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities. Federal awards expended as a recipient or subrecipient are subject to audit requirements under 2 CFR part 200, subpart F.


(c) *Contractors.* The payments received for goods or services provided as a contractor are not Federal awards. Subrecipient and contractor determinations made under 2 CFR 200.330 must be considered in determining whether payments constitute a Federal award or a payment for goods and services provided as a contractor.
