# § 684.420   What are the planning requirements for receiving supplemental youth services funding?

Applicants eligible to apply for supplemental youth funding must describe the supplemental youth services they intend to provide in the 4-year plan that they will submit as part of the competitive application process. The information on youth services will be incorporated into the overall 4-year plan, which is more fully described in §§ 684.700 and 684.710, and is required for both adult and youth funds. As indicated in § 684.710(c), additional planning information required for applicants requesting supplemental youth funding will be provided in the FOA. The Department envisions that the strategy for youth funds will not be extensive; however, grantees will be required to provide the number of youth it plans to serve and projected performance outcomes. The Department also supports youth activities that preserve INA culture and will support strategies that promote INA values.
