# ยง 688.100   What is YouthBuild?

(a) YouthBuild is a workforce development program that provides employment, education, leadership development, and training opportunities to disadvantaged and low-income youth between the ages of 16 and 24, most of whom are secondary school drop outs and are either a member of a low-income family, a foster care youth, a youth who is homeless, an offender, a youth with a disability, a child of an incarcerated parent, or a migrant youth.


(b) Program participants receive education services that may lead to either a high school diploma or its State-recognized equivalent. Further, they receive occupational skills training and are encouraged to pursue postsecondary education or additional training, including registered apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs. The program is designed to create a skilled workforce either in the construction industry, through the rehabilitation and construction of housing for homeless and low-income individuals and families, as well as public facilities, or in other in-demand industries or occupations. The program also benefits the larger community because it provides increased access to affordable housing.
