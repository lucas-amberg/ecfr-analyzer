# § 703.209   Substitution and withdrawal of indemnity bond, letters of credit or negotiable securities.

(a) A carrier may not substitute other security for any indemnity bond or letters of credit deposited under the regulations in this part except when authorized by the Branch. A carrier may, however, substitute negotiable securities acceptable under the regulations in this part for previously-deposited negotiable securities without the Branch's prior approval.


(b) A carrier that has ceased to write insurance under the Act may apply to the Branch for withdrawal of its security deposit. The carrier must file with its application a sworn statement setting forth—


(1) A list of all cases in each State in which the carrier is paying compensation, together with the names of the employees and other beneficiaries, a description of causes of injury or death, and a statement of the amount of compensation paid;


(2) A similar list of all pending cases in which the carrier has not yet paid compensation; and


(3) A similar list of all cases in which injury or death has occurred within one year before such application or in which the last payment of compensation was made within one year before such application.


(c) The Branch may authorize withdrawal of previously-deposited indemnity bonds, letters of credit and negotiable securities that, in the opinion of the Branch, are not necessary to provide adequate security for the payment of the carrier's outstanding and potential LHWCA liabilities. No withdrawals will be authorized unless there has been no claim activity involving the carrier for a minimum of five years, and the Branch is reasonably certain that no further claims will arise.
