# ยง 725.214   Determination of relationship; surviving spouse.

An individual shall be considered to be the surviving spouse of a miner if: 


(a) The courts of the State in which the miner was domiciled (see ยง 725.231) at the time of his or her death would find that the individual and the miner were validly married; or 


(b) The courts of the State in which the miner was domiciled (see ยง 725.231) at the time of the miner's death would find that the individual was the miner's surviving spouse; or 


(c) Under State law, such individual would have the right of the spouse to share in the miner's intestate personal property; or 


(d) Such individual went through a marriage ceremony with the miner, resulting in a purported marriage between them which, but for a legal impediment (see ยง 725.230), would have been a valid marriage, unless such individual entered into the purported marriage with knowledge that it was not a valid marriage, or if such individual and the miner were not living in the same household at the time of the miner's death.
