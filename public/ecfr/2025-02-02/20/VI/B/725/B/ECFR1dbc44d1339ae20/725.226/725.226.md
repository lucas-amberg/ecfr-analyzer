# § 725.226   “Good cause” for delayed filing of proof of support.

(a) *What constitutes “good cause.”* “Good cause” may be found for failure to file timely proof of support where the parent, brother, or sister establishes to the satisfaction of the Office that such failure to file was due to: 


(1) Circumstances beyond the individual's control, such as extended illness, mental, or physical incapacity, or communication difficulties; or 


(2) Incorrect or incomplete information furnished the individual by the Office; or 


(3) Efforts by the individual to secure supporting evidence without a realization that such evidence could be submitted after filing proof of support. 


(b) *What does not constitute “good cause.”* “Good cause” for failure to file timely proof of support (see § 725.222(a)(3)) does not exist when there is evidence of record in the Office that the individual was informed that he or she should file within the prescribed period and he or she failed to do so deliberately or through negligence.
