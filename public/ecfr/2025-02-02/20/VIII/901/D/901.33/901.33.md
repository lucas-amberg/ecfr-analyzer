# ยง 901.33   Initiation of proceeding.

Whenever the Executive Director has reason to believe that an enrolled actuary has violated any provision of the laws or regulations governing enrollment, such individual may be reprimanded or a proceeding may be initiated for the suspension or termination of such individual's enrollment. A reprimand as used in this paragraph is a statement informing the enrolled actuary that, in the opinion of the Executive Director, his/her conduct is in violation of the regulations and admonishing the enrolled actuary that repetition of the conduct occasioning the reprimand may result in the institution of a proceeding for the suspension or termination of the actuary's enrollment. A proceeding for suspension or termination of enrollment shall be initiated by a complaint naming the respondent actuary, signed by the Executive Director and filed in the Executive Director's office. Except in cases where the nature of the proceeding or the public interest does not permit, a proceeding will not be initiated under this section until the facts which may warrant such a proceeding have been called to the attention of the actuary in writing and he/she has been given an opportunity to respond to the allegations of misconduct.
