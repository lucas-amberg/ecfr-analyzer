(3) Appropriately validated for use in such food testing, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section; and


(4) Appropriately verified by the LAAF-accredited laboratory for use in such food testing, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

(d)(1) Before a LAAF-accredited laboratory conducts food testing under this subpart using a method for a specific intended use for which the method has been validated, but for which the LAAF-accredited laboratory has not previously applied the method under this subpart, the LAAF-accredited laboratory must have verified it can properly perform the method for the specific intended use.


(2) A LAAF-accredited laboratory performing verification of a method under this subpart must record the method that is the subject of the verification, the intended purpose of the analysis, the results of the verification, the procedure used for the verification, supporting analytical data, and whether the LAAF-accredited laboratory is able to properly perform the method.


(e) A LAAF-accredited laboratory may submit a written request to FDA requesting permission to use a method outside of its scope of LAAF-accreditation for food testing. FDA may approve the request if both following conditions are satisfied:
