# ยง 73.250   Fruit juice.

(a) *Identity.* (1) The color additive fruit juice is prepared either by expressing the juice from mature varieties of fresh, edible fruits, or by the water infusion of the dried fruit. The color additive may be concentrated or dried. The definition of fruit juice in this paragraph is for the purpose of identity as a color additive only and shall not be construed as a standard of identity under section 401 of the act. However, where a standard of identity for a particular fruit juice has been promulgated under section 401 of the act, it shall conform to such standard.


(2) Color additive mixtures made with fruit juice may contain as diluents only those substances listed in this subpart as safe and suitable in color additive mixtures for coloring foods.


(b) *Uses and restrictions.* Fruit juice may be safely used for the coloring of foods generally, in amounts consistent with good manufacturing practice, except that it may not be used to color foods for which standards of identity have been promulgated under section 401 of the act, unless the use of added color is authorized by such standards.


(c) *Labeling.* The color additive and any mixtures intended solely or in part for coloring purposes prepared therefrom shall bear, in addition to the other information required by the act, labeling in accordance with the provisions of ยง 70.25 of this chapter.


(d) *Exemption from certification.* Certification of this color additive is not necessary for the protection of the public health, and therefore batches thereof are exempt from the certification requirements of section 721(c) of the act.
