(1) Establish and implement temperature controls adequate to significantly minimize or prevent the growth of, or toxin production by, pathogens;


(2) Monitor the temperature controls with adequate frequency to provide assurance that the temperature controls are consistently performed;


(3) If there is a loss of temperature control that may impact the safety of such refrigerated packaged food, take appropriate corrective actions to:


(i) Correct the problem and reduce the likelihood that the problem will recur;


(ii) Evaluate all affected food for safety; and


(iii) Prevent the food from entering commerce, if you cannot ensure the affected food is not adulterated under section 402 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act;

(i) Calibrating temperature monitoring and recording devices (or checking them for accuracy);


(ii) Reviewing records of calibration within a reasonable time after the records are created; and

(5) Establish and maintain the following records:


(i) Records (whether affirmative records demonstrating temperature is controlled or exception records demonstrating loss of temperature control) documenting the monitoring of temperature controls for any such refrigerated packaged food;


(ii) Records of corrective actions taken when there is a loss of temperature control that may impact the safety of any such refrigerated packaged food; and
