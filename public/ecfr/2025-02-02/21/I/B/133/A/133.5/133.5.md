# § 133.5   Methods of analysis.

Moisture, milkfat, and phosphatase levels in cheeses will be determined by the following methods of analysis from “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 13th ed., 1980, which is incorporated by reference (copies are available from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

(a) Moisture content—section 16.233 “Method I (52)—Official Final Action”, under the heading “Moisture”.


(b) Milkfat content—section 16.255 “Fat (60)—Official Final Action”.


(c) Phenol equivalent value—section 16.275 “Reagents”, section 16.276 “Sampling”, and section 16.277 “Determination”, under the heading “Residual Phosphatase (27) Official Final Action”.


(d) Milkfat in solids (fat on a dry basis)—Subtract the percent of moisture found from 100; divide the remainder into the percent milkfat found. The quotient, multiplied by 100, shall be considered to be the percent of milkfat contained in the solids.
