# § 133.140   Gammelost cheese.

(a) *Description.* (1) Gammelost cheese is the food prepared from nonfat milk, as defined in § 133.3, by the procedure set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or by any other procedure which produces a finished cheese having the same physical and chemical properties. The maximum moisture content is 52 percent by weight, as determined by the methods described in § 133.5.


(2) The dairy ingredients are subjected to the action of a lactic acid-producing bacterial culture. The development of acidity is continued until the dairy ingredients coagulate to a semisolid mass. The mass is stirred and heated until a temperature of about 145 °F is reached, and is held at that temperature for at least 30 minutes. The whey is drained off and the curd removed and placed in forms and pressed. The shaped curd is placed in whey and heated for 3 or 4 hours, and may again be pressed. It is then stored under conditions suitable for curing.


(b) *Nomenclature.* The name of the food is “gammelost cheese”.


(c) *Label declaration.* Each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter.
