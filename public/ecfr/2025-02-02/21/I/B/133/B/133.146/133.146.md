(b) *Composition.* (1) Each cheese ingredient used is present at a minimum level of 2 percent of the weight of the finished food.


(2) When one variety of cheese is used, the minimum milkfat content of the food is not more than 1 percent lower than the minimum prescribed by the standard of identity for that cheese.


(3) When two or more varieties of cheese are used, the minimum milkfat content is not more than 1 percent below the arithmetical average of the minimum fat content percentages prescribed by the standards of identity for the varieties of cheese used, and in no case is the milkfat content less than 31 percent.


(4) Milkfat and moisture contents are determined by the methods described in § 133.5.


(c) *Optional ingredients.* The following safe and suitable ingredients may be used:

The name “reggiano” may be used for “parmesan”.
