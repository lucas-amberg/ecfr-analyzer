(2) When a sweetener is added as a part of any such liquid packing medium, the density range of the resulting packing medium expressed as percent by weight of sucrose (degrees Brix) as determined by the procedure prescribed in § 145.3(m) shall be designated by the appropriate name for the respective density ranges, namely:


(i) When the density of the solution is 11 percent or more but less than 16 percent, the medium shall be designated as “slightly sweetened water”; or “extra light syrup”; “slightly sweetened fruit juice(s) and water”; or “slightly sweetened fruit juice(s)”, as the case may be.


(ii) When the density of the solution is 16 percent or more but less than 21 percent, the medium shall be designated as “light sirup”; “lightly sweetened fruit juice(s) and water”; or “lightly sweetened fruit juice(s)”, as the case may be.

(iv) When the density of the solution is 26 percent or more but not more than 35 percent, the medium shall be designated as “extra heavy sirup”; “extra heavily sweetened fruit juice(s) and water”; or “extra heavily sweetened fruit juice(s)”, as the case may be.


(d) *Labeling requirements.* (1) The name of the food is “figs”. The words “broken” or “split” shall be a part of the name when the optional fig ingredient is a broken or split fig. The name of the food shall also include a declaration of any flavoring that characterizes the product as specified in § 101.22 of this chapter and a declaration of any spice or seasoning that characterizes the product; for example, “Spice added”, or in lieu of the word “Spice”, the common name of the spice, “Seasoned with vinegar” or “Seasoned with unpeeled segments of citrus fruits”. When two or more of the optional ingredients specified in paragraphs (a) (2) through (5), inclusive, of this section are used, such words may be combined as for example, “Seasoned with cider vinegar, cloves, cinnamon oil and unpeeled segments of citrus fruits.”


(2) The name of the packing medium as used in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, preceded by “In” or “Packed in”, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, shall be included as part of the name or in close proximity to the name of the food.

When the liquid portion of the packing media provided for in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section consists of fruit juice(s), such juice(s) shall be designated in the name of the packing medium as:


(i) In the case of a single fruit juice, the name of the juice shall be used in lieu of the word “fruit”;


(ii) In the case of a combination of two or more fruit juices, the names of the juices in the order of predominance by weight shall either be used in lieu of the word “fruit” in the name of the packing medium, or be declared on the label as specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section; and


(iii) In the case of a single fruit juice or a combination of two or more fruit juices any of which are made from concentrate(s), the words “from concentrate(s)” shall follow the word “juice(s)” in the name of the packing medium and in the name(s) of such juice(s) when declared as specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
