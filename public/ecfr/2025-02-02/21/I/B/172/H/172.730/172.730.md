# § 172.730   Potassium bromate.

The food additive potassium bromate may be safely used in the malting of barley under the following prescribed conditions:


(a)(1) It is used or intended for use in the malting of barley under conditions whereby the amount of the additive present in the malt from the treatment does not exceed 75 parts per million of bromate (calculated as Br), and the treated malt is used only in the production of fermented malt beverages or distilled spirits.


(2) The total residue of inorganic bromides in fermented malt beverages, resulting from the use of the treated malt plus additional residues of inorganic bromides that may be present from uses in accordance with other regulations in this chapter promulgated under sections 408 and/or 409 of the act, does not exceed 25 parts per million of bromide (calculated as Br). No tolerance is established for bromide in distilled spirits because there is evidence that inorganic bromides do not pass over in the distillation process.


(b) To assure safe use of the additive, the label or labeling of the food additive shall bear, in addition to the other information required by the Act, the following:


(1) The name of the additive.


(2) Adequate directions for use.


(c) To assure safe use of the additive, the label or labeling of the treated malt shall bear, in addition to other information required by the Act, the statement, “Brewer's Malt—To be used in the production of fermented malt beverages only”, or “Distiller's Malt—To be used in the production of distilled spirits only”, whichever is the case.
