# § 172.886   Petroleum wax.

Petroleum wax may be safely used in or on food, in accordance with the following conditions:


(a) Petroleum wax is a mixture of solid hydrocarbons, paraffinic in nature, derived from petroleum, and refined to meet the specifications prescribed by this section.


(b) Petroleum wax meets the following ultraviolet absorbance limits when subjected to the analytical procedure described in this paragraph.


(c) Petroleum wax may contain one or more of the following adjuvants in amounts not greater than that required to produce their intended effect:


(1) Antioxidants permitted in food by regulations issued in accordance with section 409 of the act.


(2) Poly(alkylacrylate) (CAS Reg. No. 27029-57-8), made from long chain (C_16_-C_22_) alcohols and acrylic acid, or poly(alkylmethacrylate) (CAS Reg. No. 179529-36-3), made from long chain (C_18_-C_22_) methacrylate esters, having:


(i) A number average molecular weight between 40,000 and 100,000;


(ii) A weight average molecular weight (MW_w_) to number average molecular weight (MW_n_) ratio (MW_w_/MW_n_) of not less than 3; and


(iii) Unreacted alkylacrylate or alkylmethacrylate monomer content not in excess of 14 percent, as determined by a method entitled “Method for Determining Weight-Average and Number-Average Molecular Weight and for Determining Alkylacrylate Monomer Content of Poly(alkylacrylate) used as Processing Aid in Manufacture of Petroleum Wax,” which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.
