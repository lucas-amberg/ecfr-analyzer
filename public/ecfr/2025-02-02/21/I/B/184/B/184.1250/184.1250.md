# § 184.1250   Cellulase enzyme preparation derived from Trichoderma longibrachiatum.

(a) Cellulase enzyme preparation is derived from a nonpathogenic, nontoxicogenic strain of *Trichoderma longibrachiatum* (formerly *T. reesei*). The enzyme, cellulase, catalyzes the endohydrolysis of 1,4-beta-glycosidic linkages in cellulose. It is obtained from the culture filtrate resulting from a pure culture fermentation process.


(b) The ingredient meets the general and additional requirements for enzyme preparations in the monograph specifications on enzyme preparations in the “Food Chemicals Codex,” 4th ed. (1996), pp. 129 to 134, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies are available from the National Academy Press, 2101 Constitution Ave. NW., Box 285, Washington, DC 20055 (Internet *http://www.nap.edu*), or may be examined at the Dockets Management Staff (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852, 240-402-7500, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

(c) In accordance with § 184.1(b)(1), the ingredient is used in food with no limitation other than current good manufacturing practice. The affirmation of this ingredient as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) as a direct human food ingredient is based upon the following current good manufacturing practice conditions of use:


(1) The ingredient is used in food as an enzyme as defined in § 170.3(o)(9) of this chapter for the breakdown of cellulose.


(2) The ingredient is used in food at levels not to exceed current good manufacturing practice.
