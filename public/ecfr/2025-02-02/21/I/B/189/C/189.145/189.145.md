# § 189.145   Dulcin.

(a) Dulcin is the chemical 4-ethoxyphenylurea, C_9_H_12_N_2_O_2_. It is a synthetic chemical having a sweet taste about 250 times that of sucrose, is not found in natural products at levels detectable by the official methodology, and has been proposed for use as an artificial sweetener.


(b) Food containing any added or detectable level of dulcin is deemed to be adulterated in violation of the act, based upon an order published in the _Federal Register_ of January 19, 1950 (15 FR 321).


(c) The analytical methods used for detecting dulcin in food are in sections 20.173-20.176 of the “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 13th Ed. (1980), which is incorporated by reference.
