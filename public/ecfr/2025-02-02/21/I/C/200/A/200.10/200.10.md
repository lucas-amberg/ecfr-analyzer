# ยง 200.10   Contract facilities (including consulting laboratories) utilized as extramural facilities by pharmaceutical manufacturers.

(a) Section 704(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act specifically authorizes inspection of consulting laboratories as well as any factory, warehouse, or establishment in which prescription drugs are manufactured, processed, packed, or held.


(b) The Food and Drug Administration is aware that many manufacturers of pharmaceutical products utilize extramural independent contract facilities, such as testing laboratories, contract packers or labelers, and custom grinders, and regards extramural facilities as an extension of the manufacturer's own facility.


(c) The Food and Drug Administration reserves the right to disclose to the pharmaceutical manufacturer, or to the applicant of a new drug application (NDA) or to the sponsor of an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application, any information obtained during the inspection of an extramural facility having a specific bearing on the compliance of the manufacturer's, applicant's, or sponsor's product with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Food and Drug Administration's position is that by the acceptance of such contract work, the extramural facility authorizes such disclosures.


(d) The Food and Drug Administration does not consider results of validation studies of analytical and assay methods and control procedures to be trade secrets that may be withheld from the drug manufacturer by the contracted extramural facility.
