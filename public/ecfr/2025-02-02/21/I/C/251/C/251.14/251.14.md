(a) *SIP Sponsor.* A sponsor of an authorized SIP must ensure that:


(1) Each drug imported under the SIP is HPFB-approved and labeled for sale in Canada by the manufacturer before it reaches the Foreign Seller;


(2) For each drug that is imported under the SIP and that is manufactured outside Canada, the drug was authorized for import into Canada by the manufacturer and was not transshipped through Canada for sale in another country;


(3) For each drug imported under the SIP, the drug was sold by the manufacturer directly to a Foreign Seller;


(4) For each drug imported under the SIP, the Foreign Seller ships the drug directly to the Importer in the United States;


(5) For each drug imported under the SIP, the Foreign Seller identified in the SIP meets applicable supply chain security requirements of this part;


(6) The Importer identified in the SIP meets the applicable requirements of this part and in sections 582(c) and (d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; and


(7) Returned eligible prescription drugs are properly dispositioned in, and not exported from, the United States.


(b) *Manufacturer.* For each transaction of the eligible prescription drug, the manufacturer must provide to the Importer, within 30 calendar days of receiving the Importer's request, a copy of all transaction documents that were provided from the manufacturer to the Foreign Seller.


(c) *Foreign Seller.* (1) A Foreign Seller must have systems in place to:


(i) Determine whether a drug in its possession or control that it intends to sell to the Importer under a SIP is a suspect foreign product. Upon making a determination that a drug in its possession or control is a suspect foreign product, or upon receiving a request for verification from FDA that the Foreign Seller has determined that a product within its possession or control is a suspect foreign product, a Foreign Seller must:


(A) Quarantine such product within its possession or control until such product is cleared or dispositioned;


(B) Promptly conduct an investigation, in coordination with the Importer and the manufacturer, as applicable, to determine whether the product is an illegitimate foreign product, and verify the product at the package level, including the SSI; and


(C) If the Foreign Seller makes the determination that a suspect foreign product is not an illegitimate foreign product, promptly notify FDA of such determination for those products that FDA has requested verification.


(ii) Determine whether a drug in its possession or control that it intends to sell to the Importer under a SIP is an illegitimate foreign product. Upon making a determination that a drug in its possession or control is an illegitimate foreign product, the Foreign Seller must:


(A) Quarantine such product within the possession or control of the Foreign Seller from product intended for distribution until such product is dispositioned;


(B) Disposition the illegitimate foreign product within the possession or control of the Foreign Seller;


(C) Take reasonable and appropriate steps to assist a manufacturer or Importer to disposition an illegitimate product not in the possession or control of the Foreign Seller; and


(D) Retain a sample of the product for further physical examination or laboratory analysis of the product by the manufacturer or FDA (or other appropriate Federal or State official) upon request by FDA (or other appropriate Federal or State official), as necessary and appropriate.


(2)(i) Upon determining that a product in the possession or control of the Foreign Seller is an illegitimate foreign product, the Foreign Seller must notify FDA and the Importer that the Foreign Seller received such illegitimate product not later than 24 hours after making such determination.


(ii) Upon the receipt of a notification from the manufacturer, FDA, the Importer or other wholesale distributor, or dispenser that a determination has been made that a product that had been sold by the Foreign Seller is an illegitimate foreign product, a Foreign Seller must identify all illegitimate foreign product subject to such notification that is in the possession or control of the Foreign Seller, including any product that is subsequently received, and perform the activities to investigate the product described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.


(iii) Upon making a determination, in consultation with FDA, that a notification is no longer necessary, a Foreign Seller must promptly notify the Importer and person who sent the notification that the notification is terminated.


(iv) A Foreign Seller must keep records of the disposition of an illegitimate foreign product for not less than 6 years after the conclusion of the disposition.


(3) Upon request by FDA, or other appropriate Federal or State official, in the event of a recall or for purposes of investigating a suspect foreign product or an illegitimate foreign product, a Foreign Seller must promptly provide the official with information about its transactions with the manufacturer and the Importer.


(4) A Foreign Seller, upon receiving a shipment of eligible prescription drugs from the manufacturer, must:


(i) Separate the portion of drugs intended for sale to the Importer located in the United States, and store such portion separately from that portion of product intended for sale in the Canadian market;


(ii) Assign an SSI to each package and homogenous case intended for sale to the Importer in the United States, unless each such package and homogenous case displayed a manufacturer-affixed or imprinted product identifier, as such term is defined in section 581(14) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, at the time of receipt by the Foreign Seller;


(iii) Affix or imprint the SSI on each package and homogenous case intended for sale to the Importer in the United States. Such SSI must be located on blank space on the package or homogenous case and must not obscure any labeling for the Canadian market, including the DIN; and


(iv) Keep records associating the SSI with the DIN and all the records the Foreign Seller received from the manufacturer upon receipt of the original shipment intended for the Canadian market for not less than 6 years.


(5) Upon receiving a request for verification from the Importer or other authorized repackager, wholesale distributor, or dispenser that is in possession or control of a product such person believes to be distributed by such Foreign Seller, a Foreign Seller must, not later than 24 hours after receiving the request for verification, or in such other reasonable time as determined by the FDA based on the circumstances of the request, notify the person making the request whether the SSI that is the subject of the request corresponds to the SSI affixed or imprinted by the Foreign Seller. If a Foreign Seller responding to a request for verification identifies an SSI that does not correspond to that SSI affixed or imprinted by the Foreign Seller, the Foreign Seller must treat such product as suspect foreign product and conduct an investigation as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If the Foreign Seller determines the product is an illegitimate foreign product, the Foreign Seller must advise the person making the request of such determination at the time such Foreign Seller responds to the request for verification.


(6) For each transaction between the Foreign Seller and the Importer for an eligible prescription drug, the Foreign Seller must provide:


(i) A statement that the Foreign Seller purchased the product directly from the manufacturer;


(ii) The proprietary name (if any) and the established name of the product;


(iii) The strength and dosage form of the product;


(iv) The container size;


(v) The number of containers;


(vi) The lot number of the product assigned by the manufacturer;


(vii) The date of the transaction;


(viii) The date of the shipment, if more than 24 hours after the date of the transaction;


(ix) The business name and address of the person associated with the Foreign Seller from whom ownership is being transferred;


(x) The business name and address of the person associated with the Importer to whom ownership is being transferred;


(xi) The SSI for each package and homogenous case of product; and


(xii) The Canadian DIN for each product transferred.


(7) Upon a request by FDA, or other appropriate Federal or State official, in the event of a recall or for purposes of investigating a suspect foreign product or an illegitimate foreign product, the Foreign Seller must promptly provide the official with information about its transactions with the manufacturer and the Importer.


(d) *Importers.* (1) An Importer of an eligible prescription drug must purchase the drug directly from a Foreign Seller in Canada.


(2) Upon receipt of an eligible prescription drug in a transaction from the Foreign Seller, an Importer must facilitate the affixation or imprinting of a product identifier, as defined in section 581(14) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, for all eligible prescription drugs. The Importer must ensure that such affixation or imprinting occurs at the same time the product is relabeled with the required U.S.-approved labeling for the drug product and, except for repackaging necessary to perform the relabeling described in this part, cannot otherwise relabel or repackage the product. The Importer may affix or imprint the product identifier, or the Importer may contract with an entity registered with FDA under part 207 of this chapter to accomplish such relabeling, provided that the entity does not otherwise relabel or repackage the product, except for repackaging that is necessary to perform the relabeling described in this part. Any entity with which the Importer contracts to accomplish such labeling must, even if not engaged in a repackaging operation with respect to the eligible prescription drug, have systems and processes in place to meet applicable requirements of a “repackager” under section 582(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for any transaction involving the eligible prescription drug.


(3) The repackager that affixes or imprints the product identifier on each package and homogenous case of an eligible prescription drug in accordance with section 582 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which may be the Importer or the Importer's authorized repackager—


(i) May affix or imprint a product identifier only on a package of an eligible prescription drug that has a serial number that was assigned and affixed by the Foreign Seller;


(ii) Must maintain the product identifier information for such drug for not less than 6 years; and


(iii) Must maintain records for not less than 6 years that associate the product identifier the repackager affixes or imprints with the serial number assigned by the Foreign Seller and the Canadian DIN.


(4) An Importer must retain records, for not less than 6 years, that allow the Importer to associate the product identifier affixed or imprinted on each package or homogenous case of product it received from the Foreign Seller, with the SSI that had been assigned by the Foreign Seller, and the Canadian DIN that was on the package when the Foreign Seller received the product from the manufacturer.


(5) An Importer must, upon receipt of an eligible prescription drug and records from a Foreign Seller, compare such information with information the Importer received from the manufacturer, including relevant documentation about the transaction that the manufacturer provided to the Foreign Seller upon its transfer of ownership of the product for the Canadian market.


(6) An Importer must comply with all applicable requirements of section 582 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including requirements that apply to subsequent transactions with trading partners, unless a waiver, exception, or exemption applies.


(7) For transactions of eligible prescription drugs between Importers and Foreign Sellers under a SIP, an Importer is exempt from the following specific supply chain security requirements that are otherwise applicable:


(i) An Importer is exempt from the prohibition on receiving a product for which the previous owner did not provide the transaction history, transaction information, and transaction statement, under sections 582(c)(1)(A) or (d)(1)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as applicable, provided that the Importer receives from the Foreign Seller the information required under paragraph (c) of this section.


(ii) An Importer is exempt from the prohibition on receiving a product that is not encoded with a product identifier, under sections 582(c)(2) or (d)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as applicable, provided that the product the Importer received from the Foreign Seller has an SSI.


(iii) An Importer is exempt from the prohibition on conducting a transaction with an entity that is not an “authorized trading partner,” under sections 582(c)(3) or (d)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as applicable.


(iv) An Importer is exempt from the requirement to verify that a product in the Importer's possession or control contains a “standardized numerical identifier” at the package level, under sections 582(c)(4)(A)(i)(II) or (d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as applicable, provided that the Importer verifies that each package and homogenous case of the product includes the SSI affixed or imprinted by the Foreign Seller.
