(3) Water that contacts animal food, animal food-contact surfaces, or animal food-packaging materials must be safe for its intended use; and


(4) Water may be reused for washing, rinsing, or conveying animal food if it does not increase the level of contamination of the animal food.


(b) Plumbing must be designed, installed, and maintained to:
