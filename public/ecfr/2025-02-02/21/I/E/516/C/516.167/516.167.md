# § 516.167   Removal from the index.

(a) After due notice to the holder of the index listing and an opportunity for an informal conference as described in § 516.123, FDA shall remove a new animal drug from the index if FDA finds that:


(1) The same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use has been approved or conditionally approved;


(2) The expert panel failed to meet the requirements in § 516.141;


(3) On the basis of new information before FDA, evaluated together with the evidence available to FDA when the new animal drug was listed in the index, the benefits of using the new animal drug for the indexed use do not outweigh its risks to the target animal, taking into account the harm caused by the absence of an approved or conditionally-approved new animal drug for the minor species in question;


(4) Any of the conditions in § 516.133(a)(2), (5), or (6) are present;


(5) The manufacture of the new animal drug is not in accordance with current good manufacturing practices;


(6) The labeling, distribution, or promotion of the new animal drug is not in accordance with the index listing;


(7) The conditions and limitations of use associated with the index listing have not been followed; or


(8) Any information used to support the request for addition to the index contains any untrue statement of material fact.


(b) The agency may partially remove an indexing listing if, in the opinion of the agency, such partial removal would satisfactorily resolve a safety or effectiveness issue otherwise warranting removal of the listing under section 572(f)(1)(B) of the act.


(c) FDA may immediately suspend a new animal drug from the index if FDA determines that there is a reasonable probability that the use of the drug would present a risk to the health of humans or other animals. The agency will subsequently provide due notice and an opportunity for an informal conference as described in § 516.123.


(d) A decision of FDA to remove a new animal drug from the index following an informal conference, if any, shall constitute final agency action subject to judicial review.
