The food additive consists of the meal obtained after the removal of most of the oil from whole seeds or partially dehulled seeds or both obtained from a *Carthamus tinctorius* L. safflower Centennial variety genetically engineered to express the delta-6-desaturase gene from *Saprolegnia diclina* Humphrey. The 453 amino acid, delta-6-desaturase enzyme converts the fatty acid linoleic acid to gamma-linolenic acid during seed development. The resulting additive may be safely used in cattle and poultry feeds in accordance with the following prescribed conditions:


(a) The additive shall contain not less than 20 percent crude protein, not more than 40 percent crude fiber, not more than 10 percent moisture, and not more than 2 percent crude fat.
