# § 809.10   Labeling for in vitro diagnostic products.

(a) The label for an in vitro diagnostic product shall state the following information, except where such information is not applicable, or as otherwise specified in a standard for a particular product class or as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. Section 201(k) of the act provides that “a requirement made by or under authority of this act that any word, statement, or other information appear on the label shall not be considered to be complied with unless such word, statement, or other information also appears on the outside container or wrapper, if any there be, of the retail package of such article, or is easily legible through the outside container or wrapper.” 


(1) The proprietary name and established name (common or usual name), if any. 


(2) The intended use or uses of the product. 


(3) For a reagent, a declaration of the established name (common or usual name), if any, and quantity, proportion or concentration of each reactive ingredient; and for a reagent derived from biological material, the source and a measure of its activity. The quantity, proportion, concentration, or activity shall be stated in the system generally used and recognized by the intended user, e.g., metric, international units, etc. 


(4) A statement of warnings or precautions for users as established in the regulations contained in 16 CFR part 1500 and any other warnings appropriate to the hazard presented by the product; and a statement “For In Vitro Diagnostic Use” and any other limiting statements appropriate to the intended use of the product. The limiting statement appropriate to the intended use of a prescription in vitro diagnostic product shall bear the symbol statement “Rx only” or “℞ only” or the statement “Caution: Federal law restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a ___”, the blank to be filled with the word “physician”, “dentist”, “veterinarian”, or with the descriptive designation of any other practitioner licensed by the law of the State in which the practitioner practices to use or order the use of the device.


(5) For a reagent, appropriate storage instructions adequate to protect the stability of the product. When applicable, these instructions shall include such information as conditions of temperature, light, humidity, and other pertinent factors. For products requiring manipulation, such as reconstitution and/or mixing before use, appropriate storage instructions shall be provided for the reconstituted or mixed product which is to be stored in the original container. The basis for such instructions shall be determined by reliable, meaningful, and specific test methods such as those described in § 211.166 of this chapter. 


(6) For a reagent, a means by which the user may be assured that the product meets appropriate standards of identity, strength, quality and purity at the time of use. This shall be provided, both for the product as provided and for any resultant reconstituted or mixed product, by including on the label one or more of the following: 


(i) An expiration date based upon the stated storage instructions. 


(ii) A statement of an observable indication of an alteration of the product, e.g., turbidity, color change, precipitate, beyond its appropriate standards. 


(iii) Instructions for a simple method by which the user can reasonably determine that the product meets its appropriate standards. 


(7) For a reagent, a declaration of the net quantity of contents, expressed in terms of weight or volume, numerical count, or any combination of these or other terms which accurately reflect the contents of the package. The use of metric designations is encouraged, wherever appropriate. If more than a single determination may be performed using the product, any statement of the number of tests shall be consistent with instructions for use and amount of material provided. 


(8) Name and place of business of manufacturer, packer, or distributor. 


(9) A lot or control number, identified as such, from which it is possible to determine the complete manufacturing history of the product. 


(i) If it is a multiple unit product, the lot or control number shall permit tracing the identity of the individual units. 


(ii) For an instrument, the lot or control number shall permit tracing the identity of all functional subassemblies. 


(iii) For multiple unit products which require the use of included units together as a system, all units should bear the same lot or control number, if appropriate, or other suitable uniform identification should be used. 


(10) Except that for items in paragraphs (a) (1) through (9) of this section: (i) In the case of immediate containers too small or otherwise unable to accommodate a label with sufficient space to bear all such information and which are packaged within an outer container from which they are removed for use, the information required by paragraphs (a) (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) (ii), (iii) and (7) of this section may appear in the outer container labeling only. 


(ii) In any case in which the presence of this information on the immediate container will interfere with the test, the information may appear on the outside container or wrapper rather than on the immediate container label. 


(b) Labeling accompanying each product, e.g., a package insert, shall state in one place the following information in the format and order specified below, except where such information is not applicable, or as specified in a standard for a particular product class. The labeling for a multiple-purpose instrument used for diagnostic purposes, and not committed to specific diagnostic procedures or systems, may bear only the information indicated in paragraphs (b) (1), (2), (6), (14), and (15) of this section. The labeling for a reagent intended for use as a replacement in a diagnostic system may be limited to that information necessary to identify the reagent adequately and to describe its proper use in the system. 


(1) The proprietary name and established name, i.e., common or usual name, if any. 


(2) The intended use or uses of the product and the type of procedure, e.g., qualitative or quantitative. 


(3) Summary and explanation of the test. Include a short history of the methodology, with pertinent references and a balanced statement of the special merits and limitations of this method or product. If the product labeling refers to any other procedure, appropriate literature citations shall be included and the labeling shall explain the nature of any differences from the original and their effect on the results. 


(4) The chemical, physical, physiological, or biological principles of the procedure. Explain concisely, with chemical reactions and techniques involved, if applicable. 


(5) Reagents:
