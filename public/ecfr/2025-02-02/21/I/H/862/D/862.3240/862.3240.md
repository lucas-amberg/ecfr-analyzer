# ยง 862.3240   Cholinesterase test system.

(a) *Identification.* A cholinesterase test system is a device intended to measure cholinesterase (an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of acetylcholine to choline) in human specimens. There are two principal types of cholinesterase in human tissues. True cholinesterase is present at nerve endings and in erythrocytes (red blood cells) but is not present in plasma. Pseudo cholinesterase is present in plasma and liver but is not present in erythrocytes. Measurements obtained by this device are used in the diagnosis and treatment of cholinesterase inhibition disorders (e.g., insecticide poisoning and succinylcholine poisoning). 


(b) *Classification.* Class I (general controls). The device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to the limitations in ยง 862.9.
