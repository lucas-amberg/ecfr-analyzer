# ยง 864.1866   Lynch syndrome test systems.

(a) *Identification.* Lynch syndrome test systems are in vitro diagnostic tests for use with tumor tissue to identify previously diagnosed cancer patients at risk for having Lynch syndrome.


(b) *Classification.* Class II (special controls). The special controls for this device are:


(1) Premarket notification submissions must include the following information, as appropriate:


(i) A detailed description of all test components, including all provided reagents, and required but not provided, ancillary reagents.


(ii) A detailed description of instrumentation and equipment, including illustrations or photographs of non-standard equipment or manuals.


(iii) Detailed documentation of the device software, including, but not limited to, standalone software applications and hardware-based devices that incorporate software.


(iv) A detailed description of quality controls including appropriate positive and negative controls that are recommended or provided.


(v) Detailed specifications for sample collection, processing, and storage.


(vi) A detailed description of methodology and assay procedure.


(vii) A description of the assay cut-off (*i.e.,* the medical decision point between positive and negative results) or other relevant criteria that distinguishes positive and negative results, or ordinal classes of marker expression, including the rationale for the chosen cut-off or other relevant criteria and results supporting validation of the cut-off.


(viii) Detailed specification of the criteria for test result interpretation and reporting.


(ix) Detailed information demonstrating the performance characteristics of the device, including:


(A) Data from an appropriate study demonstrating clinical accuracy using well-characterized clinical specimens representative of the intended use population (*i.e.,* concordance to Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) sequencing results of the Lynch syndrome associated genes or method comparison to the predicate device using samples with known alterations in genes representative of Lynch syndrome). Pre-specified acceptance criteria must be provided and followed.


(B) Appropriate device reproducibility data investigating all sources of variance (*e.g.,* for distributed tests, data generated using a minimum of three sites, of which at least two sites must be external sites). Each site must perform testing over a minimum of 5 nonconsecutive days evaluating a sample panel that spans the claimed measuring range, and includes the clinical threshold. Pre-specified acceptance criteria must be provided and followed.


(C) Data demonstrating reader reproducibility, both within-reader and between-reader, assessed by three readers over 3 nonconsecutive days at each site, including a 2 week washout period between reads, as appropriate.


(D) Device precision data using clinical samples spanning the measuring range and controls to evaluate the within-lot, between-lot, within-run, between run, and total variation.


(E) Analytical specificity studies including as appropriate, western blots, peptide inhibition, testing in normal tissues and neoplastic tissues, interference by endogenous and exogenous substances, and cross-reactivity and cross contamination testing.


(F) Device analytical sensitivity data generated by testing an adequate number of samples from individuals with the target condition such that prevalence of the biomarker in the target population is established.


(G) Device stability data, including real-time stability and in-use stability, and stability evaluating various storage times, temperatures, and freeze-thaw conditions, as appropriate.


(H) The staining performance criteria assessed must include overall staining acceptability, background staining acceptability, and morphology acceptability, as appropriate.


(I) Appropriate training requirements for users, including interpretation manual, as applicable.


(J) Identification of risk mitigation elements used by the device, including a description of all additional procedures, methods, and practices incorporated into the instructions for use that mitigate risks associated with testing.


(2) The device's ยง 809.10(b) of this chapter compliant labeling must include a detailed description of the protocol, including the information described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (viii) of this section, as appropriate, and a detailed description of the performance studies performed and the summary of the results, including those that relate to paragraph (b)(1)(ix) of this section, as appropriate.
