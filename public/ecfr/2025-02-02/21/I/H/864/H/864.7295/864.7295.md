# ยง 864.7295   Heparin and direct oral factor Xa inhibitor drug test system.

(a) *Identification.* A heparin and direct oral factor Xa inhibitor drug test system is intended for the detection of heparin and direct oral factor Xa inhibitors in human specimens collected from patients taking heparin or direct oral factor Xa inhibitors. This device is intended to aid in the management of therapy in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings.


(b) *Classification.* Class II (special controls). The special controls for this device are:


(1) Design verification and validation must include the following:


(i) Detailed documentation of analytical device performance studies and results demonstrating acceptable analytical performance with a sufficient number of specimens tested in order to obtain unbiased estimates of analytical performance. This documentation shall include the following as appropriate to the technology, specimen types tested, and intended use of the device:


(A) Studies and results for that demonstrate device precision including repeatability and reproducibility, using quality controls and clinical samples, when appropriate. Precision studies must assess specimens for each indicated drug at concentrations throughout the measuring range of the device including near clinically relevant levels, as appropriate. The study must evaluate different sources of variability including, as appropriate, between-run, between-operator, between-lot, between-instrument, between-day, and between-site;


(B) Studies and results that demonstrate that the device is free from clinically significant interference, from endogenous and exogenous interferents associated with the target population(s), and interferents that are specific for, or related to, the technology or methodology of the device;


(C) Data to demonstrate appropriate specimen stability for the intended sample matrices under the intended conditions for specimen collection, handling, and storage described in the device labeling;


(D) Studies and results that demonstrate the linear range, limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit of quantitation (LoQ), as applicable to the technology of the device; and


(E) For any devices intended for use for near patient testing, studies and results that demonstrate the robustness of the device in the hands of the intended user, including the entire testing procedure, pre-analytical specimen processing steps, and results interpretation.


(ii) Detailed documentation of clinical performance testing in which the performance is analyzed relative to a comparator that FDA has determined is appropriate. Specimens must be representative of the intended use population(s) and must cover the full range of the device output and any clinically relevant decision points as appropriate.


(2) The labeling required under ยง 809.10(b) of this chapter must include:


(i) Identification of any known interferents, including all endogenous, exogenous, technology-specific, and patient population-specific interferents, specific to the test outputs. The information must include the concentration(s) or level(s) of the interferent at which clinically significant interference was found to occur, and the concentration range or levels at which interference was not found to occur;


(ii) A prominent statement that the device is not intended for use in monitoring patients taking heparin or direct oral factor Xa inhibitors; and


(iii) Limiting statements indicating, as applicable:


(A) That the device should only be used in conjunction with information available from clinical evaluations and other diagnostic procedures; and


(B) That the device is not specific to the direct oral factor Xa inhibitor that has been evaluated and may detect the presence of other direct factor Xa inhibitors that have not been evaluated.
