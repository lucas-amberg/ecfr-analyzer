(a) *Identification.* Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus serological reagents are devices that consist of antigens and antisera used in serological tests to identify antibodies to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in serum.

Lymphocytic choriomeningitis viruses usually cause a mild cerebral meningitis (inflammation of membranes that envelop the brain) and occasionally a mild pneumonia, but in rare instances may produce severe and even fatal illnesses due to complications from cerebral meningitis and pneumonia.


(b) *Classification.* Class I (general controls). The device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to ยง 866.9.
