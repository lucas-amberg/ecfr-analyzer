# § 866.3550   

(a) *Identification. Salmonella* spp. serological reagents are devices that consist of antigens and antisera used in serological tests to identify *Salmonella* spp. from cultured isolates derived from clinical specimens. Additionally, some of these reagents consist of antisera conjugated with a fluorescent dye (immunofluorescent reagents) used to identify *Salmonella* spp. directly from clinical specimens or cultured isolates derived from clinical specimens. The identification aids in the diagnosis of salmonellosis caused by bacteria belonging to the genus *Salmonella* and provides epidemiological information on this disease. Salmonellosis is characterized by high grade fever (“enteric fever”), severe diarrhea, and cramps.


(b) *Classification.* Class II (special controls). The device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to § 866.9.
