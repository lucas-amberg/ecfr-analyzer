# ยง 866.4520   Immunofluorometer equipment.

(a) *Identification.* Immunofluorometer equipment for clinical use with its electrical power supply is a device used to measure the fluorescence of fluorochrome-labeled antigen-antibody complexes. The concentration of these complexes may be measured by means of reflected light. A beam of light is passed through a solution in which a fluorochrome has been selectively attached to serum protein antibody molecules in suspension. The amount of light emitted by the fluorochrome label is detected by a photodetector, which converts light energy into electrical energy. The amount of electrical energy registers on a readout system such as a digital voltmeter or a recording chart. This electrical readout is called the fluorescence value and is used to measure the concentration of antigen-antibody complexes. 


(b) *Classification.* Class I (general controls). The device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to the limitations in ยง 866.9.
