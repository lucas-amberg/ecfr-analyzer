# ยง 866.4600   Ouchterlony agar plate.

(a) *Identification.* An ouchterlony agar plate for clinical use is a device containing an agar gel used to examine antigen-antibody reactions. In immunodiffusion, antibodies and antigens migrate toward each other through gel which originally contained neither of these reagents. As the reagents come in contact with each other, they combine to form a precipitate that is trapped in the gel matrix and is immobilized. 


(b) *Classification.* Class I (general controls). The device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to the limitations in ยง 866.9.
