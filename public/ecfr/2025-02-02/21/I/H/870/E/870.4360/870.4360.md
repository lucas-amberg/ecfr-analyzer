# § 870.4360   Nonroller-type blood pump.

(a) *Nonroller-type cardiopulmonary and circulatory bypass blood pump*—(1) *Identification.* A nonroller-type cardiopulmonary and circulatory bypass blood pump is a prescription device that uses a method other than revolving rollers to pump the blood through an extracorporeal circuit for periods lasting less than 6 hours for the purpose of providing either:


(i) Full or partial cardiopulmonary bypass (*i.e.,* circuit includes an oxygenator) during open surgical procedures on the heart or great vessels; or


(ii) Temporary circulatory bypass for diversion of flow around a planned disruption of the circulatory pathway necessary for open surgical procedures on the aorta or vena cava.


(2) *Classification*—Class II (special controls). The special controls for this device are:


(i) Non-clinical performance testing must perform as intended over the intended duration of use and demonstrate the following: Operating parameters, dynamic blood damage, heat generation, air entrapment, mechanical integrity, and durability/reliability;


(ii) The patient-contacting components of the device must be demonstrated to be biocompatible;


(iii) Sterility and shelf life testing must demonstrate the sterility of patient-contacting components and the shelf life of these components; and


(iv) Labeling must include information regarding the duration of use, and a detailed summary of the device- and procedure-related complications pertinent to use of the device.


(b) *Nonroller-type temporary ventricular support blood pump*—(1) *Identification.* A nonroller-type temporary ventricular support blood pump is a prescription device that uses any method resulting in blood propulsion to provide the temporary ventricular assistance required for support of the systemic and/or pulmonary circulations during periods when there is ongoing or anticipated hemodynamic instability due to immediately reversible alterations in ventricular myocardial function resulting from mechanical or physiologic causes. Duration of use would be less than 6 hours.


(2) *Classification.* Class III (premarket approval).


(c) *Date premarket approval application (PMA) or notice of completion of product development protocol (PDP) is required.* A PMA or notice of completion of a PDP is required to be filed with FDA on or before September 8, 2015, for any nonroller-type temporary ventricular support blood pump that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or that has, on or before September 8, 2015, been found to be substantially equivalent to any nonroller-type temporary ventricular support blood pump that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. Any other nonroller-type temporary ventricular support blood pump shall have an approved PMA or declared completed PDP in effect before being placed in commercial distribution.
