# ยง 872.1   Scope.

(a) This part sets forth the classification of dental devices intended for human use that are in commercial distribution. 


(b) The identification of a device in a regulation in this part is not a precise description of every device that is, or will be, subject to the regulation. A manufacturer who submits a premarket notification submission for a device under part 807 cannot show merely that the device is accurately described by the section title and identification provisions of a regulation in this part, but shall state why the device is substantially equivalent to other devices, as required by ยง 807.87. 


(c) To avoid duplicative listings, a dental device that has two or more types of uses (e.g., used both as a diagnostic device and as a therapeutic device) is listed in one subpart only. 


(d) References in this part to regulatory sections of the Code of Federal Regulations are to chapter I of title 21 unless otherwise noted. 


(e) Guidance documents referenced in this part are available on the Internet at *http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/default.htm.*
