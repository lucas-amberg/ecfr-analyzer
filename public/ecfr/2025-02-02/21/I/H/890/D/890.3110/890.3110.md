# § 890.3110   Electric positioning chair.

(a) *Identification.* An electric positioning chair is a device with a motorized positioning control that is intended for medical purposes and that can be adjusted to various positions. The device is used to provide stability for patients with athetosis (involuntary spasms) and to alter postural positions.


(b) *Classification.* Class II. The electric positioning chair is exempt from premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter, subject to § 890.9 and the following conditions for exemption:


(1) Appropriate analysis and non-clinical testing must demonstrate that the safety controls are adequate to ensure safe use of the device and prevent user falls from the device in the event of a device failure;


(2) Appropriate analysis and non-clinical testing must demonstrate the ability of the device to withstand the rated user weight load with an appropriate factor of safety;


(3) Appropriate analysis and non-clinical testing must demonstrate the longevity of the device to withstand external forces applied to the device and provide the user with an expected service life of the device;


(4) Appropriate analysis and non-clinical testing must demonstrate proper environments of use and storage of the device to maximize the longevity of the device;


(5) Appropriate analysis and non-clinical testing (such as that outlined in the currently FDA-recognized editions of ANSI/AAMI/ES60601-1, “Medical Electrical Equipment—Part 1: General Requirements for Basic Safety and Essential Performance,” and ANSI/AAMI/IEC 60601-1-2, “Medical Electrical Equipment—Part 1-2: General Requirements for Basic Safety and Essential Performance—Collateral Standard: Electromagnetic Disturbances—Requirements and Tests”) must validate electromagnetic compatibility and electrical safety;


(6) Appropriate analysis and non-clinical testing (such as that outlined in the currently FDA-recognized editions of ANSI/AAMI/ISO 10993-1, “Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices—Part 1: Evaluation and Testing Within a Risk Management Process,” ANSI/AAMI/ISO 10993-5, “Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices—Part 5: Tests for In Vitro Cytotoxicity,” and ANSI/AAMI/ISO 10993-10, “Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices—Part 10: Tests for Irritation and Skin Sensitization”) must validate that the skin-contacting components of the device are biocompatible;


(7) Appropriate analysis and non-clinical testing (such as that outlined in the currently FDA-recognized editions of IEC 62304, “Medical Device Software—Software Life Cycle Processes”) must validate the software life cycle and that all processes, activities, and tasks are implemented and documented;


(8) Appropriate analysis and non-clinical testing must validate that the device components are found to be non-flammable;


(9) Appropriate analysis and non-clinical testing must validate that the battery in the device (if applicable) performs as intended over the anticipated service life of the device; and


(10) Adequate patient labeling is provided to the user to document proper use and maintenance of the device to ensure safe use of the device by the patient in the intended use environment.
