# § 1304.24   Records for maintenance treatment programs, mobile narcotic treatment programs, and detoxification treatment programs.

(a) Each person registered or authorized (by § 1301.22 of this chapter) to maintain and/or detoxify controlled substance users in a narcotic treatment program (NTP), including a mobile NTP, shall maintain records with the following information for each narcotic controlled substance:


(1) Name of substance;


(2) Strength of substance;


(3) Dosage form;


(4) Date dispensed;


(5) Adequate identification of patient (consumer);


(6) Amount consumed;


(7) Amount and dosage form taken home by patient; and


(8) Dispenser's initials.


(b) The records required by paragraph (a) of this section will be maintained in a dispensing log at the NTP site, or in the case of a mobile NTP, at the registered site of the NTP, and will be maintained in compliance with § 1304.22 without reference to § 1304.03.


(1) As an alternative to maintaining a paper dispensing log, an NTP or its mobile component may also use an automated/computerized data processing system for the storage and retrieval of the program's dispensing records, if the following conditions are met:


(i) The automated system maintains the information required in paragraph (a);


(ii) The automated system has the capability of producing a hard copy printout of the program's dispensing records;


(iii) The NTP or its mobile component prints a hard copy of each day's dispensing log, which is then initialed appropriately by each person who dispensed medication to the program's patients;


(iv) The automated system is approved by DEA;


(v) The NTP or its mobile component maintains an off-site back-up of all computer generated program information; and


(vi) The automated system is capable of producing accurate summary reports for both the registered site of the NTP and any mobile component, for any time-frame selected by DEA personnel during an investigation. If these summary reports are maintained in hard copy form, they must be kept in a systematically organized file located at the registered site of the NTP.


(2) The NTP must retain all records for the NTP as well as any mobile component two years from the date of execution, in accordance with § 1304.04(a). However, if the State in which the NTP is located requires that records be retained longer than two years, the NTP should contact its State opioid treatment authority for information about State requirements.


(c) All sites which compound a bulk narcotic solution from bulk narcotic powder to liquid for on-site use must keep a separate batch record of the compounding. 


(d) Records of identity, diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment of any patients which are maintained in connection with the performance of a narcotic treatment program shall be confidential, except that such records may be disclosed for purposes and under the circumstances authorized by part 310 and 42 CFR part 2.
