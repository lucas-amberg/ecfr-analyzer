# § 19.10-2   Reduced annuity with regular survivor annuity to spouse or former spouse.

(a) At commencement of annuity, a participant or former participant may provide a regular survivor annuity for any eligible former spouse and, within the limits of paragraph (b) of this section, a regular survivor annuity to any spouse to whom he/she is then married as described in §§ 19.11-2 and 19.11-3, respectively. A regular survivor annuity for a spouse or former spouse equals 55 percent of the portion of the retiree's annuity (up to the full amount) designated as the base for the survivor annuity. To provide the survivor annuity, the participant must accept a reduction in his/her full annuity equal to 2
1/2 percent of the first $3,600 of the designated base, plus 10 percent of the balance of the base. If a regular survivor annuity is being provided for both a spouse and a former spouse, the bases for each are added and the calculation made as in the following example:


(b) The maximum regular survivor annuity or combination of regular survivor annuities that may be provided under this section is limited to 55% of the principal's full annuity computed at retirement. If an annuitant is recalled to active duty in the Foreign Service, he/she may provide additional regular survivor annuities under § 19.10-6. The maximum regular survivor annuity or combination of regular survivor annuities that an annuitant who was married at retirement may elect or provide, pursuant to a court order or otherwise, after retirement in the event of his/her divorce or remarriage, is limited to the amount provided at the time of initial retirement or reversion to retired status following recall service.
