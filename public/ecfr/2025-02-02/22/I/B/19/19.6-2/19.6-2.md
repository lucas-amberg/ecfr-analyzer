# § 19.6-2   Qualifying court order.

(a) To be valid for purposes of this section, a court order must be found to be “qualified” by PER/ER/RET acting for the Secretary of State. A qualifying court order must—


(1) Be consistent with the terms of the Act and applicable regulations;


(2) Not direct payment of an amount in excess of the maximum amount authorized to be paid by the relevant regulation;


(3) Direct that payments be made to an eligible beneficiary from a principal's Foreign Service retirement benefit or survivor benefit. If a court directs or implies that a principal, rather than the Secretary of State or the Government, make the payments, the order will not be considered qualified unless the principal does not object during the 30-day notice period provided under § 19.6-6;


(4) Define the amount to be paid to a beneficiary in way so that it can be readily calculated from information in the normal files of the Department;


(5) Not make payment contingent upon events other than those on which other payments from the Fund are based such as age, marital status and school attendance; and


(6) Not be in conflict with any previously issued court order which remains valid. 


(b) No apportionment of annuity to a beneficiary under § 19.6-1(a) (1) or (6) shall exceed the net annuity of the principal. The net annuity is computed by excluding from the gross annuity the amounts which are:


(1) Owed by the individual to the United States; 


(2) Deducted for health benefits premiums pursuant to section 8906 of Title 5, United States Code;


(3) Deducted for life insurance premiums under the Government Life Insurance Program;


(4) Owed due to overpayment of annuity;


(5) Properly withheld for Federal income tax purposes, if amounts withheld are not greater than they would be if the individual claimed all dependents to which he/she was entitled.
