# ยง 19.6-9   Limitations.

(a) Retirement benefits are subject to apportionment by court order under ยง 19.6-1(a)(6) only while the principal is living. Payment of apportioned amounts will be made only to a previous spouse and/or the children of the principal. Such payments will not be made to any of the following:


(1) Heirs or legatees of the previous spouse;


(2) Creditors of either the principal or the previous spouse; or


(3) Assignees of either the principal or the previous spouse.


(b) The amount of any court ordered payment may not be less than one dollar and, in the absence of compelling circumstances, shall be in whole dollars.


(c) In honoring and complying with a court order, the Department shall not be required to disrupt the scheduled method of accruing retirement benefits or the normal timing for making such payments, despite the existence of any special schedule relating to a previous spouse or other beneficiary.


(d) In cases where the court order apportions a percentage of the retirement benefits, PER/ER/RET will initially determine the amount of proper payment. That amount will only be increased by future cost-of-living increases unless the court directs otherwise.
