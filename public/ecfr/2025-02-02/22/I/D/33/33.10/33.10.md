# ยง 33.10   Payments.

The Office Director, Office of Marine Conservation, Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, will pay the claimant the amount calculated under ยง 33.9. Payment will be made as promptly as practicable, but may be delayed pending the appropriation of sufficient funds, should fee collections not be adequate to sustain the operation of the Fund. The Director shall notify the claimant of the amount approved for payment as promptly as practicable and the same shall thereafter constitute a valid, but non-interest bearing obligation of the Government. Delays in payments are not a direct consequence of seizure and detention and cannot therefore be construed as increasing the compensable period for lost fishing time. If there is a question about distribution of the proceeds of the claim, the Director may request proof of interest from all parties, and will settle this issue.
