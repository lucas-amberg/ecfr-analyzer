# § 34.13   Notice requirements before offset.

Except as provided in § 34.16, salary offset deductions will not be made unless STATE first provides the employee with a written notice that he/she owes a debt to the Federal Government at least 30 calendar days before salary offset is to be initiated. When STATE is the creditor agency, this notice of intent to offset an employee's salary shall be hand-delivered or sent by electronic mail to the employee's STATE issued electronic mail address and will state:


(a) That STATE has reviewed the records relating to the debt and has determined that the debt is owed, its origin and nature, and the amount due; 


(b) The intention of STATE to collect the debt by means of deduction from the employee's current pay until the debt and any and all accumulated interest, penalties and administrative costs are paid in full; 


(c) The amount, frequency, approximate beginning date, and duration of the intended deductions; 


(d) The requirement to assess and collect interest, penalties, and administrative costs in accordance with § 34.6, unless waived in accordance with § 34.6(f); 


(e) The employee's right to inspect and copy any STATE records relating to the debt, or, if the employee or their representative cannot personally inspect the records, to request and receive a copy of such records; 


(f) The opportunity to voluntarily repay the debt or to enter into a written agreement (under terms agreeable to STATE) to establish a schedule for repayment of the debt in lieu of offset; 


(g) *Right to an internal review or outside hearing.* (1) An internal review under § 34.9 may be requested in cases of collections by salary offset for debts arising under 5 U.S.C. 5705 (travel advances), 5 U.S.C. 4108 (training expenses), and other statutes specifically providing for collection by salary offset. 


(2) For all other debts, an internal review or an outside hearing conducted by an official not under the supervision or control of STATE may be requested with respect to the existence of the debt, the amount of the debt, or the repayment schedule (*i.e.*, the percentage of disposable pay to be deducted each pay period); 


(h) That the timely filing of a request for an outside hearing or internal review within 30 calendar days after the date of the notice of intent to offset will stay the commencement of collection proceedings; 


(i) The method and time period for requesting an internal review or outside hearing; 


(j) That a final decision on the internal review or outside hearing (if one is requested) will be issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 days after the filing of the request, unless the employee requests and the outside hearing official grants a delay in the proceedings; 


(k) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representation, or evidence may subject the employee to disciplinary procedures (5 U.S.C. Chapter 75, 5 CFR part 752 or other applicable statutes or regulations); penalties (31 U.S.C. 3729-3731 or other applicable statutes or regulations); or criminal penalties (18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 1001, and 1002 or other applicable statutes or regulations); 


(l) Any other rights and remedies available to the employee under statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection is being made; 


(m) That the amounts paid on the debt which are later waived or found not owed to the United States will be promptly refunded to the employee, unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions to the contrary; and 


(n) The name and address of the STATE official to whom communications should be directed.
