(iii) The student internship program exposes participants to American techniques, methodologies, and technology and expands upon the participants' existing knowledge and skills. A program must not duplicate the student intern's prior experience.


(3) *Obligations of student internship program sponsors.* (i) A sponsor designated by the Department to administer a student internship program must:


(A) Ensure that the student internship program is full-time (minimum of 32 hours a week); and


(B) Ensure that any host organization or other third party involved in the recruitment, selection, screening, placement, orientation, evaluation, or provision of a student internship program is sufficiently educated on the goals, objectives, and regulations of the Exchange Visitor Program and adheres to all regulations set forth in this part as well as all additional terms and conditions governing Exchange Visitor Program administration that the Department may from time to time impose.


(ii) A sponsor must ensure that it or any host organization acting on the sponsor's behalf:


(A) Has sufficient resources, plant, equipment, and trained personnel available to provide the specified student internship program;

Any placement at an academic institution or at a Federal, State, or local government office is specifically excluded from this requirement. The purpose of the site visit is for the sponsor to ensure that each host organization possesses and maintains the ability and resources to provide structured and guided work-based learning experiences according to individualized T/IPPs, and that each host organization understands and meets its obligations set forth in this part.


(4) *Use of third parties.* A sponsor may engage a third party (including, but not limited to a host organization, partner, local business, governmental entity, academic institution, or any other foreign or domestic agent) to assist it in the conduct of its designated student internship program. Such a third party must have an executed written agreement with the sponsor to act on behalf of the sponsor in the conduct of the sponsor's program. This agreement must outline the full relationship between the sponsor and third party on all matters involving the administration of its exchange visitor program. A sponsor's use of a third party does not relieve the sponsor of its obligations to comply with and to ensure third party compliance with Exchange Visitor Program regulations.

A sponsor must provide to each signatory an executed copy of the Form DS-7002. Upon request, a student intern must present his or her fully executed Form DS-7002 to a Consular Official during the visa interview.


(ii) To further distinguish between work-based learning for student interns, which is permitted, and ordinary employment or unskilled labor which is not, a T/IPP must:

(ii) Not place a student intern in a position, occupation, or business that could bring the Exchange Visitor Program or the Department into notoriety or disrepute;


(iii) Not engage or otherwise cooperate or contract with a staffing/employment agency to recruit, screen, orient, place, evaluate, or train student interns, or in any other way involve such agencies in an Exchange Visitor Program student internship program;
