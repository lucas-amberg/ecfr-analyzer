(c) *Maxima not controlling.* Payments and allowances may be made at the rate or in the amount provided in the regulations in this part unless an individual grant or travel order specifies that less than the maximum will be allowed under any part of the regulation in this part. In such case, the grant or travel order will control.


(d) *Individual authorization.* Where the regulations in this part provide for compensation, allowance, or other payment, no payment shall be made therefor unless a definite amount or basis of payment is authorized in the individual case, or is approved as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.


(e) *Computation of per diem and allowance.* In computing per diem and allowance payable while on a duty assignment, except for travel performed under the Federal Travel Regulations, fractional days shall be counted as full days, the status at the end of the calendar day determining the status for the entire day.


(f) *Subsequent approval.* Whenever without prior authority expense has been incurred by a participant, or an individual has commenced his or her participation in the program as contemplated by the regulations in this part, the voucher for payments in connection therewith may be approved by an official designated for this purpose, such approval constituting the authority for such participation or the incurring of such expense.

If any maximum compensation or allowance authorized by these regulations or by the terms of any grant is exceeded by this method of computation and payment, such excess payment is hereby authorized.
