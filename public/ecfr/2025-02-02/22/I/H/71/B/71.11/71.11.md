# ยง 71.11   Short-term full diet program.

(a) *Eligibility criteria.* A prisoner is considered eligible for the short-term full diet program under the following general criteria:


(1) The prisoner is to be or has been held in excess of one day in a holding jail or other facility;


(2) Incarcerating officials do not provide the prisoner food, and food is not available from any other sources, including private funding from family or friends; and


(3) If the funds exceed an amount to be established by the Department, the prisoner signs a promissory note for funds expended, since the assistance is on a normally reimbursable basis.


(b) *Consular responsibility.* As soon as the consular officer is aware that a U.S. national is incarcerated in a facility wherein food is not routinely provided, the consular officer should:


(1) Contact the prisoner in accordance with existing procedures;


(2) Determine the normal cost of basic diet and best method of effecting payment;


(3) Attempt to secure funds from private sources such as family or friends;


(4) Because funds expended by the Department to cover the short-term full diet program normally are on a reimbursable basis, have the prisoner execute a promissory note; and


(5) Contact the Department, providing the above information, for approval and authorization.


(c) *Emergency expenditure authorization.* Since an immediate need for a short-term full diet program often prohibits the delay inherent in contacting the Department and receiving authority to expend funds, the consular officer can expend up to an amount to be established by the Department without prior Departmental approval if the prisoner's case meets the criteria established in paragraph (a) of this section. Expenditures above the predetermined limit must receive the prior approval of the Department.
