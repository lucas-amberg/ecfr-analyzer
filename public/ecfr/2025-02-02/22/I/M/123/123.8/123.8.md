# ยง 123.8   Special controls on vessels, aircraft and satellites covered by the U.S. Munitions List.

(a) Transferring registration or control to a foreign person of any aircraft, vessel, or satellite on the U.S. Munitions List is an export for purposes of this subchapter and requires a license or written approval from the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. This requirement applies whether the aircraft, vessel, or satellite is physically located in the United States or abroad.


(b) The registration in a foreign country of any aircraft, vessel or satellite covered by the U.S. Munitions List which is not registered in the United States but which is located in the United States constitutes an export. A license or written approval from the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls is therefore required. Such transactions may also require the prior approval of the U.S. Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration or other agencies of the U.S. Government.
