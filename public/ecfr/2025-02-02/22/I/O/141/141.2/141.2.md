# ยง 141.2   Application of this part.

This part applies to any program for which Federal financial assistance, as defined in this part, is authorized under a law administered by the Department including, but not limited to, the types of Federal financial assistance listed in appendix A of this part. It applies to Federal financial assistance of any form, including property which may be acquired as a result of and in connection with such assistance, extended program after the effective date of this regulation, even if the application is approved prior to such effective date. This part does not apply to (a) any Federal financial assistance by way of insurance of guaranty contracts; (b) money paid, property transferred, or other assistance extended before the effective date of this regulation; (c) any assistance to any individual who is the ultimate beneficiary; or (d) any employment practice, under any such program, of any employer, employment agency, or labor organization, except to the extent described in ยง 141.3 (d), or (e) any assistance to an activity carried on outside the United States by a person, institution, or other entity not located in the United States. The fact that a type of Federal financial assistance is not listed in appendix A of this part shall not mean, if title VI of the Act is otherwise applicable, that a program is not covered. Transfers of surplus property in the United States are subject to regulations issued by the Administrator of General Services (41 CFR 101-6.2).
