(2) The right of the debtor to inspect and copy records related to the debt; 


(3) The right of the debtor to discuss and propose a repayment agreement; 


(4) Any rights available to the debtor to review the debt, or to have recovery of the debt waived (by citing the available review or waiver authority, the conditions for review or waiver, and the effects of the review or waiver request on the collection of the debt);


(5) The date on which debt payment is due, which will be not more than 30 days from the date the written demand for-payment notice is mailed or hand delivered;


(6) The instructions for making electronic payment; 


(7) The debt is considered delinquent if it is not paid on the due date provided in the initial written demand-of payment notice;


(8) The imposition of interest charges, penalties, and administrative costs that USAID may assess against a delinquent debt, and the date when such charges apply;
