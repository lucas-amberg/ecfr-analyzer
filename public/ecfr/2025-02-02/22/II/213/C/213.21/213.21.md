# § 213.21   Employee salary offset—general.

(a) *Purpose.* This section establishes USAID's policies and procedures for recovery of debts owed to the United States by installment collection from the current pay account of an employee.


(b) *Scope.* The provisions of this section apply to collection by salary offset under 5 U.S.C. 5514 of debts owed USAID and debts owed to other Federal Departments and Agencies by USAID's employees. USAID will make every effort reasonably and lawfully possible to collect administratively any amounts owed by its employees prior to initiating collection by salary offset. An amount advanced to an employee for per diem or mileage allowances in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5705, but not used for allowable travel expenses, is recoverable from the employee by salary offset without regard to the due-process provisions in § 213.22. This section does not apply to debts for which another statute collection explicitly provides for, or prohibits, salary offset (e.g., travel advances under 5 U.S.C. 5705 and employee-training expenses under 5 U.S.C. 4108).


(c) *References.* The following statutes and regulations apply to USAID's recovery of debts due the United States by salary offset: 


(1) 5 U.S.C. 5514, as amended, governing the installment collection of debts; 


(2) 31 U.S.C. 3716, governing the liquidation of debts by administrative offset; 


(3) 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, setting forth the minimum requirements for executive agency regulations on salary offset; and 


(4) 31 CFR parts 900 through 904, the Federal Claims Collection Standards.
