# ยง 218.01   What is the purpose of the age discrimination regulations?

The purpose of these regulations is to set out the policies and procedures for the three foreign affairs agencies (State, USICA and AID) under the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 and the government-wide age discrimination regulations at 45 CFR part 90 (published at 44 FR 33768, June 12, 1979). The Act and the government-wide regulations prohibit discrimination on the basis of age in programs or activities in the United States receiving Federal financial assistance. The Act and the government-wide regulations permit federally assisted programs or activities, and recipients of Federal funds, to continue to use age distinctions and factors other than age which meet the requirements of the Act and the government-wide regulations.
