# § 303.8   Timing of responses to requests.

(a) *In general.* The Peace Corps ordinarily will respond to requests according to their order of receipt. The response time will commence on the date that the request is received by the Peace Corps' FOIA Officer or by the OIG FOIA Officer.


(b) *Multitrack processing.* The Peace Corps designates a specific track for requests that are granted expedited processing in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. The Peace Corps may also designate additional processing tracks that distinguish between simple and more complex requests based on the estimated amount of work or time needed to process the request. Among the factors the Peace Corps may consider are the number of records requested, the number of pages involved in processing the request and the need for consultations or referrals. The Peace Corps will advise requesters of the track into which their request falls and, when appropriate, should offer the requesters an opportunity to narrow or modify their request so that it can be placed in a different processing track.


(c) *Unusual circumstances.* Whenever the Peace Corps cannot meet the time limit for processing a request because of unusual circumstances as defined in § 303.2 and the Peace Corps extends the time limit on that basis, the Peace Corps will, before expiration of the 20-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which the Peace Corps estimates processing of the request will be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, the Peace Corps will provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. The Peace Corps will make available its designated FOIA contact or its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. The Peace Corps FOIA Public Liaison is identified on the agency's FOIA Open Government web page *https://www.peacecorps.gov/about/open-government/foia/* and is available at *FOIA@peacecorps.gov.* The Peace Corps will also alert requesters to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to provide dispute resolution services.


(d) *Aggregating requests.* To address unusual circumstances as defined in § 303.2, the Peace Corps may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. The Peace Corps will not aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.


(e) *Expedited processing.* (1) The Peace Corps will process requests and appeals on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve a compelling need as defined in § 303.2.


(2) A request for expedited processing of a request for information may be made at any time and submitted to the Peace Corps FOIA Officer or to the OIG FOIA Officer in the case of a request concerning OIG records. When making a request for expedited processing of an administrative appeal, the request should be submitted to the Associate Director for the Office of Management, or in the case of an appeal concerning OIG records, the Inspector General.


(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing will submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, in § 303.2, paragraph (2) of the definition for compelling need, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject may be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, the Peace Corps may waive the formal certification requirement.


(4) The Peace Corps will notify the requester within 10 calendar days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request will be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, the Peace Corps will act on any appeal of that decision expeditiously.
