# § 503.5   Records available for public inspection.

(a) To the extent that they exist, we will make the following records of general interest available for you in paper form or electronically for inspection or copying:


(1) Orders and final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions in adjudications. (*See* § 503.8(e) of this part for availability of internal memoranda, including attorney opinions and advice.)


(2) Statements of policy and interpretations that we have adopted but which have not been published in the _Federal Register._

(3) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect the public. (We will not make available, however, manuals or instructions that reveal investigative or audit procedures as described in § 503.8(b) and (g) of this part.)


(4) In addition to such records as those described in this paragraph (a), we will make available to any person a copy of all other Agency records, in the format requested, if available, unless we determine that such records should be withheld from disclosure under subsection (b) of the Act and §§ 503.8 and 503.9 of this part.


(b) Before releasing these records, however, we may delete the names of people, or information that would identify them, if release would invade their personal privacy to a clearly unwarranted degree (*See* § 503.8(f)). 


(c) The Agency's FOIA Guide and Index is available electronically via the Internet, or you may request a copy of it by mail.
