# ยง 706.20   In general.

DFC will charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the OMB Guidelines. For purposes of assessing fees, the FOIA establishes three categories of requests: Commercial use requests, non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requests, and all other requests. DFC will inform requesters as to which category their request has been placed into. Different fees are assessed depending on the category. Requesters may seek a fee waiver. DFC will consider requests for fee waiver in accordance with the requirements in ยง 706.24. To resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, DFC may contact a requester for additional information. DFC will ensure that searches, review, and duplication are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner. DFC ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.
