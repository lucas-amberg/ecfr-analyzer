# ยง 1203.735-214   Transmitting communications and gifts.

(a) *Correspondence.* In corresponding with anyone other than the proper official of the United States with regard to the public affairs of a foreign government, an employee shall use discretion and judgment to ensure that neither the United States nor the employee will be embarrassed or placed in a compromising position (22 U.S.C. 806(a)).


(b) *Communications.* An employee shall not act as an agent for the transmission of communications from private persons or organizations in foreign countries to the President or to Federal, State, or municipal officials in the United States. A chief of mission may, however, accept communications of this nature and forward them to the Department of State for such further action as may be appropriate, whenever the chief of mission determines it to be clearly in the public interest to do so.


(c) *Gifts.* An employee shall not act as an agent for the transmission of gifts from persons or organizations in foreign countries to the President or to Federal, State, or municipal officials of the United States. However, principal officers may, according to regulations prescribed by the President, accept, and forward to the Office of Protocol of the Department of State, gifts made to the United States or to any political subdivision thereof by the Government to which they are accredited or from which they hold exequaturs. Employees shall not, without the approval of the Secretary of State, transmit gifts from persons or organizations in the United States to heads or other officials of foreign states.
