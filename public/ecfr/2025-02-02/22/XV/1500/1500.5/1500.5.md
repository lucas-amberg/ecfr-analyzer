# ยง 1500.5   Grounds on which meetings may be closed.

(a) The Foundation shall open every portion of every meeting of the Foundation for public observation, except where the Foundation determines that such portion or portions of its meeting or the disclosure of such information is likely to:


(1) Disclose matters that are:


(i) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an executive order to be kept secret in the interests of national defense on foreign policy, and


(ii) In fact properly classified pursuant to such executive order;


(2) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practice of the Foundation;


(3) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, provided that such statute:


(i) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or


(ii) Has established practical criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;


(4) Disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information which has been obtained from a person and is privileged or confidential;


(5) Involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring any person;


(6) Disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarrented invasion of personal privacy;


(7) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, or information which if written would be contained in such records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or information would:


(i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings,


(ii) Deprive a person of a right to fair trial or an impartial adjudication,


(iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,


(iv) Disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source,


(v) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or


(vi) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel;


(8) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed agency action. This shall not apply in any instance where the Foundation has already disclosed to the public the content or nature of its proposed action or where the Foundation is required by law to make such disclosure on its own initiative prior to taking final Foundation action on such proposal;


(9) Specifically concern the Foundation's issuance of a subpoena; the Foundation's participation in a civil action or proceeding, or an arbitration; or an action in a foreign court or international tribunal; or the initiation, conduct, or disposition by the Foundation of a particular case of formal agency adjudication pursuant to the procedures in section 554 of title 5 of the United States Code, or otherwise involving a determination on the record after an opportunity for a hearing.


(b) Meetings of the Board of Directors shall not be closed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section when the Foundation finds that the public interest requires that they be open.
