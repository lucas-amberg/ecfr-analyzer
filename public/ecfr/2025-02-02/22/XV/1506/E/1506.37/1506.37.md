# ยง 1506.37   What are the criteria for suspension?

(a) USADF may suspend collection action on a debt when:


(1) The debtor cannot be located;


(2) The debtor's financial condition is expected to improve; or


(3) The debtor has requested a waiver or review of the debt.


(b) Based on the current financial condition of the debtor, USADF may suspend collection activity on a debt when the debtor's future prospects justify retention of the claim for periodic review, and:


(1) The applicable statute of limitations has not expired; or


(2) Future collection can be effected by offset; or


(3) The debtor agrees to pay interest on the debt and suspension is likely to enhance the debtor's ability to fully pay the principal amount of the debt with interest at a later date.


(c) USADF will suspend collection activity during the time required for waiver consideration or administrative review prior to agency collection of a debt if the statute under which the request is sought prohibits the Agency from collecting the debt during that time. USADF will ordinarily suspend collection action during the pendency of its consideration of a waiver request or administrative review where statute and regulation preclude refund of amounts collected by the Agency should the debtor prevail.


(d) USADF may suspend collection activities on debts of $100,000 or less during the pendency of a permissive waiver or administrative review when there is no statutory requirement and where it determines that:


(1) There is a reasonable possibility that waiver will be granted and the debtor may be found not owing the debt (in whole or in part);


(2) The Government's interest is protected, if suspension is granted, by the reasonable assurance that the debt can be recovered if the debtor does not prevail; or


(3) Collection of the debt will cause undue hardship to the debtor.


(e) USADF will decline to suspend collection where it determines that the request for waiver or administrative review is frivolous or was made primarily to delay collection.
