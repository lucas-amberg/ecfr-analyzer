# § 1508.215   Which nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions?

The following types of nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions: 


(a) A direct award to— 


(1) A foreign government or foreign governmental entity; 


(2) A public international organization; 


(3) An entity owned (in whole or in part) or controlled by a foreign government; or 


(4) Any other entity consisting wholly or partially of one or more foreign governments or foreign governmental entities. 


(b) A benefit to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted). For example, if a person receives social security benefits under the Supplemental Security Income provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1301 *et seq.,* those benefits are not covered transactions and, therefore, are not affected if the person is excluded. 


(c) Federal employment. 


(d) A transaction that the African Development Foundation needs to respond to a national or agency-recognized emergency or disaster. 


(e) A permit, license, certificate, or similar instrument issued as a means to regulate public health, safety, or the environment, unless the African Development Foundation specifically designates it to be a covered transaction. 


(f) An incidental benefit that results from ordinary governmental operations. 


(g) Any other transaction if the application of an exclusion to the transaction is prohibited by law.
