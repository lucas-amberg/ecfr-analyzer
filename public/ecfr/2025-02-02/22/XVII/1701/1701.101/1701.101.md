# ยง 1701.101   Purpose.

The purpose of this part is to implement the spirit of section 119 of the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services and Developmental Disabilities Amendments of 1978, which amended section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to prohibit discrimination on the basis of handicap in programs or activities conducted by various Executive agencies. Although the USIP does not believe that Congress contemplated coverage of independent Federal institutions, such as the USIP, it has chosen to promulgate this part.
