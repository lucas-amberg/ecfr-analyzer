Equal employment opportunity requirements not to discriminate and to take affirmative action to assure equal employment opportunity as required by Executive Order 11246 and Executive Order 11375 are set forth in Required Contract, Provisions (Form PR-1273 or 1316, as appropriate) and these Special Provisions which are imposed pursuant to section 140 of title 23 U.S.C., as established by section 22 of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968. The requirements set forth in these Special Provisions shall constitute the specific affirmative action requirements for project activities under this contract and supplement the equal employment opportunity requirements set forth in the Required Contract Provisions.


b. The contractor will work with the State highway agencies and the Federal Government in carrying out equal employment opportunity obligations and in their review of his/her activities under the contract.


c. The contractor and all his/her subcontractors holding subcontracts not including material suppliers, of $10,000 or more, will comply with the following minimum specific requirement activities of equal employment opportunity: (The equal employment opportunity requirements of Executive Order 11246, as set forth in volume 6, chapter 4, section 1, subsection 1 of the Federal-Aid Highway Program Manual, are applicable to material suppliers as well as contractors and subcontractors.) The contractor will include these requirements in every subcontract of $10,000 or more with such modification of language as is necessary to make them binding on the subcontractor.


2. *Equal Employment Opportunity Policy.* The contractor will accept as his operating policy the following statement which is designed to further the provision of equal employment opportunity to all persons without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and to promote the full realization of equal employment opportunity through a positive continuing program:


It is the policy of this Company to assure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, religion, sex, color, or national origin. Such action shall include: employment, upgrading, demotion, or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship, preapprenticeship, and/or on-the-job training.


3. *Equal Employment Opportunity Officer.* The contractor will designate and make known to the State highway agency contracting officers and equal employment opportunity officer (hereinafter referred to as the EEO Officer) who will have the responsibility for and must be capable of effectively administering and promoting an active contractor program of equal employment opportunity and who must be assigned adequate authority and responsibility to do so.


4. *Dissemination of Policy.* a. All members of the contractor's staff who are authorized to hire, supervise, promote, and discharge employees, or who recommend such action, or who are substantially involved in such action, will be made fully cognizant of, and will implement, the contractor's equal employment opportunity policy and contractual responsibilities to provide equal employment opportunity in each grade and classification of employment. To ensure that the above agreement will be met, the following actions will be taken as a minimum:


(1) Periodic meetings of supervisory and personnel office employees will be conducted before the start of work and then not less often than once every six months, at which time the contractor's equal employment opportunity policy and its implementation will be reviewed and explained. The meetings will be conducted by the EEO Officer or other knowledgeable company official.


(2) All new supervisory or personnel office employees will be given a thorough indoctrination by the EEO Officer or other knowledgeable company official, covering all major aspects of the contractor's equal employment opportunity obligations within thirty days following their reporting for duty with the contractor.


(3) All personnel who are engaged in direct recruitment for the project will be instructed by the EEO Officer or appropriate company official in the contractor's procedures for locating and hiring minority group employees.


b. In order to make the contractor's equal employment opportunity policy known to all employees, prospective employees and potential sources of employees, *i.e.*, schools, employment agencies, labor unions (where appropriate), college placement officers, etc., the contractor will take the following actions:


(1) Notices and posters setting forth the contractor's equal employment opportunity policy will be placed in areas readily accessible to employees, applicants for employment and potential employees.


(2) The contractor's equal employment opportunity policy and the procedures to implement such policy will be brought to the attention of employees by means of meetings, employee handbooks, or other appropriate means.


5. Recruitment. a. When advertising for employees, the contractor will include in all advertisements for employees the notation: “An Equal Opportunity Employer.” All such advertisements will be published in newspapers or other publications having a large circulation among minority groups in the area from which the project work force would normally be derived.


b. The contractor will, unless precluded by a valid bargaining agreement, conduct systematic and direct recruitment through public and private employee referral sources likely to yield qualified minority group applicants, including, but not limited to, State employment agencies, schools, colleges and minority group organizations. To meet this requirement, the contractor will, through his EEO Officer, identify sources of potential minority group employees, and establish with such identified sources procedures whereby minority group applicants may be referred to the contractor for employment consideration.


In the event the contractor has a valid bargaining agreement providing for exclusive hiring hall referrals, he is expected to observe the provisions of that agreement to the extent that the system permits the contractor's compliance with equal employment opportunity contract provisions. (The U.S. Department of Labor has held that where implementation of such agreements have the effect of discriminating against minorities or women, or obligates the contractor to do the same, such implementation violates Executive Order 11246, as amended.)


c. The contractor will encourage his present employees to refer minority group applicants for employment by posting appropriate notices or bulletins in areas accessible to all such employees. In addition, information and procedures with regard to referring minority group applicants will be discussed with employees.


6. *Personnel Actions.* Wages, working conditions, and employee benefits shall be established and administered, and personnel actions of every type, including hiring, upgrading, promotion, transfer, demotion, layoff, and termination, shall be taken without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The following procedures shall be followed:


a. The contractor will conduct periodic inspections of project sites to insure that working conditions and employee facilities do not indicate discriminatory treatment of project site personnel.


b. The contractor will periodically evaluate the spread of wages paid within each classification to determine any evidence of discriminatory wage practices.


c. The contractor will periodically review selected personnel actions in depth to determine whether there is evidence of discrimination. Where evidence is found, the contractor will promptly take corrective action. If the review indicates that the discrimination may extend beyond the actions reviewed, such corrective action shall include all affected persons.


d. The contractor will promptly investigate all complaints of alleged discrimination made to the contractor in connection with his obligations under this contract, will attempt to resolve such complaints, and will take appropriate corrective action within a reasonable time. If the investigation indicates that the discrimination may affect persons other than the complainant, such corrective action shall include such other persons. Upon completion of each investigation, the contractor will inform every complainant of all of his avenues of appeal.


7. *Training and Promotion.* a. The contractor will assist in locating, qualifying, and increasing the skills of minority group and women employees, and applicants for employment.


b. Consistent with the contractor's work force requirements and as permissible under Federal and State regulations, the contractor shall make full use of training programs, *i.e.*, apprenticeship, and on-the-job training programs for the geographical area of contract performance. Where feasible, 25 percent of apprentices or trainees in each occupation shall be in their first year of apprenticeship or training. In the event the Training Special Provision is provided under this contract, this subparagraph will be superseded as indicated in Attachment 2.


c. The contractor will advise employees and applicants for employment of available training programs and entrance requirements for each.


d. The contractor will periodically review the training and promotion potential of minority group and women employees and will encourage eligible employees to apply for such training and promotion.


8. *Unions.* If the contractor relies in whole or in part upon unions as a source of employees, the contractor will use his/her best efforts to obtain the cooperation of such unions to increase opportunities for minority groups and women within the unions, and to effect referrals by such unions of minority and female employees. Actions by the contractor either directly or through a contractor's association acting as agent will include the procedures set forth below:


a. The contractor will use best efforts to develop, in cooperation with the unions, joint training programs aimed toward qualifying more minority group members and women for membership in the unions and increasing the skills of minority group employees and women so that they may qualify for higher paying employment.


b. The contractor will use best efforts to incorporate an equal employment opportunity clause into each union agreement to the end that such union will be contractually bound to refer applicants without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.


c. The contractor is to obtain information as to the referral practices and policies of the labor union except that to the extent such information is within the exclusive possession of the labor union and such labor union refuses to furnish such information to the contractor, the contractor shall so certify to the State highway department and shall set forth what efforts have been made to obtain such information.


d. In the event the union is unable to provide the contractor with a reasonable flow of minority and women referrals within the time limit set forth in the collective bargaining agreement, the contractor will, through independent recruitment efforts, fill the employment vacancies without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; making full efforts to obtain qualified and/or qualifiable minority group persons and women. (The U.S. Department of Labor has held that it shall be no excuse that the union with which the contractor has a collective bargaining agreement providing for exclusive referral failed to refer minority employees.) In the event the union referral practice prevents the contractor from meeting the obligations pursuant to Executive Order 11246, as amended, and these special provisions, such contractor shall immediately notify the State highway agency.


9. *Subcontracting.* a. The contractor will use his best efforts to solicit bids from and to utilize minority group subcontractors or subcontractors with meaningful minority group and female representation among their employees. Contractors shall obtain lists of minority-owned construction firms from State highway agency personnel.


b. The contractor will use his best efforts to ensure subcontractor compliance with their equal employment opportunity obligations.


10. *Records and Reports.* a. The contractor will keep such records as are necessary to determine compliance with the contractor's equal employment opportunity obligations. The records kept by the contractor will be designed to indicate:


(1) The number of minority and nonminority group members and women employed in each work classification on the project.


(2) The progress and efforts being made in cooperation with unions to increase employment opportunities for minorities and women (applicable only to contractors who rely in whole or in part on unions as a source of their work force),


(3) The progress and efforts being made in locating, hiring, training, qualifying, and upgrading minority and female employees, and


(4) The progress and efforts being made in securing the services of minority group subcontractors or subcontractors with meaningful minority and female representation among their employees.


b. All such records must be retained for a period of three years following completion of the contract work and shall be available at reasonable times and places for inspection by authorized representatives of the State highway agency and the Federal Highway Administration.


c. The contractors will submit an annual report to the State highway agency each July for the duration of the project, indicating the number of minority, women, and non-minority group employees currently engaged in each work classification required by the contract work. This information is to be reported on Form PR 1391. If on-the-job training is being required by “Training Special Provision”, the contractor will be required to furnish Form FHWA 1409.
