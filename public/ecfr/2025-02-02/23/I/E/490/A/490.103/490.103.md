# § 490.103   Data requirements.

(a) *In general.* Unless otherwise noted in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section, the data requirements in this section apply to the measures identified in subparts C through H of this part. Additional data requirements for specific performance management measures are identified in 23 CFR sections—


(1) 490.309 for the condition of pavements on the Interstate System;


(2) 490.309 for the condition of pavements on the non-Interstate NHS;


(3) 490.409 for the condition of bridges on the NHS;


(4) 490.509 for the performance of the Interstate System;


(5) 490.509 for the performance of the non-Interstate NHS;


(6) 490.609 for the freight movement on the Interstate System;


(7) 490.709 for traffic congestion; and


(8) 490.809 for on-road mobile source emissions.


(b) *Urbanized area data.* The State DOTs shall submit urbanized area data, including boundaries of urbanized areas, in accordance with the HPMS Field Manual for the purpose of the additional targets for urbanized and non-urbanized areas in § 490.105(e) and establishing and reporting on targets for the CMAQ Traffic Congestion measures in § 490.707. The boundaries of urbanized areas shall be identified based on the most recent U.S. Decennial Census, unless FHWA approves adjustments to the urbanized area as provided by 23 U.S.C. 101(a)(34) and these adjustments are submitted to HPMS.


(c) *Nonattainment and maintenance areas data.* The State DOTs shall use the nonattainment and maintenance areas boundaries based on the effective date of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designations in 40 CFR part 81.


(d) *National Highway System data.* The State DOTs shall document and submit the extent of the NHS in accordance with the HPMS Field Manual.


(e) *Travel time data set.* Travel time data needed to calculate the measures in subparts E, F, and G of this part will come from the NPMRDS, unless the State DOT requests, and FHWA approves, the use of an equivalent data source(s) that meets the requirements of this section. The State DOT shall establish, in coordination with applicable MPOs, a single travel time data set (*i.e.,* NPMRDS or equivalent data set) that will be used to calculate the annual metrics in subparts E, F, and G of this part. The same data source shall be used for each calendar year. A State DOT and MPO(s) must use the same travel time data set for each reporting segment for the purposes of calculating the metrics and measures. The use of equivalent data source(s) shall comply with the following:


(1) State DOTs and MPOs shall use the same equivalent data source(s) for a calendar year;


(2) The State DOT shall request FHWA approval for the use of such equivalent data source(s) no later than October 1st before the beginning of the calendar year in which the data source would be used to calculate metrics and FHWA must approve the use of that data source prior to a State DOT and MPO(s)'s implementation and use of that data source;


(3) The State DOT shall make the equivalent data source(s) available to FHWA, on request;


(4) The State DOT shall maintain and use a documented data quality plan to routinely check the quality and accuracy of data contained within the equivalent data source(s); and


(5) If approved by FHWA, the equivalent data source(s) shall:


(i) Be used by both the State DOT and all MPOs within the State for all applicable travel time segments and be referenced by HPMS location referencing standards; and


(ii) In combination with or in place of NPMRDS data, include:


(A) Contiguous segments that cover the mainline highways full NHS, as defined in 23 U.S.C. 103, within the State and MPO boundary; and


(B) Average travel times for at least the same number of 15 minute intervals and the same locations that would be available in the NPMRDS;


(iii) Be populated with observed measured vehicle travel times and shall not be populated with travel times derived from imputed (historic travel times or other estimates) methods. Segment travel times may be derived from travel times reported over a longer time period of measurement (path processing or equivalent);


(iv) Include, for each segment at 15 minute intervals throughout the time periods specified in paragraphs (e)(5)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section for each day of the year, the average travel time, recorded to the nearest second, representative of at least one of the following:


(A) All traffic on each segment of the NHS (24 hours on Interstate; 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. for non-Interstate NHS); or


(B) Freight vehicle traffic on each segment of the Interstate System (24 hours);


(v) Include, for each segment, a recording of the time and date of each 15 minute travel time record;


(vi) Include the location (route, functional class, direction, State), length and begin and end points of each segment; and


(vii) Be available within 60 days of measurement.


(f) *Reporting segments.* State DOTs, in coordination with MPOs, shall define a single set of reporting segments of the Interstate System and non-Interstate NHS for the purpose of calculating the travel time-based measures specified in §§ 490.507, 490.607, and 490.707 in accordance with the following:


(1) Reporting segments shall be comprised of one or more contiguous Travel Time Segments of same travel direction. State DOTs have the option to accept the Travel Time Segments in the NPMRDS as the reporting segments;


(2) Reporting segments shall not exceed 1 mile in length in urbanized areas unless an individual Travel Time Segment is longer and 10 miles in length in non-urbanized areas unless an individual Travel Time Segment is longer;


(3) All reporting segments collectively shall be contiguous and cover the full extent of the directional mainline highways of the Interstate System and non-Interstate NHS required for reporting the measure; and


(4) The State DOT and applicable MPOs shall document, in manner that mutually agreed upon by all relevant parties, the coordination and agreement on the travel time data set and the defined reporting segments.


(g) *Posted speed limit.* State DOTs are encouraged to report the posted speed limits for the full extent of the NHS in their State via HPMS (HPMS Data Item “Speed__Limit”).
