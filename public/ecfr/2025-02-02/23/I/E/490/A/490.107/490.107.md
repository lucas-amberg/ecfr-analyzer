(1) *Baseline Performance Period Report*—(i) *Schedule.* State DOTs shall submit a Baseline Performance Period Report to FHWA by October 1st of the first year in a performance period. State DOTs shall submit their first Baseline Performance Period Report to FHWA by October 1, 2018, and subsequent Baseline Performance Period Reports to FHWA by October 1st every 4 years thereafter, except for the GHG measure specified in § 490.105(c)(5). For the Baseline Performance Period Report, State DOTs shall submit information related to the GHG measure in the report due to FHWA by October 1, 2026, and every 4 years thereafter.


(ii) *Content.* The State DOT shall report the following information in each Baseline Performance Period Report:

(B) *Baseline condition/performance.* Baseline condition/performance derived from the latest data collected through the beginning date of the performance period specified in § 490.105(e)(4)(i) for each target, required under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section;


(C) *Relationship with other performance expectations.* A discussion, to the maximum extent practicable, on how the established targets in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section support expectations documented in longer range plans, such as the State asset management plan required by 23 U.S.C. 119(e) and the long-range statewide transportation plan provided in part 450 of this chapter;


(D) *Urbanized area boundaries and population data for targets.* For the purpose of establishing additional targets for urbanized and non-urbanized areas in § 490.105(e)(3) and the urbanized area specific targets in § 490.105(e)(8), State DOTs shall document the boundary extent for all applicable urbanized areas based on information in HPMS;


(E) *Congestion at truck freight bottlenecks.* The State DOT shall document the location of truck freight bottlenecks within the State, including those identified in the National Freight Strategic Plan. If a State has prepared a State Freight Plan under 49 U.S.C. 70202, within the last 2 years, then the State Freight Plan may serve as the basis for identifying truck freight bottlenecks;


(F) *Nonattainment and maintenance area for targets.* Where applicable, for the purpose of determining target scope in § 490.105(d) and any additional targets under § 490.105(e)(9)(iv), State DOTs shall describe the boundaries of U.S. EPA's designated nonattainment and maintenance areas, as described in §§ 490.103(c) and 490.105(e)(9)(v);

(E) *Target adjustment discussion.* When applicable, a State DOT may submit an adjusted 4-year target to replace an established 4-year target in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. If the State DOT adjusts its target, it shall include a discussion on the basis for the adjustment and how the adjusted target supports expectations documented in longer range plans, such as the State asset management plan and the long-range statewide transportation plan.

If FHWA determined under § 490.109(e) that the State DOT has made significant progress for immediate prior performance period's 4-year NHPP or NHFP targets, then the State DOT does not need to include this description for those targets;


(I) *MPO CMAQ Performance Plan.* Where applicable, State DOTs shall include as an attachment the MPO CMAQ Performance Plan, described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and


(J) GHG metric and metric information for the GHG measure. The metric and the individual values used to calculate the GHG metric, as described in § 490.511(c), for the calendar year preceding the reporting year, and a description of the data source(s) used for the VMT information.
