2. Except as otherwise provided in sections II, III, and IV hereof, the contractor shall insert in each of his subcontracts all of the stipulations contained in these Required Contract Provisions and also a clause requiring his subcontractors to include these Required Contract Provisions in any lower tier subcontracts which they may enter into, together with a clause requiring the inclusion of these provisions in any further subcontracts that may in turn be made. The Required Contract Provisions shall in no instance be incorporated by reference.


3. A breach of any of the stipulations contained in these Required Contract Provisions may be grounds for termination of the contract.


4. A breach of the following clauses may also be grounds for debarment as provided in 29 CFR 5.6(b):


Section 1, paragraph 2.


Section VI, paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8a.


Section VII, paragraphs 1, 5a, 5b and 5d.


1. During the performance of this contract, the contractor undertaking to do work which is, or reasonably may be, done as on-site work, shall give preference to qualified persons who regularly reside in the labor area as designated by the United States Department of Labor wherein the contract work is situated, or the subregion, or the Appalachian counties of the State wherein the contract work is situated, except:


a. To the extent that qualified persons regularly residing in the area are not available.


b. For the reasonable needs of the contractor to employ supervisory or specially experienced personnel necessary to assure an efficient execution of the contract work.


c. For the obligation of the contractor to offer employment to present or former employees as the result of a lawful collective bargaining contract, provided that the number of nonresident persons employed under this subparagraph 1c shall not exceed 20 percent of the total number of employees employed by the contractor on the contract work, except as provided in subparagraph 4 below.


2. The contractor shall place a job order with the State Employment Service indicating (a) the classifications of laborers, mechanics and other employees he anticipates will be required to perform the contract work, (b) the number of employees required in each classification, (c) the date on which he estimates such employees will be required, and (d) any other pertinent information required by the State Employment Service to complete the job order form. The job order may be placed with the State Employment Service in writing or by telephone. If during the course of the contract work, the information submitted by the contractor in the original job order is substantially modified, he shall promptly notify the State Employment Service.


3. The contractor shall give full consideration to all qualified job applicants referred to him by the State Employment Service. The contractor is not required to grant employment to any job applicants who, in his opinion, are not qualified to perform the classification of work required.


4. If, within one week following the placing of a job order by the contractor with the State Employment Service, the State Employment Service is unable to refer any qualified job applicants to the contractor, or less than the number requested, the State Employment Service will forward a certificate to the contractor indicating the unavailability of applicants. Such certificate shall be made a part of the contractor's permanent project records. Upon receipt of this certificate, the contractor may employ persons who do not normally reside in the labor area to fill the positions covered by the certificate, notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph 1c above.


5. The contractor shall include the provisions of section II-1 through II-4 in every subcontract for work which is, or reasonably may be, done as on-site work.


During the performance of this contract, the contractor agrees as follows:


a. The contractor will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Such action shall include, but not be limited to the following: Employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoffs or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection of training, including apprenticeship. The contractor agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices to be provided by the State highway department setting forth the provisions of this nondiscrimination clause.


b. The contractor will, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees placed by or on behalf of the contractor, state that all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.


c. The contractor will send to each labor union or representative of workers with which he has a collective bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding, a notice to be provided by the State highway department advising the said labor union or workers' representative of the contractor's commitments under this section III and shall post copies of the notice in conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment.


d. The contractor will comply with all provisions of Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and of the rules, regulations and relevant orders of the Secretary of Labor.


e. The contractor will furnish all information and reports required by Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and by rules, regulations and orders of the Secretary of Labor or pursuant thereto, and will permit access to his books, records and accounts by the Federal Highway Administration and the Secretary of Labor for purposes of investigation to ascertain compliance with such rules, regulations and orders.


f. In the event of the contractor's noncompliance with the nondiscrimination clauses of this contract or with any of the said rules, regulations or orders, this contract may be canceled, terminated or suspended in whole or in part and the contractor may be declared ineligible for further Government contracts or federally-assisted construction contracts in accordance with procedures authorized in Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and such other sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked as provided in Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, or by rule, regulation or order of the Secretary of Labor, or as otherwise provided by law.


g. The contractor will include the provisions of this section III in every subcontract or purchase order unless exempted by rules, regulations or orders of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to section 204 of Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor. The contractor will take such action with respect to any subcontract or purchase order as the State Highway Department or the Federal Highway Administration may direct as a means of enforcing such provisions including sanctions for noncompliance: *Provided, however,* That in the event a contractor becomes involved in, or is threatened with litigation with a subcontractor or vendor as a result of such direction by the Federal Highway Administration, the contractor may request the United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.


During the performance of this contract, the contractor, for itself, its assignees and successors in interest (hereinafter referred to as the *contractor), agrees as follows:*

1. *Compliance with regulations.* The contractor shall comply with the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 324 and with the regulations relative to nondiscrimination in Federally-assisted programs of the Department of Transportation (hereinafter, “DOT”) title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, part 21, as they may be amended from time to time (hereinafter referred to as the Regulations), which are herein incorporated by reference and made a part of this contract.


2. *Nondiscrimination.* The contractor, with regard to the work performed by it during the contract, shall not discriminate on the grounds of race, color, sex, or national origin in the selection and retention of subcontractors, including procurements of materials and leases of equipments. The contractor shall not participate either directly or indirectly in the discrimination prohibited by section 21.5 of the Regulations, including employment practices.


3. *Solicitations for subcontracts including procurement of materials and equipment.* In all solicitations either by competitive bidding or negotiation made by the contractor for work to be performed under a subcontract, including procurements of materials or leases of equipment, each potential subcontractor or supplier, shall be notified by the contractor of the contractor's obligations under this contract and the Regulations relative to nondiscrimination on the grounds of race, color, sex, or national origin.


4. *Information and reports.* The contractor shall provide all information and reports required by the Regulations, or directives issued pursuant thereto, and shall permit access to its books, records, accounts, other sources of information, and its facilities as may be determined by the State highway department or the Federal Highway Administration to be pertinent to ascertain compliance with such Regulations, orders and instructions. Where any information required of a contractor is in the exclusive possession of another who fails or refuses to furnish this information, the contractor shall so certify to the State highway department, or the Federal Highway Administration, as appropriate, and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information.


5. *Sanctions for noncompliance.* In the event of the contractor's noncompliance with the nondiscrimination provisions of this contract, the State highway department shall impose such contract sanctions as it or the Federal Highway Administration may determine to be appropriate, including, but not limited to:


a. Withholding of payments to the contractor under the contract until the contractor complies, and/or


b. Cancellation, termination or suspension of the contract, in whole or in part.


6. *Incorporation of provisions.* The contractor will include the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (6) in every subcontract, including procurements of materials and leases of equipment, unless exempt by the Regulations, or directives issued pursuant thereto. The contractor shall take such action with respect to any subcontract or procurement, as the State highway department or the Federal Highway Administration may direct as a means of enforcing such provisions including sanctions for noncompliance: *Provided, however,* That, in the event a contractor becomes involved in, or is threatened with, litigation with a subcontractor or supplier, as a result of such direction, the contractor may request the State to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the State, and, in addition, the contractor may request the United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.


(Applicable to Federal-aid construction contracts and related subcontracts exceeding $10,000 which are not exempt from the Equal Opportunity clause.)


By submission of this bid, the execution of this contract or subcontract, or the consummation of this material supply agreement, as appropriate, the bidder, Federal-aid construction contractor, subcontractor, or material supplier, as appropriate, certifies that he does not maintain or provide for his employees any segregated facilities at any of his establishments, and that he does not permit his employees to perform their services at any location, under his control, where segregated facilities are maintained. He certifies further that he will not maintain or provide for his employees any segregated facilities at any of his establishments, and that he will not permit his employees to perform their services at any location, under his control, where segregated facilities are maintained. He agrees that a breach of this certification is a violation of the Equal Opportunity clause in this contract. As used in this certification, the term *segregated facilities* means any waiting rooms, work areas, restrooms and washrooms, restaurants and other eating areas, timeclocks, locker rooms and other storage or dressing areas, parking lots, drinking fountains, recreation or entertainment areas, transportation, and housing facilities provided for employees which are segregated by explicit directive or are in fact segregated on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin, because of habit, local custom, or otherwise. He agrees that (except where he has obtained identical certifications from proposed subcontractors and material suppliers for specific time periods), he will obtain identical certifications from proposed subcontractors or material suppliers prior to the award of subcontracts or the consummation of material supply agreements, exceeding $10,000 which are not exempt from the provisions of the Equal Opportunity clause, and that he will retain such certification in his files.


1. *General.* All mechanics and laborers employed or working upon the site of the work will be paid unconditionally and not less than once a week, and without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account, except such payroll deductions as are permitted by regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor under the Copeland Act (29 CFR part 3), the full amounts due at time of payment computed at wage rates not less than those contained in the wage determination decision of the Secretary of Labor which is attached hereto and made a part thereof, regardless of any contractual relationship which may be alleged to exist between the contractor and such laborers and mechanics; and the wage determination decision shall be posted by the contractor at the site of the work in a prominent place where it can be easily seen by the workers. For the purpose of this clause, contributions made or costs reasonably anticipated under section 1(b)(2) of the Davis-Bacon Act on behalf of laborers or mechanics are considered wages paid to such laborers or mechanics, subject to the provisions of section VI, paragraph 3b, hereof. Also for the purpose of this clause, regular contributions made or costs incurred for more than a weekly period under plans, funds, or programs, but covering the particular weekly period, are deemed to be constructively made or incurred during such weekly period.


2. *Classifications*—a. The State highway department contracting officer shall require that any class of laborers or mechanics which is not listed in the wage determination and which is to be employed under the contract, shall be classified or reclassified conformably to the wage determination, and a report of the action taken shall be sent by the State highway department contracting officer to the Secretary of Labor.


b. In the event the interested parties cannot agree on the proper classification or reclassification of a particular class of laborers and mechanics to be used, the question accompanied by the recommendation of the State highway department contracting officer shall be referred to the Secretary for final determination.


3. *Payment of fringe benefits*—a. The State highway department contracting officer shall require, whenever the minimum wage rate prescribed in the contract for a class of laborers or mechanics includes a fringe benefit which is not expressed as an hourly wage rate and the contractor is obligated to pay a cash equivalent of such a fringe benefit, an hourly cash equivalent thereof to be established. In the event the interested parties cannot agree upon a cash equivalent of the fringe benefits, the question, accompanied by the recommendation of the contracting officer, shall be referred to the Secretary of Labor for determination.


b. If the contractor does not make payments to a trustee or other third person, he may consider as part of the wage of any laborer or mechanic the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing benefits under a plan or program of a type expressly listed in the wage determination decision of the Secretary of Labor which is part of this contract: *Provided, however,* The Secretary of Labor has found, upon the written request of the contractor, that the applicable standards of the Davis-Bacon Act have been met. The Secretary of Labor may require the contractor to set aside in a separate account assets for the meeting of obligations under the plan or program.


4. *Payment of excess wages.* While the wage rates shown are the minimum rates required by the contract to be paid during its life, this is not a representation that labor can be obtained at these rates. No increase in the contract price shall be allowed or authorized on account of the payment of wage rates in excess of those listed herein.


5. *Apprentices and trainees (Programs of Department of Labor).* a. Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they performed when they are employed and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with the U.S. Department of Labor, Manpower Administration, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, or with a State Apprenticeship Agency recognized by the Bureau, or if a person is employed in his first 90 days of probationary employment as an apprentice in such an apprenticeship program, who is not individually registered in the program, but who has been certified by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training or a State Apprenticeship Agency (where appropriate) to be eligible for probationary employment as an apprentice. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program. Any employee listed on a payroll at an apprentice wage rate, who is not a trainee as defined in 29 CFR 5.2(c)(2) or is not registered or otherwise employed as stated above, shall be paid the wage rate determined by the Secretary of Labor for the classification of work he actually performed. The contractor or subcontractor will be required to furnish to the State highway department or to a representative of the Wage-Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor written evidence of the registration of his program and apprentices as well as the appropriate ratios and wage rates (expressed in percentages of the journeyman hourly rates), for the area of construction prior to using any apprentices on the contract work. The wage rate paid apprentices shall be not less than the appropriate percentage of the journeyman's rate contained in the applicable wage determination.


b. Trainees, except as provided in 29 CFR 5.15, will not be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work performed unless they are employed pursuant to and individually registered in a program which has received prior approval, evidenced by formal certification, by the U.S. Department of Labor, Manpower Administration, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training. The ratio of trainees to journeymen shall not be greater than permitted under the plan approved by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training. Every trainee must be paid at not less than the rate specified in the approved program for his level of progress. Any employee listed on the payroll at a trainee rate who is not registered and participating in a training plan approved by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training shall be paid not less than the wage rate determined by the Secretary of Labor for the classification of work he actually performed. The contractor or subcontractor will be required to furnish the State highway department or a representative of the Wage-Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor written evidence of the certification of his program, the registration of the trainees, and the ratios and wage rates prescribed in that program. In the event the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training withdraws approval of a training program, the contractor will no longer be permitted to utilize trainees at less than the applicable predetermined rate for the work performed until an acceptable program is approved.


c. The utilization of apprentices, trainees and journeymen shall be in conformity with the equal employment opportunity requirements of Executive Order 11246, as amended, and 29 CFR part 30.


6. *Apprentices and trainees (Programs of Department of Transportation).* Apprentices and trainees working under apprenticeship and skill training programs which have been certified by the Secretary of Transportation as promoting equal opportunity in connection with Federal-aid highway construction programs are not subject to the requirements of section VI, paragraph 5 above. The straight time hourly wage rates for apprentices and trainees under such programs will be established by the particular programs.


7. *Withholding for unpaid wages.* The State highway department contracting officer may withhold or cause to be withheld from the contractor so much of the accrued payments or advances as may be considered necessary to pay laborers, mechanics, (including apprentices and trainees) watchmen, or guards employed by the contractor or any subcontractor on the work the full amount of wages required by the contract. In the event of failure to pay any laborer, mechanic, (including apprentices and trainees) watchman or guard employed or working on the site of the work, all or part of the wages required by the contract, the State highway department contracting officer may, after written notice to the contractor, take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of any further payment, advance, or guarantee of funds until such violations have ceased.


8. *Overtime requirements.* a. No contractor or subcontractor contracting for any part of the contract work which may require or involve the employment of laborers, mechanics, watchmen or guards (including apprentices and trainees described in paragraphs 5 and 6 above) shall require or permit any laborer, mechanic, watchman or guard in any workweek in which he is employed on such work, to work in excess of eight hours in any calendar day or in excess of forty hours in such workweek unless such laborer, mechanic, watchman or guard receives compensation at a rate not less than one and one-half times his basic rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight hours in any calendar day or in excess of forty hours in such workweek, as the case may be.


b. In the event of any violation of paragraph 8a, the contractor and any subcontractor responsible therefor shall be liable to any affected employee for his unpaid wages. In addition, such contractor and subcontractor shall be liable to the United States for liquidated damages. Such liquidated damages shall be computed with respect to each individual laborer, mechanic, watchman or guard employed in violation of paragraph 8a, in the sum of $10 for each calendar day on which such employee was required or permitted to work in excess of eight hours or in excess of the standard workweek of forty hours without payment of the overtime wages required by paragraph 8a.


c. The State highway department contracting officer may withhold or cause to be withheld, from any moneys payable on account of work performed by the contractor or subcontractor, such sums as may administratively be determined to be necessary to satisfy any liabilities of such contractor or subcontractor for liquidated damages as provided in paragraph 8b.


1. *Compliance with Copeland Regulations (29 CFR part 3).* The contractor shall comply with the Copeland Regulations (29 CFR part 3) of the Secretary of Labor which are herein incorporated by reference.


2. *Weekly statement.* Each contractor or subcontractor shall furnish each week a statement to the State highway department resident engineer with respect to the wages paid each of its employees, including apprentices and trainees described in section VI, paragraphs 5 and 6, and watchmen and guards on work covered by the Copeland Regulations during the preceding weekly payroll period. The statement shall be executed by the contractor or subcontractor or by an authorized officer or employee of the contractor or subcontractor who supervises the payment of wages. Contractors and subcontractors must use the certification set forth on U.S. Department of Labor Form WH-348, or the same certification appearing on the reverse of Optional U.S. Department of Labor Form WH-347, or on any form with identical wording.


3. *Final labor summary.* The contractor and each subcontractor shall furnish, upon the completion of the contract, a summary of all employment, indicating for the completed project the total hours worked and the total amount earned. This data shall be submitted to the State highway department resident engineer on Form PR-47 together with the data required in section VIII, hereof, relative to materials and supplies.


4. *Final certificate.* Upon completion of the contract, the contractor shall submit to the State highway department contracting officer, for transmission to the Federal Highway Administration with the voucher for final payment for any work performed under the contract, a certificate concerning wages and classifications for laborers, mechanics, watchmen and guards employed on the project, in the following form:


The undersigned, contractor on


5. *Payrolls and payroll records*—a. Payrolls and basic records relating thereto will be maintained during the course of the work and preserved for a period of three years thereafter for all laborers, mechanics, apprentices, trainees, watchmen and guards working at the site of the work.


b. The payroll records shall contain the name, social security number and address of each such employee, his correct classification, rates of pay (including rates of contributions or costs anticipated of the types described in section 1(b)(2) of the Davis-Bacon Act), daily and weekly number of hours worked, deductions made and actual wages paid. Whenever the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to section VI, paragraph 3.b., has found that the wages of any laborer or mechanic include the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing benefits under a plan or program described in section I(b)(2)(B) of the Davis-Bacon Act, the contractor shall maintain records which show that the commitment to provide such benefits is enforceable, that the plan or program is financially responsible, and that the plan or program has been communicated in writing to the laborers or mechanics affected, and records which show the costs anticipated or the actual cost incurred in providing such benefits.


c. The payrolls shall contain the following information:


1. The employee's full name, address and social security number and a notation indicating whether the employee does, or does not, normally reside in the labor area as defined in section II, paragraph 1.a. (The employee's full name and social security number need only appear on the first payroll on which his name appears. The employee's address need only be shown on the first submitted payroll on which the employee's name appears, unless a change of address necessitates a submittal to reflect the new address.)


2. The employee's classification.


3. Entries indicating the employee's basic hourly wage rate and, where applicable, the overtime hourly wage rate. The payroll should indicate separately the amounts of employee and employer contributions to fringe benefits funds and/or programs. Any fringe benefits paid to the employee in cash must be indicated. There is no prescribed or mandatory form for showing the above information on payrolls.


4. The employee's daily and weekly hours worked in each classification, including actual overtime hours worked (not adjusted).


5. The itemized deductions made and


6. The net wages paid.


d. The contractor will submit weekly a copy of all payrolls to the State highway department resident engineer. The copy shall be accompanied by a statement signed by the employer or his agent indicating that the payrolls are correct and complete, that the wage rates contained therein are not less than those determined by the Secretary of Labor and the classifications set forth for each laborer or mechanic conform with the work he performed. Submission of a weekly statement which is required under this contract by section VII, paragraph 2, and the Copeland Regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR part 3) and the filing with the initial payroll or any subsequent payroll of a copy of any findings by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to section VI, paragraph 3b, shall satisfy this requirement. The prime contractor shall be responsible for the submission of copies of payrolls of all subcontractors. The contractor will make the records required under the labor standards clauses of the contract available for inspection by authorized representatives of the State highway department, the Federal Highway Administration and the Department of Labor, and will permit such representatives to interview employees during working hours on the job.


e. The wages of labor shall be paid in legal tender of the United States, except that this condition will be considered satisfied if payment is made by negotiable check, on a solvent bank, which may be cashed readily by the employee in the local community for the full amount, without discount or collection charges of any kind. Where checks are used for payment, the contractor shall make all necessary arrangements for them to be cashed and shall given information regarding such arrangements.


f. No fee of any kind shall be asked or accepted by the contractor or any of his agents from any person as a condition of employment on the project.


g. No laborers shall be charged for any tools used in performing their respective duties except for reasonably avoidable loss or damage thereto.


h.

i. No charge shall be made for any transportation furnished by the contractor, or his agents, to any person employed on the work.


j. No individual shall be employed as a laborer or mechanic on this contract except on a wage basis, but this shall not be construed to prohibit the rental of teams, trucks, or other equipment from individuals.


1. The contractor shall maintain a record of the total cost of all materials and supplies purchased for and incorporated in the work, and also of the quantities of those specific materials and supplies listed on Form PR-47 and in the units shown. Upon completion of the contract, this record, together with the final labor summary required in section VII, paragraph 3, hereof, shall be transmitted to the State highway department resident engineer for the project on Form PR-47 in accordance with instructions attached thereto, which will be furnished for this purpose upon request. The quantities for the listed items shall be reported separately for roadway and for structures over 20 feet long as measured along the centerline of the roadway.


2. The contractor shall become familiar with the list of specific materials and supplies contained in Form PR-47 prior to the commencement of work under this contract. Any additional materials information required will be solicited through revisions of Form PR-47 with attendant explanations.


3. Where subcontracts are involved the contractor shall submit either a single report covering work both by himself and all his subcontractors, or he may submit separate reports for himself and for each of his subcontractors.


1. The contractor shall perform with his own organization contract work amounting to not less than 50 percent of the original total contract price, except that any items designated by the State as *Specialty Items* may be performed by subcontract and the amount of any such *Specialty Items* so performed may be deducted from the original total contract price before computing the amount of work required to be performed by the contractor with his own organization.


a. *His own organization* shall be construed to include only workmen employed and paid directly by the prime contractor and equipment owned or rented by him, with or without operators.


b. *Specialty items* shall be construed to be limited to work that requires highly specialized knowledge, craftsmanship or equipment not ordinarily available in contracting organizations qualified to bid on the contract as a whole and in general are to be limited to minor components of the overall contract.


2. In addition to the 50 percent requirements set forth in paragraph 1 above, the contractor shall furnish (a) a competent superintendent or foreman who is employed by him, who has full authority to direct performance of the work in accordance with the contract requirements, and who is in charge of all construction operations (regardless of who performs the work), and (b) such other of his own organizational capability and responsibility (supervision, management, and engineering services) as the State highway department contracting officer determines is necessary to assure the performance of the contract.


3. The contract amount upon which the 50 percent requirement set forth in paragraph 1 is computed includes the cost of materials and manufactured products which are to be purchased or produced by the contractor under the contract provisions.


4. Any items that have been selected as *Specialty Items* for the contract are listed as such in the Special Provisions, bid schedule, or elsewhere in the contract documents.


5. No portion of the contract shall be sublet, assigned or otherwise disposed of except with the written consent of the State highway department contracting officer, or his authorized representative, and such consent when given shall not be construed to relieve the contractor of any responsibility for the fulfillment of the contract. Request for permission to sublet, assign or otherwise dispose of any portion of the contract shall be in writing and accompanied by (a) a showing that the organization which will perform the work is particularly experienced and equipped for such work, and (b) an assurance by the contractor that the labor standards provisions set forth in thiscontract shall apply to labor performed on all work encompassed by the request.


In the performance of this contract, the contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws governing safety, health and sanitation. The contractor shall provide all safeguards, safety devices and protective equipment and take any other needed actions, on his own responsibility, or as the State highway department contracting officer may determine, reasonably necessary to protect the life and health of employees on the job and the safety of the public and to protect property in connection with the performance of the work covered by the contract.


It is a condition of this contract, and shall be made a condition of each subcontract entered into pursuant to this contract, that the contractor and any subcontractor shall not require any laborer or mechanic employed in performance of the contract to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to his health or safety, as determined under construction safety and health standards (title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, part 1926, formerly part 1518, as revised from time to time), promulgated by the United States Secretary of Labor, in accordance with section 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (83 Stat. 96).


In order to assure high quality and durable construction in conformity with approved plans and specifications and a high degree of reliability on statements and representations made by engineers, contractors, suppliers, and workers on Federal-aid highway projects, it is essential that all persons concerned with the project perform their functions as carefully, thoroughly and honestly as possible. Willfull falsification, distortion, or misrepresentation with respect to any facts related to the project is a violation of Federal law. To prevent any misunderstanding regarding the seriousness of these and similar acts, the following notice shall be posted on each Federal-aid highway project in one or more places where it is readily available to all personnel concerned with the project:
