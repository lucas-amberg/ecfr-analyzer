# ยง 635.203   Definitions.

The following definitions shall apply for the purpose of this subpart:


(a) A *State transportation department* is that department, commission, board, or official of any State charged by its laws with the responsibility for highway construction. The term *State* should be considered equivalent to *State transportation department* if the context so implies.


(b) Except as provided for as emergency repair work in ยง 668.105(i) and in ยง 635.204(b), the term *some other method* of construction as used in 23 U.S.C. 112(b) shall mean the *force account* method of construction as defined herein. In the unlikely event that circumstances are considered to justify a negotiated contract or another unusual method of construction, the policies and procedures prescribed herein for force account work will apply.


(c) The term *force account* shall mean the direct performance of highway construction work by a State transportation department, a county, a railroad, or a public utility company by use of labor, equipment, materials, and supplies furnished by them and used under their direct control.


(d) The term *county* shall mean any county, township, municipality or other political subdivision that may be empowered to cooperate with the State transportation department in highway matters.


(e) The term *cost effective* shall mean the efficient use of labor, equipment, materials and supplies to assure the lowest overall cost.


(f) For the purpose of this part, an *emergency* shall be deemed to exist when emergency repair work as provided for in ยง 668.105(i) is necessary or when a major element or segment of the highway system has failed and the situation is such that competitive bidding is not possible or is impractical because immediate action is necessary to:


(1) Minimize the extent of the damage,


(2) Protect remaining facilities, or


(3) Restore essential travel.
