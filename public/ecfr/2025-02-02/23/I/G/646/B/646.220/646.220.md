(1) All projects under § 646.206(a) (1) and (2).


(2) Major adjustments to railroad facilities under § 646.206(b).


(d) Any State wishing to adopt the alternate procedure may file a formal application for approval by FHWA. The application must include the following:

(2) A statement signed by the Chief Administrative Officer of the State highway agency certifying that:


(i) The work will be done in accordance with the applicable provisions of the State's policies and procedures submitted under § 646.220(d)(1), and


(ii) Reimbursement will be requested in only those costs properly attributable to the highway construction and eligible for Federal fund participation.


(e) When FHWA has approved the alternate procedure, it may authorize the State to proceed in accordance with the State's certification, subject to the following conditions:


(1) The work has been programmed.


(2) The State submits in writing a request for such authorization which shall include a list of the improvements or adjustments to be processed under the alternate procedure, along with the best available estimate of cost.
