# § 680.104   Definitions.

*AC Level 2* means a charger that operates on a circuit from 208 volts to 240 volts and transfers alternating-current (AC) electricity to a device in an EV that converts alternating current to direct current to recharge an EV battery.


*Alternative Fuel Corridor (AFC)* means national EV charging and hydrogen, propane, and natural gas fueling corridors designated by FHWA pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 151.


*CHAdeMO* means a type of protocol for a charging connector interface between an EV and a charger (see *www.chademo.com*). It specifies the physical, electrical, and communication requirements of the connector and mating vehicle inlet for direct-current (DC) fast charging. It is an abbreviation of “charge de move”, equivalent to “charge for moving.”


*Charger* means a device with one or more charging ports and connectors for charging EVs. Also referred to as Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE).


*Charging network* means a collection of chargers located on one or more property(ies) that are connected via digital communications to manage the facilitation of payment, the facilitation of electrical charging, and any related data requests.


*Charging network provider* means the entity that operates the digital communication network that remotely manages the chargers. Charging network providers may also serve as charging station operators and/or manufacture chargers.


*Charging port* means the system within a charger that charges one EV. A charging port may have multiple connectors, but it can provide power to charge only one EV through one connector at a time.


*Charging station* means the area in the immediate vicinity of a group of chargers and includes the chargers, supporting equipment, parking areas adjacent to the chargers, and lanes for vehicle ingress and egress. A charging station could comprise only part of the property on which it is located.


*Charging station operator* means the entity that owns the chargers and supporting equipment and facilities at one or more charging stations. Although this entity may delegate responsibility for certain aspects of charging station operation and maintenance to subcontractors, this entity retains responsibility for operation and maintenance of chargers and supporting equipment and facilities. In some cases, the charging station operator and the charging network provider are the same entity.


*Combined Charging System (CCS)* means a standard connector interface that allows direct current fast chargers to connect to, communicate with, and charge EVs.


*Community* means either a group of individuals living in geographic proximity to one another, or a geographically dispersed set of individuals (such as individuals with disabilities, migrant workers, or Native Americans), where either type of group experiences common conditions.


*Connector* means the device that attaches an EV to a charging port in order to transfer electricity.


*Contactless payment methods* means a secure method for consumers to purchase services using a debit card, credit card, smartcard, mobile application, or another payment device by using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology and near-field communication (NFC).


*Cryptographic agility* means the capacity to rapidly update or switch between data encryption systems, algorithms, and processes without the need to redesign the protocol, software, system, or standard.


*Direct Current Fast Charger (DCFC)* means a charger that enables rapid charging by delivering direct-current (DC) electricity directly to an EV's battery.


*Disadvantaged communities (DACs)* mean census tracts or communities with common conditions identified by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the U.S. Department of Energy that consider appropriate data, indices, and screening tools to determine whether a specific community is disadvantaged based on a combination of variables that may include, but are not limited to, the following: low income, high and/or persistent poverty; high unemployment and underemployment; racial and ethnic residential segregation, particularly where the segregation stems from discrimination by government entities; linguistic isolation; high housing cost burden and substandard housing; distressed neighborhoods; high transportation cost burden and/or low transportation access; disproportionate environmental stressor burden and high cumulative impacts; limited water and sanitation access and affordability; disproportionate impacts from climate change; high energy cost burden and low energy access; jobs lost through the energy transition; and limited access to healthcare.


*Distributed energy resource* means small, modular, energy generation and storage technologies that provide electric capacity or energy where it is needed.


*Electric Vehicle (EV)* means a motor vehicle that is either partially or fully powered on electric power received from an external power source. For the purposes of this regulation, this definition does not include golf carts, electric bicycles, or other micromobility devices.


*Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program (EVITP)* refers to a comprehensive training program for the installation of electric vehicle supply equipment. For more information, refer to *https://evitp.org/.*

*Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE)* See definition of a charger.


*Open Charge Point Interface (OCPI)* means an open-source communication protocol that governs the communication among multiple charging networks, other communication networks, and software applications to provide information and services for EV drivers.


*Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP)* means an open-source communication protocol that governs the communication between chargers and the charging networks that remotely manage the chargers.


*Plug and Charge* means a method of initiating charging, whereby an EV charging customer plugs a connector into their vehicle and their identity is authenticated through digital certificates defined by ISO-15118, a charging session initiates, and a payment is transacted automatically, without any other customer actions required at the point of use.


*Power Sharing* means dynamically limiting the charging power output of individual charging ports at the same charging station to ensure that the sum total power output to all EVs concurrently charging remains below a maximum power threshold. This is also called automated load management.


*Private entity* means a corporation, partnership, company, other nongovernmental entity, or nonprofit organization.


*Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)* means a system of processes, technologies, and policies to encrypt and digitally sign data. It involves the creation, management, and exchange of digital certificates that authenticate the identity of users, devices, or services to ensure trust and secure communication.


*Secure payment method* means a type of payment processing that ensures a user's financial and personal information is protected from fraud and unauthorized access.


*Smart charge management* means controlling the amount of power dispensed by chargers to EVs to meet customers' charging needs while also responding to external power demand or pricing signals to provide load management, resilience, or other benefits to the electric grid.


*State EV infrastructure deployment plan* means the plan submitted to the FHWA by the State describing how it intends to use its apportioned NEVI Formula Program funds.
