(1) Requires FHWA approval regardless of funding sources, or


(2) Is funded with Federal-aid highway funds.


(b) In order to obtain FHWA approval, the highway agency shall develop noise policies in conformance with this regulation and shall apply these policies uniformly and consistently statewide.


(c) This regulation applies to all Type I projects unless the regulation specifically indicates that a section only applies to Type II or Type III projects.


(d) The development and implementation of Type II projects are not mandatory requirements of section 109(i) of title 23, United States Code.


(e) If a highway agency chooses to participate in a Type II program, the highway agency shall develop a priority system, based on a variety of factors, to rank the projects in the program. This priority system shall be submitted to and approved by FHWA before the highway agency is allowed to use Federal-aid funds for a project in the program. The highway agency shall re-analyze the priority system on a regular interval, not to exceed 5 years.


(f) For a Type III project, a highway agency is not required to complete a noise analysis or consider abatement measures.
