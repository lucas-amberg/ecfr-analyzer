# § 940.11   Project implementation.

(a) All ITS projects funded with highway trust funds shall be based on a systems engineering analysis. 


(b) The analysis should be on a scale commensurate with the project scope. 


(c) The systems engineering analysis shall include, at a minimum: 


(1) Identification of portions of the regional ITS architecture being implemented (or if a regional ITS architecture does not exist, the applicable portions of the National ITS Architecture); 


(2) Identification of participating agencies roles and responsibilities; 


(3) Requirements definitions; 


(4) Analysis of alternative system configurations and technology options to meet requirements; 


(5) Procurement options; 


(6) Identification of applicable ITS standards and testing procedures; and 


(7) Procedures and resources necessary for operations and management of the system. 


(d) Upon completion of the regional ITS architecture required in §§ 940.9(b) or 940.9(c), the final design of all ITS projects funded with highway trust funds shall accommodate the interface requirements and information exchanges as specified in the regional ITS architecture. If the final design of the ITS project is inconsistent with the regional ITS architecture, then the regional ITS architecture shall be updated as provided in the process defined in § 940.9(f) to reflect the changes. 


(e) Prior to the completion of the regional ITS architecture, any major ITS project funded with highway trust funds that advances to final design shall have a project level ITS architecture that is coordinated with the development of the regional ITS architecture. The final design of the major ITS project shall accommodate the interface requirements and information exchanges as specified in this project level ITS architecture. If the project final design is inconsistent with the project level ITS architecture, then the project level ITS architecture shall be updated to reflect the changes. The project level ITS architecture is based on the results of the systems engineering analysis, and includes the following: 


(1) A description of the scope of the ITS project; 


(2) An operational concept that identifies the roles and responsibilities of participating agencies and stakeholders in the operation and implementation of the ITS project; 


(3) Functional requirements of the ITS project; 


(4) Interface requirements and information exchanges between the ITS project and other planned and existing systems and subsystems; and 


(5) Identification of applicable ITS standards. 


(f) All ITS projects funded with highway trust funds shall use applicable ITS standards and interoperability tests that have been officially adopted through rulemaking by the DOT. 


(g) Any ITS project that has advanced to final design by April 8, 2001 is exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section.
