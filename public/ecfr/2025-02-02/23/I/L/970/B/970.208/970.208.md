# ยง 970.208   Federal lands pavement management system (PMS).

In addition to the requirements provided in ยง 970.204, the PMS must meet the following requirements:


(a) The NPS shall have PMS coverage of all paved park roads, parkways, parking areas and other associated facilities, as appropriate, that are funded under the FLHP.


(b) The PMS may be utilized at various levels of technical complexity depending on the nature of the transportation network. These different levels may depend on mileage, functional classes, volumes, loading, usage, surface type, or other criteria the NPS deems appropriate.


(c) The PMS shall be designed to fit the NPS goals, policies, criteria, and needs using the following components, at a minimum, as a basic framework for a PMS:


(1) A database and an ongoing program for the collection and maintenance of the inventory, inspection, cost, and supplemental data needed to support the PMS. The minimum PMS database shall include:


(i) An inventory of the physical pavement features including the number of lanes, length, width, surface type, functional classification, and shoulder information;


(ii) A history of project dates and types of construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, and preventive maintenance. If some of the inventory or historic data is difficult to establish, it may be collected when preservation or reconstruction work is performed;


(iii) Condition data that includes roughness, distress, rutting, and surface friction (as appropriate);


(iv) Traffic information including volumes and vehicle classification (as appropriate); and


(v) Data for estimating the costs of actions.


(2) A system for applying network level analytical procedures that are capable of analyzing data for all park roads, parkways and other appropriate associated facilities in the inventory or any subset. The minimum analyses shall include:


(i) A pavement condition analysis that includes roughness, distress, rutting, and surface friction (as appropriate);


(ii) A pavement performance analysis that includes present and predicted performance and an estimate of the remaining service life (performance and remaining service life to be developed with time); and


(iii) An investment analysis that:


(A) Identifies alternative strategies to improve pavement conditions;


(B) Estimates costs of any pavement improvement strategy;


(C) Determines maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation strategies for pavements using life-cycle cost analysis or a comparable procedure;


(D) Provides for short and long term budget forecasting; and


(E) Recommends optimal allocation of limited funds by developing a prioritized list of candidate projects over a predefined planning horizon (both short and long term).


(d) For any park roads, parkways and other appropriate associated facilities in the inventory or subset thereof, PMS reporting requirements shall include, but are not limited to, percentage of roads in good, fair, and poor condition.
