# ยง 972.204   Management systems requirements.

(a) The FWS shall develop, establish and implement the management systems as described in this subpart. The FWS may tailor the management systems to meet the FWS goals, policies, and needs using professional engineering and planning judgment to determine the required nature and extent of systems coverage consistent with the intent and requirements of this rule. 


(b) The FWS and the FHWA shall develop an implementation plan for each of the management systems. These plans will include, but are not limited to, the following: Overall goals and policies concerning the management systems, each agency's responsibilities for developing and implementing the management systems, implementation schedule, data sources, and cost estimate. The FHWA will provide the FWS ongoing technical engineering support for the development, implementation, and maintenance of the management systems. 


(c) The FWS shall develop and implement procedures for the development, establishment, implementation and operation of management systems. The procedures shall include: 


(1) A process for ensuring the results of any of the management systems are considered in the development of FWS transportation plans and transportation improvement programs and in making project selection decisions under 23 U.S.C. 204; 


(2) A process for the analyses and coordination of all management system outputs to systematically operate, maintain, and upgrade existing transportation assets cost-effectively; 


(3) A description of each management system; 


(4) A process to operate and maintain the management systems and their associated databases; and


(5) A process for data collection, processing, analysis and updating for each management system.


(d) All management systems will use databases with a geographical reference system that can be used to geolocate all database information.


(e) Existing data sources may be used by the FWS to the maximum extent possible to meet the management system requirements.


(f) The FWS shall develop an appropriate means to evaluate the effectiveness of the management systems in enhancing transportation decision-making and improving the overall efficiency of the affected federally owned transportation systems and facilities. This evaluation is to be conducted periodically, preferably as part of the comprehensive resource conservation planning process.


(g) The management systems shall be operated so investment decisions based on management system outputs can be accomplished at the regional level.
