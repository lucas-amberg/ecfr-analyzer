# § 1300.22   State Traffic Safety Information System Improvements Grants.

(a) *Purpose.* This section establishes criteria, in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 405(c), for grants to States to develop and implement effective programs that improve the timeliness, accuracy, completeness, uniformity, integration, and accessibility of State safety data needed to identify priorities for Federal, State, and local highway and traffic safety programs; evaluate the effectiveness of such efforts; link State data systems, including traffic records and systems that contain medical, roadway, and economic data; improve the compatibility and interoperability of State data systems with national data systems and the data systems of other States, including the National EMS Information System; and enhance the agency's ability to observe and analyze national trends in crash occurrences, rates, outcomes, and circumstances.


(b) *Qualification criteria.* To qualify for a grant under this section in a fiscal year, a State shall submit as part of its annual grant application the following documentation, in accordance with part 2 of appendix B to this part:


(1) *Certification.* The State shall submit a certification that it has—


(i) A functioning *traffic records coordinating committee (TRCC)* that meets at least three times each year;


(ii) Designated a traffic records coordinating committee coordinator; and


(iii) Established a State traffic records strategic plan, updated annually, that has been approved by the TRCC and describes specific, quantifiable and measurable improvements anticipated in the State's core safety databases, including crash, citation or adjudication, driver, emergency medical services or injury surveillance system, roadway, and vehicle databases; and


(2) *Quantitative improvement.* The State shall demonstrate quantitative improvement in the data attribute of accuracy, completeness, timeliness, uniformity, accessibility or integration of a core database by providing—


(i) A written description of the performance measure(s) that clearly identifies which performance attribute for which core database the State is relying on to demonstrate progress, using the methodology set forth in the “Model Performance Measures for State Traffic Records Systems” (DOT HS 811 441), as updated; and


(ii) Supporting documentation covering a contiguous 12-month performance period starting no earlier than April 1 of the calendar year prior to the application due date, that demonstrates quantitative improvement when compared to the comparable 12-month baseline period.


(c) *Award amounts.* The amount of a grant awarded to a State in a fiscal year under this section shall be in proportion to the amount the State received under Section 402 for fiscal year 2009.


(d) *Use of grant funds.* A State may use grant funds awarded under 23 U.S.C. 405(c) only to make data program improvements to core highway safety databases relating to quantifiable, measurable progress in the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, uniformity, accessibility or integration of data in a core highway safety database, including through—


(1) Software or applications to identify, collect, and report data to State and local government agencies, and enter data into State core highway safety databases, including crash, citation or adjudication, driver, emergency medical services or injury surveillance system, roadway, and vehicle data;


(2) Purchasing equipment to improve a process by which data are identified, collated, and reported to State and local government agencies, including technology for use by law enforcement for near-real time, electronic reporting of crash data;


(3) Improving the compatibility and interoperability of the core highway safety databases of the State with national data systems and data systems of other States, including the National EMS Information System;


(4) Enhancing the ability of a State and the Secretary to observe and analyze local, State, and national trends in crash occurrences, rates, outcomes, and circumstances;


(5) Supporting traffic records improvement training and expenditures for law enforcement, emergency medical, judicial, prosecutorial, and traffic records professionals;


(6) Hiring traffic records professionals for the purpose of improving traffic information systems (including a State Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) liaison);


(7) Adoption of the Model Minimum Uniform Crash Criteria, or providing to the public information regarding why any of those criteria will not be used, if applicable;


(8) Supporting reporting criteria relating to emerging topics, including—


(i) Impaired driving as a result of drug, alcohol, or polysubstance consumption; and


(ii) Advanced technologies present on motor vehicles; and


(9) Conducting research relating to State traffic safety information systems, including developing programs to improve core highway safety databases and processes by which data are identified, collected, reported to State and local government agencies, and entered into State core safety databases.
