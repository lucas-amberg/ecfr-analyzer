(2) The prevailing rate for the kind and quality of services furnished in the community in which the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily performs services; 


(3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant; 


(4) The time reasonably spent in the light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and 


(5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services provided. 


(c) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project, or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be awarded, to the extent that the charge for the services does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.
