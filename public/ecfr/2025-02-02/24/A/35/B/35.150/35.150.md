# ยง 35.150   Compliance with other State, tribal, and local laws.

(a) *HUD responsibility.* If HUD determines that a State, tribal or local law, ordinance, code or regulation provides for evaluation or hazard reduction in a manner that provides a comparable level of protection from the hazards of lead-based paint poisoning to that provided by the requirements of subparts B, C, D, F through M and R of this part and that adherence to the requirements of subparts B, C, D, F through M, and R of this part, would be duplicative or otherwise cause inefficiencies, HUD may modify or waive some or all of the requirements of the subparts in a manner that will promote efficiency while ensuring a comparable level of protection.


(b) *Participant responsibility.* Nothing in this part is intended to relieve any participant in a program covered by this subpart of any responsibility for compliance with State, tribal or local laws, ordinances, codes or regulations governing evaluation and hazard reduction. If a State, tribal or local law, ordinance, code or regulation defines lead-based paint differently than the Federal definition, the more protective definition (i.e., the lower level) shall be followed in that State, tribal or local jurisdiction.
