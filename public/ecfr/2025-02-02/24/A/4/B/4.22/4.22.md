# § 4.22   Definitions.

*Application* means a written request for assistance regardless of whether the request is in proper form or format. 


*Assistance* does not include any contract (e.g., a procurement contract) that is subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR ch. 1). 


*Disclose* means providing information directly or indirectly to a person through any means of communication. 


*Employee* includes persons employed on a full-time, part-time, or temporary basis, and special government employees as defined in 18 U.S.C. 202. The term applies whether or not the employee is denoted as an officer of the Department. “Employee” is to be construed broadly to include persons who are retained on a contractual or consultative basis under an Office of Human Resources appointment. However, “employee” does not include an independent contractor, e.g., a firm or individual working under the authority of a procurement contract. 


*Material or materially* means in some influential or substantial respect or having to do more with substance than with form. 


*Person* means an individual, corporation, company, association, authority, firm, partnership, society, State, local government, or any other organization or group of people. 


*Selection process* means the period with respect to a selection for assistance that begins when the HUD official responsible for awarding the assistance involved, or his or her designee, makes a written request (which includes the selection criteria to be used in providing the assistance) to the Office of General Counsel (OGC) to prepare the NOFA, solicitation, or request for applications for assistance for publication in the _Federal Register._ The period includes the evaluation of applications, and concludes with the announcement of the selection of recipients of assistance.
