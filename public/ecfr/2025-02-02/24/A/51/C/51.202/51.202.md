# ยง 51.202   Approval of HUD-assisted projects.

(a) The Department will not approve an application for assistance for a proposed project located at less than the acceptable separation distance from a hazard, as defined in ยง 51.201, unless appropriate mitigating measures, as defined in ยง 51.205, are implemented, or unless mitigating measures are already in place.


(b) In the case of all applications for proposed HUD-assisted projects, the Department shall evaluate projected development plans in the vicinity of these projects to determine whether there are plans to install a hazardous operation in close proximity to the proposed project. If the evaluation shows that such a plan exists, the Department shall not approve assistance for the project unless the Department obtains satisfactory assurances that adequate mitigating measures will be taken when the hazardous operation is installed.
