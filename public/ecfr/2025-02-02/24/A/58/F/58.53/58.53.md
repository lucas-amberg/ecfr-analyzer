# ยง 58.53   Use of prior environmental impact statements.

Where any final EIS has been listed in the _Federal Register_ for a project pursuant to this part, or where an areawide or similar broad scale final EIS has been issued and the EIS anticipated a subsequent project requiring an environmental clearance, then no new EIS is required for the subsequent project if all the following conditions are met: 


(a) The ERR contains a decision based on a finding pursuant to ยง 58.40 that the proposed project is not a new major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The decision shall include: 


(1) References to the prior EIS and its evaluation of the environmental factors affecting the proposed subsequent action subject to NEPA; 


(2) An evaluation of any environmental factors which may not have been previously assessed, or which may have significantly changed; 


(3) An analysis showing that the proposed project is consistent with the location, use, and density assumptions for the site and with the timing and capacity of the circulation, utility, and other supporting infrastructure assumptions in the prior EIS; 


(4) Documentation showing that where the previous EIS called for mitigating measures or other corrective action, these are completed to the extent reasonable given the current state of development. 


(b) The prior final EIS has been filed within five (5) years, and updated as follows: 


(1) The EIS has been updated to reflect any significant revisions made to the assumptions under which the original EIS was prepared; 


(2) The EIS has been updated to reflect new environmental issues and data or legislation and implementing regulations which may have significant environmental impact on the project area covered by the prior EIS. 


(c) There is no litigation pending in connection with the prior EIS, and no final judicial finding of inadequacy of the prior EIS has been made.
