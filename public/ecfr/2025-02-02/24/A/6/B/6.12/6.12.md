# ยง 6.12   Procedure for effecting compliance.

(a) Whenever the Assistant Secretary determines that a Recipient of Federal financial assistance has failed to comply with Section 109(a) or this part and voluntary compliance efforts have failed, the Secretary will notify the Governor of the State or the Chief Executive Officer of the unit of general local government of the findings of noncompliance and will request that the Governor or the Chief Executive Officer secure compliance. If within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 60 days, the Governor or the Chief Executive Officer fails or refuses to secure compliance, the Secretary will:


(1) Refer the matter to the Attorney General with a recommendation that an appropriate civil action be instituted;


(2) Exercise the powers and functions provided by Title VI;


(3) Terminate or reduce payments under Title I, or limit the availability of payments under Title I to programs or activities not affected by the failure to comply; or


(4) Take such other actions as may be provided by law, including, but not limited to, the initiation of proceedings under 2 CFR part 2424 or any applicable proceeding under State or local law. 


(b) *Termination, reduction, or limitation of the availability of Title I payments.* No order terminating, reducing, or limiting the availability of Title I payments under this part shall become effective until:


(1) The Secretary has notified the Governor of the State or the Chief Executive Officer of the unit of general local government of the Recipient's failure to comply in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and of the termination, reduction or limitation of the availability of Title I payments to be taken;


(2) The Secretary has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means;


(3) The Recipient has been extended an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with ยง 6.13(a); and


(4) A final agency notice or decision has been rendered in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section or 24 CFR part 180.


(c) If a Recipient does not respond to the notice of opportunity for a hearing or does not elect to proceed with a hearing within 20 days of the issuance of the Secretary's actions listed in paragraphs (b)(1), (2) and (3) of this section, then the Secretary's approval of the termination, reduction or limitation of the availability of Title I payments is considered a final agency notice and the Recipient may seek judicial review in accordance with section 111(c) of the Act.
