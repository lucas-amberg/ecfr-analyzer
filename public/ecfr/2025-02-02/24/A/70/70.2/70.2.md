# ยง 70.2   Applicability.

This part applies to all HUD programs for which there is a statutory exemption from Davis-Bacon or HUD-determined prevailing wage rates for volunteers or a statutory provision allowing HUD waiver of Davis-Bacon prevailing wage rates for volunteers. The programs to which this part applies include the programs listed in section 70.1(a) and (b) and any other program for which a statutory exemption or HUD waiver provision for volunteers is enacted. This part does not, however, apply to HUD waivers of prevailing wage requirements under section 20 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 for public housing residents who volunteer a portion of their labor (see 24 CFR 964.41). This part also does not apply to the contribution of labor by an eligible family under the Mutual Help Homeownership Opportunity Program for Indian families under section 202 of the United States Housing Act of 1937.
