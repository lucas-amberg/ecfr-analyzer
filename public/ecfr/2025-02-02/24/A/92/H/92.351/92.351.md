# ยง 92.351   Affirmative marketing; minority outreach program.

(a) *Affirmative marketing.* (1) Each participating jurisdiction must adopt and follow affirmative marketing procedures and requirements for rental and homebuyer projects containing five or more HOME-assisted housing units. Affirmative marketing requirements and procedures also apply to all HOME- funded programs, including, but not limited to, tenant-based rental assistance and downpayment assistance programs. Affirmative marketing steps consist of actions to provide information and otherwise attract eligible persons in the housing market area to the available housing without regard to race, color, national origin, sex, religion, familial status, or disability. If participating jurisdiction's written agreement with the project owner permits the rental housing project to limit tenant eligibility or to have a tenant preference in accordance with ยง 92.253(d)(3), the participating jurisdiction must have affirmative marketing procedures and requirements that apply in the context of the limited/preferred tenant eligibility for the project.


(2) The affirmative marketing requirements and procedures adopted must include: 


(i) Methods for informing the public, owners, and potential tenants about Federal fair housing laws and the participating jurisdiction's affirmative marketing policy (e.g., the use of the Equal Housing Opportunity logotype or slogan in press releases and solicitations for owners, and written communication to fair housing and other groups); 


(ii) Requirements and practices each subrecipient and owner must adhere to in order to carry out the participating jurisdiction's affirmative marketing procedures and requirements (e.g., use of commercial media, use of community contacts, use of the Equal Housing Opportunity logotype or slogan, and display of fair housing poster);


(iii) Procedures to be used by subrecipients and owners to inform and solicit applications from persons in the housing market area who are not likely to apply for the housing program or the housing without special outreach (e.g., through the use of community organizations, places of worship, employment centers, fair housing groups, or housing counseling agencies);


(iv) Records that will be kept describing actions taken by the participating jurisdiction and by subrecipients and owners to affirmatively market the program and units and records to assess the results of these actions; and


(v) A description of how the participating jurisdiction will annually assess the success of affirmative marketing actions and what corrective actions will be taken where affirmative marketing requirements are not met. 


(3) A State that distributes HOME funds to units of general local government must require each unit of general local government to adopt affirmative marketing procedures and requirements that meet the requirement in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. 


(b) *Minority outreach.* A participating jurisdiction must prescribe procedures acceptable to HUD to establish and oversee a minority outreach program within its jurisdiction to ensure the inclusion, to the maximum extent possible, of minorities and women, and entities owned by minorities and women, including, without limitation, real estate firms, construction firms, appraisal firms, management firms, financial institutions, investment banking firms, underwriters, accountants, and providers of legal services, in all contracts entered into by the participating jurisdiction with such persons or entities, public and private, in order to facilitate the activities of the participating jurisdiction to provide affordable housing authorized under this Act or any other Federal housing law applicable to such jurisdiction. Section 200.321 of title 2 Code of Federal Regulations describes actions to be taken by a participating jurisdiction to assure that minority business enterprises and women business enterprises are used when possible in the procurement of property and services.
