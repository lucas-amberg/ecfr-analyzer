# § 92.500   The HOME Investment Trust Fund.

(a) *General.* A HOME Investment Trust Fund consists of the accounts described in this section solely for investment in accordance with the provisions of this part. HUD will establish a HOME Investment Trust Fund United States Treasury account for each participating jurisdiction. Each participating jurisdiction may use either a separate local HOME Investment Trust Fund account or, a subsidiary account within its general fund (or other appropriate fund) as the local HOME Investment Trust Fund account. 


(b) *Treasury Account.* The United States Treasury account of the HOME Investment Trust Fund includes funds allocated to the participating jurisdiction under § 92.50 (including for a local participating jurisdiction, any transfer of the State's allocation pursuant to § 92.102(b)(2)) and funds reallocated to the participating jurisdiction, either by formula or by competition, under subpart J of this part; and 


(c) *Local account.* (1) The local account of the HOME Investment Trust Fund includes deposits of HOME funds disbursed from the Treasury account; the deposit of any State funds (other than HOME funds transferred pursuant to § 92.102(b)(2)) or local funds that enable the jurisdiction to meet the participating threshold amount in § 92.102, any program income (from both the allocated funds and matching contributions in accordance with the definition of program income), and any repayments or recaptured funds as required by § 92.503. The local account must be interest-bearing.


(2) The participating jurisdiction may establish a second local account of the HOME Investment Trust Funds if: 


(i) The participating jurisdiction has its own affordable housing trust fund that the participating jurisdiction will use for matching contributions to the HOME program; 


(ii) The statute or local ordinance requires repayments from its own trust fund to be made to the trust fund; 


(iii) The participating jurisdiction establishes a separate account within its own trust fund for repayments of the matching contributions; and 


(iv) The funds in the account are used solely for investment in eligible activities within the participating jurisdiction's boundaries in accordance with the provisions of this part, except as provided under § 92.201(a)(2). 


(3) The funds in the local account cannot be used for the matching contribution and do not need to be matched. 


(d)(1) *Reductions of Fiscal Year 2015 and subsequent fiscal year allocations.* HUD will reduce or recapture HOME funds in the HOME Investment Trust Fund, as follows:


(i) Any funds from a specific fiscal year allocation that are in the United States Treasury account that are not committed (including funds for community housing development organizations under § 92.300) within 24 months after the last day of the month in which HUD notifies the participating jurisdiction of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement for the specific fiscal year allocation;


(ii) Any funds from a specific fiscal year allocation that were committed to a State recipient or subrecipient that are not committed to a specific local project within 36 months after the last day of the month in which HUD notifies the participating jurisdiction of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement for the specific fiscal year allocation;


(iii) Any funds from a specific fiscal year allocation that are in the United States Treasury account that are not expended (drawn down) by September 30 of the fifth year after the end of the period of availability of the fiscal year allocation for obligation by HUD. Due to end-of-year financial system closeouts that begin before this date and prevent electronic access to the payment system, requests to draw down the funds must be made at least 7 full business days before this date to ensure that the funds still can be drawn from the United States Treasury account through the computerized disbursement and information system; and


(iv) Any penalties assessed by HUD under § 92.552.


(2)(i) *Reductions of Fiscal Year 2014 and prior fiscal year allocations.* HUD will reduce or recapture HOME funds in the HOME Investment Trust Fund by the amount of:


(A) Any funds from Fiscal Year 2014 and prior fiscal year allocations in the United States Treasury account that are required to be reserved (*i.e.,* 15 percent of the funds) by a participating jurisdiction, under § 92.300, and which are not committed to a community housing development organization project within 24 months after the last day of the month in which HUD notifies the participating jurisdiction of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement;


(B) Any funds from Fiscal Year 2014 and prior fiscal year allocations in the United States Treasury account that are not committed within 24 months after the last day of the month in which HUD notifies the participating jurisdiction of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement;


(C) Any funds from Fiscal Year 2014 and prior fiscal year allocations in the United States Treasury account that are not expended within 5 years after the last day of the month in which HUD notifies the participating jurisdiction of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement; and


(D) Any penalties assessed by HUD under § 92.552.


(ii) For purposes of determining the amount by which the HOME Investment Trust Fund will be reduced or recaptured under paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A), (B), and (C) of this section, HUD will consider the sum of commitments to CHDOs, commitments, or expenditures, as applicable, from all fiscal year allocations through the Fiscal Year 2014 allocation. This sum must be equal to or greater than the sum of all fiscal year allocations through the fiscal year allocation being examined (minus previous reductions to the HOME Investment Trust Fund), or in the case of commitments to CHDOs, 15 percent of those fiscal year allocations.


(iii) HUD will reduce or recapture HOME funds in the HOME Investment Trust Fund by the amount of all fiscal year allocations through the Fiscal Year 2014 allocation that are uncommitted by the commitment deadline for the Fiscal Year 2015 allocation.
