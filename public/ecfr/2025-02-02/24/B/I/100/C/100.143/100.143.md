# ยง 100.143   Appropriate corrective action.

(a) The report or results of a self-test are privileged as provided in this subpart if the lender has taken or is taking appropriate corrective action to address likely violations identified by the self-test. Appropriate corrective action is required when a self-test shows it is more likely than not that a violation occurred even though no violation was adjudicated formally.


(b) A lender must take action reasonably likely to remedy the cause and effect of the likely violation and must:


(1) Identify the policies or practices that are the likely cause of the violation, such as inadequate or improper lending policies, failure to implement established policies, employee conduct, or other causes; and


(2) Assess the extent and scope of any likely violation, by determining which areas of operation are likely to be affected by those policies and practices, such as stages of the loan application process, types of loans, or the particular branch where the likely violation has occurred. Generally, the scope of the self-test governs the scope of the appropriate corrective action.


(c) Appropriate corrective action may include both prospective and remedial relief, except that to establish a privilege under this subpart:


(1) A lender is not required to provide remedial relief to a tester in a self-test;


(2) A lender is only required to provide remedial relief to an applicant identified by the self-test as one whose rights were more likely than not violated;


(3) A lender is not required to provide remedial relief to a particular applicant if the statute of limitations applicable to the violation expired before the lender obtained the results of the self-test or the applicant is otherwise ineligible for such relief.


(d) Depending on the facts involved, appropriate corrective action may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following:


(1) If the self-test identifies individuals whose applications were inappropriately processed, offering to extend credit if the applications were improperly denied; compensating such persons for any damages, both out-of-pocket and compensatory;


(2) Correcting any institutional policies or procedures that may have contributed to the likely violation, and adopting new policies as appropriate;


(3) Identifying, and then training and/or disciplining the employees involved;


(4) Developing outreach programs, marketing strategies, or loan products to serve more effectively the segments of the lender's market that may have been affected by the likely violation; and


(5) Improving audit and oversight systems to avoid a recurrence of the likely violations.


(e) Determination of appropriate corrective action is fact-based. Not every corrective measure listed in paragraph (d) of this section need be taken for each likely violation.


(f) Taking appropriate corrective action is not an admission by a lender that a violation occurred.
