These regulations are to carry out the requirements of E.O. 11063 that all action necessary and appropriate be taken to prevent discrimination because of race, color, religion (creed), sex or national origin in the sale, rental, leasing or other disposition of residential property and related facilities or in the use or occupancy thereof where such property or facilities are owned or operated by the Federal Government, or provided with Federal assistance by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and in the lending practices with respect to residential property and related facilities of lending institutions insofar as such practices relate to loans insured, guaranteed or purchased by the Department. These regulations are intended to assure compliance with the established policy of the United States that the benefits under programs and activities of the Department which provide financial assistance, directly or indirectly, for the provision, rehabilitation, or operation of housing and related facilities are made available without discrimination based on race, color, religion (creed), sex or national origin. These regulations are also intended to assure compliance with the policy of this Department to administer its housing programs affirmatively, so as to achieve a condition in which individuals of similar income levels in the same housing market area have a like range of housing choices available to them regardless of their race, color, religion (creed), sex or national origin.
