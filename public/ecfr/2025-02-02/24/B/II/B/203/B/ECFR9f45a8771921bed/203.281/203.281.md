(a) The applicable premium percentage determined under paragraph (b) of this section assumes, for purposes of calculation, that the entire amount of the one-time MIP is added to the loan amount.

(b)(1) The Commissioner shall determine the applicable premium percentage in accordance with sound financial and actuarial practice. 


(2) Application of the premium percentage determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not result in a MIP in excess of an amount equivalent to 1 per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation of the mortgage outstanding at any time, without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments.


(c) The applicable premium percentage will be published by notice at least annually in the _Federal Register._
