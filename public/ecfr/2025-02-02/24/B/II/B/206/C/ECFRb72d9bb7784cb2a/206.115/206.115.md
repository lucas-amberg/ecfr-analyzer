(5) Where applicable, a certificate under oath and contract regarding use of the dwelling for transient or hotel purposes;


(6) Where an individual water or sewer system is being used, an approval letter from the local health authority indicating approval of the system in accordance with § 200.926d(f);


(7) A mortgage certification on a form prescribed by the Commissioner, stating that the authorized representative of the mortgagee who is making the certification has personally reviewed the mortgage documents and the application for insurance endorsement, and certifying that the mortgage complies with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.

(11) Such other documents as the Commissioner may require.


(c) *Pre-endorsement review for Direct Endorsement.* (1) Upon submission by an approved mortgagee of the documents required by paragraph (b) of this section, the Commissioner will review the documents and determine that:


(i) The mortgage is executed on a form which meets the requirements of the Commissioner;


(ii) The mortgage maturity meets the requirements of the applicable program;


(iii) The stated mortgage amount does not exceed 150 percent of the maximum claim amount;


(iv) All documents required by paragraph (b) of this section are submitted;


(v) All necessary certifications are made in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section;


(vi) There is no mortgage insurance premium, late charge or interest due to the Commissioner; and


(vii) The mortgage was not in default when submitted for insurance or, if submitted for insurance more than 60 days after closing, the mortgagee certifies that the borrower is current in paying all property charges or is otherwise in compliance with all the terms and conditions of the mortgage documents.


(2) The Commissioner is authorized to determine if there is any information indicating that any certification or required document is false, misleading, or constitutes fraud or misrepresentation on the part of any party, or that the mortgage fails to meet a statutory or regulatory requirement. If, following this review, the mortgage is determined to be eligible, the Commissioner will endorse the mortgage for insurance by issuance of a Mortgage Insurance Certificate. If the mortgage is determined to be ineligible, the Commissioner will inform the mortgagee in writing of this determination, and include the reasons for the determination and any corrective actions that may be taken.


(d) *Submission by mortgagee other than originating mortgagee.* If the originating mortgagee assigns the mortgage to another approved mortgagee before pre-endorsement review under paragraph (c) of this section, the assignee may submit the required documents for pre-endorsement review in the name of the originating mortgagee. All certifications must be executed by the originating mortgagee (or its underwriter, if appropriate). The purchasing mortgagee may pay any required mortgage insurance premium, late charge and interest.


(e) *Post-Endorsement review for Direct Endorsement.* Following endorsement for insurance, the Commissioner may review all documents required by paragraph (b) of this section. If, following this review, the Commissioner determines that the mortgage does not satisfy the requirements of the Direct Endorsement program, the Commissioner may place the mortgagee on Direct Endorsement probation, or terminate the authority of the mortgagee to participate in the Direct Endorsement program pursuant to § 206.15, or refer the matter to the Mortgagee Review Board for action pursuant to part 25 of this title.


(f) *Creation of the contract.* The mortgage shall be an insured mortgage from the date of the issuance of a Mortgage Insurance Certificate, from the date of the endorsement of the credit instrument, or from the date of FHA's electronic acknowledgement to the mortgagee that the mortgage is insured, as applicable. The Commissioner and the mortgagee are thereafter bound by the regulations in this subpart with the same force and to the same extent as if a separate contract had been executed relating to the insured mortgage, including the provisions of the regulations in this subpart and of the National Housing Act.
