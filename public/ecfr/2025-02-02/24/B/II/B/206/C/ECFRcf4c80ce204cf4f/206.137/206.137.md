# ยง 206.137   Effect of noncompliance with regulations.

If, for any reason, the mortgagee fails to comply with the regulations in this subpart, the Commissioner may hold processing of the application for insurance benefits in abeyance for a reasonable time in order to permit the mortgagee to comply. In the alternative to holding processing in abeyance, the Commissioner may reconvey title to the property or reassign the mortgage to the mortgagee, in which event the application for insurance benefits shall be considered as cancelled and the mortgagee shall refund the insurance benefits to the Commissioner as well as other funds required by ยง 206.138. The mortgagee may reapply for insurance benefits at a subsequent date; provided, however, that the mortgagee may not be reimbursed for any expenses incurred in connection with the property after it has been reconveyed or the mortgage reassigned by the Commissioner, or paid any debenture interest accrued after the date of initial conveyance, whichever is earlier, and there will be deducted from the insurance benefits any reduction in the Commissioner's estimate of the value of the property occurring from the time of reconveyance or mortgage reassignment to the time of reapplication.
