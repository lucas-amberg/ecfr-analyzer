# § 245.420   Rights of tenants to participate.

(a) The tenants (including any legal or other representatives acting for tenants individually or as a group) must have the right to inspect and copy the materials that the mortgagor is required to submit to HUD pursuant to § 245.415, for a period of 30 days from the date on which the notice required under § 245.410 is served on the tenants. During this period, the mortgagor must provide a place (as specified in the notice) reasonably convenient to tenants in the project where tenants and their representatives can inspect and copy these materials during normal business hours. 


(b) The tenants have the right during this period to submit written comments on the proposed conversion to the mortgagor and to the local HUD office. Tenant representatives may assist tenants in preparing these comments. 


(c) If the mortgagor, whether at HUD's request or otherwise, makes any material change during a tenant comment period in the materials submitted to HUD pursuant to § 245.415, the mortgagor must notify the tenants of the change, in the manner provided in § 245.15, and make the materials as changed available for inspection and copying at the address specified in the notice for this purpose. The tenants have a period of 15 days from the date of service of this additional notice (or the remainder of any applicable comment period, if longer) in which to inspect and copy the materials as changed and to submit comments on the proposed covered action, before the mortgagor may submit its request to HUD for approval of the covered action.
