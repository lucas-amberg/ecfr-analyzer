# § 246.5   Rental charges.

The Department will generally not interfere in the regulation of rents by a rent control board or agency constituted under State or local laws (hereinafter referred to as board) for unsubsidized projects with mortgages insured or held by HUD. However, HUD will preempt the regulation of rents, together with any board regulations which require the mortgagor to offer a lease for a term in excess of one year, under certain conditions. This preemption may occur for such a project when the Department determines that the delay or decision of a board prevents the mortgagor from achieving a level of residential income necessary to maintain and operate adequately the project, which includes sufficient funds to meet the financial obligations under the mortgage.”
