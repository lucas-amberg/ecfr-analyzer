# ยง 246.6   Initiation.

When a mortgagor determines that the permitted increase in rents as prescribed by the board will not provide a rent level necessary to maintain and operate adequately the project, and the mortgagor elects to request preemption under this subpart, it shall: 


(a) File an application for whatever relief or redetermination is permitted under the State or local law and; 


(b) Notify: (1) The tenants in accordance with ยง 246.7 of this subpart, (2) the appropriate HUD office pursuant to ยง 246.8, and (3) the board of the mortgagor's intention to file a request for preemption of local rent control regulation pursuant to the provisions of regulations in this subpart. This action may be taken if either the board's written decision is unacceptable to the mortgagor or no written decision is received from the board within 30 days of the mortgagor's request under paragraph (a) of this section.
