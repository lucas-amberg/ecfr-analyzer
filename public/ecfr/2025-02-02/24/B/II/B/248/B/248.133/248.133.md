# § 248.133   Second notice of intent.

(a) *Filing.* A second notice of intent must be filed by all owners who, after receiving the information provided by the Commissioner in § 248.131, elect to transfer the project under §§ 248.157 or 248.161.


(b) *Timeliness.* A second notice of intent must be submitted not later than 30 days after receipt of the information provided by the Commissioner under § 248.131. If an owner who is required to submit a second notice of intent fails to do so within this time period, the original notice of intent submitted under § 248.105 shall be void and ineffective for purposes of subpart B of this part. 


(c) *Filing with the State or local government and tenants.* The owner simultaneously shall file the second notice of intent with that officer of State and local government to whom the owner submitted a notice of intent under § 248.105(c) and with the mortgagee. In addition, the owner shall deliver a copy of the second notice of intent to each tenant representative known to the owner, and if none is known, then to each occupied unit in the project.
