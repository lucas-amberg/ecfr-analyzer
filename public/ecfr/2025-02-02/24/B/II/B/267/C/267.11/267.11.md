# § 267.11   Allocation of risk retention to an originator.

(a) *In general.* A sponsor choosing to retain an eligible vertical interest or an eligible horizontal residual interest (including an eligible horizontal cash reserve account), or combination thereof under § 267.4, with respect to a securitization transaction may offset the amount of its risk retention requirements under § 267.4 by the amount of the eligible interests, respectively, acquired by an originator of one or more of the securitized assets if:


(1) At the closing of the securitization transaction:


(i) The originator acquires the eligible interest from the sponsor and retains such interest in the same manner and proportion (as between horizontal and vertical interests) as the sponsor under § 267.4, as such interest was held prior to the acquisition by the originator;


(ii) The ratio of the percentage of eligible interests acquired and retained by the originator to the percentage of eligible interests otherwise required to be retained by the sponsor pursuant to § 267.4, does not exceed the ratio of:


(A) The unpaid principal balance of all the securitized assets originated by the originator; to


(B) The unpaid principal balance of all the securitized assets in the securitization transaction;


(iii) The originator acquires and retains at least 20 percent of the aggregate risk retention amount otherwise required to be retained by the sponsor pursuant to § 267.4; and


(iv) The originator purchases the eligible interests from the sponsor at a price that is equal, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, to the amount by which the sponsor's required risk retention is reduced in accordance with this section, by payment to the sponsor in the form of:


(A) Cash; or


(B) A reduction in the price received by the originator from the sponsor or depositor for the assets sold by the originator to the sponsor or depositor for inclusion in the pool of securitized assets.


(2) *Disclosures.* In addition to the disclosures required pursuant to § 267.4(c), the sponsor provides, or causes to be provided, to potential investors a reasonable period of time prior to the sale of the asset-backed securities as part of the securitization transaction and, upon request, to the Commission and its appropriate Federal banking agency, if any, in written form under the caption “Credit Risk Retention”, the name and form of organization of any originator that will acquire and retain (or has acquired and retained) an interest in the transaction pursuant to this section, including a description of the form and amount (expressed as a percentage and dollar amount (or corresponding amount in the foreign currency in which the ABS interests are issued, as applicable)) and nature (*e.g.,* senior or subordinated) of the interest, as well as the method of payment for such interest under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section.


(3) *Hedging, transferring and pledging.* The originator and each of its affiliates complies with the hedging and other restrictions in § 267.12 with respect to the interests retained by the originator pursuant to this section as if it were the retaining sponsor and was required to retain the interest under subpart B of this part.


(b) *Duty to comply.* (1) The retaining sponsor shall be responsible for compliance with this section.


(2) A retaining sponsor relying on this section:


(i) Shall maintain and adhere to policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to monitor the compliance by each originator that is allocated a portion of the sponsor's risk retention obligations with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (3) of this section; and


(ii) In the event the sponsor determines that any such originator no longer complies with any of the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (3) of this section, shall promptly notify, or cause to be notified, the holders of the ABS interests issued in the securitization transaction of such noncompliance by such originator.
