# ยง 401.554   Contract renewal and administration.

HUD will offer to renew section 8 contracts as provided in each Restructuring Plan, subject to the availability of appropriations and subject to the renewal authority available at the time of each contract expiration. The offer will be made by HUD directly or through a PAE that has contracted with HUD to be a contract administrator for such contracts. HUD will offer to any PAE that is qualified to be the section 8 contract administrator the opportunity to serve as the section 8 contract administrator for a project restructured under a Restructuring Plan developed by the PAE under the Mark-to-Market Program. Qualifications will be determined under both statutory requirements and requirements issued by the appropriate office within HUD, depending on the type of section 8 assistance that is provided.
