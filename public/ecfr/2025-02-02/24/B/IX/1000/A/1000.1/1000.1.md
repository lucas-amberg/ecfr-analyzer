# ยง 1000.1   What is the applicability and scope of these regulations?

Under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (25 U.S.C. 4101 *et seq.*) (NAHASDA) the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides grants, loan guarantees, and technical assistance to Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages for the development and operation of low-income housing in Indian areas. The policies and procedures described in this part apply to grants to eligible recipients under the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) program for Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages. This part also applies to loan guarantee assistance under title VI of NAHASDA. The regulations in this part supplement the statutory requirements set forth in NAHASDA. This part, as much as practicable, does not repeat statutory language.
