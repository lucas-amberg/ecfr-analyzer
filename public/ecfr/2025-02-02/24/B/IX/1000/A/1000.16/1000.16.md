(a) *Davis-Bacon wage rates.* (1) As described in section 104(b) of NAHASDA, contracts and agreements for assistance, sale, or lease under NAHASDA must require prevailing wage rates determined by the Secretary of Labor under the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 3141-44, 3146, and 3147) to be paid to laborers and mechanics employed in the development of affordable housing.


(2) When NAHASDA assistance is only used to assist homebuyers to acquire single family housing, the Davis-Bacon wage rates apply to the construction of the housing if there is a written agreement with the owner or developer of the housing that NAHASDA assistance will be used to assist homebuyers to buy the housing.


(3) Prime contracts not in excess of $2000 are exempt from Davis-Bacon wage rates.


(b) *HUD-determined wage rates.* Section 104(b) also mandates that contracts and agreements for assistance, sale or lease under NAHASDA require that prevailing wages determined or adopted (subsequent to a determination under applicable state, tribal or local law) by HUD shall be paid to maintenance laborers and mechanics employed in the operation, and to architects, technical engineers, draftsmen and technicians employed in the development, of affordable housing.


(c) *Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act.* Contracts in excess of $100,000 to which Davis-Bacon or HUD-determined wage rates apply are subject by law to the overtime provisions of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 3701).


(d) *Volunteers.* The requirements in 24 CFR part 70 concerning exemptions for the use of volunteers on projects subject to Davis-Bacon and HUD-determined wage rates are applicable.


(e) Paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section shall not apply to any contract or agreement for assistance, sale, or lease pursuant to NAHASDA, or to any contract for construction, development, operations, or maintenance thereunder, if such contract or agreement for assistance, sale, or lease is otherwise covered by one or more laws or regulations adopted by an Indian tribe that requires the payment of not less than prevailing wages, as determined by the Indian tribe. Paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section shall also not apply to work performed directly by tribal or TDHE employees under a contract or agreement for assistance, sale, or lease, that is covered by one or more such laws or regulations adopted by an Indian tribe.
