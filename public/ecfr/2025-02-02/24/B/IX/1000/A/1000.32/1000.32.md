# ยง 1000.32   May exceptions be made to the conflict of interest provisions?

(a) Yes. HUD may make exceptions to the conflict of interest provisions set forth in ยง 1000.30(b) on a case-by-case basis when it determines that such an exception would further the primary objective of NAHASDA and the effective and efficient implementation of the recipient's program, activity, or project.


(b) A public disclosure of the conflict must be made and a determination that the exception would not violate tribal laws on conflict of interest (or any applicable state laws) must also be made.
