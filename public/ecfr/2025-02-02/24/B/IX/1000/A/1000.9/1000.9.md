(b) *Initiation of rulemaking.* HUD shall initiate a negotiated rulemaking not later than 90 days after the enactment of any act to reauthorize or significantly amend NAHASDA.


(c) *Work groups.* Negotiated rulemaking committees may form workgroups made up of committee members and other interested parties to meet during committee sessions and between sessions to develop specific rulemaking proposals for committee consideration.


(d) *Further review.* Negotiated rulemaking committees shall provide recommended rules to HUD. Once rules are proposed by HUD, they shall be published for comment in the _Federal Register._ Any comments will be further reviewed by the committee and HUD before HUD determines if the rule or rules will be adopted.
