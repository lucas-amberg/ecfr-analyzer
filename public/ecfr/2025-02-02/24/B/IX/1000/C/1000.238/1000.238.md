# ยง 1000.238   What percentage of the IHBG funds can be used for administrative and planning expenses?

Recipients receiving in excess of $500,000 may use up to 20 percent of their annual expenditures of grant funds or may use up to 20 percent of their annual grant amount, whichever is greater. Recipients receiving $500,000 or less may use up to 30 percent of their annual expenditures of grant funds or up to 30 percent of their annual grant amount, whichever is greater. When a recipient is receiving grant funds on behalf of one or more grant beneficiaries, the recipient may use up to 30 percent of the annual expenditure of grant funds or up to 30 percent of the annual grant amount, whichever is greater, of each grant beneficiary whose allocation is $500,000 or less, and up to 20 percent of the annual expenditure of grant funds or up to 20 percent of the annual grant amount, whichever is greater, of each grant beneficiary whose allocation is greater than $500,000. HUD approval is required if a higher percentage is requested by the recipient. Recipients combining grant funds with other funding may request HUD approval to use a higher percentage based on its total expenditure of funds from all sources for that year. When HUD approval is required, HUD must take into consideration any cost of preparing the IHP, challenges to and collection of data, the recipient's grant amount, approved cost allocation plans, and any other relevant information with special consideration given to the circumstances of recipients receiving minimal funding.
