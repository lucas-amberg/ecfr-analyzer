# ยง 1003.300   Application requirements.

(a) *Application information.* A Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) shall be published in the _Federal Register_ not less than 30 days before the deadline for application submission. The NOFA will provide information relating to the date and time for application submission, the form and content requirements of the application, specific information regarding the rating and ranking criteria to be used, and any other information pertinent to the application process. 


(b) *Costs incurred by applicant.* Costs incurred by an applicant prior to the submission of the single purpose grant application to HUD will not be recognized by HUD as eligible ICDBG expenses. 


(c) HUD will not normally reimburse or recognize costs incurred before HUD approval of the application for funding. However, under unusual circumstances, the Area ONAP may consider and approve written requests to recognize and reimburse costs incurred after submission of the application where failure to do so would impose undue hardship on the applicant. Such written authorization will be made only before the costs are incurred and where the requirements for reimbursement have been met in accordance with 24 CFR 58.22 and with the understanding that HUD has no obligation whatsoever to approve the application or to reimburse the applicant should the application be disapproved.
