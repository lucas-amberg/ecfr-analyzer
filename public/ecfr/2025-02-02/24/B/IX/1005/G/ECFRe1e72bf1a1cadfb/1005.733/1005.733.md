(1) Acknowledge receipt of the application;


(2) Determine if the application is complete or incomplete;


(3) If incomplete, notify the Borrower which documentation is required and missing, and that submission of the missing documents is required no later than fourteen days from the date of the response to provide missing documents to the Servicer. If the Borrower does not timely submit the requested documents, the Servicer must initiate live contact with the Borrower.

(c) *Notification of Servicer determination.* The Servicer shall provide written notification:


(1) Informing the Borrower of all available loss mitigation options;


(2) Encouraging the Borrower to review all available loss mitigation options and to contact the Servicer with any questions;


(3) Encouraging Borrowers, when feasible, to consider pursuing simultaneous loss mitigation options, to the extent it is offered by the Servicer;


(4) Informing the Borrower that if no loss mitigation option is elected or if all elected loss mitigation options fail, the Servicer may proceed with Tribal notice under ยง 1005.757(a) or First Legal Action at 180 days of default in accordance with ยง 1005.757 or ยง 1005.761; and

HUD may permit other loss mitigation on a case-by-case basis if requested by the Servicer.
