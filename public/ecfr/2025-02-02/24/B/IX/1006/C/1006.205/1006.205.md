(b) *Multi-unit projects.* NHHBG funds may be used to assist one or more housing units in a multi-unit project. Only the actual NHHBG eligible development costs of the assisted units may be charged to the NHHBG Program. If the assisted and unassisted units are not comparable, the actual costs may be determined based upon a method of cost allocation. If the assisted and unassisted units are comparable in terms of size, features, and number of bedrooms, the actual cost of the NHHBG-assisted units can be determined by pro-rating the total NHHBG eligible development costs of the project so that the proportion of the total development costs charged to the NHHBG Program does not exceed the proportion of the NHHBG-assisted units in the project.
