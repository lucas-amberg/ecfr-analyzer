# ยง 902.103   Public housing assessment of small rural PHAs.

(a) *Small rural public housing assessment.* The public housing program of small rural PHAs as defined in ยง 902.101 shall be assessed and scored based only on the physical condition of their public housing properties in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart G, except that properties that meet the definition specified in ยง 902.44(b) of physical condition and neighborhood environment shall receive one additional point for physical condition and neighborhood environment. Such agencies shall not be subject to PHAS except as noted below.


(b) *Triennial assessment.* Public housing programs operated by small rural PHAs will be assessed no more than once every three years, except that a small rural PHA shall be subject to annual inspection if it is designated by the Secretary as troubled as defined in ยง 902.105.


(c) *Initial public housing assessment.* (1) For PHAs subject to small PHA deregulation, the first assessment and inspections will be determined based on the PHA's next scheduled PHAS assessment (e.g., a higher performing PHA would receive the first inspection 3 years after the most recent PHAS assessment).


(2) For PHAs not subject to small PHA deregulation, the first inspection is based on the PHA's overall weighted project physical condition indicator score (e.g., a PHA with a physical condition indicator score of 90 or greater would receive the first inspection three years after most recent PHAS assessment).
