# § 904.108   Break-even amount.

(a) *Definition.* The term “break-even amount” as used herein means the minimum average monthly amount required to provide funds for the items listed in the illustration below. A separate break-even amount shall be established for each size and type of dwelling unit, as well as for the Project as a whole. The break-even amount for EHPA and NRMR will vary by size and type of dwelling unit; similar variations as to other line items may be made if the LHA deems this equitable. 


(b) *Excess over break-even.* When the homebuyer's required monthly payment (see § 904.107(j)) exceeds the applicable break-even amount, the excess shall constitute additional Project income and shall be deposited and used in the same manner as other Project income. 


(c) *Deficit in monthly payment.* When the homebuyer's required monthly payment is less than the applicable break-even amount, the deficit shall be applied as a reduction of that portion of the monthly payment designated for operating expense (i. e., as a reduction of Project income). In all such cases, the EHPA and the NRMR shall be credited with the amount included in the break-even amount for these accounts.
