# ยง 906.17   PHA handling of homeownership applications.

Families who are interested in purchasing a unit must submit applications to the PHA or PRE for that specific purpose, and those applications must be handled separately from applications for other PHA programs. Application for homeownership must not affect an applicant's place on any other PHA waiting list for rental units.
