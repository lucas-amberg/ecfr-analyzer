# ยง 972.133   Public and resident consultation process for developing a conversion plan.

(a) The PHA must consult with appropriate public officials and with the appropriate public housing residents in developing the conversion plan.


(b) The PHA may satisfy the requirement for consultation with public officials by obtaining a certification from the appropriate government official that the conversion plan is consistent with the applicable Consolidated Plan. This may be the same certification as is required for the PHA Annual Plan that includes the conversion plan, so long as the certification specifically addresses the conversion plan.


(c) To satisfy the requirement for consultation with the appropriate public housing residents, in addition to the public participation requirements for the PHA Annual Plan, the PHA must:


(1) Hold at least one meeting with the residents of the affected sites (including the duly elected Resident Council, if any, that covers the development in question) at which the PHA must:


(i) Explain the requirements of this section, especially as they apply to the residents of the affected developments; and


(ii) Provide draft copies of the conversion plan to the residents;


(2) Provide a reasonable comment period for residents; and


(3) Summarize the resident comments for HUD, in the conversion plan, and consider these comments in developing the final conversion plan.
