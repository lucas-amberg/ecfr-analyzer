# ยง 982.618   Shared housing: Housing quality standards.

(a) *Compliance with HQS.* The PHA may not give approval to reside in shared housing unless the entire unit, including the portion of the unit available for use by the assisted family under its lease, meets HQS.




(b) *Applicable HQS standards.* As defined in ยง 982.4, HQS refers to the minimum quality standards developed by HUD in accordance with 24 CFR 5.703 for housing assisted under the HCV program, including any variations approved by HUD for the PHA under 24 CFR 5.705(a)(3). However, the HQS standards in this section apply in place of standards related to space and security in 24 CFR 5.703.


(c) *Facilities available for family.* The facilities available for the use of an assisted family in shared housing under the family's lease must include (whether in the family's private space or in the common space) a living room, sanitary facilities in accordance with the standards set in 24 CFR 5.703, and food preparation and refuse disposal facilities in accordance with 24 CFR 5.703.






(d) *Space and security: Performance requirements.* (1) The entire unit must provide adequate space and security for all its residents (whether assisted or unassisted).


(2)(i) Each unit must contain private space for each assisted family, plus common space for shared use by the residents of the unit. Common space must be appropriate for shared use by the residents.


(ii) The private space for each assisted family must contain at least one bedroom for each two persons in the family. The number of bedrooms in the private space of an assisted family may not be less than the family unit size.


(iii) A zero or one bedroom unit may not be used for shared housing.
