# § 983.58   PHA determination prior to selection.

(a) *Analysis of units and budget.* A PHA must calculate the number of authorized voucher units that it is permitted to project-base in accordance with § 983.6 and determine the amount of budget authority that it has available for project-basing in accordance with § 983.5(b), before it issues a request for proposals in accordance with § 983.51(b)(1), makes a selection based on a previous competition in accordance with § 983.51(b)(2), amends an existing HAP contract to add units in accordance with § 983.207(b), or noncompetitively selects a project in accordance with § 983.51(c).


(b) *Analysis of impact.* Prior to selecting a project for PBV assistance, a PHA must perform an analysis of the impact if project-basing 50 percent or more of the PHA's authorized voucher units. The analysis should consider the ability of the PHA to meet the needs of the community across its tenant-based and project-based voucher portfolio, including the impact on, among others: families on the waiting list and eligible PBV families that wish to move under § 983.261. The analysis performed by the PHA must be available as part of the public record.
