# § 983.153   Development requirements.

(a) *Environmental review requirements.* The development activity must comply with any applicable environmental review requirements at § 983.56.


(b) *Subsidy layering review.* (1) The PHA may provide PBV assistance only in accordance with the HUD subsidy layering regulations (24 CFR 4.13) and other requirements. A subsidy layering review is required when an owner undertakes development activity and housing assistance payment subsidy under the PBV program is combined with other governmental housing assistance from Federal, State, or local agencies, including assistance such as tax concessions or tax credits. The subsidy layering review is intended to prevent excessive public assistance for the housing by combining (layering) housing assistance payment subsidy under the PBV program with other governmental housing assistance from Federal, State, or local agencies, including assistance such as tax concessions or tax credits.


(2) When a subsidy layering review is required, it must occur before a PHA attaches assistance to a project. Specifically, the PHA may not execute an Agreement or HAP contract with an owner until HUD or a housing credit agency approved by HUD has conducted any required subsidy layering review and determined that the PBV assistance is in accordance with HUD subsidy layering requirements.


(3) A further subsidy layering review is not required if HUD's designee has conducted a review in accordance with HUD's PBV subsidy layering review guidelines and that review included a review of PBV assistance.


(4) The owner must disclose to the PHA any change to the information provided for purposes of the subsidy layering review, including the amount of assistance or number of units to be developed, that occurs after the subsidy layering review has been conducted and before all contract units are placed under the HAP contract, in accordance with HUD requirements. A subsidy layering review may be required to determine if such a change would result in excess public assistance to the project, as required by HUD through notification in the _Federal Register_.


(5) The HAP contract must contain the owner's certification that the project has not received and will not receive (before or during the term of the HAP contract) any public assistance for acquisition, development, or operation of the housing other than assistance disclosed in the subsidy layering review in accordance with HUD requirements, unless the owner discloses additional assistance in accordance with HUD requirements. A subsidy layering review is required for newly constructed or rehabilitated housing under a HAP contract that receives additional assistance, as described in § 983.11(d).


(6) Existing housing is exempt from subsidy layering requirements.


(c) *Labor standards.* (1) Labor standards as described in paragraphs (c)(2) of this section apply to development activity. When the PHA exercises its discretion at §§ 983.154(f) or 983.157(a) to allow the owner to conduct some or all development activity while the proposed PBV units are not under an Agreement or HAP contract, the applicable parties must comply with the labor standards in paragraph (c)(2) of this section from the date of proposal submission (for housing subject to competitive selection) or from the date of the PHA's board resolution approving the project-basing of assistance at the project (for housing excepted from competitive selection).


(2) In the case of development involving nine or more contract units (whether or not completed in stages):


(i) The owner and the owner's contractors and subcontractors must pay Davis-Bacon wages to laborers and mechanics employed in development of the housing; and


(ii) The owner and the owner's contractors and subcontractors must comply with the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, Department of Labor regulations in 29 CFR part 5, and other applicable Federal labor relations laws and regulations. The PHA must monitor compliance with labor standards.


(3) For any project to which labor standards apply, the PHA's written notice to the party that submitted the selected proposal or board resolution approving project-basing of assistance at the specific project, as applicable per § 983.51(f), must state that any construction contracts must incorporate a Davis-Bacon contract clause and the current applicable prevailing wage determination.


(d) *Equal employment opportunity.* Development activity is subject to the Federal equal employment opportunity requirements of Executive Orders 11246 as amended (3 CFR, 1964-1965 Comp., p. 339), 11625 (3 CFR, 1971-1975 Comp., p. 616), 12432 (3 CFR, 1983 Comp., p. 198), and 12138 (3 CFR, 1977 Comp., p. 393).


(e) *Accessibility.* As applicable, the design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act and implementing regulations at 24 CFR 100.205; the accessibility requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8, including 8.22 and 8.23; and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12131-12134) and implementing regulations at 28 CFR part 35, including §§ 35.150 and 35.151, apply to development activity. A description of any required work item resulting from these requirements must be included in the Agreement (if applicable), as specified in § 983.154(e)(6) or HAP contract (if applicable), as specified in § 983.157(e)(1).


(f) *Broadband infrastructure.* (1) Any development activity that constitutes substantial rehabilitation as defined by 24 CFR 5.100 of a building with more than four rental units and where the proposal or project selection date or the start of the development activity while under a HAP contract is after January 19, 2017, must include installation of broadband infrastructure, as this term is defined in 24 CFR 5.100, except where the owner determines and documents the determination that:


(i) The location of the new construction or substantial rehabilitation makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible;


(ii) The cost of installing broadband infrastructure would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of its program or activity or in an undue financial burden; or


(iii) The structure of the housing to be substantially rehabilitated makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible.


(2) A description of any required work item resulting from this requirement must be included in the Agreement (if applicable), as specified in § 983.154(e)(7) or HAP contract (if applicable), as specified in § 983.157(e)(2).


(g) *Eligibility to participate in Federal programs and activities.* (1) An owner or project principal who is on the U.S. General Services Administration list of parties excluded from Federal procurement and non-procurement programs, or who is debarred, suspended subject to a limited denial of participation, or otherwise excluded under 2 CFR part 2424, may not participate in development activity or the rehabilitation of units subject to a HAP contract. Both the Agreement (if applicable) and the HAP contract must include a certification by the owner that the owner and other project principals (including the officers and principal members, shareholders, investors, and other parties having a substantial interest in the project) are not on such list and are not debarred, suspended subject to a limited denial of participation, or otherwise excluded under 2 CFR part 2424.


(2) An owner must disclose any possible conflict of interest that would be a violation of the Agreement (if applicable), the HAP contract, or HUD regulations, in accordance with § 982.161 of this title.
