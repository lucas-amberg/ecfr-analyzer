(a) *Filling vacant units.* (1) The PHA and the owner must make reasonable good-faith efforts to minimize the likelihood and length of any vacancy in a contract unit. However, contract units in a rehabilitated housing project undergoing development activity after HAP contract execution that are not available for occupancy in accordance with ยง 983.157(e)(5) are not subject to this requirement.


(i) If an owner-maintained waiting list is used, in accordance with ยง 983.251, the owner must promptly notify the PHA of any vacancy or expected vacancy in a contract unit and refer the family to the PHA for final eligibility determination. The PHA must make every reasonable effort to make such final eligibility determination within 30 calendar days.


(ii) If a PHA-maintained waiting list is used, in accordance with ยง 983.251, the owner must promptly notify the PHA of any vacancy or expected vacancy in a contract unit, and the PHA must, after receiving the owner notice, make every reasonable effort to promptly refer a sufficient number of families for the owner to fill such vacancies within 30 calendar days.


(2) The owner must lease vacant contract units only to families determined eligible by the PHA.


(b) *Reducing number of contract units.* If any contract units have been vacant for a period of 120 days or more since owner notice of vacancy, as required in paragraph (a) of this section, and notwithstanding the reasonable good-faith efforts of the PHA and the owner to fill such vacancies, the PHA may give notice to the owner amending the HAP contract to reduce the number of contract units by subtracting the number of contract units (by number of bedrooms) that have been vacant for such period.
