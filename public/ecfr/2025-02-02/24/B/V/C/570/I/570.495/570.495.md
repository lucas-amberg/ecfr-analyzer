# ยง 570.495   Reviews and audits response.

(a) If HUD's review and audit under ยง 570.493 results in a negative determination, or if HUD otherwise determines that a state or unit of general local government has failed to comply with any requirement of this subpart, the state will be given an opportunity to contest the finding and will be requested to submit a plan for corrective action. If the state is unsuccessful in contesting the validity of the finding to the satisfaction of HUD, or if the state's plan for corrective action is not satisfactory to HUD, HUD may take one or more of the following actions to prevent a continuation of the deficiency; mitigate, to the extent possible, the adverse effects or consequence of the deficiency; or prevent a recurrence of the deficiency:


(1) Issue a letter of warning that advises the State of the deficiency and puts the state on notice that additional action will be taken if the deficiency is not corrected or is repeated;


(2) Advise the state that additional information or assurances will be required before acceptance of one or more of the certifications required for the succeeding year grant;


(3) Advise the state to suspend or terminate disbursement of funds for a deficient activity or grant;


(4) Advise the state to reimburse its grant in any amounts improperly expended;


(5) Change the method of payment to the state from an advance basis to a reimbursement basis;


(6) Based on the state's current failure to comply with a requirement of this subpart which will affect the use of the succeeding year grant, condition the use of the succeeding fiscal years grant funds upon appropriate corrective action by the state. When the use of funds is conditioned, HUD shall specify the reasons for the conditions and the actions necessary to satisfy the conditions.


(b)(1) Whenever HUD determines that a state or unit of general local government which is a recipient of CDBG funds has failed to comply with section 109 of the Act (nondiscrimination requirements), HUD shall notify the governor of the State or chief executive officer of the unit of general local government of the noncompliance and shall request the governor or the chief executive officer to secure compliance. If within a reasonable time, not to exceed sixty days, the governor or chief executive officer fails or refuses to secure compliance, HUD may take the following action:


(i) Refer the matter to the Attorney General with a recommendation that an appropriate civil action be instituted;


(ii) Exercise the powers and functions provided by title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-2000d-7);


(iii) Exercise the powers and functions provided for in ยง 570.496; or


(iv) Take such other action as may be provided by law.


(2) When a matter is referred to the Attorney General pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, or whenever HUD has reason to believe that a State or unit of general local government is engaged in a pattern or practice in violation of the provisions of section 109 of the Act, the Attorney General may bring a civil action in any appropriate United States district court for such relief as may be appropriate, including injunctive relief.
