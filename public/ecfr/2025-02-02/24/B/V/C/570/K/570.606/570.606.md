# § 570.606   Displacement, relocation, acquisition, and replacement of housing.

(a) *General policy for minimizing displacement.* Consistent with the other goals and objectives of this part, grantees (or States or state recipients, as applicable) shall assure that they have taken all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of persons (families, individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms) as a result of activities assisted under this part. 


(b) *Relocation assistance for displaced persons at URA levels.* (1) A displaced person shall be provided with relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the requirements of 49 CFR part 24, which contains the government-wide regulations implementing the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655). 


(2) *Displaced person.* (i) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the term “*displaced person*” means any person (family, individual, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves his or her personal property from real property, permanently and involuntarily, as a direct result of rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition for an activity assisted under this part. A permanent, involuntary move for an assisted activity includes a permanent move from real property that is made: 


(A) After notice by the grantee (or the state recipient, if applicable) to move permanently from the property, if the move occurs after the initial official submission to HUD (or the State, as applicable) for grant, loan, or loan guarantee funds under this part that are later provided or granted. 


(B) After notice by the property owner to move permanently from the property, if the move occurs after the date of the submission of a request for financial assistance by the property owner (or person in control of the site) that is later approved for the requested activity. 


(C) Before the date described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, if either HUD or the grantee (or State, as applicable) determines that the displacement directly resulted from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the requested activity. 


(D) After the “initiation of negotiations” if the person is the tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit and any one of the following three situations occurs: 


(*1*) The tenant has not been provided with a reasonable opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex upon the completion of the project, including a monthly rent that does not exceed the greater of the tenant's monthly rent and estimated average utility costs before the initiation of negotiations or 30 percent of the household's average monthly gross income; or 


(*2*) The tenant is required to relocate temporarily for the activity but the tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporary location and any increased housing costs, or other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; and the tenant does not return to the building/complex; or 


(*3*) The tenant is required to move to another unit in the building/complex, but is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move. 


(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the term “*displaced person*-” does not include: 


(A) A person who is evicted for cause based upon serious or repeated violations of material terms of the lease or occupancy agreement. To exclude a person on this basis, the grantee (or State or state recipient, as applicable) must determine that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance under this section; 


(B) A person who moves into the property after the date of the notice described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, but who received a written notice of the expected displacement before occupancy. 


(C) A person who is not displaced as described in 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2). 


(D) A person who the grantee (or State, as applicable) determines is not displaced as a direct result of the acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for an assisted activity. To exclude a person on this basis, HUD must concur in that determination. 


(iii) A grantee (or State or state recipient, as applicable) may, at any time, request HUD to determine whether a person is a displaced person under this section. 


(3) *Initiation of negotiations.* For purposes of determining the type of replacement housing assistance to be provided under paragraph (b) of this section, if the displacement is the direct result of privately undertaken rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition of real property, the term “*initiation of negotiations*” means the execution of the grant or loan agreement between the grantee (or State or state recipient, as applicable) and the person owning or controlling the real property. 


(c) *Residential antidisplacement and relocation assistance plan.* The grantee shall comply with the requirements of 24 CFR part 42, subpart B.


(d) *Optional relocation assistance.* Under section 105(a)(11) of the Act, the grantee may provide (or the State may permit the state recipient to provide, as applicable) relocation payments and other relocation assistance to persons displaced by activities that are not subject to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. The grantee may also provide (or the State may also permit the state recipient to provide, as applicable) relocation assistance to persons receiving assistance under paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section at levels in excess of those required by these paragraphs. Unless such assistance is provided under State or local law, the grantee (or state recipient, as applicable) shall provide such assistance only upon the basis of a written determination that the assistance is appropriate (see, e.g., 24 CFR 570.201(i), as applicable). The grantee (or state recipient, as applicable) must adopt a written policy available to the public that describes the relocation assistance that the grantee (or state recipient, as applicable) has elected to provide and that provides for equal relocation assistance within each class of displaced persons. 


(e) *Acquisition of real property.* The acquisition of real property for an assisted activity is subject to 49 CFR part 24, subpart B. 


(f) *Appeals.* If a person disagrees with the determination of the grantee (or the state recipient, as applicable) concerning the person's eligibility for, or the amount of, a relocation payment under this section, the person may file a written appeal of that determination with the grantee (or state recipient, as applicable). The appeal procedures to be followed are described in 49 CFR 24.10. In addition, a low- or moderate-income household that has been displaced from a dwelling may file a written request for review of the grantee's decision to the HUD Field Office. For purposes of the State CDBG program, a low- or moderate-income household may file a written request for review of the state recipient's decision with the State. 


(g) *Responsibility of grantee or State.* (1) The grantee (or State, if applicable) is responsible for ensuring compliance with the requirements of this section, notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the grantee to comply with the provisions of this section. For purposes of the State CDBG program, the State shall require state recipients to certify that they will comply with the requirements of this section. 


(2) The cost of assistance required under this section may be paid from local public funds, funds provided under this part, or funds available from other sources. 


(3) The grantee (or State and state recipient, as applicable) must maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this section.
