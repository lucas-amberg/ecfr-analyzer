# ยง 578.47   New construction.

(a) *Use.* Grant funds may be used to:


(1) Pay up to 100 percent of the cost of new construction, including the building of a new structure or building an addition to an existing structure that increases the floor area by 100 percent or more, and the cost of land associated with that construction, for use as housing.


(2) If grant funds are used for new construction, the applicant must demonstrate that the costs of new construction are substantially less than the costs of rehabilitation or that there is a lack of available appropriate units that could be rehabilitated at a cost less than new construction. For purposes of this cost comparison, costs of rehabilitation or new construction may include the cost of real property acquisition.


(b) *Ineligible costs.* Grant funds may not be used for new construction on leased property.


(c) *Broadband infrastructure.* Any new construction of a building with more than 4 rental units and funded by a grant awarded after January 19, 2017 must include installation of broadband infrastructure, as this term is defined in 24 CFR 5.100, except where the grantee determines and, in accordance with ยง 578.103, documents the determination that:


(1) The location of the new construction makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible; or


(2) The cost of installing broadband infrastructure would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of its program or activity or in an undue financial burden.
