# ยง 578.91   Termination of assistance to program participants.

(a) *Termination of assistance.* The recipient or subrecipient may terminate assistance to a program participant who violates program requirements or conditions of occupancy. Termination under this section does not bar the recipient or subrecipient from providing further assistance at a later date to the same individual or family.


(b) *Due process.* In terminating assistance to a program participant, the recipient or subrecipient must provide a formal process that recognizes the rights of individuals receiving assistance under the due process of law. This process, at a minimum, must consist of:


(1) Providing the program participant with a written copy of the program rules and the termination process before the participant begins to receive assistance;


(2) Written notice to the program participant containing a clear statement of the reasons for termination;


(3) A review of the decision, in which the program participant is given the opportunity to present written or oral objections before a person other than the person (or a subordinate of that person) who made or approved the termination decision; and


(4) Prompt written notice of the final decision to the program participant.


(c) *Hard-to-house populations.* Recipients and subrecipients that are providing permanent supportive housing for hard-to-house populations of homeless persons must exercise judgment and examine all extenuating circumstances in determining when violations are serious enough to warrant termination so that a program participant's assistance is terminated only in the most severe cases.
