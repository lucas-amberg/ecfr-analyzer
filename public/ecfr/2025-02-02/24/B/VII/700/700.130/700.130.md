(10) Educate grant recipient's program participants on such issues as benefits application procedures (e.g. SSI, food stamps, Medicaid), service availability, and program participant options and responsibilities; 


(11) Establish volunteer support programs with service organizations in the community; 


(12) Assist the grant recipient in building informal support networks with neighbors, friends and family; and

(e) The service coordinator shall tailor each participant's case plan to the individual's particular needs. The service coordinator shall work with community agencies, the grantee and third party service providers to ensure that the services are provided on a regular, ongoing, and satisfactory basis, in accordance with the case plan approved by the PAC and the participant. 


(f) Service coordinators shall not serve as members of the PAC.
