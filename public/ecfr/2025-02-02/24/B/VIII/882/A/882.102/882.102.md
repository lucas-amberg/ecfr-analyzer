# § 882.102   Definitions.

(a) *Terms found elsewhere.* The following terms are defined in part 5, subpart A of this title: *1937 Act, covered person, drug, drug-related criminal activity, federally assisted housing, guest, household, HUD, MSA, other person under the tenant's control, public housing agency (PHA), Section 8, and violent criminal activity.*

(b) In addition, the following definitions apply to this part:


*ACC reserve account* (or “project account”). The account established and maintained in accordance with § 882.403(b).


*Agreement to enter into Housing Assistance Payments Contract (“Agreement”).* A written agreement between the Owner and the PHA that, upon satisfactory completion of the rehabilitation in accordance with requirements specified in the Agreement, the PHA will enter into a Housing Assistance Payments Contract with the Owner.


*Annual Contributions Contract* (“ACC”). The written agreement between HUD and a PHA to provide annual contributions to the PHA to cover housing assistance payments and other expenses pursuant to the 1937 Act.


*Assisted lease* (or “lease”). A written agreement between an Owner and a Family for the leasing of a unit by the Owner to the Family with housing assistance payments under a Housing Assistance Payments Contract between the Owner and the PHA.


*Congregate housing.* Housing for elderly persons or persons with disabilities that meets the HQS for congregate housing.


*Contract.* See definition of Housing Assistance Payments Contract.


*Contract rent.* The total amount of rent specified in the Housing Assistance Payments Contract as payable to the Owner by the Family and by the PHA to the Owner on the Family's behalf.


*Covered housing provider.* For the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Programs, as provided in subparts A, D, and E of this part, “covered housing provider,” as such term is used in HUD's regulations in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), refers to the PHA or owner, as applicable given the responsibilities of the covered housing provider as set forth in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L. For example, the PHA is the covered housing provider responsible for providing the notice of occupancy rights under VAWA and certification form described at 24 CFR 5.2005(a), though the PHA may provide this notice and form to owners, and charge owners with distributing the notice and form to tenants. In addition, the owner is the covered housing provider that may choose to bifurcate a lease as described at 24 CFR 5.2009(a), while both the PHA and owner are both responsible for ensuring that an emergency transfer plan is in place in accordance with 24 CFR 5.2005(e), and the owner is responsible for implementing the emergency transfer plan when an emergency occurs.


*Decent, safe, and sanitary.* Housing is decent, safe, and sanitary if it meets the physical condition standards in 24 CFR part 5, subpart G.


*Gross rent.* The total monthly cost of housing an eligible Family, which is the sum of the Contract Rent and any utility allowance.


*Group home.* A dwelling unit that is licensed by a State as a group home for the exclusive residential use of two to twelve persons who are elderly or persons with disabilities (including any live-in aide).


*Housing Assistance Payment.* The payment made by the PHA to the Owner of a unit under lease by an eligible Family, as provided under the Contract. The payment is the difference between the Contract Rent and the tenant rent. An additional payment (the “utility reimbursement”) is made by the PHA when the utility allowance is greater than the total tenant payment.


*Housing Assistance Payments Contract* (“Contract”). A written contract between a PHA and an Owner for the purpose of providing housing assistance payments to the Owner on behalf of an eligible Family.


*Moderate rehabilitation.* Rehabilitation involving a minimum expenditure of $1000 for a unit, including its prorated share of work to be accomplished on common areas or systems, to:


(1) Upgrade to decent, safe and sanitary condition to comply with the Housing Quality Standards or other standards approved by HUD, from a condition below these standards (improvements being of a modest nature and other than routine maintenance); or


(2) Repair or replace major building systems or components in danger of failure.


*Owner.* Any person or entity, including a cooperative, having the legal right to lease or sublease existing housing.


*Single room occupancy housing* (SRO). A unit that contains no sanitary facilities or food preparation facilities, or contains either, but not both, types of facilities.


*Statement of Family responsibility.* An agreement in the form prescribed by HUD, between the PHA and a Family to be assisted under the Program, stating the obligations and responsibilities of the Family.
