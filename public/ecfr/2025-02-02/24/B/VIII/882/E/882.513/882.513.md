(i) The notice must state that assistance under this Program will be available only in specified units which have been rehabilitated under the Program.


(ii) The notice must be made in accordance with the PHA's HUD-approved application and with the HUD guidelines for fair housing requiring the use of the equal housing opportunity logotype, statement and slogan.
