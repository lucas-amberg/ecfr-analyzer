# § 882.808   Management.

(a) *Outreach to homeless individuals and appropriate organizations.* (1) The HA or the owner must undertake outreach efforts to homeless individuals so that they may be brought into the program. The outreach effort should include notification to emergency shelter providers and other organizations that could provide referrals of homeless individuals. If the owner conducts the outreach effort, the owner must notify the HA so that it may provide referrals of homeless individuals. 


(2) *Additional outreach concerns.* If the procedures that the HA or owner intends to use to publicize the availability of this program are unlikely to reach persons of any particular race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, or mental or physical disability who may qualify for admission to the program, the HA or owner must establish additional procedures that will ensure that such persons are made aware of the availability of the program. The HA or owner must also adopt and implement procedures to ensure that interested persons can obtain information concerning the existence and location of services and facilities that are accessible to persons with disabilities. 


(3) *First priority for homeless individuals.* Homeless individuals must have the first priority for occupancy of housing rehabilitated under this program. 


(b) *Individual participation*—(1) *Initial determination of individual eligibility.* Section 882.514(a) applies to this program. 


(2) *Owner selection of individuals.* The owner must rent all vacant units under contract to homeless individuals located through HA or owner outreach efforts and determined by the HA to be eligible. The owner is responsible for tenant selection and may refuse any individual, provided the owner does not unlawfully discriminate. If the owner rejects an individual, and the individual believes that the owner's rejection was the result of unlawful discrimination, the individual may request the assistance of the HA in resolving the issue and may also file a complaint with HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity in accordance with 24 CFR 103.25. If the individual requests the assistance of the HA, and if the HA cannot resolve the complaint promptly, the HA should advise the individual that he or she may file a complaint with HUD, and provide the individual with the address of the nearest HUD Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. 


(3) *Briefing of individuals.* Section 882.514(d) applies to this program, except that § 882.514(d)(1)(vi) does not apply. 


(4) *Continued participation of individual when contract is terminated.* Section 882.514(e) applies to this program.


(5) *Individuals determined by the HA to be ineligible.* Section 882.514(f) applies to this program. In addition, individuals are not precluded from exercising other rights if they believe they have been discriminated against on the basis of age. 


(c) *Lease.* Sections 882.403(d) and 882.511(a) apply to this program. In addition, the lease must limit occupancy to one eligible individual.


(d) *Security and utility deposits.* Section 882.414 applies to this program. 


(e) *Rent adjustments.* Section 882.410 applies to this program. 


(f) *Payments for vacancies.* Section 882.411 applies to this program. 


(g) *Subcontracting of owner services.* Section 882.412 applies to this program. 


(h) *Responsibility of the individual.* Section 882.413 applies to this program. 


(i) *Reexamination of individual income*—(1) *Regular reexaminations.* The HA must reexamine the income of all individuals at least once every 12 months. After consultation with the individual and upon verification of the information, the HA must make appropriate adjustments in the Total Tenant Payment in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart F, and verify that only one individual is occupying the unit. The HA must adjust Tenant Rent and the Housing Assistance Payment to reflect any change in Total Tenant Payment. At each regular reexamination, the HA must follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 5, subpart E concerning verification of immigration status of any new family member. For an individual with net family assets (as the term is defined in § 5.603 of this title) equal to or less than $50,000, which amount will be adjusted annually by HUD in accordance with the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, a PHA may accept, for purposes of recertification of income, an individual's declaration under § 5.618(b) of this title, except that the PHA must obtain third-party verification of all family assets every 3 years.








(2) *Interim reexaminations.* The individual shall supply such certification, release, information, or documentation as the PHA or HUD determines to be necessary, including submissions required for interim reexaminations of individual income and determinations as to whether only one individual is occupying the unit. In addition § 882.515(b) shall apply.


(3) *Continuation of Housing Assistance Payments.* Section 882.515(d) applies to this program.




(4) *Individual reporting of change.* The PHA must adopt policies consistent with this section prescribing when and under what conditions the individual must report a change in family income or composition.


(5) *Accuracy of family income data.* The PHA must establish procedures that are appropriate and necessary to assure that income data provided by applicant or participant individuals is complete and accurate. The PHA will not be considered out of compliance with the requirements in this section solely due to de minimis errors in calculating family income but is still obligated to correct errors once the PHA becomes aware of the errors. A de minimis error is an error where the PHA determination of family income deviates from the correct income determination by no more than $30 per month in monthly adjusted income ($360 in annual adjusted income).


(A) The PHA must take any corrective action necessary to credit or repay an individual if the individual has been overcharged for their Tenant Rent or Total Tenant Payment as a result of an error (including a de minimis error) in the income determination. Individuals will not be required to repay the PHA in instances where the PHA has miscalculated income resulting in an individual being undercharged for Tenant Rent or Total Tenant Payment.


(B) HUD may revise the amount of de minimis error in this paragraph (i)(5) through a rulemaking published in the _Federal Register_ for public comment.

 


(j) *Overcrowded units.* If the HA determines that anyone other than, or in addition to, the eligible individual is occupying an SRO unit assisted under this program, the HA must take all necessary action, as soon as reasonably feasible, to ensure that the unit is occupied by only one eligible individual. 


(k) *Adjustment of utility allowance.* Section 882.510 applies to this program. 


(l) *Termination of tenancy.* Section 882.511 applies to this program. For provisions requiring termination of assistance when the HA determines that a family member is not a U.S. citizen or does not have eligible immigration status, see 24 CFR part 5, subpart E for provisions concerning certain assistance for mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of termination of assistance, or for provisions concerning deferral of termination of assistance. 


(m) *Reduction of number of units covered by contract.* Section 882.512 applies to this program. 


(n) *Maintenance, operation, and inspections.* Section 882.516 applies to this program. 


(o) *HUD review of contract compliance.* Section 882.517 applies to this program. 


(p) *Records and reports.* Each recipient of assistance under this subpart must keep any records and make any reports that HUD may require within the timeframe required. 


(q) *Participation of homeless individuals.* (1) Each approved applicant receiving assistance under this program, except HAs, must provide for the participation of not less than one homeless individual or formerly homeless individual on the board of directors or other equivalent policymaking entity of such applicant, to the extent that the entity considers and makes policies and decisions regarding the rehabilitation of any housing with assistance under this subpart. This requirement is waived if the applicant is unable to meet this requirement and presents a plan that HUD approves to consult with homeless or formerly homeless individuals in considering and making such policies and decisions. 


(2) To the maximum extent practicable, each approved applicant must involve homeless individuals and families, through employment, volunteer services, or otherwise, in rehabilitating and operating facilities assisted under this subpart, and in providing services for occupants of such facilities.
