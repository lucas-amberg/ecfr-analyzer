# § 884.110   Types of housing and property standards.

(a) Newly constructed single-family houses and multifamily structures may be utilized in this program. Congregate housing may be developed for elderly, disabled, or handicapped Families and individuals. Except in the case of housing predominantly for the elderly, high-rise elevator projects for Families with children may not be utilized unless HUD determines there is no practical alternative. 


(b) Participation in this program requires compliance with:


(1) [Reserved]


(2) In the case of congregate housing, the appropriate HUD guidelines and standards;


(3) HUD requirements pursuant to section 209 of the HCD Act for projects for the elderly, disabled, or handicapped;


(4) HUD requirements pertaining to noise abatement and control; and


(5) Applicable State and local laws, codes, ordinances, and regulations.


(c) Housing assisted under this part shall be modest in design. Amenities in projects assisted under this part (except partially assisted projects) will be limited to those amenities, as determined by HUD, which are generally provided in unassisted, decent, safe and sanitary housing for low-income families, in the market area. The use of more durable, high-quality materials to control or reduce maintenance, repair and replacement costs will not be considered an excess amenity.


(d) *Smoke detectors*—(1) *Performance requirement.* After October 30, 1992, each dwelling unit must include at least one battery-operated or hard-wired smoke detector, in proper working condition, on each level of the unit. If the unit is occupied by hearing-impaired persons, smoke detectors must have an alarm system, designed for hearing-impaired persons, in each bedroom occupied by a hearing-impaired person.


(2) *Acceptability criteria.* The smoke detector must be located, to the extent practicable, in a hallway adjacent to a bedroom, unless the unit is occupied by a hearing-impaired person, in which case each bedroom occupied by a hearing-impaired person must have an alarm system connected to the smoke detector installed in the hallway.
