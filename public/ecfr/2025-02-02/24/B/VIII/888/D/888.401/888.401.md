# ยง 888.401   Purpose and scope.

(a) *Purpose.* This subpart describes the basic policies and procedures for the retroactive payment of Housing Assistance Payments to eligible project owners for the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991 and a one-time Contract Rent determination for such eligible project owners.


(b) *Applicability.* This subpart applies to all Moderate Rehabilitation projects under 24 CFR part 882, subparts D, E, and H.


(c) *Eligible project owners.* Project owners may be eligible for retroactive payments if, during the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991:


(1) The use of a comparability study by the Public Housing Agency (PHA) as contract administrator, which was conducted as an independent limitation on the amount of rent adjustment that would have resulted from use of the applicable AAF, resulted in the reduction of the maximum monthly Contract Rents for units covered by a Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) contract or resulted in less than the maximum increase for those units than would otherwise be permitted by the AAF; or


(2) The project owner certifies that a request for an annual rent adjustment was not made because of an anticipated reduction of the maximum monthly Contract Rents resulting from a comparability study.
