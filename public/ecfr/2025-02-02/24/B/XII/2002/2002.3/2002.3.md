# ยง 2002.3   OIG's overall policy concerning disclosable records.

(a) The OIG will administer its FOIA program with a presumption of openness. This policy does not create any right enforceable in court. The OIG will fully and responsibly disclose its identifiable records and information consistent with competing public interests, such as national security, personal privacy, grand jury and investigative secrecy, complainant confidentiality, and agency deliberative process, as are recognized by FOIA and other Federal statutes. The OIG will apply the FOIA exemptions if release could foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption. Release of records will be made as promptly as possible.


(b) The OIG FOIA Public Liaison is the Deputy Counsel to the Inspector General. Requesters who have questions or comments concerning their FOIA request may contact the FOIA Public Liaison at 202-708-1613, or through the FOIA email at *FOIARequests@hudoig.gov.*
