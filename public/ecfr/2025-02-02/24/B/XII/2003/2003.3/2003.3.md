# ยง 2003.3   Requests for records.

(a) A request from an individual for an OIG record about that individual which is not contained in an OIG system of records will be considered to be a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and will be processed under 24 CFR part 2002. 


(b) A request from an individual for an OIG record about that individual which is contained in an OIG system of records will be processed under both the Privacy Act and the FOIA in order to ensure maximum access under both statutes. This practice will be undertaken regardless of how an individual characterizes the request. 


(1) The procedures for inquiries and requirements for access to records under the Privacy Act are more specifically set forth in 24 CFR part 16, except that appendix A to part 16 does not apply to the OIG. 


(2) An individual will not be required to state a reason or otherwise justify his or her request for access to a record.
