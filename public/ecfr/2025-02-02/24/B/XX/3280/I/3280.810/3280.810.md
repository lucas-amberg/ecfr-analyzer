# ยง 3280.810   Electrical testing.

(a) *Dielectric strength test.* The wiring of each manufactured home shall be subjected to a 1-minute, 900 to 1079 volt dielectric strength test (with all switches closed) between live parts and the manufactured home ground, and neutral and the manufactured home ground. Alternatively, the test may be performed at 1080 to 1250 volts for 1 second. This test shall be performed after branch circuits are complete and after fixtures or appliances are installed. Fixtures or appliances which are listed shall not be required to withstand the dielectric strength test.




(b) *Additional testing.* Each manufactured home must be subjected to the following tests:


(1) An electrical continuity test to assure that metallic parts are effectively bonded;


(2) An operational test of all devices and utilization equipment, except water heaters, electric ranges, electric furnaces, dishwashers, clothes washers/dryers, and portable appliances, to demonstrate they are connected and in working order; and


(3) Electrical polarity checks to determine that connections have been made in accordance with applicable provisions of these standards and Article 550.17 of NFPA 70-2005 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 3280.4). Visual verification is an acceptable electrical polarity check.
