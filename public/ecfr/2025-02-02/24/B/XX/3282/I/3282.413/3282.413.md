# § 3282.413   Implementation of Final Determination.

(a) *Issuance of orders.* (1) The SAA or the Secretary, as appropriate, must issue an order directing the manufacturer to furnish notification if:


(i) The SAA makes a Final Determination that a defect or noncompliance exists in a class of homes;


(ii) The Secretary makes a Final Determination that an imminent safety hazard, serious defect, defect, or noncompliance exists; or


(iii) The SAA makes a Final Determination that an imminent safety hazard or a serious defect exists in any home, and the SAA has received the Secretary's concurrence on the issuance of the Final Determination and order.


(2) The SAA or the Secretary, as appropriate, must issue an order directing the manufacturer to make corrections in any affected manufactured home if:


(i) The SAA or the Secretary makes a Final Determination that a defect or noncompliance exists in a manufactured home that has been sold or otherwise released by a manufacturer to a retailer or distributor but for which the sale to a purchaser has not been completed;


(ii) The Secretary makes a Final Determination that an imminent safety hazard or serious defect exists; or


(iii) The SAA makes a Final Determination that an imminent safety hazard or serious defect exists in any home, and the SAA has received the Secretary's concurrence on the issuance of the Final Determination and order.


(3) Only the Secretary may issue an order directing a manufacturer to repurchase or replace any manufactured home already sold to a purchaser, unless the Secretary authorizes an SAA to issue such an order.


(4) An SAA that has a concurrence or authorization from the Secretary on any order issued under this section must have the Secretary's concurrence on any subsequent changes to the order. An SAA that has issued a Preliminary Determination must have the Secretary's concurrence on any waiver of notification or any settlement when the concerns addressed in the Preliminary Determination involve a serious defect or an imminent safety hazard.


(5) If an SAA or the Secretary makes a Final Determination that the manufacturer failed to make, in good faith, an initial determination required under § 3282.404(a):


(i) The SAA may impose any penalties or take any action applicable under State law and may refer the matter to the Secretary for appropriate action; and


(ii) The Secretary may take any action permitted by law.


(b) *Decision to order replacement or repurchase.* The SAA or the Secretary will order correction of any manufactured home covered by an order issued in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, unless any requirements and factors applicable under § 3282.414 and § 3282.415 indicate that the SAA or the Secretary should order replacement or repurchase of the home.


(c) *Time for compliance with order.* (1) The SAA or the Secretary may require the manufacturer to submit a plan for providing any notification and any correction, replacement, or repurchase remedy that results from an order under this section. The manufacturer's plan must include the method and date by which notification and any corrective action will be provided.


(2) The manufacturer must provide any such notification and correction, replacement, or repurchase remedy as early as practicable, but not later than:


(i) Thirty days after issuance of the order, in the case of a Final Determination of imminent safety hazard or when the SAA or Secretary has ordered replacement or repurchase of a home pursuant to § 3282.414; or


(ii) Sixty days after issuance of the order, in the case of a Final Determination of serious defect, defect, or noncompliance.


(3) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the SAA that issued the order or the Secretary may grant an extension of the deadline for compliance with an order if:


(i) The manufacturer requests such an extension in writing and shows good cause for the extension; and


(ii) The SAA or the Secretary is satisfied that the extension is justified in the public interest.


(4) When the SAA grants an extension, it must notify the manufacturer and forward to the Secretary a draft of a notice of the extension for the Secretary to publish in the _Federal Register._ When the Secretary grants an extension, the Secretary must notify the manufacturer and publish notice of such extension in the _Federal Register._

(d) *Appeal of SAA determination.* Within 10 days of a manufacturer receiving notice that an SAA has made a Final Determination that an imminent safety hazard, a serious defect, a defect, or noncompliance exists or that the manufacturer failed to make the determinations required under § 3282.404, the manufacturer may appeal the Final Determination to the Secretary under § 3282.309.


(e) *Settlement offers.* A manufacturer may propose in writing, at any time, an offer of settlement and shall submit it for consideration by the Secretary or the SAA that issued the Notice of Preliminary Determination. The Secretary or the SAA has the option of providing the manufacturer making the offer with an opportunity to make an oral presentation in support of such offer. If the manufacturer is notified that an offer of settlement is rejected, the offer is deemed to have been withdrawn and will not constitute a part of the record in the proceeding. Final acceptance by the Secretary or an SAA of any offer of settlement automatically terminates any proceedings related to the matter involved in the settlement.


(f) *Waiver of notification.* (1) At any time after the Secretary or an SAA has issued a Notice of Preliminary Determination, the manufacturer may ask the Secretary or SAA to waive any formal notification requirements. When requesting a waiver, the manufacturer must certify that:


(i) The manufacturer has made a class determination in accordance with § 3282.404(b);


(ii) The manufacturer will correct, at the manufacturer's expense, all affected manufactured homes in the class within a time period specified by the Secretary or SAA, but not later than 60 days after the manufacturer is notified of the acceptance of the request for waiver or the issuance of any Final Determination, whichever is later; and


(iii) The proposed repairs are adequate to correct the noncompliance, defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard that gave rise to the issuance of the Notice of Preliminary Determination.


(2) If the Secretary or SAA grants a waiver, the manufacturer must reimburse any owner of an affected manufactured home who chose to make the correction before the manufacturer did so, for the reasonable cost of correction.


(g) *Recordkeeping.* The manufacturer must provide the report and maintain the records that are required by § 3282.417 for all notification and correction actions.
