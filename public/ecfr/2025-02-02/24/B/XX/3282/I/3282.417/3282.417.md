# § 3282.417   Recordkeeping requirements.

(a) *Manufacturer report on notifications and corrections.* Within 30 days after the deadline for completing any notifications, corrections, replacement, or repurchase required pursuant to this subpart, the manufacturer must provide a complete report of the action taken to, as appropriate, the Secretary or the SAA that approved the plan under § 3282.408, granted a waiver, or issued the order under § 3282.413. If any other SAA or the Secretary forwarded the relevant consumer complaint or other information to the manufacturer in accordance with § 3282.403, the manufacturer must send a copy of the report to that SAA or the Secretary, as applicable.


(b) *Records of manufacturer's determinations.* (1) A manufacturer must record each initial and class determination required under § 3282.404, in a manner approved by the Secretary or an SAA and that identifies who made each determination, what each determination was, and all bases for each determination. Such information must be available for review by the IPIA.


(2) The manufacturer records must include:


(i) The information it received that likely indicated a noncompliance, defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard;


(ii) All of the manufacturer's determinations and each basis for those determinations;


(iii) The methods used by the manufacturer to establish any class, including, when applicable, the cause of the defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard; and


(iv) Any IPIA concurrence or statement that it does not concur with the manufacturer's class determination, in accordance with § 3282.404(b).


(3) When the records that a manufacturer is required to keep in accordance with this paragraph (b) involve a class of manufactured homes that have the same noncompliance, defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard, the manufacturer has the option of meeting the requirements of this paragraph by establishing a class determination file, instead of including the same information in the file required by paragraph (e) of this section for each affected home. Such class determination file must contain the records of each class determination, notification, and correction, as applicable. For each class determination, the manufacturer must record once in each class determination file the information common to the class, and must identify by serial number all of the homes that the class comprises and that are subject to notification and correction, as applicable.


(c) *Manufacturer records of notifications.* When a manufacturer is required to provide notification under this subpart, the manufacturer must maintain a record of each type of notice sent and a complete list of the persons notified and their addresses. The manufacturer must maintain these records in a manner approved by the Secretary or an SAA to identify each notification campaign.


(d) *Manufacturer records of corrections.* When a manufacturer is required to provide or provides correction under this subpart, the manufacturer must maintain a record of one of the following, as appropriate, for each manufactured home involved:


(1) If the correction is made, a certification by the manufacturer that the repair was made to conform to the federal construction and safety standards in effect at the time the home was manufactured and that each identified imminent safety hazard or serious defect has been corrected; or


(2) If the owner refuses to allow the manufacturer to repair the home, a certification by the manufacturer that:


(i) The owner has been informed of the problem that may exist in the home;


(ii) The owner has been provided with a description of any hazards, malfunctions, deterioration, or other consequences that may reasonably be expected to result from the defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard; and


(iii) An attempt has been made to repair the problems, but the owner has refused the repair.


(e) *Maintenance of manufacturer's records.* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, for each manufactured home produced by a manufacturer, the manufacturer must maintain in a printed or electronic format all of the information required by paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, and must consolidate the information in a readily accessible file or in a readily accessible combination of a printed file and an electronic file. For each home, the manufacturer also must include in such file a copy of the homes data plate; all information related to manufacture, handling, and assembly of the home; any checklist or similar documentation used by the manufacturer in the transport of the home; the name and address of the retailer; the original or a copy of each purchaser's registration record received by the manufacturer; all correspondence with the retailer and homeowner that is related to the home; any information received by the manufacturer regarding setup of the home; all work orders for servicing the home; and the information that the manufacturer is required to keep pursuant to § 3282.211. The manufacturer must organize all such files in order of the serial numbers of the homes produced.


(2) The manufacturer must maintain each of these manufactured-home records at the plant where the home was produced. If that plant is no longer in existence, the manufacturer must keep the records at its nearest production plant in the same State, or, if such a plant does not exist, at the manufacturer's corporate headquarters.
