# § 3285.203   Site Drainage.

(a) *Purpose.* Drainage must be provided to direct surface water away from the home to protect against erosion of foundation supports and to prevent water build-up under the home, as shown in Figure to § 3285.203.


(b) The home site must be graded as shown in Figure to § 3285.203, or other methods, such as a drain tile and automatic sump pump system, must be provided to remove any water that may collect under the home.


(c) All drainage must be diverted away from the home and must slope a minimum of one-half inch per foot away from the foundation for the first ten feet. Where property lines, walls, slopes, or other physical conditions prohibit this slope, the site must be provided with drains or swales or otherwise graded to drain water away from the structure, as shown in Figure to § 3285.203.


(d) *Sloped site considerations.* The home, where sited, must be protected from surface runoff from the surrounding area.


(e) Refer to § 3285.902 regarding the use of drainage structures to drain surface runoff.


(f) *Gutters and downspouts.* Manufacturers must specify in their installation instructions whether the home is suitable for the installation of gutters and downspouts. If suitable, the installation instructions must indicate that when gutters and downspouts are installed, the runoff must be directed away from the home.
