# ยง 3288.105   Time when Alternative Process is available.

(a) The Alternative Process may be invoked after an alleged defect has been reported, pursuant to ยง 3288.15(b). However, the Alternative Process may not be invoked more than 7 days after notification of a request for dispute resolution has been received by all of the parties. The notification must be delivered by overnight delivery, commercial carrier, or fax by the screening neutral, in accordance with ยง 3288.30.

All required agreements are set forth in ยง 3288.110 of this part. The parties must also make reasonable efforts to include the following information in the notification:


(1) Identification of the case; and


(2) Identification of the parties participating in the Alternative Process.
