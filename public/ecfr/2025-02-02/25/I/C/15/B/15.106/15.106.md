# ยง 15.106   May a probate case be initiated when an owner of an interest has been absent?

(a) A probate case may be initiated when either:


(1) Information is provided to us that an owner of an interest in trust or restricted land or trust personalty has been absent without explanation for a period of at least 6 years; or


(2) We become aware of other facts or circumstances from which an inference may be drawn that the person has died.


(b) When we receive information as described in ยง 15.106(a), we may begin an investigation into the circumstances, and may attempt to locate the person. We may:


(1) Search available electronic databases;


(2) Inquire into other published information sources such as telephone directories and other available directories;


(3) Examine BIA land title and lease records;


(4) Examine the IIM account ledger for disbursements from the account; and


(5) Engage the services of an independent firm to conduct a search for the owner.


(c) When we have completed our investigation, if we are unable to locate the person, we may initiate a probate case and prepare a file that may include all the documentation developed in the search.


(d) We may file a claim in the probate case to recover the reasonable costs expended to contract with an independent firm to conduct the search.
