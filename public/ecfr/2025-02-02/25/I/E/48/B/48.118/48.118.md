(1) Cancel the lease;


(2) Invoke other remedies available under the lease or applicable law, including collection on any available performance bond or, for failure to pay compensation, referral of the debt to the Department of the Treasury for collection; or


(3) Grant the lessee additional time in which to cure the violation.


(b) The Bureau may take action to recover unpaid compensation and any associated late payment charges under ยง 48.113, and does not have to cancel the lease or give any further notice to the lessee before taking action to recover unpaid compensation.

(4) Order the lessee to vacate the property within 31 days of the date of receipt of the cancellation letter, if an appeal is not filed by that time; and


(5) Order the lessee to take any other action the Bureau deems necessary to protect the facility.
