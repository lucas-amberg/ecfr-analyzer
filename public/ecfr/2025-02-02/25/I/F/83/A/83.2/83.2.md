# ยง 83.2   What is the purpose of the regulations in this part?

The regulations in this part implement Federal statutes for the benefit of Indian tribes by establishing procedures and criteria for the Department to use to determine whether a petitioner is an Indian tribe eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians. A positive determination will result in Federal recognition status and the petitioner's addition to the Department's list of federally recognized Indian tribes. Federal recognition:


(a) Is a prerequisite to the protection, services, and benefits of the Federal Government available to those that qualify as Indian tribes and possess a government-to-government relationship with the United States;


(b) Means the tribe is entitled to the immunities and privileges available to other federally recognized Indian tribes;


(c) Means the tribe has the responsibilities, powers, limitations, and obligations of other federally recognized Indian tribes; and


(d) Subjects the Indian tribe to the same authority of Congress and the United States as other federally recognized Indian tribes.
