(3) The purposes for which the land will be used; and


(4) If the land to be acquired is in fee status, whether the Bureau of Indian Affairs is equipped to discharge the additional responsibilities resulting from the acquisition of the land in trust status.


(b) The Secretary shall give great weight to acquiring land that serves any of the following purposes, in accordance with ยง 151.3:


(1) Furthers Tribal interests by establishing a Tribal land base or protects Tribal homelands;


(2) Protects sacred sites or cultural resources and practices;


(3) Establishes or maintains conservation or environmental mitigation areas;


(4) Consolidates land ownership;


(5) Reduces checkerboarding;


(6) Acquires land lost through allotment;

(8) Facilitates Tribal self-determination, economic development, or Indian housing.


(c) Upon receipt of a written request to have land outside the boundaries of an Indian reservation acquired in trust status, the Secretary shall notify the State and local governments with regulatory jurisdiction over the land to be acquired. The notice will inform the State or local government that each will be given 30 calendar days in which to provide written comments on the acquisition's potential impact on regulatory jurisdiction, real property taxes, and special assessments. If the State or local government responds within 30 calendar days, a copy of the comments will be provided to the applicant, who will be given a reasonable time in which to reply, if they choose to do so in their discretion, or request that the Secretary issue a decision. In reviewing such comments, the Secretary will consider the location of the land and potential conflicts of land use. The Secretary presumes that the Tribe will benefit from the acquisition.
