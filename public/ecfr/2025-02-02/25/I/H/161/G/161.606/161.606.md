(2) BIA may invoke any other remedies available to BIA under the permit;


(3) The Navajo Nation may invoke any remedies available to them under the permit; or


(4) The permittee may be granted additional time in which to cure the violation.


(b) If BIA grants a permittee a time extension to cure a violation, the permittee must proceed diligently to complete the necessary corrective actions within a reasonable or specified time from the date on which the extension is granted.
