# ยง 162.009   Do I need BIA approval of a subleasehold mortgage?

Unless the lease provides otherwise, sublease, or by request of the parties, you do not need our approval of a subleasehold mortgage. If the lease or sublease requires, or parties request, our approval, we will use the procedures governing our review of leasehold mortgages.
