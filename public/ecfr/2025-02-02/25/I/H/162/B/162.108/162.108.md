# ยง 162.108   What are BIA's responsibilities in administering and enforcing agricultural leases?

(a) We will ensure that tenants meet their payment obligations to Indian landowners, through the collection of rent on behalf of the landowners and the prompt initiation of appropriate collection and enforcement actions. We will also assist landowners in the enforcement of payment obligations that run directly to them, and in the exercise of any negotiated remedies that apply in addition to specific remedies made available to us under these or other regulations. 


(b) We will ensure that tenants comply with the operating requirements in their agricultural leases, through appropriate inspections and enforcement actions as needed to protect the interests of the Indian landowners and respond to concerns expressed by them. We will take immediate action to recover possession from trespassers operating without an agricultural lease, and take other emergency action as needed to preserve the value of the land.
