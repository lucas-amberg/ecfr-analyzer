# ยง 162.109   What laws, other than these regulations, will apply to agricultural leases granted or approved under this part?

(a) Agricultural leases granted or approved under this part will be subject to federal laws of general applicability and any specific federal statutory requirements that are not incorporated in these regulations. 


(b) Tribal laws generally apply to land under the jurisdiction of the tribe enacting such laws, except to the extent that those tribal laws are inconsistent with these regulations or other applicable federal law. These regulations may be superseded or modified by tribal laws, however, so long as: 


(1) The tribal laws are consistent with the enacting tribe's governing documents; 


(2) The tribe has notified us of the superseding or modifying effect of the tribal laws; 


(3) The superseding or modifying of the regulation would not violate a federal statute or judicial decision, or conflict with our general trust responsibility under federal law; and 


(4) The superseding or modifying of the regulation applies only to tribal land. 


(c) State law may apply to agricultural lease disputes or define the remedies available to the Indian landowners in the event of an agricultural lease violation by the tenant, if the agricultural lease so provides and the Indian landowners have expressly agreed to the application of state law.
