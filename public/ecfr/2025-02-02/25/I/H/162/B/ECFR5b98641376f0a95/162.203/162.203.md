# § 162.203   When can the regulations in this subpart be superseded or modified by tribal laws and leasing policies?

(a) The regulations in this subpart may be superseded or modified by tribal laws, under the circumstances described in § 162.109(b) of this part. 


(b) When specifically authorized by an appropriate tribal resolution establishing a general policy for the leasing of tribal and individually-owned agricultural land, we will: 


(1) Waive the general prohibition against tenant preferences in leases advertised for bid under § 162.212 of this subpart, by allowing prospective Indian tenants to match the highest responsible bid (unless the tribal leasing policy specifies some other manner in which the preference must be afforded); 


(2) Waive the requirement that a tenant post a bond under § 162.234 of this subpart; 


(3) Modify the requirement that a tenant post a bond in a form described in § 162.235 of this subpart; 


(4) Approve leases of tribal land at rates established by the tribe, as provided in § 162.222(b) of this subpart. 


(c) When specifically authorized by an appropriate tribal resolution establishing a general policy for the leasing of “highly fractionated undivided heirship lands” (as defined in the tribal leasing policy), we may waive or modify the three-month notice requirement in § 162.209(b) of this subpart, so long as: 


(1) The tribal law or leasing policy adopts an alternative plan for providing notice to Indian landowners, before an agricultural lease is granted by us on their behalf; and 


(2) A waiver or modification of the three-month notice requirement is needed to prevent waste, reduce idle land acreage, and ensure lease income to the Indian landowners. 


(d) Tribal leasing policies of the type described in paragraphs (b) through (c) of this section will not apply to individually-owned land that has been made exempt from such laws or policies under § 162.205 of this subpart.
