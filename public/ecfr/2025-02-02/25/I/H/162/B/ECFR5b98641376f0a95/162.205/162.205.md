# ยง 162.205   Can individual Indian landowners exempt their agricultural land from certain tribal leasing policies?

(a) Individual Indian landowners may exempt their agricultural land from the application of a tribal leasing policy of a type described in ยง 162.203(b) through (c) of this subpart, if the Indian owners of at least 50% of the trust or restricted interests in the land submit a written objection to us before a lease is granted or approved. 


(b) Upon our receipt of a written objection from the Indian landowners that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, we will notify the tribe that the owners' land has been exempted from a specific tribal leasing policy.
