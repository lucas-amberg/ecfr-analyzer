(a) We may take appropriate enforcement action to ensure removal of the permanent improvements and restoration of the premises at the lessee's expense:


(1) In consultation with the tribe, for tribal land or, where feasible, with Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land; and


(2) Before or after expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease.


(b) We may collect and hold the performance bond or alternative form of security until removal and restoration are completed.
