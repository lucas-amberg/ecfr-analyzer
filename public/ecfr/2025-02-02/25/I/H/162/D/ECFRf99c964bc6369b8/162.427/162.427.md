# ยง 162.427   Will BIA notify a lessee when a payment is due under a business lease?

Upon request of the Indian landowners, we may issue invoices to a lessee in advance of the dates on which payments are due under a business lease. The lessee's obligation to make these payments in a timely manner will not be excused if invoices are not issued, delivered, or received.
