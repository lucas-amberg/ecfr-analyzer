# ยง 162.566   How will BIA decide whether to approve a WSR lease?

(a) We will approve a WSR lease unless:


(1) The required consents have not been obtained from the parties to the lease;


(2) The requirements of this subpart have not been met; or


(3) We find a compelling reason to withhold our approval in order to protect the best interests of the Indian landowners.


(b) We will defer, to the maximum extent possible, to the Indian landowners' determination that the WSR lease is in their best interest.


(c) We may not unreasonably withhold approval of a WSR lease.
