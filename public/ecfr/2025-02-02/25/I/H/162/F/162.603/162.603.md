# ยง 162.603   San Xavier and Salt River Pima-Maricopa Reservations.

(a) *Purpose and scope.* The Act of November 2, 1966 (80 Stat. 1112), provides statutory authority for long-term leasing on the San Xavier and Salt River Pima-Maricopa Reservations, Arizona, in addition to that contained in the Act of August 9, 1955 (69 Stat. 539), as amended (25 U.S.C. 415). When leases are made under the 1955 Act on the San Xavier or Salt River Pima-Maricopa Reservations, the regulations in part 162 apply. The purpose of this section is to provide regulations for implementation of the 1966 Act. The 1966 Act does not apply to leases made for purposes that are subject to the laws governing mining leases on Indian lands. 


(b) *Duration of leases.* Leases made under the 1966 Act for public, religious, educational, recreational, residential, or business purposes may be made for terms of not to exceed 99 years. The terms of a grazing lease shall not exceed ten years; the term of a farming lease that does not require the making of a substantial investment in the improvement of the land shall not exceed ten years; and the term of a farming lease that requires the making of a substantial investment in the improvement of the land shall not exceed 40 years. No lease shall contain an option to renew which extends the total term beyond the maximum term permitted by this section. 


(c) *Required covenant and enforcement thereof.* Every lease under the 1966 Act shall contain a covenant on the part of the lessee that he will not commit or permit on the leased land any act that causes waste or a nuisance or which creates a hazard to health of persons or to property wherever such persons or property may be. 


(d) *Notification regarding leasing proposals.* If the Secretary determines that a proposed lease to be made under the 1966 Act for public, religious, educational, recreational, residential, or business purposes will substantially affect the governmental interests of a municipality contiguous to the San Xavier Reservation or the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Reservation, as the case may be, he shall notify the appropriate authority of such municipality of the pendency of the proposed lease. The Secretary may, in his discretion, furnish such municipality with an outline of the major provisions of the lease which affect its governmental interests and shall consider any comments on the terms of the lease affecting the municipality or on the absence of such terms from the lease that the authorities may offer. The notice to the authorities of the municipality shall set forth a reasonable period, not to exceed 30 days, within which any such comments shall be submitted. 


(e) *Applicability of other regulations.* The regulations in part 162 of this title shall apply to leases made under the 1966 Act except where such regulations are inconsistent with this section. 


(f) *Mission San Xavier del Bac.* Nothing in the 1966 Act authorizes development that would detract from the scenic, historic, and religious values of the Mission San Xavier del Bac owned by the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor and located on the San Xavier Reservation.
