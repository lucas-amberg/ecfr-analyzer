# ยง 166.607   Is insurance required for a permit?

When we determine it to be in the best interest of the Indian landowners, we will require a permittee to provide insurance. If insurance is required, it must: 


(a) Be provided in an amount sufficient to: 


(1) Protect any improvements on the permit premises; 


(2) Cover losses such as personal injury or death; and 


(3) Protect the interest of the Indian landowner. 


(b) Identify the tribe, individual Indian landowners, and United States as insured parties.
