# ยง 166.801   What is the BIA's trespass policy?

We will: 


(a) Investigate accidental, willful, and/or incidental trespass on Indian agricultural land; 


(b) Respond to alleged trespass in a prompt, efficient manner; 


(c) Assess trespass penalties for the value of products used or removed, cost of damage to the Indian agricultural land, and enforcement costs incurred as a consequence of the trespass. 


(d) Ensure that damage to Indian agricultural lands resulting from trespass is rehabilitated and stabilized at the expense of the trespasser.
