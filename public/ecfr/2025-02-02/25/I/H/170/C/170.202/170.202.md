(a) The total amount of funding made available for the Tribal supplemental program is determined as follows:


(1) If the amount made available for the TTP is less than or equal to $275,000,000, the Tribal supplemental funding amount will equal 30 percent of such amount.


(2) If the amount made available for the TTP exceeds $275,000,000, the Tribal supplemental funding will equal:


(i) $82,500,000; plus


(ii) 12.5 percent of the amount made available for the Tribal transportation program in excess of $275,000,000.


(b) The Tribal supplemental program funds will be distributed as follows:


(1) Initially, the Tribal supplemental program funding determined in paragraph (a) of this section will be designated among the BIA Regions in proportion to the regional total of Tribal shares based on the cumulative Tribal shares of all Indian Tribes within the region under § 170.201.


(2) After paragraph (b)(1) of this section is completed, the Tribal supplemental program funding designated for each region will be distributed among the Tribes within the region as follows:


(i) The Secretaries will determine which Tribes would be entitled under § 170.200 to receive in a fiscal year less funding than they would receive in fiscal year 2011 pursuant to the relative need distribution factor and population adjustment factor, as described in 25 CFR part 170, subpart C (in effect as of July 5, 2012); and


(ii) The combined amount that such Indian Tribes would be entitled to receive in fiscal year 2011 pursuant to such relative need distribution factor and population adjustment factor in excess of the amount that they would be entitled to receive in the fiscal year under § 170.200.


(c) Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, the Secretaries will distribute a combined amount to each Tribe that meets the criteria described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section a share of funding in proportion to the share of the combined amount determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section attributable to such Indian Tribe.


(d) A Tribe may not receive under paragraph (b)(2) of this section and based on its Tribal share under § 170.200 a combined amount that exceeds the amount that such Indian Tribe would be entitled to receive in fiscal year 2011 pursuant to the relative need distribution factor and population adjustment factor, as described in 25 CFR part 170, subpart C.


(e) If the amount made available for a region under paragraph (b)(1) of this section exceeds the amount distributed among Indian Tribes within that region under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, The Secretaries will distribute the remainder of such region's funding under paragraph (b)(1) of this section among all Tribes in that region in proportion to the combined amount that each such Tribe received under § 170.200 and paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
