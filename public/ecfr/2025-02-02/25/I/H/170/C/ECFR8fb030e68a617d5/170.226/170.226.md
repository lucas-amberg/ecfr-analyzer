# ยง 170.226   How can a Tribe appeal its share calculation?

(a) In calculating Tribal shares, BIA and FHWA use population data (which may be appealed) and specific prior-year data (which may not be appealed). Share calculations are based upon the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 202(b)(3)(B).


(b) Any appeal of a Tribe's population figure must be directed to Department of Housing and Urban Development, Indian Housing Office of Native American Programs. The population data used is the most recent data on American Indian and Alaska Native population within each Indian Tribe's American Indian/Alaska Native Reservation or Statistical Area. This data is computed under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (25 U.S.C. 4101 *et seq.*).


(c) Appeal processes regarding inventory submissions are found at ยง 170.444(c), design standards at ยง 170.457, and new uses of funds at ยง 170.113.
