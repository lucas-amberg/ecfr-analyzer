# ยง 170.422   How does the public participate in developing the TTIP?

Public involvement is required in the development of the TTIP.


(a) The Tribe must publish a notice in local and/or Tribal newspapers when the draft TTIP is complete. In the absence of local public newspapers, the Tribe or BIA may post notices under locally acceptable practices. The notice must indicate where a copy can be obtained, a contact person for questions, where comments may be submitted, and the deadline for submitting comments. A copy of the notice will be made available to BIA or FHWA upon request.


(b) The Tribe may hold public meetings at which the public may comment orally or in writing.


(c) The Tribe, the State transportation department, or MPO may conduct public involvement activities.
