# ยง 170.447   How are the allowable lengths of access roads in the NTTFI determined?

The allowable length of an access road in the NTTFI is determined as follows:


(a) If the road section intersects or abuts a federally recognized Tribal boundary, then the length of the access road is the distance from the boundary extending to the intersection of an equal or greater functional classification but no more than 15 miles.


(b) If the road section does not intersect or abut a federally recognized Tribal boundary, the following applies:


(1) If the road section intersects or abuts an Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) (43 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq.*) village corporation transportation service area, then the length of the access road is the distance from the ANCSA village corporation transportation service area extending to the intersection of an equal or greater functional classification but no more than 15 miles.


(2) If the road section is located outside of an ANCSA village corporation and located within a developed Alaska Native Village with a population more than 50% Alaska Native/American Indian, then the length of the access road is defined as the distance beginning five miles outside of the developed area of the Alaska Native Village extending to the intersection of an equal or greater functional classification but no more than 15 miles.


(3) If the road section intersects or abuts a Tribally owned trust or fee parcel located outside of an incorporated municipal boundary, then the length of the access road is defined as the distance beginning five miles outside of the Tribally owned trust or fee parcel boundary extending to the intersection of an equal or greater functional classification but no more than 15 miles.


(4) If the road section intersects or abuts a Tribally owned trust or fee parcel located inside of an incorporated municipal boundary, then the length of the access road is defined as the distance from the Tribally owned trust or fee parcel boundary extending to the intersection of an equal or greater functional classification but no more than 15 miles.
