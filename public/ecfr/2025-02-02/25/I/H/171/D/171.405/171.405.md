# ยง 171.405   Can I build my own structure or take over responsibility of a BIA structure?

You may build a structure on our irrigation facility for your private use or take responsibility of one of our structures, but only under a written agreement between you and us which:


(a) Relieves us from any future liability or responsibility for the structure;


(b) Relieves us from any future costs incurred for maintaining the structure;


(c) Describes what is granted by us and accepted by you; and


(d) Provides that if you do not regularly use a structure for a period of time that we have determined, or you do not properly maintain and rehabilitate the structure, we will notify you in writing that:


(1) You must either remove it or correct any unsafe condition;


(2) If you do not comply with our notice, we may remove the structure and you must reimburse us our costs; and


(3) We may modify, close, or remove your structure without notice due to an urgency we have identified.
