# ยง 211.44   Suspension of operations.

(a) After the expiration of the primary term of the lease the Secretary may approve suspension of operations for remedial purposes which are necessary for continued production, to protect the resource, the environment, or for other good reasons. *Provided,* that such remedial operations are conducted in accordance with 43 CFR part 3160, subpart 3165 and under such stipulations and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary and are conducted with reasonable diligence. Any suspension shall not relieve the lessee from liability for the payment of rental and other payments as required by lease provisions. 


(b) An application for permission to suspend operations or production for economic or marketing reasons on a lease capable of production after the expiration of the primary term of lease duration must be accompanied by the written consent of the Indian mineral owner, an economic analysis, and an executed amendment by the parties to the lease setting forth the provisions pertaining to the suspension of operations and production. Such application shall be treated as a negotiated change to lease provisions, and as such, shall be subject to review and approval by the Secretary.
