# ยง 226.24   Lessee's use of water.

Lessee or his contractor may, with the approval of the Superintendent, use water from streams and natural water courses to the extent that same does not diminish the supply below the requirements of the surface owner from whose land the water is taken. Similarly, Lessee or his contractor may use water from reservoirs formed by the impoundment of water from such streams and natural water courses, provided such use does not exceed the quantity to which they originally would have been entitled had the reservoirs not been constructed. Lessee or his contractor may install necessary lines and other equipment within the Osage Mineral Estate to obtain such water. Any damage resulting from such installation shall be settled as provided in ยง 226.21.
