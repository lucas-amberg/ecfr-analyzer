# ยง 273.140   What is the funding formula to distribute funds?

Funds will be distributed to contractors based upon a funding formula. The funding formula is calculated using data obtained by the Department of Education from the previous year.


(a) The funding formula to determine the funding to be distributed to each contractor is the Weight Factor multiplied by the number of eligible Indian students, where the Weight Factor is:


(1) The State average cost per pupil count divided by the national average cost per pupil count; or


(2) A default weight factor of 1.3, if the calculation in paragraph (a)(1) of this section results in a weight factor of less than 1.3.


(b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of the law, Federal funds appropriated for the purpose will be allotted pro rata in accordance with the distribution method outlined in this formula.


(c) For four fiscal years following the date of enactment of the JOM Modernization Act (December 31, 2018):


(1) Existing contractors will not receive an amount that is less than the amount received for Fiscal Year 2018 (the fiscal year preceding the date of enactment of the JOM Modernization Act), unless:


(i) The existing contractor fails to submit a complete annual report;


(ii) The Secretary has found that the existing contractor has violated the terms of a contract under this part; or


(iii) The number of eligible Indian students reported in the annual report has decreased below the number of eligible Indian students served by the existing contractor in Fiscal Year 2018 (the fiscal year preceding the date of enactment of the JOM Modernization Act).


(2) Paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section notwithstanding, no existing contractor will receive an amount of funding per eligible Indian student that is less than the amount of funding per eligible Indian student that the existing contractor received for Fiscal Year 2018 (the fiscal year preceding the enactment of the JOM Modernization Act).


(d) Beginning December 31, 2022 (4 years after the December 31, 2018, date of enactment of the JOM Modernization Act), no contracting party will receive for a fiscal year more than a 10 percent decrease in funding per eligible Indian student from the previous year.
