# ยง 293.28   May a compact or extension include provisions that limit the duration of the compact?

Yes. However, IGRA anticipates compacts are long-term agreements between a Tribe and a State. These agreements reflect carefully negotiated compromises between sovereigns. A refusal to negotiate a long-term compact, or a short-term extension of at least one year to allow for negotiations to continue, may be considered evidence of a violation of IGRA.
