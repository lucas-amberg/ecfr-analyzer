# ยง 547.9   What are the minimum technical standards for Class II gaming system accounting functions?

(a) *Required accounting data.* The following minimum accounting data, however named, must be maintained by the Class II gaming system:


(1) Amount In: The total value of all financial instruments and cashless transactions accepted by the Class II gaming system. Each type of financial instrument accepted by the Class II gaming system must be tracked independently per financial instrument acceptor, and as required by applicable requirements of TGRA regulations that meet or exceed the minimum internal control standards at 25 CFR part 543.


(2) Amount Out: The total value of all financial instruments and cashless transactions paid by the Class II gaming system, plus the total value of attendant pay. Each type of financial instrument paid by the Class II Gaming System must be tracked independently per financial instrument dispenser, and as required by applicable requirements of TGRA regulations that meet or exceed the minimum internal control standards at 25 CFR part 543.


(b) *Accounting data storage.* If the Class II gaming system electronically maintains accounting data:


(1) Accounting data must be stored with at least eight decimal digits.


(2) Credit balances must have sufficient digits to accommodate the design of the game.


(3) Accounting data displayed to the player may be incremented or decremented using visual effects, but the internal storage of this data must be immediately updated in full.


(4) Accounting data must be updated upon the occurrence of the relevant accounting event.


(5) Modifications to accounting data must be recorded, including the identity of the person(s) making the modifications, and be reportable by the Class II gaming system.


(c) *Rollover.* Accounting data that rolls over to zero must not corrupt data.


(d) *Credit balance display and function.* (1) Any credit balance maintained at the player interface must be prominently displayed at all times except:


(i) In audit, configuration, recall and test modes; or


(ii) Temporarily, during entertaining displays of game results.


(2) Progressive prizes may be added to the player's credit balance provided that:


(i) The player credit balance is maintained in dollars and cents;


(ii) The progressive accounting data is incremented in number of credits; or


(iii) The prize in dollars and cents is converted to player credits or transferred to the player's credit balance in a manner that does not mislead the player or cause accounting imbalances.


(3) If the player credit balance displays in credits, but the actual balance includes fractional credits, the Class II gaming system must display the fractional credit when the player credit balance drops below one credit.
