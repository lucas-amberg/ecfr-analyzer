# ยง 700.515   Conflicts of interest.

(a) A conflict of interest may exist when an employee uses, or appears to use, his or her official position to obtain benefits for himself or herself, close friends, relatives, or business associates. A conflict of interest may also exist if an employee's private activities interfere with the proper discharge of his or her official duties. If an employee has any doubt about whether or not a particular situation is, or gives the appearance of being a conflict of interest, the situation should be discussed with the immediate supervisor. Should further review be required, the Designated Agency Ethics Official shall be consulted.


(b) Principal situations where conflict of interest may develop are regulated by the sections which follow. However, these regulations do not preclude other conflict of interest situations which may arise in connection with the work of the Commission.


(c) These prohibitions apply to all Commission employees, whether or not they are required to file financial and employment disclosure statements.
