# ยง 900.121   What happens during the preplanning phase and can an Indian tribe or tribal organization perform any of the activities involved in this process?

(a) The application and ranking process for developing a priority listing of projects varies between agencies. There are, however, steps in the selection process that are common to most selection processes. An Indian tribe or tribal organization that wishes to secure a construction project should contact the appropriate agency to determine the specific steps involved in the application and selection process used to fund specific types of projects. When a priority process is used in the selection of construction projects, the steps involved in the application and ranking process are as follows: 


(1) *Application.* The agency solicits applications from Indian tribes or tribal organizations. In the request for applications, the Secretary provides specific information regarding the type of project to be funded, the objective criteria that will be used to evaluate applications, the points or weight that each criterion will be assigned, and the time when applications are due. An Indian tribe or tribal organization may prepare the application (technical assistance from the agency, within resources available, shall be provided upon request from an Indian tribe or tribal organization) or may rely upon the agency to prepare the application. 


(2) *Ranking/Prioritization.* The Secretary evaluates the applications based on the criteria provided as part of the application preparation process. The Secretary applies only criteria and weights assigned to each criteria that were disclosed to the Indian tribe or tribal organization during the application stage. The applications are then ranked in order from the application that best meets application criteria to the application that least meet the application criteria. 


(3) *Validation.* Before final acceptance of a ranked application, the information, such as demographic information, deficiency levels reported in application, the condition of existing facilities, and program housing needs, is validated. During this process, additional information may be developed by the Indian tribe or tribal organization in support of the original information or the Secretary may designate a representative of the Department to conduct an on-site review of the information contained in the application.
