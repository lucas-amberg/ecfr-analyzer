# ยง 900.194   Does FTCA coverage extend to services provided under a staff privileges agreement with a non-IHS facility where the agreement requires a health care practitioner to provide reciprocal services to the general population?

Yes. Those services are covered, as long as the contractor's health care practitioners do not receive additional compensation from a third party for the performance of these services and they are acting within the scope of their employment under a self-determination contract. Reciprocal services include: 


(a) Cross-covering other medical personnel who temporarily cannot attend their patients; 


(b) Assisting other personnel with surgeries or other medical procedures; 


(c) Assisting with unstable patients or at deliveries; or 


(d) Assisting in any patient care situation where additional assistance by health care personnel is needed.
