# § 1000.135   May a Consortium member Tribe withdraw from the Consortium and be selected to participate in Self-Governance?

In accordance with the expressed terms of the compact or written agreement of the Consortium, a Consortium member Tribe (either a signatory or nonsignatory Tribe) may fully or partially withdraw from a participating Consortium its share of any program included in a compact or funding agreement to directly negotiate a compact and funding agreement. The withdrawing Tribe must do the following:


(a) Independently meet all of the eligibility criteria in §§ 1000.115 through 1000.140. If a Consortium's planning activities specifically consider self-governance activities for a member Tribe, that planning activity may be used to satisfy the planning requirements for the member Tribe if it applies for self-governance status on its own.


(b) Submit a notice of withdrawal to OSG and the Consortium as evidenced by a resolution of the Tribal governing body.
