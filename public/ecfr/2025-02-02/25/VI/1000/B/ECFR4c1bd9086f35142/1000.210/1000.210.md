# ยง 1000.210   How are funds redistributed when a withdrawing Tribe fully or partially withdraws from a compact and funding agreement and enters a new contract or compact?

When a Tribe eligible to enter into a contract under title I or a compact or funding agreement under title IV fully or partially withdraws from a participating Consortium, and has proposed to enter into a contract or compact and funding agreement covering the withdrawn funds:


(a) The withdrawing Tribe is entitled to its Tribal share of funds supporting those programs that the Tribe will be carrying out under its own contract or compact and funding agreement (calculated on the same basis or methodology upon which the funds were included in the Consortium's funding agreement); and


(b) The funds referred to in paragraph (a) of this section must be transferred from the Consortium's funding agreement, on the condition that the provisions of 25 U.S.C. 5321 and 5324(i), as appropriate, apply to the withdrawing Tribe.
