# ยง 1000.1445   May the Secretary suspend construction activities under the terms of a funding agreement or construction project agreement under title IV of the ISDEAA?

(a) The Secretary may, in lieu of reassumption under subpart M of this part, allow a Tribe/Consortium to suspend certain work under a construction project included in a funding agreement or construction project agreement under title IV of the ISDEAA for up to 30 days only if the Secretary notifies the Tribe/Consortium in writing that the Secretary has found that:


(1) Site conditions adversely affect health and safety; or


(2) Work in progress or completed for the construction project fails to substantially carry out the terms of the construction project agreement or funding agreement without good cause.


(b) The Secretary may suspend only work directly related to the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section unless other reasons for suspension are specifically negotiated in the funding agreement or construction project agreement under title IV of the ISDEAA.


(c) Unless the Secretary determines that a health and safety emergency requiring immediate reassumption under subpart M of this part exists, before requesting a suspension of work on the project by the Tribe/Consortium, the Secretary must provide:


(1) A 5-working days written notice to the Tribe/Consortium specifying the reasons the Secretary requests a suspension of certain project work; and


(2) A reasonable opportunity for the Tribe/Consortium to correct the problem.


(d) The Tribe/Consortium must be compensated for reasonable costs due to any suspension of work that occurred through no fault of the Tribe/Consortium. Project funds will not be used for this purpose. However, if suspension occurs due to the action or inaction of the Tribe/Consortium, then project funds will be used to cover suspension related activities.
