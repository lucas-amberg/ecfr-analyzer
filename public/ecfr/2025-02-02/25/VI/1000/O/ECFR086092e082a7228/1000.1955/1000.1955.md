# ยง 1000.1955   What are the consequences of a finding of imminent jeopardy in the Secretary's annual trust evaluation?

(a) A finding of imminent jeopardy to a trust asset, natural resource, or public health and safety that is caused by an act or omission of the Tribe/Consortium and that arises out of a failure by the Tribe/Consortium to carry out the compact or funding agreement, triggers the Federal reassumption process (*see* subpart M of this part), unless the conditions in paragraph (b) of this section are met.


(b) The reassumption process will not be triggered if the Secretary's designated representative determines that the Tribe/Consortium:


(1) Can cure the conditions causing jeopardy within 60 days; and


(2) Will not cause significant loss, harm, or devaluation of a trust asset, natural resources, or the public health and safety.
