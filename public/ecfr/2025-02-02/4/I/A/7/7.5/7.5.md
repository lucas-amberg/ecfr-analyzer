# § 7.5   Adverse actions: Suspensions for 14 days or less.

(3) Be represented by an attorney or other representative; and 


(4) A written decision and the specific reasons therefore at the earliest practicable date. 


(c) *Documentation.* Copies of the notice of proposed action, the answer of the employee if written, a summary thereof if made orally, the notice of decision and reasons therefor, and any order effecting the suspension, together with any supporting material, shall be maintained by Personnel and shall be furnished to the employee affected upon the employee's request.
