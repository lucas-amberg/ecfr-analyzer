(3) Name, address, affiliation, if any, and telephone number of the petitioning organization; 


(4) A copy of the constitution and bylaws of the organization, a roster of the organization's officers and representatives, and a statement of the organization's objectives, together with a statement that these documents have also been supplied to the GAO; 


(5) A declaration by the signer of the petition, under penalties of the Criminal Code (18 U.S.C. 1001), that the petition's contents are true and correct, to the best of their knowledge and belief;


(6) The signature of the representative of the petitioner, including title and telephone number; and
