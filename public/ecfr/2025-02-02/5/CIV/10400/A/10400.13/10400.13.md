# § 10400.13   Fees to be charged—categories of requesters.

(a) For fees, there are four categories of FOIA requesters: commercial use requests; educational and non-commercial scientific institution requests; requests from representatives of the news media; and all other requesters.


(b) The specific levels of fees for each of these categories are:


(1) *Commercial use request.* IPEC will recover the full direct cost of providing search, review, and duplication services. Commercial use requests will not receive free search-time or free duplication of documents.


(2) *Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requests.* IPEC will charge the cost of duplication, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. Requesters must demonstrate the request is authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought for scholarly or scientific research not a commercial use.


(3) *Requests from representatives of the news media.* IPEC will charge the cost of duplication, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. Requesters must meet the criteria in § 10400.3, and the request must not be made for a commercial use. A request that supports the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered a commercial use.


(4) *All other requesters.* IPEC will recover the full direct cost of the search and the duplication of records, excluding the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time.
