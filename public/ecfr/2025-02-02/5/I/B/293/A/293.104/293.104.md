# ยง 293.104   Collection of information.

(a) Any information in personnel records whether or not those records are in a system of records, used in whole or in part in making a determination about an individual's rights, benefits, or privileges under Federal personnel programs should, to the greatest extent practicable, be collected directly from the individual concerned. Factors to be considered in determining whether to collect the data from the individual concerned or a third party are when:


(1) The nature of the information is such that it can only be obtained from another party;


(2) The cost of collecting the information directly from the individual is unreasonable when compared with the cost of collecting it from another party;


(3) There is virtually no risk that information collected from other parties, if inaccurate, could result in a determination adverse to the individual concerned;


(4) The information supplied by an individual must be verified by another party; or


(5) There are provisions made, to the greatest extent practicable, to vertify information collected from another party with the individual concerned.
