# § 304.105   Daily and biweekly basic pay limitations.

(a) Unless specifically authorized by an appropriation or other statute, agencies subject to chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5, United States Code, may not pay for any 1 day an aggregate amount of pay (including basic pay, locality pay under subpart F of part 531 of this chapter, and premium pay under subpart A of part 550 of this chapter) that exceeds the daily equivalent of the highest rate payable under 5 U.S.C. 5332—that is, the daily rate for GS-15, step 10, under the General Schedule (excluding locality pay or any other additional pay). The daily rate is computed by dividing the annual GS-15, step 10, rate by 2,087 hours to find the hourly rate of pay and by multiplying the hourly rate of pay by 8 hours.


(b) Unless specifically authorized by an appropriation or other statute, an expert or consultant shall not be paid for any biweekly pay period an aggregate amount of pay (including basic pay, locality pay under subpart F of part 531 of this chapter, and premium pay under subpart A of part 550 of this chapter) in excess of the biweekly rate of pay for GS-15, step 10, under the General Schedule (excluding locality pay or any other additional pay). The biweekly rate is computed by dividing the annual GS-15, step 10, rate by 2,087 hours to find the hourly rate of pay and by multiplying the hourly rate of pay by 80 hours.
