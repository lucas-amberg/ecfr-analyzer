# ยง 307.103   Nature of VRAs.

VRAs are excepted appointments, made without competition, to positions otherwise in the competitive service. The veterans' preference procedures of part 302 of this chapter apply when there are preference eligible candidates being considered for a VRA. *Qualified covered veterans* who were separated *under honorable conditions* may be appointed to any position in the competitive service at grade levels up to and including GS-11 or equivalent, provided they meet the qualification standards for the position. To be eligible for a VRA as a *covered veteran* under paragraph (2) or (3) of the definition of that term in ยง 307.102, the veteran must be in receipt of the appropriate campaign badge, expeditionary medal, or AFSM. For purposes of a VRA, any military service is qualifying at the GS-3 level or equivalent. Upon satisfactory completion of 2 years of substantially continuous service, the incumbent's VRA must be converted to a career or career conditional appointment. An individual may receive more than one VRA appointment as long as the individual meets the definition of a *covered veteran* at the time of appointment.
