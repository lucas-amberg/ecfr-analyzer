# § 316.403   Designation of provisional appointments.

(a) *Conditions for designation.* An agency may designate a temporary appointment as a provisional appointment only when all of the following conditions are met:


(1) The appointment is made to fill a continuing position by a provisional appointment leading to permanent appointment when the position must be filled more quickly than would be possible under the procedures required for nontemporary appointment or when such a provisional appointment is a requirement of the applicable authority;


(2) The agency must have current budgetary and appointing authority for the nontemporary appointment (assuming satisfactory completion of the required procedures); and


(3) The agency must have a specific intention to convert the appointee to a nontemporary appointment under appropriate authority before the expiration of the temporary appointment, must state this intention in any written offer of employment and document this intention as part of the permanent record of the initial appointment in accordance with instructions issued by OPM.


(b) *Authority for provisional appointments.* Provisional appointments must be made under an authority established by law, Executive order, or regulation or granted by OPM. Appointments which may be treated as provisional appointments under this paragraph may be made under any appropriate authority, including, but not limited to:


(1) Noncompetitive temporary appointments of disabled veterans under § 316.402(b)(5), when the appointments are intended to afford eligibility for conversion in accordance with § 315.707 of this chapter and section 3112 of title 5, United States Code;


(2) Temporary appointments of nurses in the Department of Veterans Affairs, when the appointments are made under the provisions of section 4114 of title 38, United States Code, with the intention of converting the appointees to continuing appointments as soon as the appointees obtain required State certification or registration and/or the agency completes necessary verification of references;


(3) Temporary transitional Schedule C appointments made under § 213.3302 of this chapter, when the appointees are to be converted to nontemporary Schedule C appointments upon OPM approval and completion of necessary clearances.


(4) Senior Executive Service limited term and limited emergency appointments made under § 317.601 of this chapter, when the appointees are to be converted to nontemporary appointments in the Senior Executive Service or to nontemporary Presidential appointments, upon further action, such as OPM approval, White House clearance, and/or confirmation by the Senate; and
