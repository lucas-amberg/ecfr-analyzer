(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the total number of students that an agency may appoint under this section during a fiscal year may not exceed the number equal to 15 percent of the number of students the agency head appointed during the previous fiscal year to a position at the GS-11 level or below (or equivalent). An appointing agency may not count appointments made using direct hire authorities, non-competitive authorities, excepted service authorities other than Pathways Internship Program appointments under ยง 213.3402(a) of this chapter and 5 CFR part 362, subpart B, or selections under merit promotion authorities, when establishing the limit for a given fiscal year.


(b) OPM may establish a lower limitation on the number of students that may be appointed by an agency under paragraph (a) of this section during a fiscal year based on any factor OPM considers appropriate. OPM shall notify agencies via the OPM website and other venues (such as the Chief Human Capital Officer's Council) of any changes to the numerical limitation, applicable governmentwide. Changes to the numerical limit for an individual agency will be communicated directly to the agency.
