# ยง 330.607   Applying CTAP selection priority.

(a) An agency must not place any other candidate from within or outside the agency into a vacancy if there is an available CTAP selection priority candidate, unless the personnel action to be effected is an exception under ยง 330.609.


(b) In accordance with the conditions of part 300, subpart E, of this chapter, an agency may not procure temporary help services under that subpart until a determination is made that no CTAP eligible is available.

(1) Is at a grade or pay level with a representative rate no higher than the representative rate of the grade or pay level of the CTAP eligible's permanent position of record;


(2) Has no greater promotion potential than the CTAP eligible's permanent position of record;


(3) Is in the same local commuting area as the CTAP eligible's permanent position of record;


(4) Is filled during the CTAP eligible's eligibility period; and, if applicable,
