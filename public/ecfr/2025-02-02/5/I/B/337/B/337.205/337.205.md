# ยง 337.205   Critical hiring needs.

(a) OPM will determine when there is a critical hiring need for particular occupations, grades (or equivalent) and/or geographic locations. OPM may decide independently that such a need exists or may make this decision in response to a written request from an agency.


(b) An agency when requesting direct-hire authority under this section, or OPM when deciding on its own, must:


(1) Identify the position(s) that must be filled;


(2) Describe the event or circumstance that has created the need to fill the position(s);


(3) Specify the duration for which the critical need is expected to exist; and


(4) Include supporting evidence that demonstrates why the use of other hiring authorities is impracticable or ineffective.


(c) *Information Technology (IT) positions.* (1) The head of a covered agency, as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, may determine whether a critical hiring need exists for any position in the information technology management series, general schedule (GS)-2210 or equivalent. In making such a determination, a covered agency must adhere to and use the supporting evidence criteria prescribed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section. In addition, a covered agency must maintain a file of the supporting evidence for documentation and reporting purposes. Upon determination of such a finding, an agency head may approve a direct hire authority for covered positions within the agency.


(2) *Covered agency.* A covered agency is an entity listed in 31 U.S.C. 901(b) (excluding the Department of Defense), or an independent regulatory agency defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(5).


(3) *Notification to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).* Once the head of a covered agency affirmatively determines the presence of a critical hiring need and the direct hire authority is approved by the agency head, he or she must notify OPM within 10 business days. Such notification must include a description of the supporting evidence relied upon in making the determination.


(4) *Using this authority.* A covered agency must adhere to all provisions of subpart B of this part.


(5) *Length of appointments.* A covered agency may use this authority to appoint individuals for a period of more than 1 year, but not more than 4 years, if the direct hire authority remains in effect.


(i) A covered agency may extend an appointment under this authority for up to 4 additional years.


(ii) No individual may serve more than 8 years on an appointment made under these provisions for information technology positions.


(iii) No individual hired under these provisions may be transferred to positions that are not IT positions.
