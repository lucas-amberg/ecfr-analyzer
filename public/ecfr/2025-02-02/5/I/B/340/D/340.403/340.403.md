# ยง 340.403   Intermittent employment.

(a) *Appropriate use.* An intermittent work schedule is appropriate only when the nature of the work is sporadic and unpredictable so that a tour of duty cannot be regularly scheduled in advance. When an agency is able to schedule work in advance on a regular basis, it has an obligation to document the change in work schedule from intermittent to part-time or full-time to ensure proper service credit.


(b) *Noncompetitive movement.* Intermittent employees serving under career appointment may move to other positions in the same way as other regular career employees.
