# § 359.402   Removal: Unacceptable performance.

(a) *Coverage.* This section covers the removal of a career appointee from the SES during the probationary period for unacceptable performance. 


(b) *Basis for action.* A removal under this section need not be based upon a final rating under the agency's SES performance appraisal system established under subpart C of part 430 of this chapter. Even if a removal is based on such a rating, the removal action is taken under this section. 


(c) *Procedures.* The agency shall notify the appointee in writing before the effective date of the action. The notice shall, as a minimum— 


(1) State the agency's conclusions as to the inadequacies of the appointee's performance; 


(2) State whether the appointee has placement rights under § 359.701 and, if so, identify the position to which the appointee will be assigned; and 


(3) Show the effective date of the action.
