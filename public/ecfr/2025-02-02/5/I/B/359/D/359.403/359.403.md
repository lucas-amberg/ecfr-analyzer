# § 359.403   Removal: Conduct.

(a) *Coverage.* (1) This section covers the removal of a career appointee from the SES during the probationary period for misconduct, neglect of duty, malfeasance, or failure to accept a directed reassignment or to accompany a position in a transfer of function. 


(2) This section does not apply, however, when the appointee was covered under 5 U.S.C. 7511 immediately before appointment to the SES. In that case, the removal is subject to the provisions of part 752, subpart F, of this chapter. 


(b) *Procedures.* The agency shall notify the appointee in writing before the effective date of the action. The notice shall, as a minimum— 


(1) State the basis for the removal action (including the act(s) of misconduct, neglect of duty, or malfeasance if those factors are involved); and 


(2) Show the effective date of the action.
