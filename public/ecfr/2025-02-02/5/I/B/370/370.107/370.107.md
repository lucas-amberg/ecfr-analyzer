# § 370.107   Details to small business concerns.

(a) The head of each agency must take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that, of the details made to private sector organizations in each calendar year, at least 20 percent are to small business concerns, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3703(e)(1).


(b) Agencies must round up to the nearest whole number when calculating the percentage of details to small business concerns needed to meet the requirements of this section. For example, if an agency detailed 11 individuals to private sector organizations during a given year, to meet the 20 percent requirement, that agency must have made at least 3 (rounded up from 2.2) of these details to small business concerns.


(c) For purposes of this section, “year” refers to the 12-month period beginning on date of the enactment of the Act, December 17, 2002, and each succeeding 12-month period in which any assignments are made. Assignments “made” in a year are those commencing in such year, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3703(e)(2).


(d) Agencies that do not meet the requirements of this section are subject to the reporting requirements in 5 U.S.C. 3703(e)(3).


(e) An agency that makes fewer than five details to private sector organizations in any year is not subject to this section.
