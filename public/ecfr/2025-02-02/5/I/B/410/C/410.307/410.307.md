# § 410.307   Training for promotion or placement in other positions.

(a) *General.* In determining whether to provide training under this section, agencies should take into account:


(1) Agency authority to modify qualification requirements in certain situations as provided in the OPM Operating Manual for Qualification Standards for General Schedule Positions;


(2) Agency authority to establish training programs that provide intensive and directly job-related training to substitute for all or part of the experience (but not education, licensing, certification, or other specific credentials), required by OPM qualification standards. Such training programs may be established to provide employees with the opportunity to acquire the experience and knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to qualify for another position (including at a higher grade) at an accelerated rate; and


(3) Time-in-grade restrictions on advancement (see 5 CFR 300.603(b)(6)).


(b) *Training for promotion.* Under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 4103, and consistent with merit system principles set forth in 5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(1) and (2), an agency may provide training to non-temporary employees that in certain instances may lead to promotion. An agency must follow its competitive procedures under part 335 of this chapter when selecting a non-temporary employee for training that permits noncompetitive promotion after successful completion of the training.


(c) *Training for placement in other agency positions, in other agencies, or outside Government*—(1) *Grade or pay retention.* Under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 4103 and 5 U.S.C. 5364, an agency may train an employee to meet the qualification requirements of another position in the agency if the new position is at or below the retained grade or the grade of the position the employee held before pay retention.


(2) *Training for placement in another agency.* Under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 4103(b), and consistent with merit system principles set forth in 5 U.S.C. 2301, an agency may train an employee to meet the qualification requirements of a position in another agency if the head of the agency determines that such training would be in the interest of the Government.


(i) Before undertaking any training under this section, the head of the agency shall determine that there exists a reasonable expectation of placement in another agency.


(ii) When selecting an employee for training under this section, the head of the agency shall consider:


(A) The extent to which the employee's current skills, knowledge, and abilities may be utilized in the new position;


(B) The employee's capability to learn skills and acquire knowledge and abilities needed in the new position; and


(C) The benefits to the Government which would result from retaining the employee in the Federal service.


(3) *Training displaced or surplus employees.* Displaced or surplus employees as defined in 5 CFR 330.602 may be eligible for training or retraining for positions outside Government through programs provided under 29 U.S.C. 1651, or similar authorities. An agency may use its appropriated funds for training displaced or surplus employees for positions outside Government only when specifically authorized by legislation to do so.


(4) *Career transition assistance plans.* Under 5 CFR part 330, subpart F, agencies are required to establish career transition assistance plans (CTAP) to provide career transition services to displaced and surplus employees.


(i) Under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 4109, an agency may:


(A) Train employees in the use of the CTAP services;


(B) Provide vocational and career assessment and counseling services;


(C) Train employees in job search skills, techniques, and strategies; and


(D) Pay for training related expenses as provided in 5 U.S.C. 4109(a)(2).


(ii) Agency CTAP's will include plans for retraining displaced or surplus employees covered by this part.
