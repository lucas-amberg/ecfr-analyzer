# ยง 470.305   Submission of proposals for demonstration projects.

(a) OPM will accept project proposals at any time. However, OPM may delay action for a reasonable amount of time on submitted proposals until comparisons can be made with other existing projects or with project proposals of a similar nature not yet received by OPM but known to be under development.


(b) Agencies must submit the project proposal in the form of a project plan to OPM for approval. OPM will prescribe the content of a project plan in its guidance and instructions, which at a minimum will contain the items identified in 5 U.S.C. 4703(b)(1) and 5 CFR 470.301(b).


(c) Agencies will outline, at the time proposed demonstration projects are submitted to OPM for approval, what discussions of the project have been held with labor organizations which have been accorded exclusive recognition for bargaining units containing employees involved in or affected by the proposed demonstration project.


(d) OPM may combine and evaluate similar project proposals received from different agencies as a single project, with the approval of the agencies involved.
