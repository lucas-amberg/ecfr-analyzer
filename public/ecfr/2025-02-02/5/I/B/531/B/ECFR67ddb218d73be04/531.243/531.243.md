# ยง 531.243   Promotion of a GM employee.

(a) Upon promotion, an employee's status as a GM employee ends, as provided in ยง 531.241(b).


(b) When an employee loses status as a GM employee because of a temporary promotion and is returned to the lower grade upon expiration or termination of the temporary promotion under ยง 531.215(c)(1), he or she will be deemed to have been placed at the lowest step rate that equals or exceeds the employee's former GS rate (as a GM employee) on the effective date of the temporary promotion, before applying any other step increases based on his or her service during the temporary promotion.


(c) A GM employee's GS rate is used as the existing rate of pay in applying the promotion rule in ยง 531.214. A GM employee's off-step GS rate in the grade before promotion is not converted to a GS step rate in applying the promotion rule, but the employee must be placed on a GS step rate in the post-promotion grade.
