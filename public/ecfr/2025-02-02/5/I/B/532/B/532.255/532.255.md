(a) The Department of Defense shall establish and issue regular appropriated fund wage schedules for U.S. citizens who are employees in foreign areas. These wage schedules shall provide rates of pay for nonsupervisory, leader, supervisory, and production facilitating employees.

(2) Effective on the first day of the first pay period that begins on or after January 1 of the succeeding year.


(c) Step 2 rates for each nonsupervisory grade shall be derived by computing a simple average of each step 2 rate for each of the 15 grades of all nonsupervisory wage rate schedules designated in paragraph (b) of this section.


(d) Through the use of the step 2 rates derived under the schedule averaging process, the step rates for each of the 15 grades of the nonsupervisory schedule and all scheduled pay rates for leaders and supervisors shall be developed by using the standard formulas established in 5 CFR 532.203, Structure of regular wage schedules.


(e) Pay schedules for production facilitating positions shall be established in accordance with the table in § 532.263(c) of this subpart.
