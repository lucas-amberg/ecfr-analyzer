# § 532.257   Regular nonappropriated fund wage schedules in foreign areas.

(a) The Department of Defense shall establish and issue regular nonappropriated fund wage schedules for U.S. citizens who are wage employees in foreign areas. These schedules will provide rates of pay for nonsupervisory, leader, and supervisory employees.


(b) Schedules will be—


(1) Computed on the basis of a simple average of all regular nonappropriated fund wage area schedules defined for the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia in effect on the first Sunday in January; and


(2) Effective on the first Sunday in January of each year.


(c) Step 2 rates for each nonsupervisory grade will be derived by computing a simple average of each step 2 rate for each of the 15 grades of all nonsupervisory wage rate schedules designated in paragraph (b) of this section.


(d) Through the use of the step 2 rates derived under the schedule averaging process, the step rates for each of the 15 grades of the nonsupervisory schedule and all scheduled pay rates for leaders and supervisors will be developed by using the standard formulas established in 5 CFR 532.203, Structure of regular wage schedules.
