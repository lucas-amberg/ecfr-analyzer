# § 537.108   Loss of eligibility for student loan repayment benefits.

(a) An employee receiving student loan repayment benefits from an agency is ineligible for continued benefits from that agency if the employee—


(1) Separates from the agency;


(2) Does not maintain an acceptable level of performance, as determined under standards and procedures prescribed by the agency; or


(3) Violates a condition in the service agreement, if the agreement specifically provides that eligibility is lost when the condition is violated.


(b) For the purpose of applying paragraph (a)(2) of this section, an acceptable level of performance is one that is equivalent to level 3 (“Fully Successful” or equivalent) or higher, as described in 5 CFR 430.208(d). An employee loses eligibility for student loan repayment benefits if his or her most recent official performance evaluation does not meet this requirement.
