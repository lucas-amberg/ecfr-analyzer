# ยง 550.406   Work assignments during evacuation; return to duty.

(a) Evacuated employees at safe havens may be assigned to perform any work considered necessary or required to be performed during the period of the evacuation without regard to the grades or titles of the employees. Failure or refusal to perform assigned work may be a basis for terminating further evacuation payments.


(b) When part-time employees are given assigned work at the safe haven, records of the number of hours worked shall be maintained so that payment may be made for any hours of work that are greater than the number of hours on which evacuation payments are computed.


(c) Not later than 180 days after the effective date of the order to evacuate, or when the emergency or evacuation situation is terminated, whichever is earlier, an employee must be returned to his or her regular duty station, or appropriate action must be taken to reassign him or her to another duty station.
