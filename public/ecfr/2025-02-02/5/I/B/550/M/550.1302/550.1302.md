# § 550.1302   Definitions.

In this subpart:


*Annual rate of basic pay* (except as otherwise provided in §§ 550.1305 and 550.1308) means the annual rate fixed under the rate schedule applicable to the position held by the firefighter, including a locality rate schedule established under 5 U.S.C. 5304 or a special rate schedule established under 5 U.S.C. 5305, before any deductions and exclusive of additional pay of any other kind.


*Basic 40-hour workweek* means—


(1) A standard 40-hour workweek consisting of five 8-hour workdays that is part of the firefighter's regular tour of duty; or


(2) A designated block of hours within a firefighter's regular tour of duty that, on a fixed and recurring basis, consists of 40 hours of actual work during each administrative week (or 80 hours of actual work in each biweekly pay period), excluding sleep and standby duty hours, provided the regular tour of duty does not consist primarily of 24-hour shifts.




*Firefighter* means an employee— 


(1) Whose regular tour of duty, as in effect throughout the year, averages at least 106 hours per biweekly pay period; and 


(2) Who is in a position— 


(i) Covered by the General Schedule and classified in the Fire Protection and Prevention Series, GS-0081, consistent with standards published by the Office of Personnel Management; 


(ii) In a demonstration project established under chapter 47 of title 5, United States Code, or an alternative personnel system under a similar authority, which otherwise would be covered by the General Schedule, and which is classified in the Fire Protection and Prevention Series, GS-0081, consistent with standards published by the Office of Personnel Management, but only if application of 5 U.S.C. 5545b has not been waived; or 


(iii) Covered by the General Schedule and classified in the GS-0099, General Student Trainee Series (as required by § 362.203(f) of this chapter), if the position otherwise would be classified in the GS-0081 series.


*Firefighter hourly rate of basic pay* means an hourly rate computed by dividing the applicable annual rate of basic pay by 2756 hours, as described in § 550.1303.


*Irregular hours* means hours of work that are outside a firefighter's regular tour of duty.


*Overtime hours* means hours of work in excess of 106 hours in a biweekly pay period, or, if the agency establishes a weekly basis for overtime pay computations, hours of work in excess of 53 hours in an administrative workweek.


*Overtime pay* means pay for overtime hours.


*Regular tour of duty* means a firefighter's official work schedule, as established by the employing agency on a regular and recurring basis (or on a temporary basis in cases where a temporary change in schedules results in a reduction in regular work hours or a change in the pay computation method used under § 550.1303). The tour of duty may consist of a fixed number of hours each week or a fixed recurring cycle of work schedules in which the number of hours per week varies in a repeating pattern. The regular tour of duty includes only those overtime hours that are part of the fixed recurring work schedule. However, irregular hours are deemed to be included in a firefighter's regular tour of duty if those hours are substituted for hours in the regular tour of duty for which leave without pay is taken, as provided in § 550.1303(d).
