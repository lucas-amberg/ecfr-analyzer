# § 551.511   Hourly regular rate of pay.

(a) An employee's “hourly regular rate” is computed by dividing the total remuneration paid to an employee in the workweek by the total number of hours of work in the workweek for which such compensation was paid.


(b) “Total remuneration” includes all remuneration for employment paid to, or on behalf of, an employee except:


(1) Payments as rewards for service the amount of which is not measured by or dependent on hours of work, production, or efficiency (e.g., a cash award for a suggestion made by an employee and adopted by an agency);


(2) Reimbursements for travel expenses, or other similar expenses, incurred by an employee in furtherance of an agency's interest, which are not related to hours of work;


(3) Payments made in recognition of services performed during a given period, if both the fact that payment is to be made and the amount of the payment are determined at the sole discretion of the agency (*i.e.,* discretionary cash awards or bonuses);


(4) Contributions by an agency to a fund for retirement, insurance, or similar benefits;


(5) Extra compensation provided by a premium rate paid for hours of work performed by an employee in excess of eight in a day, or in excess of the normal workweek applicable to the employee;


(6) Extra compensation provided by a premium rate paid for hours of work performed by an employee on a Sunday or a holiday where such premium rate is at least one and one-half times the employee's rate of pay for work performed in nonovertime hours on other days; or


(7) Extra compensation provided by a premium rate paid for hours of work performed by an employee outside his or her regular working hours, where such premium rate is at least one and one-half times the employee's rate of pay for work performed in nonovertime hours.
