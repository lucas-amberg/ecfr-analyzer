# § 575.308   Approval criteria and written determination.

(a) An agency in its sole and exclusive discretion, subject only to OPM review and oversight, may approve a retention incentive for an individual employee or group or category of employees using the approval criteria in § 575.306.


(b) For each determination to pay a retention incentive under this subpart, an agency must document in writing—


(1) The basis for determining that the unusually high or unique qualifications of the employee (or group of employees) or a special need of the agency for the employee's (or group of employees') services makes it essential to retain the employee(s);


(2) The basis for determining that the employee (or a significant number of employees in a group) would be likely to leave the Federal service in the absence of a retention incentive; and


(3) The basis for establishing the amount and timing of the approved retention incentive payment and the length of the required service period.
