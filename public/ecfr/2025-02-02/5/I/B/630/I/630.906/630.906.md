# § 630.906   Transfer of annual leave.

(a) An employee may submit a voluntary written request to his or her own employing agency that a specified number of hours of his or her accrued annual leave be transferred from his or her annual leave account to the annual leave account of a specified leave recipient. Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, annual leave may be transferred only to a leave recipient employed by the leave donor's employing agency.


(b) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section and subject to the limitations on the amount of annual leave that may be donated by a leave donor under § 630.908, all or any portion of the annual leave requested under paragraph (a) of this section may be transferred to the annual leave account of the specified leave recipient under procedures established by the leave recipient's employing agency.


(c) An agency having employees who earn and use annual leave on the basis of an uncommon tour of duty shall establish procedures for administering the transfer of annual leave to or from such employees under this subpart.


(d) A leave recipient's employing agency shall not transfer annual leave to a leave donor's immediate supervisor.


(e) Annual leave transferred under this section may be substituted retroactively for period of leave without pay (LWOP) or used to liquidate an indebtedness for advanced annual or sick leave granted on or after a date fixed by the leave recipient's employing agency as the beginning of the period of medical emergency for which LWOP or advanced annual or sick leave was granted.


(f) A leave recipient's employing agency shall accept the transfer of annual leave from leave donors employed by one or more other agencies when—


(1) A family member of a leave recipient is employed by another agency and requests the transfer of annual leave to the leave recipient;


(2) In the judgment of the leave recipient's employing agency, the amount of annual leave transferred from leave donors employed by the leave recipient's employing agency may not be sufficient to meet the needs of the leave recipient; or 


(3) In the judgment of the leave recipient's employing agency, acceptance of leave transferred from another agency would further the purpose of the voluntary leave transfer program.


(g) The employing agency of a leave donor who wishes to donate annual leave to a leave recipient in another agency shall verify the availability of annual leave in the leave donor's annual leave account, determine that the amount of annual leave to be donated does not exceed the limitations in § 630.908, and ascertain that the leave recipient's employing agency has made any determination that may be required under paragraph (f) of this section. Upon satisfying these requirements, the leave donor's employing agency shall—


(1) Reduce the amount of annual leave credited to the leave donor's annual leave account, as appropriate; and


(2) Notify the leave recipient's employing agency in writing of the amount of annual leave to be credited to the leave recipient's annual leave account.
