# § 630.1503   Authority and requirements for investigative leave and notice leave.

(a) *Authority.* An agency may, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, and in its discretion, place an employee on—


(1) Investigative leave, if the employee is the subject of an investigation; or


(2) Notice leave—


(i) If the employee is in a notice period; or


(ii) Following a placement on investigative leave if, not later than the day after the last day of the period of investigative leave—


(A) The agency proposes or initiates an adverse action against the employee; and


(B) The agency determines that the employee continues to meet one or more of the criteria described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(b) *Required determinations.* An agency may place an employee on investigative leave or notice leave only if the agency has made a written determination documenting that the agency has—


(1) Determined, after consideration of the baseline factors specified in paragraph (e) of this section, that the continued presence of the employee in the workplace during an investigation of the employee or while the employee is in a notice period, as applicable, may—


(i) Pose a threat to the employee or others;


(ii) Result in the destruction of evidence relevant to an investigation;


(iii) Result in loss of or damage to Government property; or


(iv) Otherwise jeopardize legitimate Government interests; and


(2) Considered the following options (or a combination thereof):


(i) Keeping the employee in a duty status by assigning the employee to duties in which the employee no longer poses a threat, as described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section;


(ii) Allowing the employee to voluntarily take leave (paid or unpaid) or paid time off, as appropriate under the rules governing each category of leave or paid time off;


(iii) Carrying the employee in absent without leave status, if the employee is absent from duty without approval; and


(iv) For an employee subject to a notice period, curtailing the notice period if there is reasonable cause to believe the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed, consistent with 5 CFR 752.404(d)(1); and


(3) Determined that none of the options under paragraph (b)(2) of this section is appropriate.


(c) *Telework alternative for investigative leave.* (1) If an agency would otherwise place an employee on investigative leave, the agency may require the employee to perform, at a telework site, duties similar to the duties that the employee normally performs if—


(i) The agency determines that such a requirement, at a telework site, would not pose a threat, as described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section;


(ii) The employee is eligible to telework; as set forth in paragraph (c)(2);


(iii) The employee has been participating in a telework program under the agency telework policy during some portion of the 30-day period immediately preceding the commencement of investigative leave (or the commencement of required telework in lieu of such leave under paragraph (c) of this section, if earlier); and


(iv) The agency determines that teleworking would be appropriate.


(2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, an employee is considered to be eligible to telework if the agency determines the employee is eligible to telework under agency telework policies described in 5 U.S.C. 6502(a) and is not barred from teleworking under the eligibility conditions described in 5 U.S.C. 6502(b)(4). Any telework agreement established under 5 U.S.C. 6502(b)(2) must be superseded as necessary to comply with an agency's action to require telework under 5 U.S.C. 6502(c) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section.


(3) If an employee who is required to telework under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is absent from telework duty without the required approval, an agency may place the employee in absent without leave status, consistent with agency policies.


(4) The agency decision to require telework under this paragraph (c), as well as the supporting agency determinations and any conditions or requirements governing the required telework (*e.g.,* the telework assignment's duration or location), are to be put into effect at the agency's discretion, subject to the requirements of this paragraph (c).


(5) If an agency requires telework in lieu of placement on investigative leave, the agency must provide the employee with a written explanation regarding the required telework in lieu of placement on investigative leave. The written explanation must include the following:


(i) The agency's determination under paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and,


(ii) A description of the limitations of the required telework, including the expected duration of telework.


(d) *Reassessment and return to duty.* (1) An employee may be returned to duty at any time if the agency reassesses its determination to place the employee on investigative leave or notice leave. An employee on investigative leave or notice leave must be prepared to report promptly to work as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. These decisions are at the discretion of the agency.


(2) For an employee on investigative leave, an agency may reassess its determination that the employee must be removed from the workplace based on the criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and may reassess its determination that the options in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are not appropriate. An agency may reassess its previous determination to require or not require telework under paragraph (c) of this section. These decisions are at the discretion of the agency.


(3) For an employee on notice leave, an agency may reassess its determination that the employee must be removed from the regular worksite based on the criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and may reassess its determination that the options in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are not appropriate. These decisions are at the discretion of the agency.


(4) When an employee is placed on investigative leave or notice leave, the employee must be available to report promptly at a time during the employee's regularly scheduled tour of duty and to an approved duty location, if directed by the employee's agency. Any failure to so report may result in the employee being recorded as absent without leave, which can be the basis for disciplinary action. An employee who anticipates being unavailable to report promptly must request leave or paid time off in advance, as provided under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, to avoid being recorded as absent without leave.


(e) *Baseline factors.* In making a determination regarding the criteria listed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an agency must consider the following baseline factors:


(1) The nature and severity of the employee's exhibited or alleged behavior;


(2) The nature of the agency's or employee's work and the ability of the agency to accomplish its mission; and


(3) Other impacts of the employee's continued presence in the workplace detrimental to legitimate Government interests, including whether the employee poses an unacceptable risk to—


(i) The life, safety, or health of employees, contractors, vendors or visitors to a Federal facility;


(ii) The Government's physical assets or information systems;


(iii) Personal property;


(iv) Records, including classified, privileged, proprietary, financial or medical records; or


(v) The privacy of the individuals whose data the Government holds in its systems.


(f) *Minimum charge.* An agency must use the same minimum charge increments for investigative leave and notice leave as it does for annual and sick leave under § 630.206.


(g) *Tour of duty.* Employees may be granted investigative leave or notice leave only for hours within the tour of duty established for purposes of charging annual and sick leave when absent. For full-time employees, that tour is the 40-hour basic workweek as defined in 5 CFR 610.102, the basic work requirement established for employees on a flexible or compressed work schedule as defined in 5 U.S.C. 6121(3), or an uncommon tour of duty under § 630.210.
