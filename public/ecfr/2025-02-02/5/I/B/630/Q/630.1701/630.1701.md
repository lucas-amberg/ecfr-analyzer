(b) *Applicability.* (1) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b), this subpart applies to employees to whom subpart L of this part applies, as provided in § 630.1201(b).


(2) An agency head authorized to issue regulations on family and medical leave under 5 U.S.C. chapter 63, subchapter V, as provided in § 630.1201(b)(3), is authorized to issue any necessary supplemental regulations on paid parental leave, providing those supplemental regulations are consistent with the regulations in this subpart.


(3) This subpart applies to a birth or placement occurring on or after October 1, 2020. Paid parental leave may not be provided under this subpart for any period of time before October 1, 2020.


(c) *Agency responsibilities.* The head of an agency having employees covered by this subpart is responsible for the proper administration of this subpart, including the responsibility of informing employees of their entitlements and obligations.
