# § 831.603   Definitions.

As used in this subpart—


*CSRS* means subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code.


*Current spouse* means a living person who is married to the employee, Member, or retiree at the time of the employee's, Member's, or retiree's death.


*Current spouse annuity* means a recurring benefit under CSRS that is payable (after the employee's, Member's, or retiree's death) to a current spouse who meets the requirements of § 831.642.


*Deposit* means a deposit required by the Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98-615, 98 Stat. 3195. *Deposit,* as used in this subpart does not include a service credit deposit or redeposit under sections 8334(c) or (d) of title 5, United States Code.


*First regular monthly payment* means the first annuity check payable on a recurring basis (other than an estimated payment or an adjustment check) after OPM has initially adjudicated the regular rate of annuity payable under CSRS and has paid the annuity accrued since the time of retirement. The “first regular monthly payment” is generally preceded by estimated payments before the claim can be adjudicated and by an adjustment check (including the difference between the estimated rate and the initially adjudicated rate).


*Former spouse* means a living person who was married for at least 9 months to an employee, Member, or retiree who performed at least 18 months of creditable service in a position covered by CSRS and whose marriage to the employee was terminated prior to the death of the employee, Member, or retiree. Except in §§ 831.682 and 831.683, *former spouse* includes only persons who were married to an employee or Member on or after May 7, 1985, or who were the spouse of a retiree who retired on or after May 7, 1985, regardless of the date of termination of the marriage. 


*Former spouse annuity* means a recurring benefit under CSRS that is payable to a former spouse after the employee's, Member's, or retiree's death.


*Fully reduced annuity* means the recurring payments under CSRS received by a retiree who has elected the maximum allowable reduction in annuity to provide a current spouse annuity and/or a former spouse annuity or annuities.


*Insurable interest annuity* means the recurring payments under CSRS to a retiree who has elected a reduction in annuity to provide a survivor annuity to a person with an insurable interest in the retiree.


*Marriage* means a marriage recognized in law or equity under the whole law of the jurisdiction with the most significant interest in the marital status of the employee, Member, or retiree unless the law of that jurisdiction is contrary to the public policy of the United States. If a jurisdiction would recognize more than one marriage in law or equity, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will recognize only one marriage, but will defer to the local courts to determine which marriage should be recognized.


*Member* means a Member of Congress.


*Net annuity* means the net annuity as defined in § 838.103 of this chapter.


*Partially reduced annuity* means the recurring payments under CSRS to a retiree who has elected less than the maximum allowable reduction in annuity to provide a current spouse annuity or a former spouse annuity.


*Present value factor* means the amount of money (earning interest at an assumed rate) required at the time of annuity commencement to fund an annuity that starts at the rate of $1 a month and is payable in monthly installments for the annuitant's lifetime based on mortality rates for annuitants paid from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund; and increases each year at an assumed rate of cost of living adjustment. Assumed rates of interest, mortality, and cost-of-living adjustments used in computing the present value are those used by the Board of Actuaries of the Civil Service Retirement System for valuation of the System based on dynamic assumptions. The present value factors are unisex factors obtained as a composite of sex-distinct present value factors.


*Qualifying court order* means a court order that awards a former spouse annuity and that satisfies the requirements of section 8341(h) of title 5, United States Code, for awarding a former spouse annuity.

*Time of retirement* means the effective commencing date for a retired employee's or Member's annuity.
