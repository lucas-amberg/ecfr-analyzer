# § 835.605   OPM action as a result of consideration of evidence submitted as a result of the notice of intent.

(a) *Consideration of evidence.* If, as a result of the Notice of Intent, OPM receives notice that the debtor will submit additional evidence or receives additional evidence from the debtor within the prescribed time period, any notice to the IRS will be stayed until OPM can—


(1) Consider the evidence presented by the debtor; and


(2) Determine whether or not all or a portion of the debt is still past due and legally enforceable; and


(3) Notify the debtor of its determination.


(b) *Notification to the debtor.* Following review of the evidence, OPM will issue a written decision notifying the debtor whether OPM has sustained, amended, or canceled its determination that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable. The notice will advise the debtor of any further action to be taken and explain the supporting rationale for the decision.


(c) *OPM action on the debt.* (1) OPM will notify the debtor of its intent to refer the debt to the IRS for offset against the debtor's Federal income tax refund, if it sustains its decision that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable. OPM will also notify the debtor whether the amount of the debt remains the same or is modified.


(2) OPM will not refer the debt to the IRS for offset against the debtor's Federal income tax refund, if it reverses its decision that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable.
