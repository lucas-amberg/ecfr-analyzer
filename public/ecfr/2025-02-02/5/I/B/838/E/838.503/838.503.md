# § 838.503   Providing for payment to the former spouse.

(a) A court order directed at a refund of employee contributions is not a court order acceptable for processing unless it provides for OPM to pay a portion of a refund of employee contributions to the former spouse as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) To provide for OPM to pay a portion of a refund of employee contributions to the former spouse as required by paragraph (a) of this section, the court order must—


(1) Expressly direct OPM to pay the former spouse directly;


(2) Direct the employee or separated employee to arrange or to execute forms for OPM to pay the former spouse directly; or


(3) Be silent concerning who is to pay the portion of the refund of employee contributions awarded to the former spouse.


(c) Although paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section provide acceptable methods for satisfying the requirement that the court order provide for OPM to pay the former spouse, OPM strongly recommends that the court order expressly direct OPM to pay the former spouse directly.
