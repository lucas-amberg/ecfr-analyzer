# ยง 839.212   May I make a retirement coverage election if I received a refund of my retirement deductions after I was corrected to FERS?

If your qualifying retirement coverage error was previously corrected to FERS and you then received a refund of your FERS retirement deductions, you are not allowed to elect retirement plan coverage under the FERCCA.
