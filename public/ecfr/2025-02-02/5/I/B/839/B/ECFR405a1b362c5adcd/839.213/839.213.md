# ยง 839.213   May I make a retirement coverage election if I withdrew all or part of my TSP account after I was corrected to FERS?

(a) You may not make a retirement coverage election if your qualifying retirement coverage error was previously corrected to FERS, and you later received one of the following TSP withdrawals: 


(1) A TSP annuity after separation from service, but before receiving a FERS annuity; or 


(2) A single payment or monthly payments after separation from service; or 


(3) An age-based in-service withdrawal. 


(b) If you received an automatic cashout of your TSP account after you separated (because your account balance was $3,500 or less), or if you received a financial hardship in-service withdrawal, you may make a retirement coverage election.
