# ยง 839.215   May I make a retirement coverage election under the FERCCA if I received a payment as settlement of my claim for losses because of a qualifying retirement coverage error?

You can make a retirement coverage election under the FERCCA if OPM waives repayment of the entire amount under ยง 839.1202. If OPM does not waive the entire repayment, you must pay back the amount that OPM did not waive.
