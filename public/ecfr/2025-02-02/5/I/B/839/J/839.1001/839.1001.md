# ยง 839.1001   Does the FERCCA allow me to increase my TSP account if I was in CSRS during my qualifying retirement coverage error and my correct coverage will be FERS?

The Board's error correction regulations (5 CFR 1605 of chapter VI) generally allow you to increase your TSP account through a schedule of make-up contributions to replace the missed employee contributions. In addition, the FERCCA allows certain employees who have completed a schedule of make-up contributions, or who plan to schedule make-up contributions, to receive lost earnings on those contributions under certain circumstances. Employees are (and have been) entitled to lost earnings on the make-up agency contributions they receive as a result of the correction of an agency error.
