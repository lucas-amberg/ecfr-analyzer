(a) An annuitant may decline to accept all or any part of the amount of his or her annuity by a waiver signed and filed with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).


(b) A waiver is effective the first day of the month following the month in which it is received in OPM, unless a later effective date is specified by the annuitant.


(c) A waiver remains in effect until revoked or changed by the annuitant in writing, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section. The effective date of a revocation or change will be the first day of the month following the month in which the request to revoke or change is received in OPM, unless a later date is specified by the annuitant.

(f) Upon the death of an annuitant with a waiver in effect, any survivor annuity payable will be authorized at the full rate of annuity as though the waiver had not been in effect, unless the survivor annuitant executes a waiver.
