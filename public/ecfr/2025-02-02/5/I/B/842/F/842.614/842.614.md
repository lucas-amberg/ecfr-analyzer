# § 842.614   Computation of partial annuity reduction.

If a court order or the death of a current or former spouse results in providing less than the maximum permitted survivor reduction under § 842.613, the reduction in the employee's annuity will be 10 percent of the amount of the employee's annuity on which the survivor benefits will be computed (called the “base”).
