# ยง 842.808   Oversight of coverage determinations.

(a) Upon deciding that a position is a law enforcement officer or firefighter position, each agency head must notify OPM (Attention: Associate Director for Retirement and Insurance) stating the title of each position, the number of incumbents, whether the position is rigorous or secondary, and, if the position is rigorous, the established maximum entry age (or if no maximum entry age has yet been established, the date by which it will be established). The Director of OPM retains the authority to overrule an agency head's determination that a position is a rigorous or secondary position, except such a determination under 5 U.S.C. 8401(17)(B) (concerning certain employees in the Departments of the Interior and the Treasury) or under 5 U.S.C. 8401(17)(D) (concerning certain positions primarily involved in detention activities).


(b) Each agency must establish a file containing all coverage determinations made by an agency head under ยง 842.803, and all background material used in making the determination. 


(c) Upon request by OPM, the agency will make available the entire coverage determination file for OPM to audit to ensure compliance with the provisions of this subpart. 


(d) Upon request by OPM, an agency must submit to OPM a list of all covered positions and any other pertinent information requested. For rigorous positions, the list must show the specific entry age requirement and physical qualification requirements for each position.
