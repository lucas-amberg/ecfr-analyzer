# § 843.305   Reinstatement.

(a) If a current spouse annuity is terminated because of a remarriage of the recipient, the annuity is reinstated on the day of the termination of the remarriage by death, annulment, or divorce if— 


(1) The surviving spouse elects to receive this annuity instead of another survivor benefit to which he or she may be entitled (under FERS or another retirement system for Government employees) by reason of the remarriage; and 


(2) Any lump sum paid on termination of the annuity is repaid (in a single payment or by withholding payment of the annuity until the amount of the lump sum has accrued). 


(b) If present or future entitlement to a former spouse annuity terminates because of remarriage of the recipient or potential recipient, the entitlement is permanently extinguished. An annulment of the remarriage does not reinstate the entitlement.
