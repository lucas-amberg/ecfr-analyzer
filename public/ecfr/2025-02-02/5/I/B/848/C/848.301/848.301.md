(ii) Obtain the signed written approval of an authorized agency official for the request.


(3) An employee may cancel an approved election to end phased retirement status to return to regular employment status by submitting a signed written request to the agency and obtaining the approval of an authorized agency official before the effective date of return to regular employment status.


(4) The employing agency must notify OPM that the employee's phased retirement status has ended by submitting to OPM a copy of the completed election to end phased retirement status to return to regular employment status within 15 days of its approval.


(b) *Mandated return to regular employment status.* A phased retiree may be returned to regular employment status as provided under § 848.205(j)(6).


(c) *Bar on reelection of phased retirement.* Once an election to end phased retirement status to return to regular employment status is effective, the employee may not reelect phased retirement status.
