# § 870.503   Basic insurance: Cancelling a waiver.

(a) An annuitant or compensationer who has filed a waiver of Basic insurance cannot cancel the waiver.


(b) An employee who has filed a waiver of Basic insurance may cancel the waiver and become insured if:


(1) The employee makes an election during an open enrollment period as described in § 870.507;


(2) At least 1 year has passed since the effective date of the waiver, and the employee provides satisfactory medical evidence of insurability; or


(3) The employee has a change in family circumstances (marriage or divorce, a spouse's death, or acquisition of an eligible child) and files an election as provided in paragraph (b)(3(i), (b)(3)(ii), or (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii), the effective date of Basic insurance elected under this paragraph (b)(3) is the 1st day the employee actually enters on duty in a pay status on or after the day the employing office receives the election.


(i) An employee must file an election under this paragraph with the employing office, in a manner designated by OPM, along with proof of the event, no later than 60 calendar days following the date of the change in family circumstances that permits the election; the employee may also file the election before the event and provide proof no later than 60 calendar days following the event.


(ii) An employee making an election under this paragraph based on acquisition of an eligible foster child must file the election with the employing office no later than 60 calendar days after completing the required certification.


(iii) Within 6 months after an employee becomes eligible to make an election of Basic insurance due to a change in family circumstances, an employing office may determine that the employee was unable, for reasons beyond his or her control, to elect Basic insurance within the time limit. In this case, the employee must elect Basic insurance within 60 calendar days after he or she is notified of the determination. The insurance is retroactive to the 1st day of the first pay period beginning after the date the individual became eligible, if the employee was in pay and duty status that day. If the employee was not in pay and duty status that day, the coverage becomes effective the 1st day after the date the employee returned to pay and duty status. The individual must pay the full cost of the Basic insurance from that date for the time that he or she is in pay status.


(c) OFEGLI reviews the employee's request and determines whether the employee complied with paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If the employee complied, then OFEGLI approves the Request for Insurance. The Basic insurance is effective on the date of OFEGLI's approval if the employee is in pay and duty status on that date. If the employee is not in pay and duty status on the date of OFEGLI's approval, the Basic insurance is effective the first day the employee returns to pay and duty status, as long as it is within 60 calendar days after OFEGLI's approval. If the employee is not in pay and duty status within 60 calendar days after OFEGLI's approval, the approval is revoked automatically.


(d) When an employee who has been separated from service for at least 180 days is reinstated on or after April 1, 1981, a previous waiver of Basic insurance is automatically cancelled. Unless the employee files a new waiver, Basic insurance becomes effective on the 1st day he or she actually enters on duty in pay status in a position in which he or she is eligible for coverage. *Exception:* For employees who waived Basic insurance after February 28, 1981, separated, and returned to Federal service before December 9, 1983, the waiver remained in effect; these employees were permitted to elect Basic insurance by applying to their employing office before March 7, 1984.


(e)(1) An employee of the Department of Defense who is designated as an “emergency essential employee” under section 1580 of title 10, United States Code, may cancel a waiver of Basic insurance without providing satisfactory medical information.


(2) An election of Basic insurance under paragraph (e)(1) of this section must be made within 60 days of being designated “emergency essential.” Basic insurance is effective on the date the employing office receives the election, if the employee is in pay and duty status on that date. If the employee is not in pay and duty status on the day the employing office receives the election, the coverage becomes effective on the date the employee returns to pay and duty status.


(f)(1) A civilian employee who is eligible for Basic insurance coverage and is deployed in support of a contingency operation as defined by section 101(a)(13) of title 10, United States Code, may cancel a waiver of Basic Insurance without providing satisfactory medical information.


(2) An election of Basic insurance under paragraph (f)(1) of this section must be made within 60 days after the date of notification of deployment in support of a contingency operation. Basic insurance is effective on the date the employing office receives the election, if the employee is in pay and duty status on that date. If the employee is not in pay and duty status on the day the employing office receives the election, the coverage becomes effective on the date the employee returns to pay and duty status.
