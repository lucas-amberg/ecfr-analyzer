# ยง 875.202   Am I eligible as a Federal annuitant?

If you are a Federal annuitant, including a survivor annuitant, a deferred annuitant, or a compensationer, you are eligible to apply for coverage. Separated Federal employees with title to a deferred annuity may apply for coverage, even if they are not yet receiving that annuity.
