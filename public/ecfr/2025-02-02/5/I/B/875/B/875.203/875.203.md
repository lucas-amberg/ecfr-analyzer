# ยง 875.203   Am I eligible if I separated under the FERS MRA+10 provision?

If you have separated from service under the FERS Minimum Retirement Age and 10 years of service (MRA+10) provision of 5 U.S.C. 8412(g), and have postponed receiving an annuity under that provision, you are eligible to apply for coverage as an annuitant under this part.
