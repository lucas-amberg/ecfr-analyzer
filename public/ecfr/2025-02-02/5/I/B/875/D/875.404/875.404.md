(a)(1) The effective dates of coverage under special application period enrollments will be announced in a document published in the _Federal Register_ that announces special application period dates.


(2) If you are an active workforce member or the spouse of an active workforce member and you are applying for coverage during a special application period, the workforce member must be actively at work at least 1 day during the calendar week immediately before the week which contains your coverage effective date for your coverage to become effective. You must inform the Carrier if you do not meet this requirement. In the event you do not meet this requirement, the Carrier will issue you a revised effective date, which will be the 1st day of the next month. The workforce member also must meet the actively at work requirement for any revised effective date for coverage to become effective, or you will be issued another revised effective date in the same manner.


(b) If you enroll at any time outside of a special application period, your coverage effective date is the 1st day of the month after the date your application is approved.
