(f) A suit to compel enrollment or for equitable relief from an adverse enrollment action founded on 5 U.S.C. chapter 89 that is based on information received by OPM pursuant to an agreement with a source agency as defined at ยง 890.1602, to determine whether Postal Service annuitants or family members of such annuitants satisfy the enrollment requirements set forth in 5 U.S.C. 8903c, may not be brought later than December 31 of the 3rd year after the year in which the enrollment action was effectuated, and will be limited to the record that was before OPM when it effectuated the enrollment action.
