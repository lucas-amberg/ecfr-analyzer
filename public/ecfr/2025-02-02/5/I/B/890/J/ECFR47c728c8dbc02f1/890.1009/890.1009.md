If a timely contest is not filed, the proposed debarment shall become effective as stated in the notice, without further action by OPM. 


(b) *Requesting a reduction of the debarment period.* If OPM proposes a mandatory debarment for a period longer than the 3-year minimum required by 5 U.S.C. 8902a(g)(3), the provider may request a reduction of the debarment period to not less than 3 years, without contesting the debarment itself. 


(c) *Personal appearance before the debarring official.* In addition to providing written material, the provider may appear before the debarring official personally or through a representative to present oral arguments in support of his contest. OPM's notice shall contain specific information about arranging an in-person presentation.
