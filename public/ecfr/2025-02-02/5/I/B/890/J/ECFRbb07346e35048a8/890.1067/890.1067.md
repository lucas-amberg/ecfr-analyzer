# § 890.1067   Provider contests of proposed penalties and assessments.

(a) *Contesting proposed sanctions.* A provider may formally contest the proposed penalties and assessments by sending a written notice to the debarring official within 30 days after receiving the notice described in § 890.1066. The debarring official must apply the administrative procedures set forth in §§ 890.1069 and 890.1070 to decide the contest.


(b) *Contesting debarments and financial sanctions concurrently.* If OPM proposes debarment and penalties and assessments in the same notice, the provider may contest both the debarment and the financial sanctions in the same proceeding. If the provider pursues a combined contest, the requirements set forth in §§ 890.1022 through 890.1024, as well as this section, apply.


(c) *Settling or compromising proposed sanctions.* The debarring official may settle or compromise proposed sanctions at any time before issuing a final decision under § 890.1070.
