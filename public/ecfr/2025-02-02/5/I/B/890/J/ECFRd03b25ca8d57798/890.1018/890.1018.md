OPM shall determine the length of debarments of entities under 5 U.S.C. 8902a(c)(2) based on the type of violation committed by the person with an ownership or control interest. The types of violations actionable under this provision are:

(c) *Owner/controller's civil monetary penalty.* The debarment of an entity based on a civil monetary penalty imposed on a person with an ownership or control interest, shall be for a period of not less than 3 years, subject to adjustment for any aggravating or mitigating circumstances set forth in ยง 890.1016 applying solely to the entity.
