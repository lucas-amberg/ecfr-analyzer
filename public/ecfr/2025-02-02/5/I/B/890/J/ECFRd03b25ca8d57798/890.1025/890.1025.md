In each contest, the debarring official shall determine whether a further fact-finding proceeding is required in addition to presentation of arguments, documents, and information. An additional fact-finding proceeding is not required when: 


(a) *Prior adjudication.* The proposed debarment is based on facts determined in a prior due process adjudication. Examples of prior due process proceedings include, but are not limited to, the adjudication procedures associated with: 


(1) Licensure revocation, suspension, restriction, or nonrenewal by a State licensing authority; 


(2) Debarment, exclusion, suspension, civil monetary penalties, or similar legal or administrative adjudications by Federal, State, or local agencies; 


(3) A criminal conviction or civil judgment; or 


(4) An action by a provider that constitutes a waiver of his right to a due process adjudication, such as surrender of professional license during the pendency of a disciplinary hearing, entering a guilty plea or confession of judgment in a judicial proceeding, or signing a settlement agreement stipulating facts that constitute a sanctionable violation. 


(b) *Material facts not in dispute.* The provider's contest does not identify a bona fide dispute concerning facts material to the basis for the proposed debarment.
