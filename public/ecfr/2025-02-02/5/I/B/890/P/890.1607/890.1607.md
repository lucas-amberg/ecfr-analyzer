(a) *Who may file.* An individual may request the employing agency or OPM, as applicable, to reconsider the employing office's or OPM's initial decision denying eligibility for, or enrollment in, or coverage under, the PSHB Program. Individuals subject to § 890.1112 are not entitled to reconsideration as used in this subpart.


(b) *Initial decision.* An employing office's or OPM's initial decision must be in writing and state the right to an independent level of review (reconsideration).

(i) Verification that an individual is an eligible member of family under § 890.302;


(ii) Postal Service annuitants or their family members who are not required to enroll in VA's system of patient enrollment referred to in 38 U.S.C. 1705(a), and who must provide documentation from the VA under § 890.1604(d)(2) indicating they satisfy the requirements for an exception described in § 890.1604(c)(1)(iv) or (c)(2)(iii); and

(3) OPM is responsible for initial decisions regarding enrollment actions made based on information received from source agencies with which OPM has an information sharing agreement established pursuant to § 890.1612.
