# ยง 894.406   What happens if my uniformed services pay or uniformed services retirement pay is insufficient to cover my FEDVIP premiums, or I go into a nonpay status?

(a) You must contact the *Administrator* to arrange to pay your premiums by direct premium payment or automatic bank withdrawal to the *Administrator.*

(b) If you do not make the premium payments, your FEDVIP coverage will stop. You will not be able to reenroll until the next open season after:


(1) You are in pay status; or


(2) Your uniformed services pay or uniformed services retirement pay (retired, retainer, or equivalent) is sufficient to make the premium payment.


(c) If you are a FEDVIP *enrollee* who is furloughed or excepted from furlough and working without pay due to such a lapse, your coverage will not stop during such a lapse. Upon the end of such a lapse, premiums will be paid to the Carrier using back pay.
