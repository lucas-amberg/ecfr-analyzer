(a) Your FEDVIP coverage continues if you retire on an immediate annuity or on a disability annuity, or start receiving *compensation* from OWCP.


(b) If you retire on a Minimum Retirement Age +10 annuity that you elect to postpone in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8412(g), your FEDVIP coverage will stop when you separate from service. However, you may enroll again within 60 *days* of when your annuity starts.


(c) If you retire on a deferred annuity in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8413, your FEDVIP coverage stops and you are not eligible to enroll.
