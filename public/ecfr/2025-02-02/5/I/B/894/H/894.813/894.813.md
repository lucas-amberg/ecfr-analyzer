# ยง 894.813   I am a TEI former spouse. Am I eligible to enroll in a FEDVIP vision plan?

Yes, you are eligible to enroll in a FEDVIP vision plan only. A *TEI former spouse* is not eligible to enroll in a FEDVIP dental plan. You are a *TEI-V,* and you are an *enrollee,* however your *type of enrollment* is limited to self only. You may not enroll a child, even if the child is a *TEI child.* The *TEI child* will have his or her opportunity for FEDVIP dental and/or vision coverage through your ex-spouse *sponsor,* or *TEI certifying family member* as the case may be. It is possible for a minor *TEI child* to be the *TEI certifying family member* eligible to enroll as an *enrollee.* If this is the case, you (or the *TEI child's* legal guardian if not you) may effectuate that enrollment by accepting responsibility on behalf of the *TEI child* to self-certify as *enrollee* by enrolling and, if appropriate, covering other *TEI family members* of the *sponsor.* Accepting responsibility to self-certify as *enrollee* on behalf of the *TEI child* includes consulting all of the *TEI family members of the TEI certifying family member* regarding their preference for coverage under the enrollment, electing an appropriate plan, option and *type of enrollment,* and paying the premium on behalf of the *TEI child* and other *TEI family members* for the enrollment.
