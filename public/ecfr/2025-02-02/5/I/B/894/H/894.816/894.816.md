# ยง 894.816   If I return from active duty and retire, what happens to my TEI family members' enrollment in their FEDVIP vision plan?

As a uniformed services member on active duty, you are the *sponsor* but you are not eligible to enroll in a FEDVIP vision plan and you cannot be the *enrollee.* A *TEI certifying family member* may be the *enrollee* while you are on active duty. Upon your retirement, however, you become eligible to enroll as a *TEI-V* and *TEI-D,* and the current *enrollee* status of your *TEI certifying family member* ends. As *sponsor,* you are responsible for notifying the *Administrator* and your *TEI family members* of your change in status. The *TEI family members'* enrollment will be terminated and as a *TEI-V* and *TEI-D* who is both *sponsor* and *enrollee,* you may enroll yourself and cover *TEI family members. See* ยง 894.601.
