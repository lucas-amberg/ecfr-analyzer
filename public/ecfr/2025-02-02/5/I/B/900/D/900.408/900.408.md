# § 900.408   Procedure for effecting compliance.

(a) *General.* (1) If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this subpart, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this subpart may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance or by other means authorized by law. 


(2) Other means may include, but are not limited to, (i) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce the rights of the United States under a law of the United States (including other titles of the Civil Rights Act of 1964), or an assurance or other contractual undertaking, and (ii) an applicable proceeding under State or local law. 


(b) *Noncompliance with § 900.405.* If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 900.405 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section, Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. OPM shall not be required to provide assistance in that case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under this paragraph. Subject, however, to § 900.412, OPM shall continue assistance during the pendency of the proceedings where the assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application approved prior to the effective date of this subpart. 


(c) *Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance.* An order suspending, terminating, or refusing to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall not become effective until—


(1) OPM has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by informal voluntary means; 


(2) There has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this subpart; 


(3) The action has been approved by the Office of Personnel Management pursuant to § 900.410(e); and 


(4) The expiration of 30 days after the Director, Office of Personnel Management has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for the action. 


(d) *Other means authorized by law.* An action to effect compliance with title VI by other means authorized by law shall not be taken by OPM until—


(1) OPM has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means; 


(2) The recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance; and 


(3) The expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of a notice to the recipient or person. During this period of at least 10 days, additional efforts shall be made to persuade the recipient or other person to comply with the regulation and to take corrective action as may be appropriate.
