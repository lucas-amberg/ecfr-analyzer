# ยง 900.412   Effect on other regulations, forms, and instructions.

(a) *Effect on other regulations.* Regulations, orders, or like directions issued before the effective date of this subpart by OPM which impose requirements designed to prohibit discrimination against individuals on the ground of race, color, or national origin under a program to which this subpart applies, and which authorizes the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance to an applicant for or recipient of assistance under a program for failure to comply with the requirements, are superseded to the extent that discrimination is prohibited by this subpart, except that nothing in this subpart relieves a person of an obligation assumed or imposed under a superseded regulation, order, instruction, or like direction, before the effective date of this subpart. This subpart does not supersede any of the following (including future amendments thereof): (1) Executive Order 11246 (3 CFR, 1965 Supp.) and regulations issued thereunder or (2) any other orders, regulations, or instructions, insofar as these orders, regulations, or instructions prohibit discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in a program or situation to which this subpart is inapplicable, or prohibit discrimination on any other ground. 


(b) *Forms and instructions.* OPM shall issue and promptly make available to all interested persons forms and detailed instructions and procedures for effectuating this subpart as applied to programs to which this subpart applies, and for which it is responsible. 


(c) *Supervision and coordination.* The Director, Office of Personnel Management may from time to time assign to officials of OPM, or to officials of other departments or agencies of the Government with the consent of the departments or agencies, responsibilities in connection with the effectuation of the purposes of title VI and this subpart (other than responsibilities for final decision as provided in ยง 900.410), including the achievement of effective coordination and maximum uniformity within OPM and within the executive branch in the application of title VI and this subpart to similar programs and in similar situations. An action taken, determination made, or requirement imposed by an official of another department or agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility under this paragraph shall have the same effect as though the action had been taken by OPM.
