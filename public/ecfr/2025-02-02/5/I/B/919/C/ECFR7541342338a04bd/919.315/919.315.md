# ยง 919.315   May I use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction?

(a) You as a participant may continue to use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction if you were using the services of that person in the transaction before the person was excluded. However, you are not required to continue using that person's services as a principal. You should make a decision about whether to discontinue that person's services only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate. 


(b) You may not begin to use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction unless the OPM grants an exception under ยง 919.120.
