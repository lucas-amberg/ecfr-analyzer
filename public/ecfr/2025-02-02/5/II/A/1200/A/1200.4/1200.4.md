# § 1200.4   Petition for rulemaking.

(a) Any interested person may petition the MSPB for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule. For purposes of this regulation, a “rule” means a regulation contained in 5 CFR parts 1200 through 1216. Each petition shall:


(1) Be submitted to the Clerk of the Board, 1615 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20419;


(2) Set forth the text or substance of the rule or amendment proposed or specify the rule sought to be repealed;


(3) Explain the petitioner's interest in the action sought; and


(4) Set forth all data and arguments available to the petitioner in support of the action sought.


(b) No public procedures will be held on the petition before its disposition. If the MSPB finds that the petition contains adequate justification, a rulemaking proceeding will be initiated or a final rule will be issued as appropriate under the Administrative Procedure Act. If the Board finds that the petition does not contain adequate justification, the petition will be denied by letter or other notice, with a brief statement of the ground for denial. The Board may consider new evidence at any time; however, repetitious petitions for rulemaking will not be considered.
