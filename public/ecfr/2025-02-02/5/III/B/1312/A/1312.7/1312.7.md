# ยง 1312.7   Derivative classification.

A *derivative classification* means that the information is in substance the same information that is currently classified, usually by another agency or classification authority. The application of derivative classification markings is the responsibility of the person who incorporates, restates, paraphrases, or generates in new form information that is already classified, or one who applies such classification markings in accordance with instructions from an authorized classifier or classification guide. Extreme care must be taken to continue classification and declassification markings when such information is incorporated into OMB documents. The duplication or reproduction of existing classified information is not derivative classification. Persons who use derivative classification need not possess original classification authority.
