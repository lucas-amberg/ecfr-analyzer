# ยง 9001.103   Waivers.

(a) *General.* The DAEO may waive any provision of this part upon finding that the waiver will not result in conduct inconsistent with 5 CFR part 2635 or otherwise prohibited by law, and that application of the provision is not necessary to ensure public confidence in the impartiality and objectivity with which the programs of FHFA are administered. Each waiver shall be in writing and supported by a statement of the facts and findings upon which it is based and may impose appropriate conditions, including but not limited to requiring the employee to execute a written disqualification statement or an agreement not to acquire additional securities.


(b) *Waiver of prohibitions relating to ownership or control of securities.* The DAEO may grant a waiver permitting the employee or the employee's spouse or minor children to own or control, directly or indirectly, any security prohibited under ยง 9001.104, if, in addition to the standards under paragraph (a) of this section:


(1) Extenuating circumstances exist, such as ownership or control of the security was acquired:


(i) Prior to employment with FHFA;


(ii) Through inheritance, gift, merger, acquisition, or other change in corporate structure, or otherwise without specific intent on the part of the employee, or employee's spouse or minor children, to acquire the security; or


(iii) By an employee's spouse or minor children as part of a compensation package in connection with employment or prior to marriage to the employee;


(2) The amount of the prohibited financial interest has a market value of less than the *de minimis* amount set forth in 5 CFR 2640.202(a);


(3) The employee makes a prompt and complete written disclosure of the interest; and


(4) If the employee is required to disqualify himself or herself from certain assignments, the disqualification does not unduly interfere with the full performance of the employee's duties.
