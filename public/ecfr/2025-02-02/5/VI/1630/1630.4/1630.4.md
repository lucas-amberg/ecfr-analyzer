# § 1630.4   Request for notification and access.

(a) Within 20 work days of receiving the request for review, the Executive Director will make a final determination on appeal. A participant or a spouse, former spouse, or beneficiary of a participant must make his or her inquiry in accordance with the chart set forth in this paragraph. The mailing address of the Thrift Savings Plan is provided at *http://www.tsp.gov.* Telephone inquiries are subject to the verification procedures set forth in § 1630.7. A written inquiry from a participant must include the participant's name and the participant's account number or Social Security number. A written inquiry from a spouse or former spouse or a beneficiary of the participant must include the inquiring party's name and Social Security number or, if available, the case reference number as well as the name and Social Security number or account number of the participant. Other third party inquiries (e.g., from other Federal agencies authorized to obtain information about the participant's account) must include, at a minimum, the participant's name and Social Security number.


(2) Participants may also inquire whether this system contains records about them and access certain records through the account access section of the TSP website and the ThriftLine (the TSP's automated telephone system). The TSP website is *www.tsp.gov.* To use the TSP ThriftLine, the participant must have a touch-tone telephone and call (877) 968-3778. Information such as account balance and transaction status is available on the TSP website and the ThriftLine. To access these features, the participant may be required to verify his or her identity by providing identifying particulars.


(3) A Privacy Act request which is incorrectly submitted to the Board will not be considered received until received by the record keeper. The Board will submit such a Privacy Act request to the record keeper within three workdays. A Privacy Act request which is incorrectly submitted to the record keeper will not be considered received until received by the employing agency. The record keeper will submit such a Privacy Act request to the employing agency within three workdays.


(4) No disclosure history will be made when the Board contracts for an audit of TSP financial statements (which includes the review and sampling of TSP account balances).


(5) No disclosure history will be made when the Department of Labor or the General Accounting Office audits TSP financial statements (which includes the review and sampling of TSP account balances) in accordance with their responsibilities under chapter 84 of title 5 of the U.S. Code. Rather, a requester will be advised that these agencies have statutory obligations to audit TSP activities and that in the course of such audits they randomly sample individual TSP accounts to test for account accuracy.


(b) *Non-TSP Board records.* An individual who wishes to know if a specific system of records maintained by the Board contains a record pertaining to him or her, or who wishes access to such records, shall address a written request to the Privacy Act Officer, Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, 77 K Street, NE., Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20002. The request letter should contain the complete name and identifying number of the pertinent system as published in the annual _Federal Register_ notice describing the Board's Systems of Records; the full name and address of the subject individual; the subject's Social Security number if a Board employee; a brief description of the nature, time, place, and circumstances of the individual's prior association with the Board; and any other information the individual believes would help the Privacy Act Officer determine whether the information about the individual is included in the system of records. In instances where the information is insufficient to ensure disclosure to the subject individual to whom the record pertains, the Board reserves the right to ask the requester for additional identifying information. The words “PRIVACY ACT REQUEST” should be printed on both the letter and the envelope.
