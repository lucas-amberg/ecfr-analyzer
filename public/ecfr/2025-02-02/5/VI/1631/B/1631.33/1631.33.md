(3) The records or testimony can be obtained from other sources;


(4) The Board has an interest in the decision that may be rendered in the legal proceeding;


(5) The demand improperly seeks to compel a Board employee to serve as an expert witness for a private interest;


(6) The demand improperly seeks to compel a Board employee to testify as to a matter of law;


(7) Disclosure would result in the Board appearing to favor one private litigant over another private litigant;


(8) Disclosure relates to documents that were produced by another government agency; and
