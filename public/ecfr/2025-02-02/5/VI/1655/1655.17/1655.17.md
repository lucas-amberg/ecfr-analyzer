# ยง 1655.17   Prepayment.

(a) A participant may repay a loan in full, without a penalty, at any time before the declaration of a deemed distribution or loan foreclosure under ยง 1655.15. Repayment in full means receipt by the TSP record keeper of a payment, by check or guaranteed funds made payable to the Thrift Savings Plan or via loan direct debit repayments, of all principal and interest due on the loan.


(b) If a participant returns a loan check to the TSP record keeper, it will be treated as a repayment; however, additional interest may be owed, which, if not paid, could result in a deemed distribution. The loan, even though repaid, will also be taken into account in determining the maximum amount available for future loans, in accordance with ยง 1655.6(b).


(c) The amount outstanding on a loan can be obtained from the TSP website, the ThriftLine, or by a written request to the TSP record keeper.
