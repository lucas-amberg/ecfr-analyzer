# ยง 9701.341   General.

Sections 9701.342 through 9701.346 describe various types of performance-based pay adjustments that are part of the pay system established under this subpart. Generally, these within-band pay increases are directly linked to an employee's rating of record (as assigned under the performance management system described in subpart D of this part). These provisions are designed to provide DHS with the flexibility to allocate available funds based on performance as a means of fostering a high-performance culture that supports mission accomplishment. While performance measures primarily focus on an employee's contributions (as an individual or as part of a team) in accomplishing work assignments and achieving mission results, performance also may be reflected in the acquisition and demonstration of required competencies.
