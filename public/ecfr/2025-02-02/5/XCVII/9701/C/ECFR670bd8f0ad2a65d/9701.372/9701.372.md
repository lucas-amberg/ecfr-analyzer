# ยง 9701.372   Creating initial pay ranges.

(a) DHS must, after coordination with OPM, set the initial band rate ranges for the DHS pay system established under this subpart. The initial ranges will link to the ranges that apply to converted employees in their previously applicable pay system (taking into account any applicable special rates and locality payments or supplements).


(b) For employees who are law enforcement officers as defined in 5 U.S.C. 5541(3) and who were covered by the GS system immediately before conversion, the initial ranges must provide rates of basic pay that equal or exceed the rates of basic pay these officers received under the GS system (taking into account any applicable special rates and locality payments or supplements).
