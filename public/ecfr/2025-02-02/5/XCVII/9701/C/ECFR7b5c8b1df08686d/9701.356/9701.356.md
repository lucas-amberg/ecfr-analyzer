# ยง 9701.356   Pay retention.

(a) Subject to the requirements of this section, DHS will, after coordination with OPM, issue implementing directives regarding the application of pay retention. Pay retention prevents a reduction in basic pay that would otherwise occur by preserving the former rate of basic pay within the employee's new band or by establishing a retained rate that exceeds the maximum rate of the new band.


(b) Pay retention must be based on the employee's rate of basic pay in effect immediately before the action that would otherwise reduce the employee's rate. A retained rate must be compared to the range of rates of basic pay applicable to the employee's position.


(c) In applying ยง 9701.323 (regarding pay increases provided at the time of a rate range adjustment under ยง 9701.322), any increase in the rate of basic pay for an employee receiving a retained rate is equal to one-half of the percentage value of any increase in the minimum rate of the employee's band.
