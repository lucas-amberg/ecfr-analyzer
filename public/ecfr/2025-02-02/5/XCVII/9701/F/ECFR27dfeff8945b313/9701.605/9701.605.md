# ยง 9701.605   Initial service period.

(a) DHS may establish an initial service period of 1 to 2 years for certain designated occupations in order for employees in such occupations to demonstrate appropriate competencies. DHS will establish standard policies for determining the applicability and the length of the ISP for specific occupations.


(b) Employees must complete an ISP after selection for a designated DHS position in the competitive service before obtaining coverage under this subpart. All relevant prior Federal civilian service (including non-appropriated fund service), as determined by appropriate standards established by DHS, counts toward completion of this requirement.


(c) An employee who is removed during a probationary, trial, or initial service period must be removed in accordance with 5 CFR 315.804 or 315.805, except for a preference eligible employee in the competitive service who has completed the first year of an ISP.
