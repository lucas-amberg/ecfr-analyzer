Unless otherwise permitted by law, an employee of CIGIE shall:


(a) Collect from individuals only the information that is relevant and necessary to discharge the responsibilities of CIGIE;


(b) Collect information about an individual directly from that individual whenever practicable when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs;


(c) Inform each individual from whom information is collected of:


(1) The legal authority to collect the information and whether providing it is mandatory or voluntary;


(2) The principal purpose for which CIGIE intends to use the information;


(3) The routine uses CIGIE may make of the information; and


(4) The effects on the individual, if any, of not providing the information;


(d) Maintain no system of records without public notice and notify appropriate CIGIE officials of the existence or development of any system of records that is not the subject of a current or planned public notice;


(e) Maintain all records that are used by CIGIE in making any determination about an individual with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to ensure fairness to the individual in the determination;


(f) Except as to disclosures made to an agency or made under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552 (FOIA), make reasonable efforts, prior to disseminating any record about an individual, to ensure that the record is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete;


(g) Maintain no record describing how an individual exercises his or her First Amendment rights, unless it is expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained, or is pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity;


(h) When required by the Privacy Act, maintain an accounting in the specified form of all disclosures of records by CIGIE to persons, organizations, or agencies;


(i) Maintain and use records with care to prevent the unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure of a record to anyone. No record contained in a CIGIE system of records shall be disclosed to another person, or to another agency outside CIGIE, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains, unless the disclosure is otherwise authorized by the Privacy Act; and


(j) Notify the appropriate CIGIE official of any record that contains information that the Privacy Act does not permit CIGIE to maintain.
