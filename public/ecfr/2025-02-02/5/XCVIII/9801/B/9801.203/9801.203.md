# ยง 9801.203   Granting access.

(a) *Means of access.* (1) The methods for allowing access to records, when such access has been granted by CIGIE, are:


(i) Examination in person in a designated office during the hours specified by CIGIE; or


(ii) Providing copies of the records.


(2) When a requester has not indicated whether he wants a copy of the record or wants to examine the record in person, CIGIE may choose the means of granting access. However, the means chosen should not unduly impede the requester's right of access. A requester may elect to receive a copy of the records after having examined them.


(b) *Accompanying individual.* If the requester is granted in person access to examine the records, the requester may be accompanied by another individual of the requester's choice during the course of the examination of the records. CIGIE may require the requester to submit a signed statement authorizing the accompanying individual's access to the records.


(c) *Certified copies.* CIGIE will not furnish certified copies of records. When copies are to be furnished, they may be provided as determined by CIGIE.


(d) *Original records.* When the requester seeks to obtain original documentation, CIGIE reserves the right to limit the request to copies of the original records.
