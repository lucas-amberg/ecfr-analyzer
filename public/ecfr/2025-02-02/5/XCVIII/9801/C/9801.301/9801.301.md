# § 9801.301   Requests for amendment of record.

(a) *How addressed.* A requester seeking to amend a record or records pertaining to requester in a CIGIE system of records should submit a written request that includes the words “Privacy Act Amendment Request” on both the envelope and at the top of the request letter to the Executive Director, Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, 1717 H Street NW., Suite 825, Washington, DC 20006. Records not subject to the Privacy Act will not be amended in accordance with these provisions.


(b) *Contents of request.* A request to amend a record in a CIGIE system of records must include:


(1) The name of the system of records and a brief description of the record proposed for amendment. In the event the request to amend the record is the result of the requester having gained access to the record in accordance with the provisions concerning access to records as set forth in subpart B of this part, copies of previous correspondence between the requester and CIGIE will serve in lieu of a separate description of the record.


(2) The exact portion of the record the requester seeks to have amended should be indicated clearly. If possible, proposed alternative language should be set forth, or, at a minimum, the reasons why the requester believes the record is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete should be set forth with enough particularity to permit CIGIE to not only understand the requester's basis for the request, but also to make an appropriate amendment to the record.


(c) *Burden of proof.* The requester has the burden of proof when seeking the amendment of a record. The requester must furnish sufficient facts to persuade the appropriate system manager of the inaccuracy, irrelevance, untimeliness, or incompleteness of the record.


(d) *Identification requirement.* When the requester's identity has been previously verified pursuant to § 9801.201, further verification of identity is not required as long as the communication does not suggest a need for verification. If the requester's identity has not been previously verified, the appropriate system manager may require identification validation as described in § 9801.201.
