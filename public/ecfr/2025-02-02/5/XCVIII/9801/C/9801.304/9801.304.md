Notice of the extension and the reasons therefor will be sent to the requester within the 30-day period.


(b) *Amendment granted.* If the Chairperson determines that the record(s) should be amended in accordance with the requester's request, the Chairperson will take the necessary steps to advise the requester and to direct the appropriate system manager:


(1) To amend the record(s); and


(2) To notify previous recipients of the record(s) for which there is an accounting of disclosure that the record(s) have been amended.


(c) *Denial affirmed.* If the appeal decision does not grant in full the request for amendment, the decision letter will notify the requester that the requester may:

(2) File a statement setting forth their reasons for disagreeing with the decision.


(d) *Requester's disagreement statement.* A requester's disagreement statement must be concise. CIGIE has the authority to determine the “conciseness” of the statement, taking into account the scope of the disagreement and the complexity of the issues.


(e) *Provision of requester's disagreement statement.* In any disclosure of information about which an individual has filed a proper statement of disagreement, CIGIE will clearly note any disputed portion(s) of the record(s) and will provide a copy of the statement to persons or other agencies to whom the disputed record or records has been disclosed and for whom an accounting of disclosure has been maintained. A concise statement of the reasons for not making the amendments requested may also be provided.
