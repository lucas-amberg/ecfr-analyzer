# ยง 2417.203   Filing requirements for litigants seeking documents or testimony.

A requester must comply with the following requirements when filing a request or demand for official records and information or testimony under part 2417. Requesters should file a request before a demand.


(a) The request or demand must be in writing and must be submitted to the FLRA's Office of the Solicitor.


(b) The written request or demand must contain the following information:


(1) The caption of the legal proceeding, docket number, and name and address of the court or other authority involved;


(2) A copy of the complaint or equivalent document setting forth the assertions in the case and any other pleading or document necessary to show relevance;


(3) A list of categories of records sought, a detailed description of how the information sought is relevant to the issues in the legal proceeding, and a specific description of the substance of the testimony or records sought;


(4) A statement as to how the need for the information outweighs any need to maintain the confidentiality of the information and the burden on the FLRA to produce the records or provide testimony;


(5) A statement indicating that the information sought is not available from another source, from other persons or entities, or from the testimony of someone other than an employee, such as a retained expert;


(6) If testimony is sought, the intended use of the testimony, and a showing that no document could be provided and used in lieu of testimony;


(7) A description of all prior decisions, orders, or pending motions in the case that bear upon the relevance of the requested records or testimony;


(8) The name, address, and telephone number of counsel to each party in the case; and


(9) An estimate of the amount of time that the requester and other parties will require for each employee to prepare for testimony, to travel to the legal proceeding, and to attend the legal proceeding.


(c) The Office of the Solicitor reserves the right to require additional information to complete the request, where appropriate.


(d) Requesters should submit their request or demand at least 30 days before the date that records or testimony are required. Requests or demands submitted fewer than 30 days before records or testimony are required must be accompanied by a written explanation stating the reasons for the late request or demand and the reasons that would justify expedited processing.


(e) Failure to cooperate in good faith to enable the FLRA to make an informed decision may serve as the basis for a determination not to comply with the request or demand.


(f) The request or demand should state that the requester will provide a copy of the employee's statement at the expense of the requester and that the requester will permit the FLRA to have a representative present during the employee's testimony.
