(a) *Purpose of a motion.* After the Regional Director issues a Notice of Hearing in a representation proceeding, a party who seeks a ruling, an order, or relief must do so by filing or raising a motion stating the order or relief sought and the grounds in support. The Regional Director or Hearing Officer may treat challenges and other filings referenced in other sections of this subpart as a motion.

(c) *Motions made at the hearing.* During the hearing, parties may make oral motions on the record to the Hearing Officer unless required to be in writing. Responses may be oral on the record or in writing, but must be provided before the hearing closes, absent permission of the Hearing Officer. When appropriate, the Hearing Officer will rule on motions made at the hearing or referred to the Hearing Officer by the Regional Director.


(d) *Posthearing motions.* Parties must file motions made after the hearing closes in writing with the Regional Director. Any response to a posthearing motion must be filed with the Regional Director within five (5) days after service of the motion.
