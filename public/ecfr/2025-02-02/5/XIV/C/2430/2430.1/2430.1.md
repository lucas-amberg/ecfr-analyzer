# ยง 2430.1   Purpose.

The Equal Assess to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504, provides for the award of attorney, agent, or witness fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to Authority adversary adjudications. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over the General Counsel, unless the General Counsel's position in the proceeding was substantially justified, or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this part describe the parties eligible for awards, and the Authority proceeding that is covered. They also set forth the procedures for applying for such awards, and the procedures by which the Authority will rule on such applications.
