# § 5701.102   Fundraising activities.

When engaging in personal fundraising, as described at 5 CFR 2635.808(c), an employee of the Federal Trade Commission may, notwithstanding the prohibition of § 2635.808(c)(1)(i), personally solicit funds from a person who is a prohibited source only under 5 CFR 2635.203(d)(3) (*i.e.,* because the person “conducts activities regulated by” the Commission). The other provisions of § 2635.808(c) continue to apply to any such personal fundraising.
