(a) *Prior approval requirement.* An employee, other than a special Government employee, must obtain written approval from the DAEO through normal supervisory channels before engaging in outside employment with any person who is a “prohibited source” as that term is defined at 5 CFR 2635.203(d).


(b) *Approval of requests.* Approval under this section shall be denied only upon a determination by the DAEO that the outside activity is expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulations, including 5 CFR part 2635.


(c) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section, “employment” means any form of non-Federal employment or business relationship or activity involving the provision of personal services by the employee for compensation other than reimbursement of actual and necessary expenses. It includes, but is not limited to, personal services as an officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, or trustee.
