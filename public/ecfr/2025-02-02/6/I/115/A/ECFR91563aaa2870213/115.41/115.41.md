(2) The age of the detainee;


(3) The physical build and appearance of the detainee;


(4) Whether the detainee has previously been incarcerated or detained;


(5) The nature of the detainee's criminal history;


(6) Whether the detainee has any convictions for sex offenses against an adult or child;


(7) Whether the detainee has self-identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex, or gender nonconforming;


(8) Whether the detainee has self-identified as having previously experienced sexual victimization; and


(9) The detainee's own concerns about his or her physical safety.


(d) The initial screening shall consider prior acts of sexual abuse, prior convictions for violent offenses, and history of prior institutional violence or sexual abuse, as known to the facility, in assessing detainees for risk of being sexually abusive.


(e) The facility shall reassess each detainee's risk of victimization or abusiveness between 60 and 90 days from the date of initial assessment, and at any other time when warranted based upon the receipt of additional, relevant information or following an incident of abuse or victimization.

(g) The facility shall implement appropriate controls on the dissemination within the facility of responses to questions asked pursuant to this standard in order to ensure that sensitive information is not exploited to the detainee's detriment by staff or other detainees or inmates.
