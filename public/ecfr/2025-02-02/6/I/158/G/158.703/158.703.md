(2) Matching assignments with newly appointed individuals as described in paragraph (c) of this section; or


(3) Seeking to recruit individuals and establish new qualified positions under the talent acquisition system described in § 158.501 and then matching assignments with newly appointed individuals as described in paragraph (c) of this section.

In matching an individual with an initial assignment, the Department may also consider:


(1) Input from the individual;

(3) Mission-related requirements; and


(4) Strategic talent priorities.
