# ยง 5.24   Classified information.

On receipt of any request involving classified information, the component will determine whether information is currently and properly classified and take appropriate action to ensure compliance with 6 CFR part 7. Whenever a request is made for access to a record that is covered by a system of records containing information that has been classified by or may be appropriate for classification by another component or agency under any applicable executive order, the receiving component will consult the component or agency that classified the information. Whenever a record contains information that has been derivatively classified by a component or agency because it contains information classified by another component or agency, the component will consult the component or agency that classified the underlying information. Information determined to no longer require classification will not be withheld from a requester based on exemption (k)(1) of the Privacy Act. On receipt of any appeal involving classified information, the DHS Office of the General Counsel, or its designee, shall take appropriate action to ensure compliance with 6 CFR part 7.
