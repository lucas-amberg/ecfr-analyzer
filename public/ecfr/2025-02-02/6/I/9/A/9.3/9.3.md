(2) An award of a Federal loan or a commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan exceeding $150,000.

(i) A Federal contract, grant, or cooperative agreement exceeding $100,000; or 


(ii) A Federal loan or a commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan exceeding $150,000. 


(2) A filing described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not be required if such person previously filed a certification, and a disclosure form required under paragraph (a) of this section. 


(c) Each person shall file a disclosure form at the end of each calendar quarter in which there occurs any event that requires disclosure or that materially affects the accuracy of the information contained in any disclosure form previously filed by such person under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. An event that materially affects the accuracy of the information reported includes: 


(1) A cumulative increase of $25,000 or more in the amount paid or expected to be paid for influencing or attempting to influence a covered Federal action; 


(2) A change in the person(s) or individual(s) influencing or attempting to influence a covered Federal action; or 


(3) A change in the officer(s), employee(s), or Member(s) contacted to influence or attempt to influence a covered Federal action. 


(d)(1) The requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section apply to any person who requests or receives from a person referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section: 


(i) A subcontract exceeding $100,000 at any tier under a Federal contract; 


(ii) A subgrant, contract, or subcontract exceeding $100,000 at any tier under a Federal grant; 


(iii) A contract or subcontract exceeding $100,000 at any tier under a Federal loan exceeding $150,000; or 


(iv) A contract or subcontract exceeding $100,000 at any tier under a Federal cooperative agreement. 


(2) A person described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall file a certification, and a disclosure form, if required, to the next tier. 


(e) All disclosure forms, but not certifications, shall be forwarded from tier to tier until received by the person referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. That person shall forward all disclosure forms to the agency. 


(f) Any certification or disclosure form filed under paragraph (e) of this section shall be treated as a material representation of fact upon which all receiving tiers shall rely. All liability arising from an erroneous representation shall be borne solely by the tier filing that representation and shall not be shared by any tier to which the erroneous representation is forwarded. Submitting an erroneous certification or disclosure constitutes a failure to file the required certification or disclosure, respectively. If a person fails to file a required certification or disclosure, the United States may pursue all available remedies, including those authorized by section 31 U.S.C. 1352. 


(g) No reporting is required for an activity paid for with appropriated funds if that activity is allowable under either subpart B or C of this part.
