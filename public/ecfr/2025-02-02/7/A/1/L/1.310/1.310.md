# § 1.310   Default upon failure to file an answer.

(a) If the respondent does not file an answer within the time prescribed in § 1.309(a) of this part, the reviewing official may refer the complaint together with proof of service to the ALJ and request that the ALJ issue an order of default imposing the penalties and assessments sought in the complaint. An answer must comply in all material respects with § 1.309(b) of this part in order to be considered filed within the time prescribed in § 1.310(a) of this part. 


(b) Upon the referral of the complaint under paragraph (a) of this section, the ALJ shall promptly serve on the respondent, in the manner prescribed in § 1.308 of this part, a notice that a decision will be issued under this section. 


(c) If the respondent fails to answer, the ALJ shall assume the facts alleged in the complaint to be true and, if such facts establish liability under § 1.303 of this part, the ALJ shall issue a decision imposing the penalties and assessments sought in the complaint, not to exceed the maximum amount allowed under the statute. 


(d) A respondent who fails to file a timely answer waives any right to a review of the penalty and assessment, unless he can demonstrate extraordinary circumstances justifying the failure to file an answer.
