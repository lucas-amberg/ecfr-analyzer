(c) The judicial officer may extend the initial 30-day period during which a notice of appeal may be filed for an additional 30 days if the respondent files a request for an extension within the initial 30-day period and shows good cause. 


(d) If the respondent timely files a notice of appeal with the judicial officer and the time for filing motions for reconsideration under ยง 1.337 of this part has expired, the ALJ will forward the record of the proceeding to the judicial officer.

(h) There is no right to interlocutory appeal of rulings by the ALJ. 


(i) The judicial officer, in reviewing the decision, shall not consider any objection that was not raised before the ALJ unless a demonstration is made that extraordinary circumstances caused the failure to raise the objection. 


(j) If any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the judicial officer that additional evidence not presented to the ALJ is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to present such evidence to the ALJ, the judicial officer shall remand the matter to the ALJ for consideration of such additional evidence. 


(k) The judicial officer may affirm, reduce, reverse, compromise, remand or settle any penalty or assessment determined by the ALJ. 


(l) The judicial officer shall promptly serve each party to the appeal with a copy of the decision of the judicial officer and a statement describing the respondent's right to seek judicial review.
