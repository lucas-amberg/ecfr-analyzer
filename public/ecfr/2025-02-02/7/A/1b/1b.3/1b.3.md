# ยง 1b.3   Categorical exclusions.

(a) The following are categories of activities which have been determined not to have a significant individual or cumulative effect on the human environment and are excluded from the preparation of environmental assessment (EA's) or environmental impact statement (EIS's), unless individual agency procedures prescribed otherwise.


(1) Policy development, planning and implementation which relate to routine activities, such as personnel, organizational changes, or similar administrative functions;


(2) Activities which deal solely with the funding of programs, such as program budget proposals, disbursements, and transfer or reprogramming of funds;


(3) Inventories, research activities, and studies, such as resource inventories and routine data collection when such actions are clearly limited in context and intensity;


(4) Educational and informational programs and activities;


(5) Civil and criminal law enforcement and investigative activities;


(6) Activities which are advisory and consultative to other agencies and public and private entities, such as legal counselling and representation;


(7) Activities related to trade representation and market development activities abroad.


(b) Agencies will identify in their own procedures the activities which normally would not require an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement.


(c) Notwithstanding the exclusions listed in paragraphs (a) of this section and ยง 1b.4, or identified in agency procedures, agency heads may determine that circumstances dictate the need for preparation of an EA or EIS for a particular action. Agencies shall continue to scrutinize their activities to determine continued eligibility for categorical exclusion.
