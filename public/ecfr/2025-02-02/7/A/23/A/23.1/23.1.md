(a) Title V of the Rural Development Act of 1972 (Pub. L. 92-419) hereafter referred to as “Title V” is the Research and Education component of the Rural Development Act of 1972. Title V provides the opportunity to utilize and build upon the research, extension, and community service capability of public and private institutions of higher education in each State to expand scientific inquiry and education backup for rural development. The higher educational and research institutions in each State, including the Land Grant Institutions of 1890, are authorized to assist in developing and disseminating through the most appropriate manner, scientific information, technical assistance, and feasibility studies required to improve the rural development capability of local citizens, agencies, and governments. Programs authorized under title V shall be organized and conducted by one or more colleges or universities in each State to provide a coordinated program in each State which will have the greatest impact on accomplishing the objectives of rural development in both the short and longer term and the use of these studies to support the State's comprehensive program to be supported under title V. 


(b) Title V operations will be consonant with the purpose that all Federal rural development activities be coordinated with other federally assisted rural development activities and with the State's ongoing rural development program. To effectuate such purpose, the Assistant Secretary for Conservation, Research and Education will implement title V plans and activities in close coordination with the Assistant Secretary for Rural Development.
