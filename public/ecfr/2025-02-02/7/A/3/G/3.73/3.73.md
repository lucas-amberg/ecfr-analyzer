# ยง 3.73   Determination of indebtedness.

(a) In determining that an employee is indebted to USDA and that 31 CFR parts 900 through 904 have been satisfied and that salary offset is appropriate, USDA will review the debt to make sure that it is valid and past due.


(b) If USDA determines that any of the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section have not been met, no determination of indebtedness will be made and salary offset will not proceed until USDA is assured that the requirements have been met.
