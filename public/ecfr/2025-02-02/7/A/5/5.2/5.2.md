# ยง 5.2   Marketing season average price data.

It is hereby found that it is impractical to use averages of prices received by farmers on a calendar year basis for the following agricultural commodities for the purpose of calculating adjusted base prices and, therefore, marketing season average prices will be used. An allowance for any supplemental payment resulting from price support operations shall be included in the determination of the adjusted base prices. For cigar binder tobacco, types 51-52, for each of the marketing seasons beginning in the years 1949 through 1958, 37.9 cents per pound shall be used in lieu of the average of prices received by farmers for such tobacco during each such marketing season.
