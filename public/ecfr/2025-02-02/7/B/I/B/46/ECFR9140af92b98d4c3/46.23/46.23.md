# § 46.23   Evidence of dumping.

Reasonable cause for destroying any produce exists when the commodity has no commercial value or when it is dumped by order of a local health officer or other authorized official or when the shipper has specifically consented to such disposition. The term “commercial value” means any value that a commodity may have for any purpose that can be ascertained by the exercise of due diligence without unreasonable expense or loss of time. When produce is being handled for or on behalf of another person, proof as to the quantities of produce destroyed or dumped in excess of five percent of the shipment shall be provided by procuring an official certificate showing that the produce has no commercial value from any person authorized by the Department to inspect fruits and vegetables. Where such inspection service is not available certification may be obtained from (a) any health officer or food inspector of any State, county, parish, city or municipality or of the District of Columbia; (b) any established commercial agency or service making inspections for the fruit and vegetable industry; or (c) when no inspector or health officer designated above is available consideration will be given to other evidence such as inspection and certification made by any two persons having no financial interest in the produce involved or in the business of any person financially interested therein, and who are unrelated by blood or marriage to any such financially interested person, and who, at the time of the inspection and certification, and for a period of at least one year immediately prior thereto, have been engaged in the handling of the same general kind or class of produce with respect to which the inspections and certification are to be made. Any certificate issued by any persons designated in paragraph (c) of this section shall include a statement that each of them possesses the requisite qualifications. Any such certificate shall properly identify the produce by showing the commodity, lot number, brand or principal identifying marks on the containers, quantity dumped, name and address of shipper, name and address of applicant, condition of the produce, time, place, and date of inspection and a statement that the produce possesses no commercial value.
