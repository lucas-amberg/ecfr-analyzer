# § 51.2561   Average moisture content.

(a) Determining average moisture content of the lot is not a requirement of the grades, except when kernels are specified as “very well dried.” It may be carried out upon request in connection with grade analysis or as a separate determination.


(b) Kernels shall be obtained from a randomly drawn composite sample. Official certification shall be based on the air-oven method or other officially approved methods or devices. Results obtained by methods or devices not officially approved may be reported and shall include a description of the method or device and owner of any equipment used.
