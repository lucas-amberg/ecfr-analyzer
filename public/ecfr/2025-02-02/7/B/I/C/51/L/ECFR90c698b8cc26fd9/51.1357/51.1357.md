*Seriously deformed* means that the pear is so badly misshapen as to cause a loss during the usual commercial preparation for use of over 20 percent, by weight, of the pear in excess of that which would occur if the pear were well formed. Round or apple-shaped pears shall not be considered seriously deformed.
