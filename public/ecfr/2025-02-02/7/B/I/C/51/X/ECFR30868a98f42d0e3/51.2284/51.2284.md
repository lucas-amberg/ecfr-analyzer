# § 51.2284   Size classification.

The following classifications are provided to describe the size of any lot: “Halves”, “Pieces and Halves”, “Pieces” or “Small Pieces”. The size of portions of kernels in the lot shall conform to the requirements of the specified classification as defined below:


(a) *Halves.* Lot consists of 85 percent or more, by weight, half kernels, and the remainder three-fourths half kernels. (See § 51.2285.)


(b) *Pieces and halves.* Lot consists of 20 percent or more, by weight, half kernels, and the remainder portions of kernels that cannot pass through a sieve with 
24/64 inch round openings. When a lot exceeds this minimum requirement, the actual percentage of halves may be specified. (See § 51.2285.)


(c) *Pieces.* Lot consists of portions of kernels that cannot pass through a sieve with 
24/64 inch round openings. (See § 51.2285.)


(d) *Small pieces.* Lot consists of portions of kernels that pass through a sieve with 
24/64 inch round openings, but that cannot pass through a sieve with 
8/64 inch round openings. When desired, the actual size ranges within such size ranges may be specified. (See § 51.2285.)
