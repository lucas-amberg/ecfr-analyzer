# § 52.38   Sampling plans and procedures for determining lot compliance.

(a) Except as otherwise provided for in this section in connection with in-plant inspection and unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, samples shall be selected from each lot in the exact number of sample units indicated for the lot size in the applicable sampling plans. The lot size is to correspond to a sample size with a maximum of 29 sample units: Provided, that at the discretion of the inspection service, the number of sample units selected may be increased to the exact number of sample units indicated for any one of the larger sample sizes provided for in the appropriate plans. The samples size may be increased beyond 29 sample units in accordance with the following sampling plan:


(b) Under the sampling plans with respect to any specified requirement:


(1) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the specific requirement) in the sample does not exceed the acceptance number prescribed for the sample size, the lot meets the requirement;


(2) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the specific requirement) in the sample exceeds the acceptance number prescribed for the sample size, the lot fails the requirement.


(c) If in the conduct of on-line in-plant inspection of a product covered by a grade standard which does not contain sampling plans, the sample is examined before the lot size is known and the number of sample units exceeds the prescribed sample size for such lot, but does not equal any of the prescribed larger sample sizes, the lot may be deemed to meet or fail a specific requirement in accordance with the following procedure:


(1) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the specific requirement) in the nonprescribed sample does not exceed the acceptance number of the next smaller sample size, the lot meets the requirement;


(2) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the specific requirement) in the nonprescribed sample equals the acceptance number prescribed for the next larger sample size, additional sample units shall be selected to increase the sample to the next larger prescribed sample size;


(3) If the number of deviants (as defined in connection with the specific requirement) in the nonprescribed sample exceeds the acceptance number prescribed for the next larger sample size, the lot fails the requirement.


(d) In the conduct of on-line in-plant inspection, sampling may be performed on a time interval basis. The sampling frequency shall be specified in an applicable grade standard or other procedural instruction approved by the Administrator.


(e) In the event that the lot compliance determination provisions of a standard or specification are based on the number of specified deviations instead of deviants the procedures set forth in this section may be applied by substituting the word “deviation” for the word “deviant” wherever it appears.


(f) Sampling plans referred to in this section are those contained in Tables I, II, III, IV, and V and (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section which follow or any other plans which are applicable. For processed products not included in these tables, the minimum sample size shall be the exact number of sample units prescribed in the table, container group, and lot size that, as determined by the inspector, most closely resembles the product, type, container, size and amount of product to be sampled. The maximum sample size in tables I, II, III, IV, V, (g)(1), (g)(2) and processed products not included in these tables is 29 sample units.


(g)(1) *Sampling plan for dried figs.* For each 10,000 pounds (or fraction of 10,000 pounds) of product—6 sample units of approximately 35 figs each accumulated into 1 composite (at least 200 figs). Each composite will be examined separately, and all must meet the requirement for the U.S. Grade.


(2) *Sampling plan for dried fruits other than dates and figs.* For each 15,000 pounds (or fraction of 15,000 pounds) of product—sample units of approximately 16 ounces each accumulated into 1 composite (at least 100 ounces) Each composite will be examined separately and all must meet the requirements for the U.S. Grade.
