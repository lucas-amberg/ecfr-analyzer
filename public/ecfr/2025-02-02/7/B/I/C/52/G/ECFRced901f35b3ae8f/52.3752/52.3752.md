# § 52.3752   Types of canned ripe olives.

Canned ripe olives are processed as two distinct types. Unless a specific type is stated in this subpart, “canned ripe olives” refers to olives of either “ripe-type” or “green-ripe type.”


(a) *Ripe type.* “Ripe type” olives are those which have been treated and oxidized in processing to produce a typical dark brown to black color.


(b) *Green-ripe type.* “Green-ripe type” olives are those which have not been oxidized in processing; which range in color from yellow-green; green-yellow or other greenish casts; and which may be mottled.
