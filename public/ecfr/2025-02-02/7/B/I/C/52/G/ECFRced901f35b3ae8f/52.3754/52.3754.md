# § 52.3754   Size designations for whole and pitted styles.

(a) *General.* (1) “Average count” for canned whole ripe olives is determined from all containers in the sample and is calculated on the basis of the drained weight of the olives.


(2) Diameters of canned whole and pitted ripe olives are determined by measuring the smallest diameters at the largest circumferences at right angles to the longitudinal axes of the olives. The longitudinal axis is a line running from the stem to the apex of the olive.


(b) *Size determination.* Size of canned whole or pitted olives shall conform to the applicable count per pound range indicated in Table I in the case of whole olives, or conform closely to the applicable illustration in Table I in the case of pitted olives. When the count per pound of whole olives falls between two count ranges, the size designation shall be the next smaller size.
