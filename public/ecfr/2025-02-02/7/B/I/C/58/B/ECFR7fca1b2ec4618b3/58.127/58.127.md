There shall be no cross connection between potable water lines and non-potable water lines or between public and private water supplies. Bacteriological examinations shall be made of the plant's sanitary water supply taken at the plant at least twice a year, or as often as necessary to determine safety and suitability as related to product keeping quality for use in manufactured products shall be made by a USDA or State agency laboratory except for supplies that are regularly tested for purity and bacteriological quality, and approved by the local health officer.
