Where necessary to provide easy access for cleaning of floors and adjacent wall areas, the receiving tank shall be equipped with wheels or casters to allow easy removal. 


(c) *Can washers.* Can washers shall have sufficient capacity and ability to discharge a clean dry can and cover and shall be kept properly timed in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer. They should be equipped with proper temperature controls on the wash and rinse tanks and the following additional devices: Prerinse jet, wash tank solution feeder, can sanitizing attachment, forced air vapor exhaust, and removable air filter on drying chamber. The water and steam lines supplying the washer shall maintain a reasonably uniform pressure and if necessary be equipped with pressure regulating valves. The steam pressure to the can washer should be not less than 80 pounds, and the temperature of the wash and final rinse solution should be automatically controlled and not exceed 140 °F. 


(d) *Product storage tanks or vats.* Storage tanks or vats shall be fully enclosed or tightly covered and well insulated. The entire interior surface, agitator and all appurtenances shall be accessible for thorough cleaning and inspection. Any opening at the top of the tank or vat including the entrance of the shaft shall be suitably protected against the entrance of dust, moisture, insects, oil or grease. The sight glasses, if used, shall be sound, clear, and in good repair. Vats which have hinged covers shall be easily cleaned and shall be so designed that moisture, or dust on the surface cannot enter the vat when the covers are raised. If the storage tanks or vats are equipped with air agitation, the system shall be of an approved type and properly installed in accordance with the 3-A Accepted Practices for Supplying Air Under Pressure. Storage tanks or vats intended to hold product for longer than approximately 8 hours shall be equipped with adequate refrigeration and/or have adequate insulation.

(f) *Coil or dome type batch pasteurizers.* Coil or dome type batch pasteurizers shall be stainless steel lined and if the coil is not stainless steel or other equally noncorrosive metal it shall be properly tinned over the entire surface. Sanitary seal assemblies at the shaft ends of coil vats shall be of the removable type, except that existing equipment not provided with this type gland will be acceptable if the packing glands are maintained and operated without adverse effects. New or replacement units shall be provided with removable packing glands. Dome type pasteurizer agitators shall be stainless steel except that any non-metallic parts shall comply with 3-A Sanitary Standards for Plastic or Rubber and Rubberlike Materials, as applicable. Each pasteurizer used for heating product at a temperature of 5 °F. or more above the minimum pasteurization temperature need not have the airspace heater. It shall be equipped with an airspace thermometer to insure a temperature at least 5 °F. above that required for pasteurization of the product. There shall be adequate means of controlling the temperature of the heating medium, Batch pasteurizers shall have temperature indicating and recording devices. 


(g) *Short time pasteurizing systems.* When pasteurization is intended or required, an approved timing pump or device, recorder-controller, automatic flow diversion valve and holding tube or its equivalent, if not a part of the existing equipment, shall be installed on all such equipment used for pasteurization, to assure complete pasteurization. The entire facility shall comply with the 3-A Accepted Practices for the Sanitary Construction, Installation, Testing and Operation of High Temperature Short Time Pasteurizers. After the unit has been tested according to the 3-A Accepted Practices, the timing pump or device and the recorder controller shall be sealed at the correct setting to assure pasteurization. The system should be rechecked semi-annually to assure continued compliance with the 3-A Accepted Practices. Sealing and rechecking of the unit shall be performed by the control authority having jurisdiction. When direct steam pasteurizers are used, the steam, prior to entering the product, shall be conducted through a steam strainer and a steam purifier equipped with a steam trap and only steam meeting the requirements for culinary steam shall be used. 


(h) *Thermometers and recorders*—(1) *Indicating thermometers.* (i) Long stem indicating thermometers which are accurate within 0.5 °F., plus or minus, for the applicable temperature range, shall be provided for checking the temperature of pasteurization and cooling of products in vats and checking the accuracy of recording thermometers. 


(ii) Short stem indicating thermometers, which are accurate within 0.5 °F., plus or minus, for the applicable temperature range, shall be installed in the proper stationary position in all pasteurizers. Storage tanks where temperature readings are required shall have thermometers which are accurate within 2.0 °F., plus or minus. 


(iii) Air space indicating thermometers, where applicable, which are accurate within 1.0 °F., plus or minus, for the proper temperature range shall also be installed above the surface of the products pasteurized in vats, to make certain that the temperature of the foam and/or air above the products pasteurized also received the required minimum temperature treatment. 


(2) *Recording thermometers.* (i) Recording thermometers that are accurate within 1 °F., plus or minus, for the applicable temperature range, shall be used on each heat treating, pasteurizing or thermal processing unit to record the heating process. 


(ii) Additional use of recording thermometers accurate within 2 °F., plus or minus may be required where a record of temperature or time of cooling and holding is of significant importance. 


(iii) Recorder charts shall be marked to show date and plant identification, reading of the indicating thermometer at a particular referenced reading point on the recording chart, amount and name of product, product temperature at which the “cut-in” and “cut-out” function, record of the period in which flow diversion valve is in forward-flow position, signature or initials of operator.
