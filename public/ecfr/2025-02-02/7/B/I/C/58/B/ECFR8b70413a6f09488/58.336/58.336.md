(2) *Free fatty acid.* This test should be made on churnings or batches from samples taken from the butter as often as is necessary to aid in the control of lipase activity. 


(d) *Other analysis.* Other chemical analysis or physical measurements shall be performed as often as is necessary to insure meeting grade standards and contract specifications. 


(e) *Weight or volume control.* Representative samples of the packaged product should be checked using procedures prescribed by the Administrator during the packaging operation to assure compliance with the stated net weight or volume on the container. 


(f) *Keeping quality and stability.* Samples from churnings shall be subjected to a seven day keeping quality test at a temperature of 72 °F. to establish and maintain a satisfactory keeping quality history. Optionally 98 °F. for 48 hours may be used, however, in case of a dispute, the results of the seven days at 72 °F. will prevail.
