# ยง 61.34   Drawing and preparation of sample.

Each licensed cottonseed sampler shall draw, prepare, and identify one official sample of cottonseed and a duplicate thereof from each lot made available to him in such manner as may be required by the Director, and shall promptly prepare it for forwarding to a licensed cottonseed chemist for analysis and grading. The duplicate shall be sealed and retained by the sampler until the original official sample shall have been analyzed by a licensed chemist. If the original official sample shall become lost or destroyed before having been analyzed the duplicate shall become the official sample; otherwise the licensed sampler shall immediately remove the identification marks from the duplicate and discard it. In no case shall the duplicate be offered for analysis unless the original shall have been lost or destroyed before analysis.
