# § 70.91   Issuance.

(a) *Resident grading basis.* Certificates will be issued only upon a request therefor by the applicant or the AMS. When requested, a grader shall issue a certificate covering product graded by such grader. In addition, a grader may issue a grading certificate covering product graded in whole or in part by another grader when the grader has knowledge that the product is eligible for certification based on personal examination of the product or official grading records.


(b) *Other than resident grading.* Each grader shall, in person or by an authorized agent, issue a grading certificate covering each product graded by such grader. A grader's name may be signed on a grading certificate by a person other than the grader if such person has been designated as the authorized agent of such grader by the national supervisor: *Provided*, That the certificate is prepared from an official memorandum of grading signed by the grader: *And provided further*, That a notarized power of attorney authorizing such signature has been issued to such person by the grader and is on file in the office of grading. In such case, the authorized agent shall sign both the agents name and the grader's name, e.g., “John Doe by Mary Roe.”
