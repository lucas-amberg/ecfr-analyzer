# § 91.27   Corrections to certificates prior to issuance.

(a) The accuracy of the statements and information shown on certificates of analysis must be verified by the individual whose name or signature, or both, is shown on the certificate or by the authorized agent who affixed the name or signature, or both. When a name or signature, or both, is affixed by an authorized agent, the initials of the agent shall appear directly below or following the name, or signature of the person. Errors found during this process shall be corrected according to this section. 


(b) Only official personnel or their authorized agents may make corrections, additions, or other changes to certificates. 


(c) No corrections, additions, or other changes shall be made which involve identification, quality, or quantity. If such errors are found, a new certificate shall be prepared and issued and the incorrect certificate marked “Void.” Otherwise, errors may be corrected, provided there is evidence of satisfactory correction procedures as follows: 


(1) The corrections are neat and legible; 


(2) Each correction is initialed by the individual who corrects the certificate; and 


(3) The corrections and initials are shown on the original and all copies.
