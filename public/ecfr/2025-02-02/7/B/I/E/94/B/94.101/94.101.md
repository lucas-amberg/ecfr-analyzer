*Certification sample.* An egg product sample submitted by an applicant for chemical, physical, or microbiological analyses and tests at a Science and Technology Division laboratory. This voluntary sample is analyzed or tested by the Division's analyst or scientist to certify that an egg product lot meets applicable specifications for identity, quality, and wholesomeness. 


*Surveillance sample.* This is a 100 gram sample for *Salmonella* analysis that is drawn by the USDA egg product inspector from each lot of egg product processed at an official plant. This sample may be analyzed by a Science and Technology Division laboratory, or by a laboratory approved and recognized by the Division to analyze for *Salmonella* in egg products. 


*Unofficial sample.* These samples of egg products are drawn by plant personnel upon the request of plant management. Analyses of these samples are usually conducted for the plant's refractometer correlation, bacteriological evaluation of production techniques, or quality control of procedures. Official plant or Science and Technology Division laboratories can analyze these samples.
