# ยง 201.56-8   Flax family, Linaceae.

Kind of seed: Flax. 


(a) General description. 


(1) Germination habit: Epigeal dicot. (Due to the mucilaginous nature of the seed coat, seedlings germinated on blotters may adhere to the blotter and appear to be negatively geotropic.) 


(2) Food reserves: Cotyledons which expand and become photosynthetic. 


(3) Shoot system: The hypocotyl elongates carrying the cotyledons above the soil surface. The epicotyl usually does not show any development within the test period. 


(4) Root system: A primary root, with secondary roots usually developing within the test period. 


(b) Abnormal seedling description. 


(1) Cotyledons: 


(i) Less than half of the original cotyledon tissue remaining attached. 


(ii) Less than half of the original cotyledon tissue free of necrosis or decay. 


(2) Epicotyl: 


(i) Missing. (May be assumed to be present if cotyledons are intact.) 


(ii) [Reserved]


(3) Hypocotyl: 


(i) Deep open cracks extending into the conducting tissue. 


(ii) Malformed, such as markedly shortened, curled, or thickened. 


(4) Root: 


(i) None.
