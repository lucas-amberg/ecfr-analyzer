# § 201.33   Seed in bulk or large quantities; seed for cleaning or processing.

(a) In the case of seed in bulk, the information required under sections 201(a), (b), and (i) of the Act shall appear in the invoice or other records accompanying and pertaining to such seed. If the seed is in containers and in quantities of 20,000 pounds or more, regardless of the number of lots included, the information required on each container under sections 201 (a), (b), and (i) of the Act need not be shown on each container; *Provided,* That: (1) The omission from each container of a label with the required information is with the knowledge and consent of the consignee prior to the transportation or delivery for transportation of such seed in interstate commerce; (2) each container has stenciled upon it or bears a label containing a lot designation; and (3) the invoice or other records accompanying and pertaining to such seed bear the various statements required for the respective seeds. 


(b) Seed consigned to a seed cleaning or processing establishment, for cleaning or processing for seeding purposes, need not be labeled to show the information required on each container under sections 201 (a), (b), and (i) of the Act if it is in bulk, or in containers and in quantities of 20,000 pounds or more regardless of the number of lots involved, and the invoice or other records accompanying and pertaining to such seed show that it is “Seed for processing,” or, if the seed is in containers and in quantities less than 20,000 pounds and each container bears a label with the words “Seed for processing.” If any such seed is later to be labeled as to origin and/or variety, the origin and/or variety as the case may be, shall be shown on the invoice if the seed is in bulk, otherwise, on a label, at the time of transportation to such establishment, except that if it is covered by a declaration of origin and/or variety it will be sufficient if the lot designation appearing in the declaration is placed on the invoice if the seed is in bulk, or on a label if the seed is in containers, regardless of the quantity.
