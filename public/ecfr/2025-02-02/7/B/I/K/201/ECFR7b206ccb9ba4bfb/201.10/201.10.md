# § 201.10   Variety.

(a) The following kinds of agricultural seeds are generally labeled as to variety and shall be labeled to show the variety name or the words “Variety Not Stated.” 


(b) If the name of the variety is given, the name may be associated with the name of the kind with or without the words “kind and variety.” The percentage in such case, which may be shown as “pure seed,” shall apply only to seed of the variety named, except for the labeling of hybrids as provided in § 201.11a. If separate percentages for the kind and the variety or hybrid are shown, the name of the kind and the name of the variety or the term “hybrid” shall be clearly associated with the respective percentages. When two or more varieties are present in excess of 5 percent and are named on the label, the name of each variety shall be accompanied by the percentage of each.
