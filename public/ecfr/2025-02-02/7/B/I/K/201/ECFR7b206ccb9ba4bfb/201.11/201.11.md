# § 201.11   Type.

(a) When type is designated, such designation may be associated with the name of the kind but shall in all cases be clearly associated with the word “type.” The percentage, which may be shown as “pure seed”, shall apply only to the type designated. If separate percentages for the kind and the type are shown, such percentages shall be clearly associated with the name of the kind and the name of the type. 


(b) If the type designation does not include a variety name, it shall include a name descriptive of a group of varieties of similar character and the pure seed shall be at least 90 percent of one or more varieties all of which conform to the type designation. 


(c) If the name of a variety is used as a part of the type designation, the seed shall be of that variety and may contain: (1) An admixture of seed of other indistinguishable varieties of the same kind and of similar character; or, (2) an admixture of indistinguishable seeds having genetic characteristics dissimilar to the variety named by reason of cross-fertilization with other varieties. In either case, at least 90 percent of the pure seed shall be of the variety named or upon growth shall produce plants having characteristics similar to the variety named.
