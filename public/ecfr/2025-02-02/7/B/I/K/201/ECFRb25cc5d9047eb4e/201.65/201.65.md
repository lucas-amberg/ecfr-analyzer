# § 201.65   Noxious-weed seeds in interstate commerce.

Tolerances for rates of occurrence of noxious-weed seeds shall be recognized and shall be applied to the number of noxious-weed seeds found by analysis in the quantity of seed specified for noxious-weed seed determinations in § 201.46, except as provided in § 201.16(b). Rates per pound or ounce must be converted to the equivalent number of seeds found in § 201.46, Table 1, Minimum weight for noxious-weed seed examination (grams). Some tolerances are listed in the following table. The number found as represented by the label or test (Column X) will be considered within tolerance if not more than the corresponding numbers in Column Y are found by analysis in the administration of the Act. For numbers of seed greater than those in the table, a tolerance based on a degree of certainty of 5 percent (P = 0.05) can be calculated by the formula, Y = X + 1.65√X + 0.03, where X is the number of seeds represented by the label or test and Y is the maximum number within tolerance.
