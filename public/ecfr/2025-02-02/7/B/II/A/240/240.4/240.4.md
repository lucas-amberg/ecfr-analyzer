# ยง 240.4   Cash in lieu of donated foods for nonresidential child and adult care institutions.

(a) For each school year any State agency may, upon application to FNS prior to the beginning of the school year, elect to receive cash in lieu of donated foods for use in nonresidential child care or adult care institutions participating in the Child and Adult Care Food Program. FNS shall pay each State agency making such election, at a minimum, an amount calculated by multiplying the number of lunches and suppers served in the State's nonresidential child and adult care institutions which meet the meal pattern requirements prescribed in the regulations for the Child and Adult Care Food Program under part 226 of this chapter by the national average value of donated food prescribed in section 6(e)(1) of the Act. However, if a State agency has elected to receive a combination of donated foods and cash, the required amount shall be reduced based upon the number of such lunches and suppers served for which the State receives donated foods.


(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section in any State in which FNS administers the Child Care Food Program in any nonresidential child care institution, FNS shall withhold from the funds payable to such State under this section an amount equal to the ratio of the number of lunches and suppers served in such institutions in which the program is administered by the FNS and for which cash payments are provided to the total number of lunches and suppers served in that program and for which cash in lieu of payments are received, in all nonresidential child care institutions in the State.
