(a) *Federal audit responsibilities.* (1) OIG reserves the right to perform audits of State and local agencies and other organizations involved in the Program as determined by OIG to be necessary. In performing such audits, OIG will rely to the extent feasible on audit work performed by other Federal and non-Federal auditors.


(2) The State agency may take exception to particular audit findings and recommendations. The State agency shall submit a response or statement to FNS as to the action taken or a proposed corrective action plan regarding the findings. A proposed corrective action plan developed and submitted by the State agency shall include specific timeframes for its implementation and for completion of correction of deficiencies and their causes.


(3) FNS will determine whether Program deficiencies have been adequately corrected. If additional corrective action is necessary, FNS shall schedule a follow-up review, allowing a reasonable time for such corrective action to be taken.
