# § 247.35   Local agency appeals of State agency actions.

(a) *What recourse must the State agency provide local agencies to appeal a decision that adversely affects their participation in CSFP?* The State agency must establish a hearing procedure to allow local agencies to appeal a decision that adversely affects their participation in CSFP—e.g., the termination of a local agency's participation in the program. The adverse action must be postponed until a decision on the appeal is made.


(b) *What must the State agency include in the hearing procedure to ensure that the local agency has a fair chance to present its case?* The hearing procedure must provide the local agency:


(1) Adequate advance notice of the time and place of the hearing;


(2) An opportunity to review the record before the hearing, and to present evidence at the hearing;


(3) An opportunity to confront and cross-examine witnesses; and


(4) An opportunity to be represented by counsel, if desired.


(c) *Who conducts the hearing and how is a decision on the appeal made?* The hearing must be conducted by an impartial person who must make a decision on the appeal that is based solely on the evidence presented at the hearing, and on program legislation and regulations. A decision must be made within 60 days from the date of the request for a hearing, and must be provided in writing to the local agency.
