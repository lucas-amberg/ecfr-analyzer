# ยง 248.9   Nutrition education.

(a) *Goals.* Nutrition education shall emphasize the relationship of proper nutrition to the total concept of good health, including the importance of consuming fresh fruits and vegetables.


(b) *Requirement.* The State agency shall integrate nutrition education into FMNP operations and may satisfy nutrition education requirements through coordination with other agencies within the State. Such other agencies may include the WIC Program which routinely offers nutrition education to participants and which may wish to use the opportunity of the FMNP to reinforce nutrition messages. State agencies wishing to coordinate nutrition education with WIC shall enter into a written cooperative agreement with WIC agencies to offer nutrition education relevant to the use and nutritional value of foods available to FMNP recipients. In cases where relevant WIC nutrition education sessions are used to meet this requirement, reimbursement to the WIC local agency shall not be permitted. In cases where FMNP recipients are not receiving relevant nutrition education from the WIC Program, the State agency shall arrange alternative methods for the provision of such nutrition education which is an allowable cost under the FMNP.
