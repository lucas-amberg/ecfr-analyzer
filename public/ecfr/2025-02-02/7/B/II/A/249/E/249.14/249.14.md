# ยง 249.14   Distribution of funds to State agencies.

(a) *State Plan and agreement.* As a prerequisite to the receipt of Federal funds, a State agency must have its State Plan approved and must execute an agreement with FNS in accordance with ยง 249.3(c).


(b) *Distribution of SFMNP funds to previously participating State agencies.* Provided that sufficient SFMNP funds are available, each State agency that participated in the SFMNP in any prior fiscal year shall receive not less than the amount of funds the State agency received in the most recent fiscal year in which it received funding, if it otherwise complies with the requirements established in this Part.


(c) *Ratable reduction.* If amounts appropriated for any fiscal year for grants under the SFMNP are not sufficient to pay to each previously participating State agency at least an amount as identified in paragraph (b) of this section, each State agency's grant must be ratably reduced. However, to the extent permitted by available funds, each State agency shall receive at least $75,000 or the amount that the State agency received for the most recent prior fiscal year in which the State participated, if that amount is less than $75,000.


(d) *Expansion of participating State agencies and establishment of new State agencies.* Any SFMNP funds remaining for allocation after meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section shall be allocated in the following manner:


(1) Of the remaining funds, 75 percent shall be made available to State agencies already participating in the SFMNP that wish to serve additional participants or increase the current benefit level. If this amount is greater than that necessary to satisfy all State Plans approved for expansion, the unallocated amount shall be applied toward satisfying any unmet need in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.


(2) Of the remaining funds, 25 percent shall be made available to State agencies that have not participated in the SFMNP in any prior fiscal year. If this amount is greater than that necessary to satisfy the approved State Plans for new States, the unallocated amount shall be applied toward satisfying any unmet need in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. FNS reserves the right not to fund every State agency with an approved State Plan.


(e) *Expansion for current State agencies.* In providing funds to State agencies that participated in the SFMNP in the previous fiscal year, FNS must consider on a case-by-case basis the following factors:


(1) Whether the State agency utilized at least 80 percent of its prior year food grant. States that did not spend at least 80 percent of their prior year food grant may still be eligible for expansion funding if, in the judgment of FNS, good cause existed which was beyond the management control of the State, such as severe weather conditions or unanticipated decreases in participant caseload;


(2) Documentation supporting the funds expansion request as outlined in ยง 249.4(a)(23); and


(3) Whether the State agency currently issues a participant benefit greater than $50. Such State agencies will not be eligible to receive additional SFMNP funds for expansion until the maximum participant benefit no longer exceeds $50.


(f) *Funding of new State agencies.* Funds will be awarded to new SFMNP State agencies in accordance with ยง 249.5.


(g) *Administrative funding.* A State agency will have available for administrative costs an amount not greater than 10 percent of the total SFMNP funds it receives.


(h) *Recovery of unused funds.* State agencies must return to FNS any unexpended funds made available for a given fiscal year by February 1 of the following fiscal year.
