# ยง 250.1   Purpose and use of donated foods.

(a) *Purpose.* The Department purchases foods and donates them to State distributing agencies for further distribution and use in food assistance programs, or to provide assistance to eligible persons, in accordance with legislation:


(1) Authorizing donated food assistance in specific programs (*e.g.,* the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act for the National School Lunch Program (NSLP)); or


(2) Authorizing the removal of surplus foods from the market or the support of food prices (*i.e.,* in accordance with Section 32, Section 416, and Section 709, as defined in ยง 250.2).


(b) *Use of donated foods.* Donated foods must be used in accordance with the requirements of this part and with other Federal regulations applicable to specific food assistance programs (*e.g.,* 7 CFR part 251 includes requirements for the use of donated foods in The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP)). Such use may include activities designed to demonstrate or test the effective use of donated foods (*e.g.,* in nutrition classes or cooking demonstrations) in any programs. However, donated foods may not be:


(1) Sold or exchanged, or otherwise disposed of, unless approved by FNS, or specifically permitted elsewhere in this part or in other Federal regulations (*e.g.,* donated foods may be used in meals sold in NSLP);


(2) Used to require recipients to make any payments or perform any services in exchange for their receipt, unless approved by FNS, or specifically permitted elsewhere in this part or in other Federal regulations; or


(3) Used to solicit voluntary contributions in connection with their receipt, except for donated foods provided in the Nutrition Services Incentive Program (NSIP).


(c) *Legislative sanctions.* In accordance with the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1760) and the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 (7 U.S.C. 612c note), any person who embezzles, willfully misapplies, steals, or obtains by fraud any donated foods (or funds, assets, or property deriving from such donated foods) will be subject to Federal criminal prosecution and other penalties. Any person who receives, conceals, or retains such donated foods or funds, assets, or property deriving from such foods, with the knowledge that they were embezzled, willfully misapplied, stolen, or obtained by fraud, will also be subject to Federal criminal prosecution and other penalties. The distributing agency, or other parties, as applicable, must immediately notify FNS of any such violations.
