# § 251.10   Reports and recordkeeping.

(a) *Records*—(1) *USDA Foods.* State agencies, subdistributing agencies (as defined in § 250.3 of this chapter), and eligible recipient agencies must maintain records to document the receipt, disposal, and inventory of USDA Foods received under this part that they, in turn, distribute to eligible recipient agencies. Such records must be maintained in accordance with the requirements set forth in § 250.16 of this chapter. Eligible recipient agencies must sign a receipt for USDA Foods which they receive under this part for distribution to households or for use in preparing meals, and records of all such receipts must be maintained.


(2) *Administrative funds.* In addition to maintaining financial records in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart D, and USDA implementing regulations at 2 CFR part 400, State agencies must maintain records to document the amount of funds received under this part and paid to eligible recipient agencies for allowable administrative costs incurred by such eligible recipient agencies. State agencies must also ensure that eligible recipient agencies maintain such records.


(3) *Eligible recipient agency list.* State agencies must maintain a list of eligible recipient agencies, including eligible recipient agencies that have agreements with the State agency and eligible recipient agencies that have agreements with another eligible recipient agency. The list must include eligible recipient agencies that distribute USDA Foods for home consumption and those that distribute USDA Foods in the form of prepared meals.


(4) *Information about households receiving USDA Foods for home consumption.* Each distribution site must collect and maintain on record for each household receiving USDA Foods for home consumption, the name of the household member receiving USDA Foods, the number of persons in the household, and the basis for determining that the household is eligible to receive USDA Foods for home consumption.


(5) *Record retention.* All records required by this section must be retained for a period of 3 years from the close of the Federal Fiscal Year to which they pertain, or longer if related to an audit or investigation in progress. State agencies may take physical possession of such records on behalf of their eligible recipient agencies. However, such records must be reasonably accessible at all times for use during management evaluation reviews, audits or investigations.


(b) *Reports*—(1) *Submission of Form FNS-667.* Designated State agencies must identify funds obligated and disbursed to cover the costs associated with the program at the State and local level. State and local costs must be identified separately. The data must be identified on Form FNS-667, Report of Administrative Costs (TEFAP) and submitted to the appropriate FNS Regional Office on a quarterly basis. The quarterly report must be submitted no later than 30 calendar days after the end of the quarter to which it pertains. The final report must be submitted no later than 90 calendar days after the end of the fiscal year to which it pertains.


(2) *Reports of excessive inventory.* Each State agency must complete and submit to the FNS Regional Office reports to ensure that excessive inventories of USDA Foods are not maintained, in accordance with the requirements of § 250.18(a) of this chapter.


(3) *Report of eligible recipient agency list.* On an annual basis, each State agency must provide the list of eligible recipient agencies and statewide eligibility criteria, as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, to FNS. The report should specify whether each eligible recipient agency has an agreement with the State agency or with another eligible recipient agency.


(4) *Recipients of USDA Foods for home consumption.* State agencies must report the total number of persons served by each distribution site for home consumption as collected in paragraph (a)(4) of this section to FNS on a quarterly basis. This report must capture the total number of persons in all households which participated in each calendar month within the quarter.


(c) *Confidentiality of applicants and participants*—(1) *Confidential applicant and participant information.* Confidential applicant and participant information is any information about an applicant or participant, whether it is obtained from the applicant or participant, another source, or generated as a result of TEFAP application, certification, or participation, that individually identifies an applicant or participant and/or family member(s). Applicant or participant information is confidential, regardless of the original source and exclusive of previously applicable confidentiality provided in accordance with other Federal, State, or local law.


(2) *Limits on disclosure of information obtained from applicants or participants.* State and local agencies must restrict the use or disclosure of information obtained from TEFAP applicants or participants to persons directly connected with the administration or enforcement of the program. With the consent of the participant, the State or local agency may share information obtained with other health or welfare programs for use in determining eligibility for those programs, or for program outreach. However, the State agency must sign an agreement with the administering agencies for these programs to ensure that the information will be used only for the specified purposes, and that agencies receiving such information will not further share it.


(3) *Limits on disclosing the identity of persons making a complaint or allegation against an individual participating in or administering the program.* The State and local agency must protect the confidentiality, and other rights, of any person making allegations or complaints against another individual participating in, or administering TEFAP, except as necessary to conduct an investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding, as applicable.
