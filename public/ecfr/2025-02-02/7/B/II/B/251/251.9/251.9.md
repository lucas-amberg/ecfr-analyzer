# § 251.9   Matching of funds.

(a) *State matching requirement.* The State must provide a cash or in-kind contribution equal to the amount of TEFAP administrative funds received under § 251.8 and retained by the State agency for State-level costs or made available by the State agency directly to eligible recipient agencies that are not emergency feeding organizations as defined in § 251.3(e). The State agency will not be required to match any portion of the Federal grant passed through for administrative costs incurred by emergency feeding organizations or directly expended by the State agency for such costs in accordance with § 251.8(e)(4) of this part.


(b) *Exceptions.* In accordance with the provisions of 48 U.S.C. 1469a, American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands shall be exempt from the matching requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if their respective matching requirements are under $200,000.


(c) *Applicable contributions.* States shall meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section through cash or in-kind contributions from sources other than Federal funds which are prohibited by law from being used to meet a Federally mandated State matching requirement. Such contributions shall meet the requirements set forth in 2 CFR part 200, subpart D, and USDA implementing regulations at 2 CFR part 400. In accordance with the aforementioned regulations, as applicable, the matching requirement shall not be met by contributions for costs supported by another Federal grant, except as provided by Federal statute. Allowable contributions are only those contributions for costs which would otherwise be allowable as State or local-level administrative costs.


(1) *Cash.* An allowable cash contribution is any cash outlay of the State agency for a specifically identifiable allowable State- or local-level administrative cost, including the outlay of money contributed to the State agency by other public agencies and institutions, and private organizations and individuals. Examples of cash contributions include, but are not limited to, expenditures for office supplies, storage space, transportation, loading facilities and equipment, employees' salaries, and other goods and services specifically identifiable as State- or local-level administrative costs for which there has been a cash outlay by the State agency.


(2) *In-kind.* (i) Allowable in-kind contributions are any contributions, which are non-cash outlays, of real property and non-expendable personal property and the value of goods and services specifically identifiable with allowable State administrative costs or, when contributed by the State agency to an eligible recipient agency, allowable local-level administrative costs. Examples of in-kind contributions include, but are not limited to, the donation of office supplies, storage space, vehicles to transport the USDA Foods, loading facilities and equipment such as pallets and forklifts, and other non-cash goods or services specifically identifiable with allowable State-level administrative costs or, when contributed by the State agency to an eligible recipient agency, allowable local-level administrative costs. In-kind contributions shall be valued in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart D, and USDA implementing regulations at 2 CFR part 400, as applicable.


(ii) In order for a third-party in-kind contribution to qualify as a State-level administrative cost for purposes of meeting the match, all of the following criteria shall be met:


(A) In its administration of food assistance programs, the State has performed this type of function over a sustained period of time in the past;


(B) The function was not previously performed by the State on behalf of eligible recipient agencies; and


(C) The State would normally perform the function as part of its responsibility in administering TEFAP or related food assistance programs if it were not provided as an in-kind contribution.


(d) *Assessment fees.* States shall not assess any fees for the distribution of USDA Foods to eligible recipient agencies.


(e) *Reporting requirements.* State agencies must identify their matching contribution on the FNS-667, Report of TEFAP Administrative Costs, in accordance with § 251.10(b)(1).


(f) *Failure to match.* If, during the course of the fiscal year, the quarterly FNS-667 indicates that the State is or will be unable to meet the matching requirements in whole or in part, the Department shall suspend or disallow the unmatched portion of Federal funds subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section. If, upon submission of the final FNS-667 for the fiscal year, the Department determines that the State has not met the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section in whole or in part, the unmatched portion of Federal funds subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall be subject to disallowance by FNS.
