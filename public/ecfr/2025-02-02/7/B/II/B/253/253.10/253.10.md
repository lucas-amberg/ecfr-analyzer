# § 253.10   USDA Foods inventory management, storage, and distribution.

(a) *Control and accountability.* The State agency shall be responsible for the issuance of USDA Foods to households and the control of and accountability for the USDA Foods upon its acceptance of the USDA Foods at time and place of delivery.


(b) *USDA Foods inventories.* The State agency shall, in cooperation with the FNS Regional office, develop an appropriate procedure for determining and monitoring the level of USDA Foods inventories at storage facilities and at each local distribution point. The State agency shall maintain the inventories at proper levels taking into consideration, among other factors, household preferences and the historical and projected volume of distribution at each site. The procedures shall provide that USDA Foods inventories at each storage facility and each local distribution point are not in excess, but are adequate for, an uninterrupted distribution of USDA Foods.


(c) *Inventory management and control.* The State agency shall as a minimum ensure that: all USDA Foods are stored and inventory is maintained per §§ 250.12 and 250.14 of this chapter.


(d) *Distribution.* The State agency shall distribute USDA Foods only to households eligible to receive them under this part. If the State agency uses any other agency, administration, bureau, service, or similar organization to effect or assist in the certification of households or distribution of USDA Foods, the State agency shall impose upon such organization responsibility for determining that households to whom USDA Foods are distributed are eligible under this part. The State agency shall not delegate to any such organization its responsibilities to the Department for overall management and control of the Food Distribution Program. The State agency shall as a minimum ensure that:


(1) Notification is provided to certified households of the location of distribution sites and days and hours of distribution.


(2) An adequate supply of USDA Foods which are available from the Department is on hand at all distribution sites.


(3) Sufficient distribution sites, either stationary or mobile, are geographically located or routed in relation to population density of eligible households.


(4) Days and hours of distribution are sufficient for caseload size and convenience.


(5) Households are advised they may refuse any USDA Foods not desired, even if the USDA Foods are prepackaged by household size.


(6) Emergency issuance of USDA Foods will be made to households certified for expedited service in accordance with the provisions of § 253.7(a)(9).


(7) Eligible households or authorized representatives are identified prior to the issuance of USDA Foods.


(8) Authorized signatures are obtained for USDA Foods issued and the issue date recorded.


(9) Posters are conspicuously displayed advising program participants to accept only those USDA Foods, and in such quantities, as will be consumed by them.


(10) Complete and current records are kept of all USDA Foods received, issued, transferred, and on hand and of any inventory overages, shortages, and losses.


(11) A list of USDA Foods offered by the Department is displayed at distribution sites so that households may indicate preferences for future orders.


(e) *Improper distribution or loss of or damage of USDA Foods.* State agencies shall take action to obtain restitution in connection with claims arising in their favor for improper distribution, use or loss, or damage of USDA Foods in accordance with §§ 250.16 and 250.17 of this chapter.


(f) *Damaged or out-of-condition USDA Foods.* The State agency shall immediately notify the appropriate FNS Regional Office if any USDA Foods are found to be damaged or out- of-condition at the time of arrival, or at any subsequent time, whether due to latent defects or any other reason. The FNS Regional Office shall advise the State agency of the appropriate action to be taken with regard to such USDA Foods. If the USDA Foods are declared unfit for human consumption in accordance with § 250.15 of this chapter, they shall be disposed of as provided for under that section. When out-of-condition USDA Foods do not create a hazard to other food at the same location, they shall not be disposed of until the FNS Regional Office or the responsible contractor approves. When circumstances require prior disposal of USDA Foods, the quantity and manner of disposition shall be reported to the appropriate FNS Regional Office. If any damaged or out-of-condition USDA Foods are inadvertently issued to a household and are rejected or returned by the household because the USDA Foods were unsound at the time of issuance and not because the household failed to provide proper storage, care or handling, the State agency shall replace the damaged or out-of-condition USDA Foods with the same or similar kind of USDA Foods which are sound and in good condition. The State agency shall account for such replacements on its monthly inventory report.
