(a) *Conditions for distribution.* In jurisdictions where SNAP is in operation, there shall be no distribution of USDA Foods to households under the authority of any law, except that distribution may be made:


(1) On a temporary basis under programs authorized by law to meet disaster relief needs;


(2) For the purpose of the USDA Foods programs in accordance with the requirements of part 250 of this chapter and with other Federal regulations applicable to specific food assistance programs; and


(3) Whenever a request for concurrent or separate Food Distribution Program on a reservation is made by an ITO.


(b) *Concurrent or separate food program operation.* Distribution of USDA Foods under the Food Distribution Program, with or without SNAP, shall be made whenever an ITO submits to FNS a completed application for the Food Distribution Program on all or part of a reservation and the application is approved by FNS.


(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, when the Food Distribution Program is operating on all or part of a reservation, all eligible households within those boundaries may participate in the Food Distribution Program, or, if the ITO has elected concurrent operation of SNAP, may elect to participate in either program, without regard to whether the household is an Indian tribal household.


(2) FNS may determine, based on the number of non-Indian tribal households located on all or part of a reservation, that concurrent operation is necessary. When such a determination has been made all households residing in such areas may apply to participate in either SNAP or the Food Distribution Program.


(c) *Household distribution.* USDA Foods acquired under section 416 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended; section 32 of Public Law 320, 74th Congress, as amended; section 709 of the Food and Agricultural Act of 1963, as amended; and section 4(a) of the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973, as amended, by section 1304 of the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977, may be made available under part 250 of this chapter for distribution to households in accordance with the provisions of that part and the additional provisions and requirements of this part.


(d) *Food distribution program benefits.* Households eligible under this part shall receive a monthly food package based on the number of household members. The food package offered to each household shall consist of a quantity and variety of USDA Foods made available by the Department to provide eligible households with an opportunity to obtain a more nutritious diet and shall represent an acceptable nutritional alternative to SNAP benefits. The food package offered to each household by the State agency shall contain a variety of foods from each of the food groups in the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations Monthly Distribution Guide Rates by Household Size. FNS shall periodically notify State agencies of the kinds of USDA Foods it proposes to make available based, insofar as practicable, on the preferences of eligible households as determined by the State agency. In the event one or more of the proposed USDA Foods cannot be delivered, the Department shall arrange for delivery of a similar USDA Foods within the same food group. FNS shall periodically assess how the USDA Foods provided in the Food Distribution Program compares to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the market baskets of the Thrifty Food Plan and, to the extent practicable, will adjust the food package as needed to ensure that the food package benefit is in alignment. The food package benefit will not decrease based on this adjustment.
