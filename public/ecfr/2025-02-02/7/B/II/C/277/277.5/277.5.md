# § 277.5   Methods of payment.

(a) This section sets forth FNS methods for authorizing funds for State agencies.


(b) The “Letter of Credit” (LOC) (SF-1193A) is the document by which an official of FNS authorizes a State agency to draw funds from the United States Treasury. This shall be the preferred method of payment for State agencies which receive at least $120,000 per year and meet the requirements prescribed in 2 CFR part 200, subpart D and USDA implementing regulations 2 CFR part 400 and part 415.


(c) State agencies shall request payment(s) by submitting Request for Payment on Letter of Credit and Status of Funds Report (Treasury Form SF-183) to the appropriate United States Treasury Regional Disbursing Office with a copy to FNS.


(d) State agencies not meeting the requirements for the LOC method of payment or failing to meet LOC reporting requirements, including those requiring adjustments to cash balances to liquidate amounts owed to FNS, shall be provided funds by Treasury check in accordance with the provisions of Department of the Treasury Circular 1075.


(e) Payments for proper charges incurred by State agencies will not be withheld unless such payments are suspended or disallowed pursuant to § 277.16. When a payment is withheld, payment adjustments will be made in accordance with § 277.16. When FNS collects an indebtedness, whether due to a disallowance or an offset for amounts which the State agency has been billed but which it has failed to pay without cause acceptable to FNS, FNS shall provide reasonable notice to the State agency, and shall require appropriate accounting adjustment to cash balances for which the State agency is accountable to the Federal government to liquidate the indebtedness.
