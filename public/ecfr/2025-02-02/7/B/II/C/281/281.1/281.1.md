# ยง 281.1   General purpose and scope.

(a) These regulations govern the operation of SNAP on Indian reservations either separately or concurrently with the Food distribution program. In order to assure that SNAP is responsive to the needs of Indians on reservations, State agencies are required to consult with Indian tribal organizations about the implementation and operation of SNAP on reservations. Also, under certain specified conditions Indian tribal organizations on reservations can administer SNAP. The Act authorizes the Secretary to pay such amounts for administrative costs as are determined to be necessary for the effective operation of SNAP on Indian reservations.


(b) The operation of SNAP on Indian reservations is governed by all of the terms and conditions set forth in the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 as amended and the regulations of this chapter.


(c) Additionally, under no circumstances shall any household participate simultaneously in SNAP and the Food Distribution Program. Policy governing this prohibition is found in ยง 253.7(e).
