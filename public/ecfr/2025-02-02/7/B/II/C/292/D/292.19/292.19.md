# § 292.19   Requirements specific to ITO Summer EBT agencies.

(a) The ITO Summer EBT Agency must ensure that Summer EBT Program benefits are used by the eligible household that receives such benefits to transact for supplemental foods from retailers that have been approved for participation in the WIC Program. The ITO Summer EBT agency must:


(1) Use the same benefit delivery model for all participants throughout its service area, in accordance with its FNS-approved POM:


(i) For ITOs using a CVB-only benefit delivery model, issue a benefit level equal to the amount set forth in § 292.15(e); and


(ii) For ITOs using a food package benefit delivery model, a combination CVB and food package benefit delivery model, or an alternate benefit delivery model, issue a benefit not to exceed the amounts set forth in § 292.15(e);


(2) Ensure vendors charge prices for eligible food items which are reasonable for the area(s) served and are at the current price or less than the current price charged to other customers. Vendors may not charge Summer EBT participants more for an item than the price in the retail environment for all other customers;


(3) Provide participants supplemental foods deemed eligible for Summer EBT via an FNS-approved POM. Supplemental foods authorized for the WIC Program by the applicable WIC ITO must meet the requirements set forth in this paragraph (a)(3). The POM must identify a list of supplemental foods that:

(ii) Do not include infant formula and infant foods.


(b) ITO Summer EBT procedures and operations related to basic issuance requirements, reconciliation, benefit redemption, and functional and technical EBT system requirements, should be consistent with WIC regulations at § 246.12 of this chapter as applicable to the benefit delivery model used, to the extent such requirements do not conflict with the requirements set forth for ITO Summer EBT agencies in this part.


(c) To ensure effective vendor integrity, the ITO Summer EBT agency must set forth a system which ensures:


(1) Requirements and restrictions on the participation of vendors and the transaction of food benefits described at § 246.12 of this chapter, apply to activities involving Summer EBT benefits; and


(2) Vendors are subject to the actions and penalties described at § 246.12 of this chapter for noncompliance or violations involving Summer EBT benefits; and


(3) The standards for determination and disposition of claims against vendors described at § 246.12 of this chapter apply to Summer EBT benefits; or
