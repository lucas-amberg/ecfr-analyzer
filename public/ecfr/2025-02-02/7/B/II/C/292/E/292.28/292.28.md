(b) *General requirements on the procurement of goods and services with Federal funds.* All other Summer EBT agency and local agency costs, including eligibility systems, must comply with the requirements of this part and 2 CFR part 200, subpart D, and USDA implementing regulations in 2 CFR parts 400 and 415, as applicable, which implement the applicable requirements concerning the procurement of all goods and services with Federal funds.


(c) *Contractual responsibilities.* The standards contained in this part and 2 CFR part 200, subpart D, and USDA implementing regulations in 2 CFR parts 400 and 415, as applicable, do not relieve any Summer EBT agency or local agency of any contractual responsibilities under its contracts. The Summer EBT agency or local agency is the responsible authority, without recourse to USDA, regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in connection with the Program. This includes, but is not limited to, source evaluation, protests, disputes, claims, or other matters of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of law are to be referred to the local, State, or Federal authority that has proper jurisdiction.


(d) *Procedures.* The Summer EBT agency must follow either the State or ITO laws, policies and procedures as authorized by 2 CFR 200.317, or the procurement standards for other governmental grantees and all governmental subgrantees in accordance with 2 CFR 200.318 through 200.326. Regardless of the option selected, Summer EBT agencies must ensure that all contracts include any clauses required by Federal statutes and Executive orders and that the requirements in 2 CFR 200.236 and 2 CFR part 200, appendix II, are followed.
