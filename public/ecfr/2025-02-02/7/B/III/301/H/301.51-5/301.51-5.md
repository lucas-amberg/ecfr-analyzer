# ยง 301.51-5   Issuance and cancellation of certificates and limited permits.

(a) An inspector 
1 or person operating under a compliance agreement will issue a certificate for the interstate movement of a regulated article if he or she determines that the regulated article: 


(1)(i) Is apparently free of Asian longhorned beetle in any stage of development, based on inspection of the regulated article; or


(ii) Has been grown, produced, manufactured, stored, or handled in such a manner that, in the judgment of the inspector, the regulated article does not present a risk of spreading Asian longhorned beetle; and


(2) Is to be moved in compliance with any additional conditions deemed necessary under section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) 
2 to prevent the artificial spread of the Asian longhorned beetle; and 


(3) Is eligible for unrestricted movement under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated articles.


(b) An inspector or a person operating under a compliance agreement will issue a limited permit for the interstate movement of a regulated article not eligible for a certificate if he or she determines that the regulated article:


(1) Is to be moved interstate to a specified destination for specific processing, handling, or utilization (the destination and other conditions to be listed on the limited permit), and this interstate movement will not result in the spread of Asian longhorned beetle because Asian longhorned beetle will be destroyed by the specific processing, handling, or utilization; and


(2) It is to be moved in compliance with any additional conditions that the Administrator may impose under section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) in order to prevent the spread of the Asian longhorned beetle; and


(3) Is eligible for unrestricted movement under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated article.


(c) An inspector shall issue blank certificates and limited permits to a person operating under a compliance agreement in accordance with ยง 301.51-6 or authorize reproduction of the certificates or limited permits on shipping containers, or both, as requested by the person operating under the compliance agreement. These certificates and limited permits may then be completed and used, as needed, for the interstate movement of regulated articles that have met all of the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b), respectively, of this section.


(d) Any certificate or limited permit may be canceled orally or in writing by an inspector whenever the inspector determines that the holder of the certificate or limited permit has not complied with this subpart or any conditions imposed under this subpart. If the cancellation is oral, the cancellation will become effective immediately, and the cancellation and the reasons for the cancellation will be confirmed in writing as soon as circumstances permit. Any person whose certificate or limited permit has been cancelled may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving the written cancellation notice. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons that the person wants the Administrator to consider in deciding the appeal. A hearing may be held to resolve a conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice for the hearing will be adopted by the Administrator. As soon as practicable, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision.
