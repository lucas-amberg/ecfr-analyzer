# ยง 301.55-5   Issuance and cancellation of certificates and limited permits.

(a) An inspector 
1 may issue a certificate for the interstate movement of a regulated article if the inspector determines that:


(1) The regulated article to be moved and all other regulated articles on the premises have been grown and maintained indoors in a shadehouse or greenhouse and no other cactus moth host material exists on the premises outside of a shadehouse or greenhouse;


(2) The regulated article to be moved and all other regulated articles on the premises are maintained on benches that are kept separate from benches containing non-host material;


(3) The regulated article to be moved and all other regulated articles on the premises have been placed on a 21-day insecticide spray cycle and have been sprayed with *Bacillus thuringiensis* subsp. *kurstaki,* carbaryl, spinosad, or imidaploprid if maintained in the nursery for longer than 21 days;


(4) The regulated article to be moved has been sprayed with *Bacillus thuringiensis* subsp. *kurstaki,* carbaryl, spinosad, or imidaploprid 3 to 5 days prior to shipment and inspected and found free of cactus moth egg sticks and larval damage; and


(5) If the regulated article was moved into the premises from another premises in a quarantined area listed in ยง 301.55-3, it was immediately placed inside the shadehouse or greenhouse and sprayed with *Bacillus thuringiensis* subsp. *kurstaki,* carbaryl, spinosad, or imidaploprid within 24 hours.


(b) An inspector will issue a limited permit for the interstate movement of a regulated article if the inspector determines that:


(1) The regulated article is to be moved interstate to a specified destination for specified handling, processing, or utilization (the destination and other conditions to be listed in the limited permit), and this interstate movement will not result in the spread of the South American cactus moth because life stages of the South American cactus moth will be destroyed by the specified handling, processing, or utilization;


(2) It is to be moved in compliance with any additional conditions that the Administrator may impose under section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714) in order to prevent the spread of the South American cactus moth; and


(3) It is eligible for unrestricted movement under all other Federal domestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to the regulated article.


(c) Certificates and limited permits for the interstate movement of regulated articles may be issued by an inspector or person operating under a compliance agreement. A person operating under a compliance agreement may issue a certificate or limited permit for interstate movement of a regulated article after an inspector has determined that the regulated article is eligible for a certificate or limited permit in accordance with paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section.


(d) Any certificate or limited permit that has been issued may be canceled, either orally or in writing, by an inspector whenever the inspector determines that the holder of the limited permit has not complied with this subpart or any conditions imposed under this subpart. If the cancellation is oral, the cancellation will become effective immediately, and the cancellation and the reasons for the cancellation will be confirmed in writing as soon as circumstances permit. Any person whose certificate or limited permit has been canceled may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving the written cancellation notice. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons that the person wants the Administrator to consider in deciding the appeal. A hearing may be held to resolve a conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice for the hearing will be adopted by the Administrator. As soon as practicable, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision.
