# ยง 301.87-2   Regulated articles.

(a) *List of regulated articles.* The Deputy Administrator has determined that certain articles present a risk of spread of sugarcane diseases. A list of all such articles is found on the internet at *www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/plant-disease/sugarcane*. Lists of all regulated articles may also be obtained by request from any local Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) office; local offices are listed in telephone directories and on the internet at *www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/ppq-program-overview/sphd*.


(b) *Normal process for designating additional regulated articles.* (1) If the Deputy Administrator determines that an article not already listed at *www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/plant-disease/sugarcane* presents a risk of spread of sugarcane diseases, APHIS will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ proposing to designate the article as a regulated article for sugarcane diseases. The notice will provide the basis for this determination, and will request public comment.


(2) If no comments are received on the notice, or if the comments do not change the Deputy Administrator's determination, APHIS will publish a second notice in the _Federal Register_ designating the article as a regulated article for sugarcane diseases and listing it.


(c) *Immediate designation of regulated articles.* Any other article, product, or means of conveyance not already listed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section may be designated a regulated article on an immediate basis if an inspector determines that it presents a risk of spread of sugarcane diseases and provides actual notification to the person in possession of the article, product, or means of conveyance that it is now subject to the restrictions of this subpart.
