# ยง 301.91-2   Regulated articles.

(a) *List of regulated articles.* The Deputy Administrator has determined that certain articles present a risk of spreading European larch canker. A list of all such regulated articles is found on the internet at *www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/plant-disease/elc/european-larch-canker*. Lists of all regulated articles may also be obtained by request from any local Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) office; local offices are listed in telephone directories and on the internet at *www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/ppq-program-overview/sphd*.


(b) *Normal process for designating additional regulated articles.* (1) If the Deputy Administrator determines that an article not already listed at *www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/plant-disease/elc/european-larch-canker* presents a risk of spreading European larch canker, APHIS will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ proposing to designate the article as a regulated article for European larch canker. The notice will provide the basis for this determination, and will request public comment.


(2) If no comments are received on the notice, or if the comments do not change the Deputy Administrator's determination, APHIS will publish a second notice in the _Federal Register_ designating the article as a regulated article for European larch canker and listing it.


(c) *Immediate designation of regulated articles.* An inspector may designate any other product, article, or means of conveyance as a regulated article for European larch canker, if the inspector determines that it presents a risk of spreading European larch canker, and after the inspector provides actual notification to the person in possession of the product, article, or means of conveyance that it is subject to the restrictions of this subpart.
