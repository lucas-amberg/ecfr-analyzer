(a) *Freedom from plant debris.* All regulated articles moved under this subpart must be free from plant debris.


(b) *Certification.* Certification may be issued for the movement of regulated articles under the following conditions:


(1) *Certification on basis of inspection or nature of lot involved.* Regulated articles may be certified when they have been inspected by an inspector and found apparently free from infestation and infection, or without such inspection when the inspector determines that the lot for consignment is of such a nature that no danger of infestation or infection is involved.


(i) Persons intending to move any articles that may be certified must contact the local Plant Protection and Quarantine office as far as possible in advance of the contemplated date of shipment in order to request an inspection.


(ii) Persons intending to move any articles that may be certified must prepare, handle, and safeguard such articles from infestation or reinfestation, and assemble them at such points as the inspector may designate, placing them so that inspection may be readily made.


(2) *Certification on basis of treatment.* (i) Regulated articles for which treatments are approved underpart 305 of this chapter may be certified if such treatments have been applied in accordance with part 305 of this chapter and if the articles were handled after such treatment in accordance with a compliance agreement executed by the applicant for certification or under the supervision of an inspector.


(ii) Regulated articles certified after treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter that are taken aboard any ship, vessel, other surface craft, or aircraft must be segregated and protected in a manner as required by the inspector.


(c) *Limited permits.* (1) Limited permits 
1 may be issued by an inspector for the movement of certain noncertified regulated articles to restricted destinations.


(2) Limited permits may be issued by an inspector for the movement of regulated articles that would otherwise be prohibited movement under this subpart, if the articles are to be moved in accordance with ยง 318.13-6.


(3) Except when the regulations specify that an inspector must issue the limited permit, limited permits may be issued by a person operating under a compliance agreement.


(d) *Compliance agreements.* As a condition for the movement of regulated articles for which a compliance agreement is required, the person entering the compliance agreement must agree to the following:


(1) That he or she will use any permit or certification issued to him or her in accordance with the provisions in the permit, the requirements in this subpart, and the compliance agreement;


(2) That he or she will maintain at his or her establishment such safeguards against the establishment and spread of infestation and infection and comply with such conditions as to the maintenance of identity, handling (including post-treatment handling), and interstate movement of regulated articles and the cleaning and treatment of means of conveyance and containers used in such movement of the articles, as may be required by the inspector in each specific case to prevent the spread of infestation or infection; and


(3) That he or she will allow inspectors to inspect the establishment and its operations.


(e) *Attachment of limited permit or verification of certification.* Except as otherwise provided for certain air cargo and containerized cargo on ships moved in accordance with ยง 318.13-10, each box, bale, crate, or other container of regulated articles moved under certification or limited permit shall have the limited permit attached to the outside of the container or bear a U.S. Department of Agriculture stamp or inspection sticker verifying that the consignment has been certified in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section: *Provided*, That if a limited permit or certification is issued for a consignment of more than one container or for bulk products, certification shall be stamped on or the limited permit shall be attached to the accompanying waybill, manifest, or bill of lading.


(f) *Withdrawal of certification, transit permits, limited permits, or compliance agreements.* Any certification, transit permit, limited permit, or compliance agreement which has been issued or authorized may be withdrawn by an inspector orally or in writing, if such inspector determines that the holder thereof has not complied with all conditions under the regulations for the use of such document. If the cancellation is oral, the decision and the reasons for the withdrawal shall be confirmed in writing as promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose certification, transit permit, limited permit, or compliance agreement has been withdrawn may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving the written notification of the withdrawal. The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the certification, transit permit, limited permit, or compliance agreement was wrongfully withdrawn. The Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for such decision, as promptly as circumstances allow. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall be held to resolve such conflict. Rules of practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.


(g) *Container marking and identity.* Except as provided in ยง 318.13-6(c), consignments of regulated articles moved in accordance with this subpart must have the following information clearly marked on each container or on the waybill, manifest, or bill of lading accompanying the articles: Nature and quantity of contents; name and address of shipper, owner, or person shipping or forwarding the articles; name and address of consignee; shipper's identifying mark and number; and the certification stamp or number of the limited permit authorizing movement, if one was issued.


(h) *Refusal of movement.* An inspector may refuse to allow the interstate movement of a regulated article if the inspector finds that the regulated article is prohibited, is not accompanied by required documentation, is so infested with a plant pest or noxious weed that, in the judgment of the inspector, it cannot be cleaned or treated, or contains soil or other prohibited contaminants.


(i) *Costs and charges.* Services of the inspector during regularly assigned hours of duty at the usual places of duty shall be furnished without cost to the one requesting such services. APHIS will not assume responsibility for any costs or charges, other than those indicated in this section, in connection with the inspection, treatment, conditioning, storage, forwarding, or any other operation of any character incidental to the physical movement of regulated articles or plant pests.


(j) *APHIS not responsible for damage.* APHIS assumes no responsibility for any damage to regulated articles that results from the application of treatment or other measures required under this subpart (or under part 305 of this chapter) to protect against the dissemination of plant pests within the United States.
