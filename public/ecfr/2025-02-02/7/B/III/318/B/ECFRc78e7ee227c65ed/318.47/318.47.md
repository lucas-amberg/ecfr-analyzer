# ยง 318.47   Notice of quarantine.

(a) The Secretary of Agriculture having previously quarantined Hawaii and Puerto Rico on account of the pink bollworm of cotton (Pectinophora gossypiella Saunders) and the cotton blister mite (Eriophyes gossypii Banks), insect pests new to and not widely prevalent or distributed within and throughout the United States, now determines that it is necessary to extend the quarantine to prevent the spread of these insects from the Virgin Islands of the United States, where they are known to occur. 


(b) Under the authority of sections 411, 412, 414, and 434 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7711, 7712, 7714, and 7754), Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States are quarantined to prevent the spread of the aforementioned insect pests.

(d) As used in this subpart, unless the context otherwise requires, the term *State, Territory, or District of the United States* means State, the District of Columbia, Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands of the United States.
