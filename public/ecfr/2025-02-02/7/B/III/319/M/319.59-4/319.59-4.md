# § 319.59-4   Karnal bunt.

(a) *Regulated articles.* The following are regulated articles for Karnal bunt:


(1) Conveyances, including trucks, railroad cars, and other containers used to move host crops from a region listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that test positive for Karnal bunt through the presence of bunted kernels;


(2) Plant parts, including grain, straw, or hay, of all varieties of wheat (*Triticum aestivum*), durum wheat (*Triticum durum*), and triticale (*Triticum aestivum* × *Secale cereale*) from a region listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, except for straw/stalks/seed heads for decorative purposes that have been processed or manufactured prior to movement and are intended for use indoors;


(3) *Tilletia indica* (Mitra) Mundkur;


(4) Mechanized harvesting equipment that has been used in the production of wheat, durum wheat, or triticale that has tested positive for Karnal bunt through the presence of bunted kernels; and


(5) Seed conditioning equipment and storage/handling equipment that has been used in the production of wheat, durum wheat, or triticale seed found to contain the spores of *Tilletia indica.*

(b)(1) Karnal bunt is known to occur in the following regions: Afghanistan, India, Iran, Iraq, Mexico, Nepal, Pakistan, and South Africa.


(2) The Administrator may recognize an area within a region listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section as an area free of Karnal bunt whenever he or she determines that the area meets the requirements of the International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) No. 4, “Requirements for the establishment of pest free areas.” The international standard was established by the International Plant Protection Convention of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization and is incorporated by reference in § 300.5 of this chapter. APHIS will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ and maintain on an APHIS Web site a list of the specific areas that are approved as areas in which Karnal bunt is not known to occur in order to provide the public with current, valid information. Areas listed as being free from Karnal bunt are subject to audit by APHIS to verify that they continue to merit such listing.


(c) *Handling, inspection and phytosanitary certificates.* Unless otherwise prohibited under § 319.59-3 of this subpart, any articles described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section that are from a region listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be imported into the United States subject to the following conditions:


(1) The articles must be from an area that has been recognized, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, to be an area free of Karnal bunt, or the articles have been tested and found to be free of Karnal bunt;


(2) The articles have not been commingled prior to arrival at a U.S. port of entry with articles from areas where Karnal bunt is known to occur;


(3) The articles offered for entry must be made available to an inspector for examination and remain at the port until released, or authorized further movement pending release, by an inspector; and


(4) The articles must be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate issued by the national plant protection organization of the region of origin that includes the following additional declaration: “These articles originated in an area where Karnal bunt is not known to occur, as attested to either by survey results or by testing for bunted kernels or spores.”


(d) *Treatments.* (1) Prior to entry into the United States, the following articles must be cleaned by removing any soil and plant debris that may be present.


(i) All conveyances and mechanized harvesting equipment used for storing and handling wheat, durum wheat, or triticale that tested positive for Karnal bunt based on bunted kernels.


(ii) All grain storage and handling equipment used to store or handle seed that has tested spore positive or grain that has tested bunted-kernel positive.


(iii) All seed-conditioning equipment used to store or handle seed that has tested spore-positive.


(2) Articles listed in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii) of this section will require disinfection in addition to cleaning prior to entry into the United States if an inspector or an official of the plant protection organization of the country of origin determines that disinfection is necessary to prevent the spread of Karnal bunt. Disinfection is required for all seed conditioning equipment covered under paragraph (d)(1)(iii) prior to entry into the United States.


(3) Items that require disinfection prior to entry into the United States must be disinfected in accordance with part 305 of this chapter.
