# § 322.24   Packaging of transit shipments.

(a) Restricted organisms transiting the United States must be packaged in securely closed and completely enclosed containers that prevent the escape of organisms and the leakage of any contained materials. The container must be sufficiently strong and durable to prevent it from rupturing or breaking during shipment.


(b) In addition to the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section, each pallet of cages containing honeybees transiting the United States must be covered by an escape-proof net that is secured to the pallet so that no honeybees can escape from underneath the net.


(c) The outside of the package must be clearly marked with the contents of the transit shipment, *i.e.*, either “Live Bees,” “Bee Germ Plasm,” or “Live Bee Brood,” and the name of the exporting region.
