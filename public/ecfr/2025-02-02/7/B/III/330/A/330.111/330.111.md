# ยง 330.111   Advance notification of arrival of aircraft and watercraft.

The owner, operator, or other representative of any aircraft or watercraft entering the United States from a foreign country, or arriving in the continental United States from Hawaii or any territory or possession of the United States, shall provide every Plant Protection and Quarantine office (PPQ office) serving a port of arrival on the itinerary of the craft while in the United States with advance notification of intent to arrive at that port. This advance notification of arrival shall:


(a) Reach the appropriate PPQ office not less than 12 hours before the craft's estimated time of arrival at the port;


(b) Be communicated by radio, wire, telephone, or any other means; and


(c) Include the following information:


(1) The name or other identifying feature of the individual craft;


(2) The date and estimated time of arrival at the port;


(3) The location of arrival, providing the most site-specific data available, such as the dock, pier, wharf, berth, mole, anchorage, gate, or facility, and;


(4) The names of all foreign and non-Continental U.S. ports where any cargo, crew, or passenger destined for the continental United States has boarded the craft since its most recent arrival at a port in the United States.


(d) If the craft's estimated time of arrival changes by more than one hour, the PPQ office that serves the port of arrival must be notified and provided with updated information immediately.


(e) If the craft's site of arrival changes after a PPQ office has received advance notification of arrival, both that PPQ office and the newly affected PPQ office shall be notified of this change immediately. This applies, too, to site-specific changes involving watercraft.


(f) If the craft's point of arrival is an anchorage, the PPQ office shall be notified, as soon as possible after the craft's arrival at the anchorage, of the specific site, such as berth, mole, pier, to which the craft will be moving, as well as of its estimated time of arrival at that site.


(g) Aircraft and watercraft meeting any of the following conditions are exempt from the provisions in this section, and need not provide advance notification of arrival:


(1) The craft is not regularly used to carry passengers or cargo for a fee;


(2) The aircraft is making a flight scheduled in the Official Airline Guide, North American Edition, or the Official Airline Guide, Worldwide Edition, unless the scheduled time of arrival changes by more than one hour or the plane is diverted to another landing port;


(3) An inspector has precleared the aircraft in Hawaii, a territory or possession of the United States, or a foreign port, having determined that the aircraft contained only articles that are not prohibited or restricted importation into the United States under the provisions of 7 CFR chapter III and 9 CFR chapter I; or


(4) Personnel of the United States armed forces, including the U.S. Coast Guard, in Hawaii, a territory or possession of the United States, or a foreign port, have precleared an aircraft, having determined that the aircraft contained only articles that are not prohibited or restricted importation into the United States under the provisions of 7 CFR chapter III and 9 CFR chapter I.


(5) The owner, operator, or other representative of the aircraft or watercraft not leaving the United States has been informed in writing by a PPQ inspector that notification of intended arrival is not required at subsequent ports in the United States.
