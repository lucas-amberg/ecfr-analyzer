As a safeguard, the innermost package must be placed within another, larger package.

The packages must be able to withstand changes in pressure, temperature, and other climatic conditions incidental to shipment.

Packing material must be suited for the enclosed organism or article, as well as any medium in which the organism or article will be maintained.

(2) Shipping containers may be reused, provided that the container has not been contaminated with plant pests, noxious weeds, biological control organisms, or associated articles. Shipping containers that have been in contact with or otherwise contaminated with any of these items must be sufficiently sterilized or disinfected prior to reuse, or otherwise disposed of.


(d) *Costs.* Permittees who fail to meet the requirements of this section may be held responsible for all costs incident to inspection, rerouting, repackaging, subsequent movement, and any treatments.
