*PPQ.* The Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.


*Principal investigator.* The one individual who is designated by the entity to direct a project or program and who is responsible to the entity for the scientific and technical direction of that project or program.


*Recombinant nucleic acids.* (1) Molecules that are constructed by joining nucleic acid molecules and that can replicate in a living cell; or


(2) Molecules that result from the replication of those described in paragraph (1) of this definition.


*Responsible official.* The individual designated by an entity with the authority and control to ensure compliance with the regulations in this part.


*Security barrier.* A physical structure that is designed to prevent entry by unauthorized persons.


*Select agent and/or toxin.* A biological agent or toxin listed in ยง 331.3.


*Specimen.* Samples of material from humans, animals, plants, or the environment, or isolates or cultures from such samples, for diagnosis, verification, or proficiency testing.

*Synthetic nucleic acids.* (1) Molecules that are chemically or by other means synthesized or amplified, including those that are chemically or otherwise modified but can base pair with naturally occurring nucleic acid molecules (i.e., synthetic nucleic acids); or


(2) Molecules that result from the replication of those described in paragraph (1) of this definition.


*Toxin.* The toxic material or product of plants, animals, microorganisms (including, but not limited to, bacteria, viruses, fungi, or protozoa), or infectious substances, or a recombinant or synthesized molecule, whatever their origin and method of production, and includes:

(2) Any poisonous isomer or biological product, homolog, or derivative of such a substance.


*United States.* All of the States.


*USDA.* The U.S. Department of Agriculture.


*Validated inactivation procedure.* A procedure, whose efficacy is confirmed by data generated from a viability testing protocol, to render a select agent non-viable but allows the select agent to retain characteristics of interest for future use; or to render any nucleic acids that can produce infectious forms of any select agent virus non-infectious for future use.


*Verification.* The demonstration of obtaining established performance (*e.g.*, accuracy, precision, and the analytical sensitivity and specificity) specifications for any procedure used for diagnosis.


*Viability testing protocol.* A protocol to confirm the validated inactivation procedure by demonstrating the material is free of all viable select agent.
