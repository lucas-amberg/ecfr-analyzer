# ยง 460.12   Calculating PCCP amounts for WFRP.

(a) For the 2022 crop year, for eligible WFRP acres, the amount of premium support under PCCP for each acre will be $5, with a maximum equal to the amount of WFRP premium owed by the insured.


(b) PCCP amounts for WFRP are limited to the full amount of premium owed by the insured for the WFRP policy. If the full amount under PCCP would result in a negative premium balance for the insured, PCCP amounts will be limited to the full amount of premium owed.


(c) If the eligible WFRP acres are adjusted or revised for any reason, such as an overreporting of planted cover crop acres, the amount under PCCP will be based on the eligible WFRP acres after any such amendment.
