(b) *Issuance of marketing order with marketing agreement.* Whenever, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary executes a marketing agreement, and handlers also have executed the same as provided in section 8c(8) of the Act, he shall, if he finds that it will tend to effectuate the purposes of the Act, issue and make effective the marketing order, if any, which was filed as a part of his decision pursuant to ยง 900.13a: *Provided,* That the issuance of such order shall have been approved or favored by producers as required by section 8c(8) of the act.


(c) *Issuance of marketing order without marketing agreement.* If, despite the failure or refusal of handlers to sign the marketing agreement, as provided in section 8c(8) of the Act, the Secretary makes the determinations required under section 8c(9) of the Act, the Secretary shall issue and make effective the marketing order, if any, which was filed as a part of his decision pursuant to ยง 900.13a.


(d) *Effective date of marketing order.* No marketing order shall become effective less than 30 days after its publication in the _Federal Register,_ unless the Secretary, upon good cause found and published with the order, fixes an earlier effective date therefor: *Provided,* That no marketing order shall become effective as to any person sought to be charged thereunder before either (1) it has been filed with the Office of the Federal Register, or (2) such person has received actual notice of the issuance and terms of the marketing order.


(e) *Notice of issuance.* After issuance of a marketing order, such order shall be filed with the hearing clerk, and notice thereof, together with notice of the effective date, shall be given by publication in the _Federal Register._ (7 U.S.C. 610(c).)
