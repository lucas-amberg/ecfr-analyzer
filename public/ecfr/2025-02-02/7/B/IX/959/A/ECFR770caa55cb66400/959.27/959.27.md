The Secretary may select the members of the committee and alternates from nominations which may be made in the following manner:


(a) A meeting or meetings of producers and handlers shall be held for each district to nominate members and alternates for the committee. For nominations to the initial committee, the meetings may be sponsored by the United States Department of Agriculture or by any agency or group requested to do so by such department. For nominations for succeeding members and alternates on the committee, the committee shall hold such meetings or cause them to be held prior to June 15 of each year, after the effective date of this subpart, or by such other date as may be specified by the Secretary;


(b) At each such meeting at least one nominee shall be designated for each position as member and for each position as alternate member on the committee;


(c) Nominations for committee members and alternates shall be supplied to the Secretary in such manner and form as he may prescribe, not later than July 1 of each year, or by such other date as may be specified by the Secretary;


(d) Only producers may participate in designating producer nominees, and only handlers may participate in naming handler nominees. In the event a person is engaged in producing or handling onions in more than one district, such person shall elect the district within which he may participate as aforesaid in designating nominees;


(e) Regardless of the number of districts in which a person produces or handles onions, each such person is entitled to cast only one vote on behalf of himself, his agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and representatives in designating nominees for committee members and alternates. An eligible voter's privilege of casting only one vote as aforesaid shall be construed to permit a voter to cast one vote for each position to be filled in the respective district in which he elects to vote.
