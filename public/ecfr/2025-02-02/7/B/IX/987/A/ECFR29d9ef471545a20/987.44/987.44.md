(a) Whenever the Committee finds that the available supply of marketable dates of applicable grade and size available to supply the trade demand for free dates of any variety is likely to be excessive, and that limiting the volume of marketable dates to be handled as free dates through establishment of free and restricted percentages applicable to such variety of such dates would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act, it shall recommend such percentages to the Secretary. If the Secretary finds, upon the basis of the Committee's recommendation and supporting data or other information available to him, that the establishment of such percentages would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act, he shall establish such percentages. The sum of the free and restricted percentages for any crop year shall equal 100 percent.


(b) The dates handled by any handler in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be determined to be that handler's quota fixed by the Secretary within the meaning of section 8a(5) of the act.
