# § 987.52   Exemption.

(a) The Committee may exempt from regulation, upon written request of any producer or handler, the dates he sells to consumers through roadside stands, local date shops, mail order or specialty outlets, if it determines that the particular request is not likely to materially interfere with the objectives of this part. All dates handled pursuant to exemptions under this section shall be reported to the Committee in such manner and in such form as the Committee may prescribe. The Committee shall issue, with the approval of the Secretary, appropriate rules and regulations establishing the bases on which exemptions may be granted.


(b) The Committee may, with the approval of the Secretary, recommend that the handling of any date variety be exempted from regulations established pursuant to §§ 987.39 through 987.51 and §§ 987.61 through 987.72.
