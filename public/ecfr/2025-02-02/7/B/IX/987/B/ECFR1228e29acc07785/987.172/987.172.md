# § 987.172   Adjustment of assessment obligation, and late payment and interest charges.

(a) In accordance with §§ 987.45 and 987.72, the assessment obligation of FP dates shall be based on the weight of the dates at the time of inspection and certification. However, if such dates are subsequently processed and packed within the area of production, the assessment obligation shall be adjusted to reflect any increase in weight and the obligation shall be placed on the handler agreeing to assume it.


(b) Pursuant to § 987.72, the committee shall impose an interest charge on any handler whose assessment payment has not been received in the committee's office, or the envelope containing the payment legibly postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service, within 60 days of the invoice date shown on the handler's statement. The interest charge shall be a rate of one and one-half percent per month, and shall be applied to the unpaid assessment balance for the number of days all or any part of the unpaid balance is delinquent beyond the 60-day payment period.


(c) In addition to the interest charge specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the committee shall impose a late payment charge on any handler whose payment has not been received in the committee's office, or the envelope containing the payment legibly postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service, within 60 days of the invoice date. The late payment charge shall be 10 percent of the unpaid balance.
