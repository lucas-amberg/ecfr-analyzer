(b) Producer members representing cooperative bargaining association(s) shall be members of such associations, and the number of those members shall be equal to the product, rounded to the nearest whole number, obtained by multiplying 35 by the ratio the raisins acquired by handlers from bargaining association members are to the total acquisitions of all handlers during the preceding crop year.

(2) The remaining handler members shall be selected from and represent all other handlers, which would include all independent handlers and small cooperative marketing association(s) who acquired less than 10 percent of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year.
