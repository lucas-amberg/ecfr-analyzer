(a) *Lot* for the purposes of §§ 993.49 and 993.149 means any quantity of prunes delivered by one producer or one dehydrator to a handler on which inspection is requested: *Provided,* That a lot shall be limited to (1) the prunes contained in not more than 30 “ton box” containers or (2), if in other containers, not more than 60,000 pounds of prunes. If the prunes in any containers are markedly inferior in quality and condition to other prunes in the proffered lot, the containers shall be segregated into lots of reasonable uniform quality.


(b) *Lot* for the purposes of §§ 993.50 and 993.150 means:


(1) With respect to in-line inspection either (i) the aggregate quantity of prunes of the same size, other than those rejected by inspection, processed in any continuous production of one calendar day and packed during such day in one size and style of container or (ii) the aggregate quantity of prunes of the same size, other than those rejected by inspection, so processed and held in packing containers for later packaging.


(2) With respect to floor inspection either (i) prunes not previously inspected in-line, of the same size, in like containers, bearing the same identification (e.g., brand) if in consumer packages, and offered for inspection as a lot; or (ii) prunes previously inspected in-line but rejected as failing to meet requirements, of the same size, in like containers, processed in any continuous production of one calendar day, and offered for inspection as a new lot.
