# ยง 993.517   Identification.

The size category of the prunes in any lot shall be clearly marked by the handler on each consumer package of such prunes, on the parts or panels of the package or label which are normally presented in retail display, in terms of the applicable numerical or nomenclature designation prescribed in ยง 993.515, which designation shall not be lacking in prominence and conspicuousness. Any handler may, at his option, clearly mark on such consumer package additional information describing in numerical terms the average size count, or particular range of size counts, of the prunes in such lot so long as such numerical terms fall within the range of the size counts of the applicable numerical or nomenclature designation and do not tend to be deceptive as to the actual average size count, or range of the size counts, of the prunes in such lot. Descriptive terms other than synonyms of the prescribed nomenclature designation or words of like connotation, describing the style of pack, variety of prune, or other item of commercial significance may also be marked on the consumer package. Prunes in any lot of which the maximum size count is less than 25 shall be clearly marked by the handler in terms of the applicable numerical designation prescribed in ยง 993.515(a); and the handler may use nomenclature terms descriptive of size other than the nomenclature designations prescribed in ยง 993.515(b).
