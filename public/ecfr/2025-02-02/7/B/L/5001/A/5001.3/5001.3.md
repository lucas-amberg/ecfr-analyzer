Upon a negative determination, the Under Secretary will provide to the petitioner an opportunity to appeal a determination to the Under Secretary, and the petitioner will have 10 business days to appeal the determination and provide further information for consideration. The Under Secretary will make a determination of the appeal in not less than 15 days, but no more than 30 days.


(iii) Rural Development State Directors may also initiate a request to the Under Secretary to determine if an area is โrural in character.โ A written recommendation must document how the area meets the statutory requirements of paragraph (1)(i)(B) of this definition and discusses why the State Director believes the area is โrural in character,โ including, but not limited to, the area's population density, demographics, topography, and how the local economy is tied to a rural economic base. Upon receipt of such a request, the Administrator will review the request for compliance with the โrural in characterโ provisions and make a recommendation to the Under Secretary. Provided a favorable determination is made, the Under Secretary will consult with the applicable Governor and request comments within 10 business days, unless gubernatorial comments were submitted with the request. A public notice will be published by the State Office in accordance with paragraph (1)(ii) of this definition. There is no appeal process for requests made on the initiative of the State Director.


(2) An area that is attached to the urbanized area of a city or town with more than 50,000 inhabitants by a contiguous area of urbanized census blocks that is not more than two census blocks wide. Applicants from such an area should work with their Rural Development State Office to request a determination of whether their project is located in a rural area under this provision. This applies to areas that would not be considered a rural area because they are attached to the urbanized area of a city or town of greater than 50,000 inhabitants by a โstringโ area that is two census blocks wide or less (which are typically interstates or major highways). As long as the โstringโ area is two census blocks wide or less, the area outside of the urbanized area, beginning with the โstringโ area, may be considered rural. Once an area is approved as a string exception, any project within that area is eligible.


(3) For the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the island is considered Rural and eligible except for the San Juan Census Designated Place (CDP) and any other CDP with greater than 50,000 inhabitants. Areas within CDPs with greater than 50,000 inhabitants, other than the San Juan CDP, may be determined to be Rural if they are โnot urban in character.โ


(4) For the State of Hawaii, all areas within the State are considered rural and eligible except for the Honolulu CDP within the County of Honolulu and any other CDP with greater than 50,000 inhabitants. Areas within CDPs with greater than 50,000 inhabitants, other than the Honolulu CDP, may be determined to be rural if they are โnot urban in character.โ


(5) For the purpose of defining a rural area in the Republic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Agency shall determine what constitutes rural and rural Area based on available population data.


*Rural small business* means a small business that is located in a rural area or that can demonstrate the proposed project for which assistance is being applied for under this part is located in a rural area.


*Service area* means the area identified to be served.


*Significant ties* means, as determined by the agency, a facility under private control will carry out a public purpose and continue to primarily serve rural areas for CF projects (not applicable to public bodies and Federally Recognized Tribes) as evidenced by the following: Association with or control by a public body or bodies; or Broadly based membership and controlled primarily by members residing in the project service area. Membership must be open without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, or marital or familial status.


*Simple payback* means the estimated simple payback of a project funded under this part as calculated using paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this definition, as applicable.


(1) Energy efficiency improvement projects simple payback = (Total Project Costs) รท (Dollar value of energy saved).


(i) Energy saved will be determined by subtracting the projected energy (determined by the method in paragraph (1)(i)(B) of this definition) to be consumed from the historical energy consumed (determined by the method in paragraph (1)(i)(A) of this definition), and converting the result to a monetary value using a constant value or price of energy (determined by the method in paragraph (1)(i)(C) of this definition).


(A) Actual energy used in the original building and/or equipment, as applicable, prior to the EEI project, must be based on the actual average annual total energy used in British thermal units (BTU) over the most recent 12, 24, 36, 48, or 60 consecutive months of operation.


(B) Projected energy use if the proposed EEI project had been in place for the original building and/or equipment, as applicable, for the same time period used to determine that actual energy use under paragraph (1)(i)(A) of this definition.


(C) Value or price of energy must be the actual average price paid over the same time period used to calculate the actual energy used under paragraph (1)(i)(A) of this definition.


(ii) Energy efficiency improvement projects simple payback does not allow EEI to monetize benefits other than the dollar amount of the energy savings the agricultural producer or rural small business realizes as a result of the improvement.


(iii) Proposed additional energy consumption by a business which would result in greater savings if implemented is not considered in the payback calculation.


(2) Renewable energy systems projects simple payback = (total project costs) รท (dollar value of energy units replaced, credited, sold, or used and fair market value of byproducts as applicable in a typical year).


(i) Value of energy replaced will be calculated based on the borrower entity's historical energy consumption with actual average price paid for the energy replaced, following the methodology outlined in paragraph (1)(i) of this definition RES replacement projects which generate more energy than the applicant's historical records document, may add to the replacement value, the value obtained by taking the excess energy generated times a documented market price in order to derive at total dollar value of energy units replaced, credited, sold, or used.


(ii) Value of energy credited or sold will be calculated based on the amount of energy units to be sold at the proposed rate per unit, as documented in utility net metering or crediting policies and/or a purchase agreement.


(iii) If proposed energy will be used in a new facility (includes any direct-use project), value of energy used will be calculated based on the amount of energy units to be used at the documented price per unit of conventional fuel alternative.


(iv) Value of byproducts produced by and used in the project or related enterprises should be documented at the fair market value to be received for the byproducts in a typical year.


(v) Renewable energy systems projects simple payback does not include any one-time benefits such as but not limited to construction and investment-related benefits, nor credits which do not provide annual income to the project, such as tax credits. These benefits may be considered when appropriate for calculating repayment ability of guaranteed loans.


(vi) For RES projects that involve a shared meter with a residence where the cost of the system has been prorated, only the eligible prorated amount of energy attributed to the rural business or agricultural producer will be used in the payback calculation. For projects that involve in-eligible expenses other than residential, the full amount of energy production will be used in the payback calculation.


(3) Energy efficiency equipment and systems projects simple payback = (total project costs) รท (dollar value of efficiency savings). Efficiency savings will be determined by subtracting the annual value of energy to be consumed by the proposed energy efficient equipment from the annual value of energy that a conventional equipment alternative would have consumed. Adequate documentation must be provided for all consumption estimates and values utilized in the calculation.


*Small business* means an entity that meets the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this definition:


(1) An entity or utility, as applicable, as further defined in paragraphs (1)(i) through (iv) of this definition and meeting the requirements in paragraph (2) of this definition.

Size standards to be utilized are found in 13 CFR 121.201, and any successor regulation. The size standards themselves are expressed either in number of employees or annual receipts in millions of dollars, unless otherwise specified. The number of employees or annual receipts indicates the maximum allowed for an entity and its affiliates and are calculated using the following criteria:


(A) The number of employees is calculated using the guidance found in 13 CFR 121.106, and any successor regulation. The average number of employees is used based upon number of employees for each of the pay periods for the preceding 24 months. Part-time and temporary employees are counted as full-time employees. If the entity has not been in business for 24 months, the average number of employees is used for each of the pay periods during which it has been in business; or


(B) Annual receipts are calculated using the guidance found in 13 CFR 121.104, and any successor regulation.
