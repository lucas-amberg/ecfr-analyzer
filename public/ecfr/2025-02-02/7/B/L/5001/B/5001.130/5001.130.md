A review of the lender's performance will be completed to determine whether the lender has continually met the eligibility criteria described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.

A lender who is not active in the Agency guaranteed loan programs should provide evidence that they remain active in other commercial lending activity with acceptable underwriting and servicing performance. Lenders with loans that cause a loss to the Agency are a concern and those projects will be reviewed to determine the cause of the loss, including whether the lender's analysis or servicing processes were insufficient.


(v) The renewal will be for a term of 5 years.

(3) *Approval or disapproval.* The Agency will notify the non-regulated lending entity servicing tribal trust land whether its request to become a lender is approved or rejected. If the Agency rejects the request, the Agency will include in the notification the reason(s) for the rejection.


(4) *Renewals.* To maintain its status as an approved lender, the non-regulated lending entity serving Tribal trust land must submit a written request to the Agency for renewal of its approved lender status at least 60 and not more than 120 calendar days prior to the expiration of the existing lender's agreement to be assured of a timely renewal. A review of the lender's performance will be completed to determine whether the lender has continually met the eligibility criteria described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The lender's activity in the program and its delinquency/default rate will also be considered when making a determination regarding renewal. Any action by the lender since it was designated an eligible lender that could be cause for revoking its status, in accordance with § 5001.132, will be considered cause for denying the renewal of eligible status.
