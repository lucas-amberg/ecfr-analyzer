# ยง 520.7   Preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).

(a) *Actions requiring EIS.* An EIS will normally be prepared for: 


(1) Proposals for legislation which are determined to be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment; or,

(b) *Notice of intent.* If the responsible official recommends the preparation of an EIS, then the public shall be apprised of the decision. This notice shall be prepared according to 40 CFR 1508.22. 


(c) *Draft and final EIS.* The process of preparing the draft and final EIS, as well as the format, shall be according to 40 CFR parts 1502-1506.


(d) *Decisionmaking and implementation.* The responsible official may make a decision no sooner than thirty days after the notice of availability of the final EIS has been published in the _Federal Register_ by the Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 1506.10). The decision will be documented in a Record of Decision required by 40 CFR 1502.2, and monitoring and mitigation activities will be implemented as required by 40 CFR 1505.3.
