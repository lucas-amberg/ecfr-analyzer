# § 550.123   Financial reporting.

The Cooperator must submit financial reports at the interval required by the REE Agency, as identified on the Award Face Sheet, and may submit financial reports to the ADO electronically (refer to 2 CFR 200.335 Methods for collection, transmission, and storage of information).


(a) The OMB-approved SF-425, “Federal Financial Report,” may be used to report the financial status of an award; however, a financial report must contain an itemization of actual dollar amounts expended on the project during the reporting period (in line with the approved budget), and cumulative totals expended for each budget category from the start date of the award.


(b) Financial reporting due dates:


(1) Quarterly and semi-annual reports are due no later than 30 calendar days after the reporting period.


(2) Annual reports are due no later than 90 days following the end of the award anniversary date (*i.e.,* one year following the month and day when the period of performance begins, and each year thereafter up until a final report is required).


(c) Final financial report:


(1) Requests for extensions must be submitted to the ADO.


(2) Regardless of Agency-provided extensions for submission of the final financial report, funds will not be available for any drawdowns/payments that exceed statutory limits, as well as any expiring appropriations.
