# ยง 636.12   Termination of cost-share agreements.

(a) The State Conservationist may, independently or by mutual agreement with the parties to the cost-share agreement, terminate the cost-share agreement where:


(1) The parties to the cost-share agreement are unable to comply with the terms of the cost-share agreement as the result of conditions beyond their control;


(2) Termination of the cost-share agreement would, as determined by the State Conservationist, be in the public interest; or


(3) A participant fails to correct a violation of a cost-share agreement within the period provided by NRCS in accordance with ยง 636.13.


(b) If NRCS terminates a cost-share agreement, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section the State Conservationist may allow the participant to retain a portion of any payments received appropriate to the effort the participant has made to comply with the contract.


(1) NRCS may require a participant to provide only a partial refund of the payments received if a previously implemented conservation activity can function independently, and is not adversely affected by the violation or the absence of other conservation activities that would have been implemented under the cost-share agreement; and


(2) The State Conservationist will have the option to waive all or part of the liquidated damages assessed, depending upon the circumstances of the case.


(c) When making termination decisions, NRCS may reduce the amount of money owed by the participant by a proportion that reflects:


(1) The good faith effort of the participant to comply with the cost-share agreement; or


(2) The existence of hardships beyond the participant's control that have prevented compliance. If a participant claims hardship, that claim must be documented and cannot have existed when the applicant applied for participation in the program.
