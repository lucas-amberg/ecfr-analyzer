(2) A “limited resource farmer or rancher” means for this section a producer who is both:


(i) A producer whose direct or indirect gross farm sales do not exceed $100,000 in both of the two calendar years that precede the calendar year that corresponds to the relevant program year, adjusted upwards for any general inflation since fiscal year 2004, inflation as measured using the Prices Paid by Farmer Index compiled by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), and


(ii) A producer whose total household income is at or below the national poverty level for a family of four, or less than 50 percent of the county median household income for the same two calendar years referenced in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, as determined annually using Commerce Department data.
