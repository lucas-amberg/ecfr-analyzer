(f) For a loss due to livestock death to be considered eligible, the livestock death must have occurred in the county where the eligible loss condition occurred. The livestock death must be due to an eligible loss condition determined as eligible by the Deputy Administrator and not related to an eligible adverse weather event as specified in Subpart E for LIP.
