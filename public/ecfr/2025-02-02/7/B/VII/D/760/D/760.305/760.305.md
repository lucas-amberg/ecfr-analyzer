# § 760.305   Eligible grazing losses.

(a) A grazing loss due to drought is eligible for LFP only if the grazing loss for the covered livestock occurs on land that:


(1) Is native or improved pastureland with permanent vegetative cover or


(2) Is planted to a crop planted specifically for the purpose of providing grazing for covered livestock; and


(3) Is grazing land or pastureland that is owned or leased by the eligible livestock producer that is physically located in a county that is, during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland for the county, rated by the U.S. Drought Monitor as having a:


(i) D2 (severe drought) intensity in any area of the county for at least 8 consecutive weeks during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland for the county, as determined by the Secretary, or


(ii) D3 (extreme drought) or D4 (exceptional drought) intensity in any area of the county at any time during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland for the county, as determined by the Secretary. (As specified elsewhere in this subpart, the amount of potential payment eligibility will be higher than under (a)(3)(i) of this section where the D4 trigger applies or where the D3 condition as determined by the Secretary lasts at least 4 weeks during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland for the county.)


(b) A grazing loss is not eligible for LFP if the grazing loss due to drought on land used for haying or grazing under the Conservation Reserve Program established under subchapter B of chapter 1 of subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3831-3835a).


(c) A fire qualifies for LFP only if:


(1) The grazing loss occurs on rangeland that is managed by a Federal agency and


(2) The eligible livestock producer is prohibited by the Federal agency from grazing the normal permitted livestock on the managed rangeland due to a fire.


(d) An eligible livestock producer may be eligible for LFP payments only on those grazing lands incurring losses for which the livestock producer:


(1) Meets the risk management purchase requirements specified in § 760.104; or


(2) Does not meet the risk management purchase requirements specified in § 760.104 because the risk management purchase requirement is waived according to §§ 760.105, 760.106, or 760.107.
