# ยง 760.814   Calculation of acreage for crop losses other than prevented planted.

(a) Payment acreage of a crop is limited to the lesser of insured acreage or NAP covered acreage of the crop, as applicable, or actual acreage of the crop planted for harvest.


(b) In cases where there is a repeat crop or a multiple planted crop in more than one planting period, or if there is multiple cropped acreage meeting criteria established in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, each of these crops may be considered separate crops if the county committee determines that all of the following conditions are met:


(1) Were planted with the intent to harvest;


(2) Were planted within the normal planting period for that crop;


(3) Meet all other eligibility provisions of this part including good farming practices; and


(4) Could reach maturity if each planting was harvested or would have been harvested.


(c) In cases where there is multiple-cropped acreage, each crop may be eligible for disaster assistance separately if both of the following conditions are met:


(1) The specific crops are approved by the State committee as eligible multiple-cropping practices in accordance with procedures approved by the Deputy Administrator and separately meet all requirements, including insurance or NAP requirements ; and


(2) The farm containing the multiple-cropped acreage has a history of successful multiple cropping more than one crop on the same acreage in the same crop year, in the year previous to the disaster, or at least 2 of the 4 crop years immediately preceding the disaster crop year based on timely filed crop acreage reports.


(d) A participant with multiple-cropped acreage not meeting the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section may be eligible for disaster assistance on more than one crop if the participant has verifiable records establishing a history of carrying out a successful multiple-cropping practice on the specific crops for which assistance is requested. All required records acceptable to FSA as determined by the Deputy Administrator must be provided before payments are issued.


(e) A participant with multiple-cropped acreage not meeting the criteria in paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section must select the crop for which assistance will be requested. If more than one participant has an interest in the multiple cropped acreage, all participants must agree to the crop designated for payment by the end of the application period or no payment will be approved for any crop on the multiple-cropped acreage.


(f) Benefits under this part apply to irrigated crops where, in cases determined by the Deputy Administrator, acreage was affected by a lack of surface irrigation water due to drought or contamination of ground water or surface irrigation water due to saltwater intrusion. In no case is a loss of ground water, for any reason, an eligible cause of loss.
