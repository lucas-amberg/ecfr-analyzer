(c) Each dairy producer that has an interest in the dairy operation will be jointly and severally liable for any refund and related charges found to be due to FSA.


(d) Interest will be applicable to any refunds to FSA required in accordance with 7 CFR parts 792 and 1403. Such interest will be charged at the rate that the U.S. Department of the Treasury charges FSA for funds, and will accrue from the date FSA made the payment to the date the refund is repaid.
