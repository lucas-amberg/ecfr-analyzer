Reliable production records are required to substantiate the reported amount of affected production for applications not based on the total dollar value loss.

(1) Warehouse grading sheets;


(2) Settlement sheets;


(3) Sales receipts showing grade and price or disposition to secondary market due to quality; and


(4) Laboratory test results.

(1) Retaining, providing, and summarizing, at time of application and whenever required by FSA, the best available verifiable production records for the crop;


(2) Providing the information in a manner that can be easily understood by the FSA county committee; and


(3) Providing supporting documentation about the disaster event if the FSA county committee has reason to question the disaster event.


(e) Participants must provide all records for any production of a crop that is grown with an arrangement, agreement, or contract for guaranteed payment.
