# ยง 760.1812   Payment calculation.

(a) Payments will be calculated separately for crops based on the crop type, intended use, certified organic or conventional status, county, and crop year.


(b) For forage crops with verifiable documentation of nutrient factors for the affected production and for the 3 preceding crop years, the payment will be equal to the producer's total affected production multiplied by the producer's verifiable percentage of loss, multiplied by the average market price, multiplied by 70 percent.


(c) For forage crops with verifiable documentation of nutrient factors for the affected production but not for the 3 preceding crop years, the payment will be equal to the producer's total affected production multiplied by the county average percentage of loss in paragraph (f) of this section, multiplied by the average market price, multiplied by 70 percent, multiplied by 50 percent.


(d) For crops other than forage with verifiable documentation of the total dollar value loss due to quality, the payment will be equal to the producer's total dollar value loss on the affected production, multiplied by 70 percent.


(e) For crops other than forage without verifiable documentation of the total dollar value loss but with verifiable documentation of grading factors, the payment will be equal to the producer's affected production multiplied by the county average loss per unit of measure in paragraph (g) of this section, multiplied by 70 percent, multiplied by 50 percent.


(f) The county average percentage of loss is the average percentage of loss from producers eligible for payment under paragraph (b) of this section if at least 5 producers in a county are eligible for payment for a crop under paragraph (b) of this section. If less than 5 producers in a county are eligible for payment for a crop under paragraph (b) of this section, the Deputy Administrator will:


(1) Determine a county average percentage of loss based on the best available data, including, but not limited to, evidence of losses in contiguous counties; or


(2) If a county average percentage of loss cannot be determined due to insufficient data, not issue payments to applicants under paragraph (c) of this section.


(g) The county average loss per unit of measure is based on the weighted average sales price from producers eligible for payment under paragraph (d) of this section if at least 5 producers in a county are eligible for payment for a crop under paragraph (d) of this section. If less than 5 producers are eligible for payment in a county under paragraph (d) of this section, the Deputy Administrator will:


(1) Determine a county average loss per unit of measure based on the best available data, including, but not limited to, evidence of losses in contiguous counties; or


(2) If a county average loss per unit of measure cannot be determined due to insufficient data, not issue payments to applicants under paragraph (e) of this section.
