# ยง 782.10   Identification of commodities subject to end-use certificate regulations.

(a) The regulations in this part are applicable to wheat and barley, respectively, imported into the U.S. from any foreign country, as defined in 19 CFR 134.1, or instrumentality of such foreign country that, as of April 8, 1994, required end-use certificates for imports of U.S.-produced wheat or barley.


(b) Because Canada is the only country with such requirements on wheat, and no country has an end-use certificate requirement for barley, only wheat originating in Canada is affected by the regulations in this part.
