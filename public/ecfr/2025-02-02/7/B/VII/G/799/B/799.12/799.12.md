# § 799.12   Emergency circumstances.

(a) If emergency circumstances exist that make it necessary to take action to mitigate harm to life, property, or important natural, cultural, or historic resources, FSA may take an action with significant environmental impact without complying with the requirements of this part.


(b) If emergency circumstances exist, the NECM will consult with CEQ as soon as feasible about alternative NEPA arrangements for controlling the immediate impact of the emergency, as specified in 40 CFR 1506.11.


(c) If emergency circumstances exist, the FPO will follow the emergency procedures specified in 36 CFR 800.12 regarding preservation of historic properties, if applicable.


(d) FSA assistance provided in response to a Presidentially-declared disaster under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 5121—5207, is exempt from NEPA requirements, as specified in 42 U.S.C. 5159. Under a Presidentially-declared disaster, the following actions to specifically address immediate post-emergency health or safety hazards are exempt from environmental compliance requirements:


(1) Clearing roads and constructing temporary bridges necessary for performing emergency tasks and essential community services;

(3) Demolishing unsafe structures that endanger the public or could create a public health hazard if not demolished;


(4) Disseminating public information and assistance for health and safety measures;


(5) Providing technical assistance to State, regional, local, or Tribal governments on disaster management control;


(6) Reducing immediate threats to life, property, and public health and safety; and


(7) Warning of further risks and hazards.


(c) Proposed actions other than those specified in paragraph (d) of this section that are not specifically to address immediate post-emergency health or safety hazards require the full suite of environmental compliance requirements and are not exempt.
