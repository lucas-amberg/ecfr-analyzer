# § 800.175   Termination of licenses.

(a) *Term of license.* Each license shall terminate in accordance with the termination date shown on the license and as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The termination date for a license shall be no less than 5 years or more than 6 years after the issuance date for the initial license; thereafter, every 5 years. Upon request of a licensee and for good cause shown, the termination date may be advanced or delayed by the Administrator for a period not to exceed 60 days.


(b) *Termination schedule for licenses.* Subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, licenses shall terminate on the last day of the month shown in the following schedule:


(c) *Termination notices.* The Service shall issue notice of termination to licensees and to their employers at least 60 days before the termination date. The notice shall (1) provide detailed instructions for requesting renewal of licenses; (2) state whether a reexamination will be required; and (3) if a reexamination will be required, show the nature and scope of the reexamination. Failure to receive a notice from the Service shall not exempt a licensee from the responsibility of having the license renewed on or before the termination date.


(d) *Renewal of licenses.* Licenses that are renewed shall show the permanent license number, the date of renewal, and the word “Renewed.”


(e) *Termination of suspended licenses.* Any suspension of a license, including voluntary suspension or suspension by change in employment, shall not affect the termination date of the license. If a licensee applies for renewal of the license prior to the termination date, the license will not terminate during the period of suspension.


(f) *Surrender of license.* Each license that is terminated, suspended, or canceled under the provisions of §§ 800.175 through 800.178 or is suspended, revoked, or not renewed for cause under the provisions of § 800.179 shall be promptly surrendered to the field office.


(g) *Marking terminated, canceled, or revoked licenses.* Each terminated, canceled, or revoked license surrendered to the Service shall be marked “Canceled.”
