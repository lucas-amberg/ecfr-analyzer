# § 800.71   Fees assessed by the Service.

(a) *Official inspection and weighing services.* The fees described for Direct Service in paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply to official inspection and weighing services performed by the Service in the U.S. and Canada. The fees described for Supervision in paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply to official domestic inspection and weighing services performed by delegated States and designated agencies, including land carrier shipments to Canada and Mexico. The fees charged to delegated States by the Service are set forth in the State's Delegation of Authority document. Failure of a delegated State or designated agency to pay the appropriate fees to the Service within 30 days after becoming due will result in an automatic termination of the delegation or designation. The delegation or designation may be reinstated by the Service if fees that are due, plus interest and any further expenses incurred by the Service because of the termination, are paid within 60 days of the termination.


(1) *Direct Service—Fees for official inspection and weighing services performed by the Service in the United States and Canada.* For each calendar year, the Service will calculate Direct Service fees as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The Service will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ and post Direct Service fees on its public website.


(2) *Supervision—Fees for supervision of official inspection and weighing services performed by delegated States and designated agencies in the United States.* The Service will assess a Supervision fee per metric ton of domestic U.S. grain shipments inspected or weighed, or both, including land carrier shipments to Canada and Mexico. For each calendar year, the Service will calculate Supervision fees as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. The Service will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ and post the Supervision fees on its public website.


(b) *Annual review of tonnage fees.* For each calendar year, the Service will review and adjust fees included in this section and publish fees each year according to the following:


(1) *Tonnage fees.* Tonnage fees for Direct Service in paragraph (a)(1) of this section will consist of the national tonnage fee and local tonnage fees and the Service will calculate and round the fee to the nearest $0.001 per metric ton. All outbound grain officially inspected and/or weighed by the Field Offices will be assessed the national tonnage fee plus the appropriate local tonnage fee. Export grain officially inspected and/or weighed by delegated States and official agencies, excluding land carrier shipments to Canada and Mexico, will be assessed the national tonnage fee only. The fees will be set according to the following:


(i) *National tonnage fee.* The national tonnage fee is the national program administrative costs for the previous fiscal year divided by the average yearly tons of export grain officially inspected and/or weighed by delegated States and designated agencies, excluding land carrier shipments to Canada and Mexico, and outbound grain officially inspected and/or weighed by the Service, during the previous 5 fiscal years.


(ii) *Local tonnage fee.* The local tonnage fee is the Field Office administrative costs for the previous fiscal year divided by the average yearly tons of outbound grain officially inspected and/or weighed by the Field Office during the previous 5 fiscal years. The local tonnage fee is calculated individually for each Field Office.


(2) [Reserved]


(c) *Annual review of hourly and unit fees.* The Service will calculate the rate for program services, per hour per program employee using the following formulas:


(1) *Regular rate.* The total direct pay of program personnel performing grading, weighing, laboratory services, and equipment testing divided by the total direct hours for the previous year, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage cost-of-living increase, plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. If applicable, travel expenses will be added to the cost of providing the service through the operating rate or the travel will be billed separately.


(2) *Overtime rate.* The total direct pay of program personnel performing grading, weighing, laboratory services, and equipment testing divided by the total direct hours for the previous year, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage cost-of-living increase and then multiplied by 1.5, plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. If applicable, travel expenses will be added to the cost of providing the service through the operating rate or the travel will be billed separately.


(3) *Holiday rate.* The total direct pay of program personnel performing grading, weighing, laboratory services, and equipment testing divided by the total direct hours for the previous year, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage cost-of-living increase and then multiplied by 2, plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. If applicable, travel expenses will be added to the cost of providing the service through the operating rate or the travel will be billed separately.


(4) *Benefits rate, operating rate, and allowance for bad debt rate.* For each calendar year, based on previous fiscal year costs, the Service will calculate the benefits rate, operating rate, and allowance for bad debt rate as follows:


(i) *Benefits rate.* The total direct benefits costs of program personnel performing grading, weighing, laboratory services, and equipment testing divided by the total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the next calendar year's percentage cost-of-living increase.


(ii) *Operating rate.* The total operating costs of program personnel performing grading, weighing, laboratory services, and equipment testing divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the percentage of inflation.


(iii) *Allowance for bad debt rate.* The total allowance for bad debt for personnel performing grading, weighing, laboratory services, and equipment testing divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked.


(5) *Cost of living and inflation factors.* The Service will use the most recent economic factors released by the Office of Management and Budget for budget development purposes to derive the cost-of-living expenses and percentage of inflation factors used in the formulas in this section.


(6) *Operating reserve adjustment.* The Service will review the operating reserve at the end of each fiscal year and adjust the fees as needed to ensure an operating reserve of 3 to 6 months of expenses. This adjustment is included in the calculation for operating cost.


(d) *Annual review of Supervision fees.* Fees for Supervision in paragraph (a)(2) of this section will be set according to the following:


(1) *Supervision tonnage fee.* The supervision tonnage fee is the sum of the prior fiscal year program costs plus an operating reserve adjustment divided by the average yearly tons of domestic U.S. grain shipments inspected or weighed, or both, including land carrier shipments to Canada and Mexico, during the previous 5 fiscal years. If the calculated value is zero or a negative value, the Service will suspend the collection of supervision tonnage fees for 1 calendar year.


(2) *Operating reserve adjustment.* The operating reserve adjustment is the supervision program costs for the previous fiscal year divided by 2, less the end of previous fiscal year operating reserve balance.


(e) *Periodic review.* The Service will periodically review and adjust all Direct Service and Supervision fees in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, respectively, as necessary to ensure they reflect the true cost of providing and supervising official service. This process will incorporate any fee adjustments from paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.


(f) *Miscellaneous fees for other services.* For each calendar year, the Service will review fees included in this section and publish fees in the _Federal Register_ and on its public website.


(1) *Registration certificates and renewals.* The fee for registration certificates and renewals will be published annually in the _Federal Register_ and on the Service's public website, and the Service will calculate the fee using the noncontract hourly rate published pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section multiplied by 5. If you operate a business that buys, handles, weighs, or transports grain for sale in foreign commerce, or you are in a control relationship with respect to a business that buys, handles, weighs, or transports grain for sale in interstate commerce, you must complete an application and pay the published fee.


(2) *Designation amendments.* The fee for amending designations will be published annually in the _Federal Register_ and on the Service's public website. The Service will calculate the fee using the cost of publication plus 1 hour at the noncontract hourly rate. If submitting an application to amend a designation, the published fee must be paid.
