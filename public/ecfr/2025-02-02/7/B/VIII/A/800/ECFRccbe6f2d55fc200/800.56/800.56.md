# § 800.56   Requirements on descriptions.

Section 13 of the Act contains certain prohibitions with respect to the use of official grade designations, official marks, and other representations with respect to grain.


(a) The use of an official grade designation, with or without factor information, or of official criteria information, or of the term “official grain standards,” shall not, without additional information, be considered to be a representation that the grain was officially inspected.


(b) The use of any symbol or term listed as an official mark, at § 800.0(b)(68), with respect to grain shall be considered to be a representation of official service under the Act: Provided however, that the use of the official marks “official certificate;” “officially inspected;” “official inspection;” “officially weighed;” “official weight;” and “official weighing” shall not be considered to be a representation of official service under the Act if it is clearly shown that the activity occurred under the U.S. Warehouse Act (7 U.S.C. 241 *et seq.*): Provided further, that the use of the official mark “officially tested” with respect to grain inspection and weighing equipment shall not be considered to be a representation of testing under the Act if it is clearly shown that the equipment was tested under a State statute.
