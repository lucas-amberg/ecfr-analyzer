(a) *Rounding.* Percentages are determined on the basis of weight and are rounded as follows:


(1) When the figure to be rounded is followed by a figure greater than or equal to 5, round to the next higher figure; e.g., report 6.36 as 6.4, 0.35 as 0.4, and 2.45 as 2.5.


(2) When the figure to be rounded is followed by a figure less than 5, retain the figure, e.g., report 8.34 as 8.3 and 1.22 and 1.2.


(b) *Recording.* The percentage of broken kernels removed by a 5 plate in U.S. Nos. 1 and 2 Milled Rice and the percentage of objectionable seeds in U.S. No. 1 Brewers Milled Rice is reported to the nearest hundredth percent. The percentages of all other factors are recorded to the nearest tenth of a percent.
