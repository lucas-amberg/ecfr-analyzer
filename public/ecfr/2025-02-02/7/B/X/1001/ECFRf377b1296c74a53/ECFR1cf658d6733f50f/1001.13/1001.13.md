# § 1001.13   Producer milk.

*Producer milk* means the skim milk (or the skim equivalent of components of skim milk) and butterfat contained in milk of a producer that is:


(a) Received by the operator of a pool plant directly from a producer or from a handler described in § 1000.9(c). Any milk which is picked up from the producer's farm in a tank truck under the control of the operator of a pool plant or a handler described in § 1000.9(c) but which is not received at a plant until the following month shall be considered as having been received by the handler during the month in which it is picked up at the farm. All milk received pursuant to this paragraph shall be priced at the location of the plant where it is first physically received;


(b) Received by the operator of a pool plant or a handler described in § 1000.9(c) in excess of the quantity delivered to pool plants subject to the following conditions:


(1) The producers whose farms are outside of the states included in the marketing area and outside the states of Maine or West Virginia shall be organized into state units and each such unit shall be reported separately; and


(2) For pooling purposes, each reporting unit must satisfy the shipping standards specified for a supply plant pursuant to § 1001.7(c);


(c) Diverted by a proprietary pool plant operator to another pool plant. Milk so diverted shall be priced at the location of the plant to which diverted; or


(d) Diverted by the operator of a pool plant or by a handler described in § 1000.9(c) to a nonpool plant, subject to the following conditions:


(1) Milk of a dairy farmer shall not be eligible for diversion unless one day's milk production of such dairy farmer was physically received as producer milk and the dairy farmer has continuously retained producer status since that time. If a dairy farmer loses producer status under the order in this part (except as a result of a temporary loss of Grade A approval), the dairy farmer's milk shall not be eligible for diversion unless milk of the dairy farmer has been physically received as producer milk at a pool plant during the month;


(2) Of the total quantity of producer milk received during the month (including diversion but excluding the quantity of producer milk received from a handler described in § 1000.9(c) or which is diverted to another pool plant), the handler diverted to nonpool plants not more than 80 percent during each of the months of September through November and 90 percent during each of the months of January through August and December. In the event that a handler causes the milk of a producer to be over diverted, a dairy farmer will not lose producer status;


(3) Diverted milk shall be priced at the location of the plant to which diverted.


(4) Any milk diverted in excess of the limits set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall not be producer milk. The diverting handler shall designate the dairy farmer deliveries that shall not be producer milk. If the handler fails to designate the dairy farmer deliveries which are ineligible, producer milk status shall be forfeited with respect to all milk diverted to nonpool plants by such handler; and


(5) The delivery day requirement and the diversion percentages in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section may be increased or decreased by the Market Administrator if the Market Administrator finds that such revision is necessary to assure orderly marketing and efficient handling of milk in the marketing area. Before making such a finding, the Market Administrator shall investigate the need for the revision either on the Market Administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested persons if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired to be effective. If the investigation shows that a revision might be appropriate, the Market Administrator shall issue a notice stating that the revision is being considered and inviting written data, views, and arguments. Any decision to revise an applicable percentage or delivery day requirement must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.


(e) Producer milk shall not include milk of a producer that is subject to inclusion and participation in a marketwide equalization pool under a milk classification and pricing program imposed under the authority of another government entity.
