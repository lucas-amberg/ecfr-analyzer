(a) In the event that any member or alternate of the Board ceases to work for or be affiliated with the domestic manufacturer or importer, or ceases to do business in the group or region from which the member or alternate was appointed to the Board, such position shall automatically become vacant.


(b) The Board may recommend to the Secretary that a member or alternate be removed from office if the member or alternate consistently refuses to perform his or her duties or engages in dishonest acts or willful misconduct. The Secretary may remove the member or alternate if he or she finds that the Board's recommendation shows adequate cause. Further, without recommendation of the Board, a member or alternate may be removed by the Secretary upon showing of adequate cause, including the failure by a member or alternate to submit reports or remit assessments required under this part, if the Secretary determines that such member's or alternate's continued service would be detrimental to the achievement of the purposes of the Act.


(c) If a position becomes vacant, nominations to fill the vacancy may be conducted using the nominations process set forth in ยง 1217.41 or the Board may nominate eligible persons. A vacancy will not be required to be filled if the unexpired term is less than 6 months.
