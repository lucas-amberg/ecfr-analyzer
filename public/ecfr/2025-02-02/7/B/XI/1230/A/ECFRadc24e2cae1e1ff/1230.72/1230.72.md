Assessments remitted to the Board shall be distributed as follows:


(a) Each State association shall receive on a monthly basis, a percentage determined by the Delegate Body or 16.5 percent, whichever is higher, of the net assessments attributable to that State. The net assessments attributable to a State is the total amount of assessments received from producers in a State.


(b) A State association which was conducting a pork promotion program in the period from July 1, 1984 to June 30, 1985, shall receive additional amounts at such times as the Board may determine, so that the total amount received on an annual basis would be equal to the amount that would have been collected in such State pursuant to the pork promotion program in existence in such State from July 1, 1984, to June 30, 1985, had the porcine animals subject to assessment, been produced from July 1, 1984, to June 30, 1985, and been subject to the rates of assessment then in effect from such State to the Council and other national entities involved in pork promotion, research, and consumer information. This paragraph shall apply to a State association only if the annual amount determined under this paragraph would be greater than the annual amount determined under paragraph (a) of this section.


(c) The Council shall receive on a monthly basis 35 percent of the net assessments until after the referendum is conducted, and 25 percent thereafter and until 12 months after the referendum.
