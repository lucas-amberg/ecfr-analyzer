(ii) A representative of the State FSA office determines, based on the magnitude and complexity of the change represented, the increase in agricultural land supports additional persons or legal entities to the farming operation; or


(4) A change in ownership by sale or gift of equipment from a person or legal entity previously engaged in a farming operation to a person or legal entity that has not been involved in the operation. The sale or gift of equipment will be considered to be bona fide and substantive only if:

(5) A change in ownership by sale or gift of land or livestock from a person or legal entity who previously has been engaged in a farming operation to a person or legal entity that has not been involved in the operation. The sale or gift of land or livestock will be considered to be bona fide and substantive only if:

(ii) The sale or gift of land or livestock was based on land's or livestock's fair market value;
