# ยง 1400.503   Commensurate reduction.

(a) Any program payment or benefit subject to this subpart provided to a legal entity, general partnership, or joint venture will be reduced by an amount commensurate with the direct and indirect ownership interest in the legal entity, general partnership, or joint venture of each person or legal entity determined to have an average adjusted gross income in excess of the applicable limitation under the standards provided elsewhere in this subpart for the direct recipient of the payments.


(b) Ownership interest in a legal entity will be reviewed to the fourth level of ownership, as specified in ยง 1400.105, to determine whether a commensurate reduction is applicable and the extent of the reduction. If an ownership interest is not held by a person in the fourth level of ownership in a legal entity, no payment or benefit will be made with respect to the interest.
