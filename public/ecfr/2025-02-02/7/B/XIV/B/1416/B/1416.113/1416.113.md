# ยง 1416.113   Milk losses due to H5N1.

(a) Payments for milk losses due to H5N1 are based on a standard number of days of lost production and the expected production for an eligible adult dairy cow. The payment for milk losses due to H5N1 is equal to the payment rate per head specified in paragraph (b) of this section, multiplied by the number of eligible adult dairy cows specified in ยง 1416.109(g), multiplied by the producer's share of milk production from the eligible adult dairy cows, multiplied by the national payment rate specified in ยง 1416.109(d).


(b) The payment rate per head varies by month and is equal to the expected milk production loss for an eligible adult dairy cow, as determined by FSA, multiplied by the all-milk price. The applicable payment rate will be determined by the month in which an eligible adult dairy cow was removed from milk production, as reported on the application. To determine the expected milk production loss for an eligible adult dairy cow, FSA will:


(1) Determine the daily expected production by dividing the total expected production for 28 days of production, as determined by FSA based on a month-specific national production value obtained from NASS data, by 28 days; and


(2) Calculate the sum of:


(i) The result of paragraph (b)(1) of this section multiplied by 21 days, and


(ii) The result of paragraph (b)(1) of this section multiplied by 7 days, multiplied by 50 percent.


(c) Payments calculated in this section are subject to the adjustments and limits provided for in this part.
