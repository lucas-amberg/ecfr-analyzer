(a) This subpart establishes the terms and conditions of the Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP).


(b) Eligible livestock owners and contract growers will be compensated in accordance with ยง 1416.306 for eligible livestock deaths in excess of normal mortality, or livestock owners will be compensated for sales of injured livestock for a reduced price, if either the death or injury that results in sale at a reduced price occurred as a direct result of an eligible cause of loss. The eligible cause of loss is one, as determined by FSA, that directly results in the death of livestock or injury and sale of livestock at a reduced price, despite the livestock owner's or contract grower's performance of expected and normal preventative or corrective measures and acceptable animal husbandry practices.
