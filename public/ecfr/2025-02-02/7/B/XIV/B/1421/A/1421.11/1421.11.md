# § 1421.11   Spot checks.

(a) CCC may inspect the collateral for MALs, and producers with such MALs must allow CCC reasonable access to the farm and storage facility as necessary to conduct “spot check” collateral inspections. Spot checks are intended to verify that the quality and quantity of farm-stored commodities pledged as collateral for MALs are maintained by the producer.


(b) LDPs are selected for spot check to ensure that all eligibility requirements, as required by CCC, are met in order to receive such LDP.


(c) Producers must present production evidence for commodities acceptable to CCC when a spot check is conducted.
