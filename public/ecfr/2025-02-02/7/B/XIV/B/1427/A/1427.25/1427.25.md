# § 1427.25   Determination of the prevailing world market price and the adjusted world price for upland cotton.

(a) CCC will determine the world market price for upland cotton as follows:


(1) During the period when only one daily price quotation is available for each growth quoted for Middling one and three-thirty-second inch (M 1
3/32-inch) cotton, CFR (cost and freight) Far East, the prevailing world market price for upland cotton will be based on the average of the quotations for the preceding Friday through Thursday for the 5 lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for M 1
3/32-inch cotton, CFR Far East.


(2) During the period when both a price quotation for cotton for shipment no later than August/September of the current calendar year (current Far East shipment price) and a price quotation for cotton for shipment no earlier than October/November of the current calendar year (forward Far East shipment price) are available for growths quoted for M 1
3/32-inch cotton, CFR Far East, the prevailing world market price for upland cotton will be based on the average of the current Far East shipment prices for the preceding Friday through Thursday for the 5 lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for M 1
3/32-inch cotton, CFR Far East, except as may be determined by the Secretary as specified in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section.


(3) The upland cotton prevailing world market price determined as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section is referred to as the “Far East price” (FE).


(4) If quotes are not available for 1 or more days in the 5-day period, the available quotes during the period will be used. If no quotes are available during the Friday through Thursday period, the prevailing world market price will be based on the best available world price information, as CCC determines.


(b) The upland cotton prevailing world market price, adjusted as specified in paragraph (c) of this section (adjusted world price (AWP)), will apply to crops of upland cotton.


(c) The upland cotton AWP will equal the FE determined as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, adjusted as follows:


(1) FE will be adjusted to U.S. location by deducting the average costs to market, including average transportation costs, as determined by the Secretary.


(2) The price determined as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be adjusted to reflect the price of base quality upland cotton by deducting the difference, as CCC announces, between the applicable loan rate for an upland cotton crop for base quality M 1
3/32-inch, leaf 3 cotton and the loan rate for base quality SLM 1
1/16-inch, leaf 4 cotton.


(3) The prevailing world market price, adjusted as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, may be further adjusted if it is determined that the adjustment is necessary to:


(i) Minimize potential loan forfeitures;


(ii) Minimize the accumulation of stocks of upland cotton by the Federal Government;


(iii) Ensure that upland cotton produced in the United States can be marketed freely and competitively, both domestically and internationally; and


(iv) Ensure an appropriate transition between current-crop and forward-crop price quotations, except that forward-crop price quotations may be used prior to July 31 of a marketing year only if there are insufficient current crop quotations and the forward-crop price quotation is the lowest such quotation available.


(d) The upland cotton AWP, determined as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, and the amount of the additional adjustment determined as specified in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, will be announced, to the extent practicable, at 4 p.m. eastern time each Thursday. In the event that Thursday is a non-workday, the determination will be announced, to the extent practicable, at 8 a.m. eastern time the next work day.


(e)(1)(i) AWP, determined as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, will be subject to a further coarse count adjustment as provided in this section regarding all qualities of upland cotton eligible for loan except the following upland cotton grades with a staple length of 1
1/16-inch or longer:


(A) White Grades—Strict Middling and better, leaf 1 through leaf 6; Middling, leaf 1 through leaf 6; Strict Low Middling, leaf 1 through leaf 6; and Low Middling, leaf 1 through leaf 5;


(B) Light Spotted Grades—Strict Middling and better, leaf 1 through leaf 5; Middling, leaf 1 through leaf 5; and Strict Low Middling, leaf 1 through leaf 4; and


(C) Spotted Grades—Strict Middling and better, leaf 1 through leaf 2; and


(ii) Grade, leaf, and staple length must be determined as specified in § 1427.9. If no such official classification is presented, the coarse count adjustment will not be made.


(2) The adjustment for upland cotton specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section will be determined by deducting from AWP:


(i) The difference between FE, and


(A) During the period when only one daily price quotation for each growth quoted for “coarse count” cotton, CFR Far East, is available, the average of the quotations for the corresponding Friday through Thursday for the three lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for “coarse count” cotton, CFR Far East (Far East coarse count price); or


(B) During the period when both current Far East shipment prices and forward Far East shipment prices are available for the growths quoted for “coarse count” cotton, CFR Far East, the result calculated by the average of the current Far East shipment prices for the preceding Friday through Thursday for the three lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for “coarse count” cotton, CFR Far East (Far East coarse count price) minus


(ii) The difference between the applicable loan rate for an upland cotton crop for base quality M 1
3/32-inch, leaf 3 cotton and the loan rate for an upland cotton crop for base quality SLM 1
1/32-inch, leaf 4 cotton.


(3) Regarding the determination of the Far East coarse count price specified in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section:


(i) If no quotes are available for one or more days of the 5-day period, the available quotes will be used;


(ii) If quotes for three growths are not available for any day in the 5-day period, that day will not be considered; and


(iii) If quotes for three growths are not available for at least 3 days in the 5-day period, that week will not be considered, in which case the adjustment determined as specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section for the latest available week will continue to be applicable.


(f)(1)(i) AWP, determined as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, will be subject to a further fine count adjustment as provided in this section regarding all upland cotton having a loan schedule premium or discount exceeding that for Middling, leaf 3, staple length 1
3/32-inch upland cotton, and


(ii) Grade, staple length, and leaf must be determined as specified in § 1427.9. If no such official classification is presented, the fine count adjustment will not be made.


(2) The adjustment for upland cotton specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section will be determined by deducting from AWP:


(i) The difference between FE, and


(A) During the period when only one daily price quotation for each growth quoted for “fine count” cotton, CFR Far East, is available the average of the quotations for the corresponding Friday through Thursday for the three lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for “fine count” cotton, CFR Far East (Far East fine count price) or


(B) During the period when both current Far East shipment prices and forward Far East shipment prices are available for the growths quoted for “fine count” cotton, CFR Far East, the result calculated by the average of the current Far East shipment prices for the preceding Friday through Thursday for the three lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for “fine count” cotton, CFR Far East (Far East fine count price) minus


(ii) The difference between the applicable loan rate for an upland cotton crop for base quality M 1
3/32-inch, leaf 3 cotton and the loan rate for an upland cotton crop for base quality SM 1
1/8-inch, leaf 2 cotton.


(3) Regarding the determination of the Far East fine count price under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section:


(i) If no quotes are available for one or more days of the 5-day period, the available quotes will be used;


(ii) If quotes for three growths are not available for any day in the 5-day period, that day will not be considered; and


(iii) If quotes for three growths are not available for at least 3 days in the 5-day period, that week will not be considered, in which case the adjustment determined as specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for the latest available week will continue to be applicable.


(g) In the determination of FE as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the Far East coarse count price specified in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section, and the Far East fine count price as specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section, CCC will use either current Far East shipment prices, forward Far East shipment prices, or any combination thereof to determine FE or the Far East coarse count price or the Far East fine count price used in the determination of the adjustment for upland cotton specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (f)(1) of this section and determined as specified in paragraphs (e)(2) and (f)(2) of this section to prevent distortions in such adjustment.


(h) For particular bales, the AWP determined as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, will be subject to further adjustments to a value no less than zero, as CCC determines, based on the Schedule of Premiums and Discounts as announced for the loan program for an upland cotton crop.
