# § 1429.108   Calculation of individual payments.

(a) Producers will be eligible for payment for both fresh and processed asparagus. CCC will calculate the payment quantity of 2003 fresh and processed asparagus for an asparagus farm operation based on the lower of:


(1) Reported production reflected on the application, or


(2) If applicable, determined production.


(b) The payment quantity will be multiplied by the following:


(1) Each asparagus producer's share, and


(2) The payment rate for the fresh or processed asparagus determined as specified in § 1429.107.


(c) If the total value of payments claimed exceeds the available funding, payments to producers are subject to a $100,000 cap per each of the two program marketing categories (fresh and processed) per asparagus producer as defined in this part, not per “person” or “legal entity” as those terms might be defined in part 1400 of this title.
