(a) CCC's security interest in the honey pledged as collateral is first and superior to all other security interests.


(b) The county office will file or record, as required by State law, all financing statements needed to perfect a security interest in honey pledged as collateral for a loan. The cost of filing and recording will be for the account of CCC.


(c) If there are any other security interests, liens, or encumbrances on the honey, CCC will obtain waivers that fully protect the interest of CCC even though the security interests, liens, or encumbrances are satisfied from the loan proceeds. No additional security interests, liens, or encumbrances will be placed on the honey after the loan is approved.
