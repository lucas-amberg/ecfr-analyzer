# ยง 1434.13   Transfer of producer's interest prohibited.

Absent written approval from CCC, the producer may not transfer either the remaining interest in, or right to redeem, the honey pledged as collateral for a MAL on honey nor may anyone acquire such interest or right. Subject to the provisions of ยง 1434.17, a producer who wishes to liquidate all or part of a MAL by contracting for the sale of the honey must obtain written approval from the county office on a form prescribed by CCC to remove a specified quantity of the honey from storage. Any such approval will be subject to the terms and conditions in the applicable form, copies of which may be obtained by producers at the FSA county office.
