(3) Provide quantity and quality information as prescribed by CCC of the commodity to be pledged as collateral; 


(4) Pay CCC a loan service fee, as determined by CCC, for the disbursement of each loan. 


(5) If there are any liens or encumbrances on sugar or in-process sugar pledged as loan collateral, obtain waivers that fully protect CCC's interest even though the liens or encumbrances are satisfied from the loan proceeds.

(6) Agree to reimburse CCC for any costs incurred as a result of the failure of the processor to obtain the waivers specified in subparagraph (5). 


(b) No loan proceeds may be disbursed until the sugar and in-process sugar have actually been produced and are otherwise established as being eligible to be pledged as loan collateral. 


(c)(1) A processor may, within the loan availability period, repledge as collateral sugar that previously served as loan collateral for a repaid loan. In making application for such a loan, the processor shall: 


(i) Specify that the loan collateral should be treated as a quantity of eligible sugar that previously served as loan collateral for a repaid loan; and 


(ii) Designate the loan to which the reoffered loan collateral was originally pledged.

(e)(1) Loans will mature at the earlier of: 


(i) the end of the 9-month period beginning on the 1st day of the first month after the month in which the loan is made; or 


(ii) September 30 following disbursement of the loan. 


(2) CCC may accelerate loan maturity dates under ยง 1435.105(h). 


(f) Processors receiving loans in July, August, or September may repledge the sugar as collateral for a supplemental loan. Such supplemental loan must:

(2) Be made at the loan rate in effect at the time the first loan was made; and


(3) Mature in 9 months less the number of months that the first loan was in effect.
