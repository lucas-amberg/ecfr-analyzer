(i) The number of acres that the processor, acting in conjunction with the producers, will divert; 


(ii) The previous consecutive 3-year simple average sugar beet or sugarcane yield on that acreage while under contract (years with no production contracted with a producer will not be considered (for first-time producers, however, the previous consecutive 3-year simple average sugar beet or sugarcane yield for all the producers under contract who delivered to the applicable factory will be used); 


(iii) The previous 3-year simple average sugar content of the producer's beets or sugarcane (for first-time producers, the previous 3-year simple average sugar content for all beets or cane delivered to that factory will be used); 


(iv) The processor's previous 3-year simple average recovery rate (for processors that have not been fully operational during the last 3 years, the simple average for those years that they were fully operational); 


(v) The value of CCC sugar to be received as payment; and 


(vi) Other information CCC deems necessary for program administration; or 


(2) The sugar production capacity to be removed from production by the processor. 


(b) The following acreage is ineligible for enrollment in the PIK program: 


(1) If planted, acreage not currently under contract for delivery of sugar beets to a sugar beet processor or sugarcane to a sugarcane processor for sugar production. 


(2) If planted, acreage that is not harvestable, 


(3) Acreage devoted to roads or other non-producing areas, or 


(4) If planted, acreage on which a crop insurance indemnity or replant payment was received for the current crop or for which a claim has been, or will be, filed to receive a crop insurance indemnity or replant payment for the current crop, except for replant payments for acreage actually replanted before the end of the normal planting period. 


(c) If planted, the diverted acres cannot be grazed until after the sugar beets or sugarcane are destroyed by disking, plowing, or other means of mechanical destruction. In addition, the sugar beets or sugarcane on the diverted acres may not be used for any commercial purpose.
