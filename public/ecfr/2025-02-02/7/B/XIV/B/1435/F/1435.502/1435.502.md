# ยง 1435.502   Bid selection procedures.

(a) For bids in which the processor offers to remove acreage of sugar beets or sugarcane from production, CCC will rank bids on the basis of the bid amount as a percentage of the expected sugar produced from the retired acreage. Bids with the lowest of such percentages will be selected first. In the case of identical bids, selection may be based on random selection or pro rata shares, as CCC deems appropriate. 


(b) CCC will reject bids for which the bid amounts exceed the expected sugar produced from the retired acreage. 


(c) For bids in which the processor offers to remove sugar production capacity from production, CCC will rank the bids on the basis of the capacity to be removed from production. 


(d) All acceptable bids specified in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section will be further reviewed by CCC and ranked in order of the greatest reduction in sugar program that can be achieved at the lowest cost to CCC.
