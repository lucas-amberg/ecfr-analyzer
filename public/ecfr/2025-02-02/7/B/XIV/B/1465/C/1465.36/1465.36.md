# ยง 1465.36   Environmental services credits for conservation improvements.

NRCS recognizes that environmental benefits will be achieved by implementing conservation practices funded through AMA, and that environmental credits may be gained as a result of implementing activities compatible with the purposes of an AMA contract. NRCS asserts no direct or indirect interest on these credits. However, NRCS retains the authority to ensure that operation and maintenance requirements for AMA-funded improvements are met, consistent with ยง 1465.21 and ยง 1465.22. Where activities may impact the land under an AMA contract, participants are highly encouraged to request an operation and maintenance compatibility determination prior to entering into any credit agreements. The AMA conservation program contract may be modified in accordance with policies outlined in ยง 1465.24 provided the modifications meet AMA purposes and are in compliance with this part.
