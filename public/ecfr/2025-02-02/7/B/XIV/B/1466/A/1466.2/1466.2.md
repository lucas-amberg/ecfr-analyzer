(ii) Identification of priority resource concerns;


(iii) Recommendations about which conservation practices will be effective to treat identified priority resource concerns; and


(iv) Recommendations of program payment rates for payment schedules.

(d) *Waiver.* The Chief may modify or waive a nonstatutory, discretionary provision of this part if the Chief determines the application of that provision to a particular limited situation to be inappropriate and inconsistent with the purposes of the program;
