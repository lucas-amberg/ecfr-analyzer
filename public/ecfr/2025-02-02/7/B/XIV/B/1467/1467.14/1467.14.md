(a) *Offers voided.* Any transfer of the property prior to the enrollment of the easement, 30-year contract, or restoration cost-share agreement contract, including the landowner entering into a contract or purchase agreement to sell the land subject to offer, shall void the offer of enrollment.


(b) *Payments to landowners.* For easements with multiple annual payments, any remaining easement payments will be made to the original participant unless NRCS receives an assignment of proceeds.


(c) *Claims to payments.* With respect to any and all payments owed to participants, NRCS shall bear no responsibility for any full payments or partial distributions of funds between the original participant and the participant's successor. In the event of a dispute or claim on the distribution of cost-share payments, NRCS may withhold payments without the accrual of interest pending an agreement or adjudication on the rights to the funds.
