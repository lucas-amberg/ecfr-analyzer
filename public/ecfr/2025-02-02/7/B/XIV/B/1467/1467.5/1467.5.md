(a) *Application for participation.* To apply for enrollment, a landowner must submit an Application for Participation in the WRP.


(b) *Preliminary agency actions.* By filing an Application for Participation, the landowner consents to an NRCS representative entering upon the land for purposes of assessing the wetland functions and values, and for other activities, such as the development of the preliminary WRPO, that are necessary or desirable for NRCS to evaluate applications. The landowner is entitled to accompany an NRCS representative on any site visits.


(c) *Voluntary reduction in compensation.* In order to enhance the probability of enrollment in WRP, a landowner may voluntarily offer to accept a lesser payment than is being offered by NRCS.
