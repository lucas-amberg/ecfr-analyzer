(c) *Calculation of monetized TRQ payment.* A payment will be established by calculating the savings that would have been realized by the eligible person for imports of qualifying worsted wool fabric had the lower duty rate been in effect by—


(1) Establishing the reported dollar value of imported worsted wool fabric, for each of the 2014 HTS subheadings of worsted wool fabric, during the calendar year immediately preceding the payment;


(2) Subtracting the duty rate (converted to numeric value) for each applicable 2014 HTS subheading of worsted wool fabric that would have been paid in calendar year 2014 from the duty rate (converted to numeric value) that was actually paid in the calendar year immediately preceding the payment;


(3) For each applicable 2014 HTS subheading of worsted wool fabric, multiplying the numeric values described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section; and


(4) Adding each product obtained in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

(ii) *Direct and indirect importers.* Eligible persons that directly import qualifying worsted wool fabric and pay the import duty for such wool are considered to be direct importers of the qualifying worsted wool fabric. Persons that import qualifying worsted wool fabric through a third party broker are considered to be indirect importers of the qualifying worsted wool fabric. Eligible persons must state in their annual affidavit whether, in the calendar year immediately preceding the payment, they were direct or indirect importers, and the dollar value of the imported qualifying worsted wool fabric. The reported dollar value of such imports by indirect importers will be subject to a 10% reduction.
