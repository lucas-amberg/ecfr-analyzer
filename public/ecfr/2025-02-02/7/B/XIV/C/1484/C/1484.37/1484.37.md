# § 1484.37   Federal Travel Regulations.

Except as otherwise provided in this part, travel funded by the Cooperator program shall conform to the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200, and FMD-funded air travel shall conform to the requirements of the Fly America Act (49 U.S.C. 40118). The Cooperator shall notify the Attaché/Counselor in the destination countries in writing in advance of any proposed travel. The timing of such notice should be far enough in advance to enable the Attaché/Counselor to schedule appointments, make preparations, or otherwise provide any assistance being requested. Failure to provide advance notification of travel generally will result in disallowance of the expenses related to the travel, unless CCC determines it was impractical to provide such notification.
