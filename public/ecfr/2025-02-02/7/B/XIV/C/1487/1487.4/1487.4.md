(a) *Funding cap.* Proposals that request more than $500,000 of CCC funding in a given year will not be considered.


(b) *Length of activities.* Awards will generally be granted for a project period not exceeding five calendar years. However, FAS will entertain requests to extend agreements beyond five years when valid justifications are submitted. Participants must submit in writing a valid justification for why an extension is necessary no later than 60 days before the end of the period of performance. Extensions generally will be granted in one-year increments, if warranted. A Participant must wait for written approval from FAS before proceeding with the project.


(c) *Target countries.* Proposals may target barriers in any eligible export market, including single countries or reasonable regional groupings of countries.


(d) *Multiple proposals.* Applicants may submit multiple proposals, but no Participant may have more than five approved projects underway at any given time.


(e) *Program funds only for specific uses.* Participants shall not use program funds to supplement the costs of normal day-to-day operations or to promote their own products or services beyond specific uses approved in a given project.
