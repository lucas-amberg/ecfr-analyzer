# ยง 1489.24   Failure to make required contribution.

A RAPP Participant's required contribution will be specified in the approval letter. If the RAPP Participant's required contribution is specified as a dollar amount and the RAPP Participant does not contribute a total dollar amount sufficient to make the required contribution, then the RAPP Participant shall pay to the CCC in dollars the difference between the amount actually contributed and the amount specified in the approval letter. If the RAPP Participant's required contribution is specified as a percentage of the total amount reimbursed by the CCC and the RAPP Participant does not provide a dollar amount of contributions sufficient to achieve the specified percentage, then the RAPP Participant may either return to the CCC the amount of funds reimbursed by the CCC to increase its actual contribution percentage to the required level or pay to the CCC in U.S. dollars the difference between the amount actually contributed and the amount of funds necessary to increase its actual contribution percentage to the required level. A RAPP Participant shall remit such payment within six months after the expiration date shown in the RAPP Participant's program agreement. The RAPP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance, in writing, by the CCC.
