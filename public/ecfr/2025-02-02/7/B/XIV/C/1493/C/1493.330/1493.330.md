# § 1493.330   Certification requirements for the evidence of performance.

By providing the statement contained in § 1493.320(a)(12), the seller is certifying that the information provided in the evidence of performance report is true and correct and, further, that all requirements set forth in this section have been met. The seller will be required to provide further explanation or documentation with regard to reports that do not include this statement. If the seller makes false certifications with respect to a payment guarantee, CCC will have the right, in addition to any other rights provided under this subpart or otherwise as a matter of law, to annul guarantee coverage for any contractual events that have not yet occurred and/or to commence legal action and/or administrative proceedings against the seller. The seller, in submitting the evidence of performance and providing the statement set forth in § 1493.320(a)(12), certifies that:


(a) The specifications and/or quantity of the contractual event conform with the information contained in the seller's application for payment guarantee and firm sales contract, or if different, CCC has approved such changes;


(b) A foreign financial institution letter of credit has been opened in favor of the seller by the foreign financial institution shown on the payment guarantee to cover the dollar amount of the contractual event covered by the payment guarantee, less the initial payment and less discounts and allowances;


(c) There have not been any corrupt payments or extra sales services or other items extraneous to the transaction provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, and that the transaction complies with applicable United States law, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and other anti-bribery measures;


(d) If the seller has not assigned the payment guarantee to a U.S. financial institution, the seller has verified that the foreign financial institution, at the time of submission of the evidence of performance report, does not appear as an excluded party on the SAM list; and


(e) The information provided pursuant to §§ 1493.220 and 1493.260 has not changed (except as agreed to and amended by CCC) and the seller still meets all of the qualification requirements of § 1493.220.
