The instrument must reference the applicable foreign financial institution letter of credit and, if applicable, the terms and conditions document; and

(ii) (A) The foreign financial institution letter of credit securing the sale; and


(B) If applicable, the terms and conditions document;

(b) *Additional documents.* If a claim is denied by CCC, the holder of the payment guarantee may provide further documentation to CCC to establish that the claim is in good order.


(c) *Subsequent claims for defaults on installments.* If the initial claim is found in good order, the holder of the payment guarantee need only provide all of the required claims documents with the initial claim relating to a covered transaction. For subsequent claims relating to failure of the foreign financial institution to make scheduled installments on the same contractual event, the holder of the payment guarantee need only submit to CCC a notice of such failure containing the information stated in paragraph (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii), and (a)(1)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section; an instrument of subrogation as per paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and the date the original claim was filed with CCC.


(d) *Alternative satisfaction of payment guarantees.* CCC may establish procedures, terms and/or conditions for the satisfaction of CCC's obligations under a payment guarantee other than those provided for in this subpart if CCC determines that those alternative procedures, terms, and/or conditions are appropriate in rescheduling the debts arising out of any transaction covered by the payment guarantee and would not result in CCC paying more than the amount of CCC's obligation.
