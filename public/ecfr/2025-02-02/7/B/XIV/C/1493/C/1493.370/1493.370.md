# ยง 1493.370   Payment for default.

(a) *Determination of CCC's liability.* Upon receipt in good order of the information and documents required under ยง 1493.360, CCC will determine whether or not a default has occurred for which CCC is liable under the applicable payment guarantee. Such determination shall include, but not be limited to, CCC's determination that all documentation conforms to the specific requirements contained in this subpart, and that all documents submitted for payment conform to the requirements of the letter of credit and, if applicable, the terms and conditions document. If CCC determines that it is liable to the holder of the payment guarantee, CCC will pay the holder of the payment guarantee in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.


(b) *Amount of CCC's liability.* CCC's maximum liability for any claims submitted with respect to any payment guarantee, not including any CCC late interest Payments due in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, will be limited to the lesser of:


(1) The guaranteed value as stated in the payment guarantee, plus Eligible interest, less any payments received or funds realized from insurance, security or collateral arrangements prior to claim by the seller or the assignee from or on behalf of the defaulting party or otherwise related to the obligation in default (other than payments between CCC, the seller or the assignee); or


(2) The guaranteed percentage (as indicated in the payment guarantee) of the value of the contractual event indicated in the evidence of performance, plus eligible interest, less any payments received or funds realized from insurance, security or collateral arrangements prior to claim by the seller or the assignee from or on behalf of the defaulting party or otherwise related to the obligation in default (other than payments between CCC, the seller or the assignee).


(c) *CCC late interest.* If CCC does not pay a claim within 15 business days of receiving the claim in good order, CCC late interest will accrue in favor of the holder of the payment guarantee beginning with the sixteenth business day after the day of receipt of a complete and valid claim found by CCC to be in good order and continuing until and including the date that payment is made by CCC. CCC late interest will be paid on the guaranteed amount, as determined by paragraph (b) of this section, and will be calculated at a rate equal to the average investment rate of the most recent Treasury 91-day bill auction as announced by the Department of Treasury as of the due date. If there has been no 91-day auction within 90 calendar days of the date CCC late interest begins to accrue, CCC will apply an alternative rate in a manner to be described on the USDA Web site.


(d) *Accelerated payments.* CCC will pay claims only on amounts not paid as scheduled. CCC will not pay claims for amounts due as a result of the claimant invoking an accelerated payment clause in the firm sales contract, the foreign financial institution letter of credit, the terms and conditions document (if applicable), or any obligation owed by the foreign financial institution to the holder of the payment guarantee that is related to the letter of credit issued in favor of the seller, unless it is determined to be in the best interests of CCC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CCC at its option may declare up to the entire amount of the unpaid balance, plus accrued ordinary interest, in default, require the holder of the payment guarantee to invoke the acceleration provision in the foreign financial institution letter of credit or, if applicable, in the terms and conditions document, require submission of all claims documents specified in ยง 1493.360, and make payment to the holder of the payment guarantee in addition to such other claimed amount as may be due from CCC.


(e) *Action against the assignee.* If an assignee submits a claim for default pursuant to ยง 1493.360 and all documents submitted appear on their face to conform with the requirements of such section, CCC will not hold the assignee responsible or take any action or raise any defense against the assignee for any action, omission, or statement by the seller of which the assignee has no knowledge.
