# ยง 1493.390   Dispute resolution and appeals.

(a) *Dispute resolution.* (1) The Director and the seller or the assignee will attempt to resolve any disputes, including any adverse determinations made by CCC, arising under the FGP, this subpart, the applicable program announcements and notices to participants, or the payment guarantee.


(2) The seller or the assignee may seek reconsideration of a determination made by the Director by submitting a letter requesting reconsideration to the Director within 30 calendar days of the date of the determination. For the purposes of this section, the date of a determination will be the date of the letter or other means of notification to the seller or the assignee of the determination. The seller or the assignee may include with the letter requesting reconsideration any additional information that it wishes the Director to consider in reviewing its request. The Director will respond to the request for reconsideration within 30 calendar days of the date on which the request or the final documentary evidence submitted by the seller or the assignee is received by the Director, whichever is later, unless the Director extends the time permitted for response. If the seller or the assignee fails to request reconsideration of a determination by the Director within 30 calendar days of the date of the determination, then the determination of the Director will be deemed final.


(3) If the seller or the assignee requests reconsideration of a determination by the Director pursuant to subparagraph (a)(2) of this section, and the Director upholds the original determination, then the seller or the assignee may appeal the Director's final determination to the GSM in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. If the seller or the assignee fails to appeal the Director's final determination within 30 calendar days, as provided in ยง 1493.390(b)(1), then the Director's decision becomes the final determination of CCC.


(b) *Appeal procedures.* (1) A seller or assignee that has exhausted the procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section may appeal a final determination of the Director to the GSM. An appeal to the GSM must be made in writing and filed with the office of the GSM no later than 30 calendar days following the date of the final determination by the Director. If the seller or the assignee requests an administrative hearing in its appeal letter, it shall be entitled to a hearing before the GSM or the GSM's designee.


(2) If the seller or the assignee does not request an administrative hearing, the seller or the assignee must indicate in its appeal letter whether or not it will submit any additional written information or documentation for the GSM to consider in acting upon its appeal. This information or documentation must be submitted to the GSM within 30 calendar days of the date of the appeal letter to the GSM. The GSM will make a decision regarding the appeal based upon the information contained in the administrative record. The GSM will issue his or her written decision within 60 calendar days of the latter of the date on which the GSM receives the appeal or the date that final documentary evidence is submitted by the seller or the assignee to the GSM.


(3) If the seller or the assignee has requested an administrative hearing, the GSM will set a date and time for the hearing that is mutually convenient for the GSM and the seller or the assignee. This date will ordinarily be within 60 calendar days of the date on which the GSM receives the request for a hearing. The hearing will be an informal procedure. The seller or the assignee and/or its counsel may present any relevant testimony or documentary evidence to the GSM. A transcript of the hearing will not ordinarily be prepared unless the seller or the assignee bears the costs involved in preparing the transcript, although the GSM may decide to have a transcript prepared at the expense of the Government. The GSM will make a decision regarding the appeal based upon the information contained in the administrative record. The GSM will issue his or her written decision within 60 calendar days of the latter of the date of the hearing or the date of receipt of the transcript, if one is to be prepared.


(4) The decision of the GSM will be the final determination of CCC. The seller or the assignee will be entitled to no further administrative appellate rights.


(c) *Failure to comply with determination.* If the seller or the assignee has violated the terms of this subpart or the payment guarantee by failing to comply with a determination made under this section, and the seller or the assignee has exhausted its rights under this section or has failed to exercise such rights, then CCC will have the right to exercise any remedies available to CCC under applicable law.


(d) *Seller's obligation to perform.* The seller will continue to have an obligation to perform pursuant to the provisions of these regulations and the terms of the payment guarantee pending the conclusion of all procedures under this section.
