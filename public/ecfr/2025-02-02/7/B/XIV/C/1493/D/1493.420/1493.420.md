# § 1493.420   Information required for program participation.

Before CCC will accept an application for a payment guarantee under the SCGP, the applicant must qualify for participation in this program. Based upon the information submitted by the applicant and other publicly available sources, CCC will determine whether the applicant is eligible for participation in the program. 


(a) *Submission of documentation.* In order to qualify for participation in the SCGP, an applicant must submit to CCC, at the address specified in the Contacts P/R, the following information: 


(1) The address of the applicant's headquarters office and the name and address of an agent in the U.S. for the service of process; 


(2) The legal form of doing business of the applicant, e.g., sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, etc.; 


(3) The place of incorporation of the applicant, if the applicant is a corporation; 


(4) The name and U.S. address of the office(s) of the applicant, and statement indicating whether the applicant is a U.S. domestic corporation, a foreign corporation or another foreign entity. If the applicant has multiple offices, the address included in the information should be that which is pertinent to the particular export sale contemplated by the applicant under this subpart; 


(5) A certified statement describing the applicant's participation, if any, during the past three years in U.S. Government programs, contracts or agreements; and 


(6) A certification that: “I certify, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that neither [name of applicant] nor any of its principals has been debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment from contracting with or participating in programs administered by any U.S. Government agency. [”Principals,” for the purpose of this certification, means officers; directors; owners of five percent or more of stock; partners; and persons having primary management or supervisory responsibility within a business entity (e.g., general manager, plant manager, head of a subsidiary division, or business segment, and similar positions).] I further agree that, should any such debarment, suspension, or notice of proposed debarment occur in the future, [name of applicant] will immediately notify CCC.” 


(b) *Previous qualification.* Any exporter that is qualified under subpart B, § 1493.30 is qualified under this section to submit applications for a SCGP payment guarantee, and the information provided by the exporter pursuant to § 1493.30 will be deemed to also have been provided under this section. Each application must include the statement required by § 1493.430(a)(17) incorporating the certifications of § 1493.440, including the certification in § 1493.440(e) that the information previously provided pursuant to § 1493.420 has not changed. If the exporter is unable to provide such certification, such exporter must update the information required by paragraph (a) of this section which has changed and certify that the remainder of the information previously provided has not changed. 


(c) *Additional submissions.* CCC will promptly notify applicants that have submitted information required by this section whether they have qualified to participate in the program. Any applicant failing to qualify will be given an opportunity to provide additional information for consideration by CCC. 


(d) *Ineligibility for program participation.* An applicant may be ineligible to participate in the SCGP if: 


(1) Such applicant is currently debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment from contracting with or participating in any program administered by a U.S. Government agency; or 


(2) Such applicant is controlled or can be controlled, in whole or in part, by any individuals or entities currently debarred, suspended or proposed for debarment from contracting with or participating in programs administered by any U.S. Government agency.
