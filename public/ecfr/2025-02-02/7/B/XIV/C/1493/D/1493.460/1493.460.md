(a) *Guarantee fee rates.* The current payment guarantee fee rate(s) will be available by Program Announcement. 


(b) *Calculation of fee.* The guarantee fee will be computed by multiplying the guaranteed value by the guarantee fee rate. 


(c) *Payment of fee.* The exporter shall remit, with his written application, the full amount of the guarantee fee. Applications will not be approved until the guarantee fee has been received by CCC. The exporter's check for the guarantee fee shall be made payable to CCC and mailed or delivered by courier to the office specified in the Contacts P/R. 


(d) *Refunds of fee.* Guarantee fees paid in connection with approved applications will ordinarily not be refundable. CCC's approval of the application will be final and refund of the guarantee fee will not be made after approval unless the GSM determines that such refund will be in the best interest of CCC. If the application for a payment guarantee is not approved or is approved only for a part of the guarantee coverage requested, a full or pro rata refund of the fee remittance will be made.
