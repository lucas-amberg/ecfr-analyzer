# § 4270.4   Criteria for eligibility.

A product must meet each of the criteria specified in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section to be eligible to participate in the BioPreferred Program.


(a) *Biobased Product.* The product for which certification is sought must be a Biobased Product as defined in § 4270.2. Products must undergo Biobased Content Testing as described in § 4270.7 of this part to confirm the products meet or exceed the applicable minimums.


(1) *Products that are qualified for preferred Federal procurement but not certified as of the date of publication of this rule.* If the product is qualified for preferred Federal procurement through the BioPreferred Program as of January 8, 2025, the product will remain eligible under the legacy rules, which can be found on the BioPreferred Program website (*biopreferred.gov*), until the product is reformulated, discontinued, or until December 9, 2027, whichever comes first. These products must follow the procedures described in § 4270.9 before December 9, 2027 to remain eligible.


(2) *Exclusions.* Motor vehicle fuels, heating oil, and electricity are excluded by statute from this Program. For the purposes of this Program, food, animal feed, and products intended to be ingested or inhaled such as pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals are also excluded.


(b) *Minimum Biobased Content.* The Biobased Content of the product must be equal to or greater than the Applicable Minimum Biobased Content, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.


(1) *Products that fall under one or more Defined Product Categories*—(i) *Product is within a single product category.* If the Biobased Product is within a single Defined Product Category that, at the time the application for certification is submitted, has been designated by USDA for preferred Federal procurement, the Applicable Minimum Biobased Content requirement for the product is the minimum Biobased Content specified for the Defined Product Category as found in the Register of Designated Categories on the BioPreferred Program website at *biopreferred.gov.*

(ii) *Product is within multiple product categories.* If the Biobased Product is marketed within more than one Defined Product Category identified for preferred Federal procurement at the time the application for certification is submitted and uses the same packaging for each use, the product's Biobased Content must meet or exceed the specified minimum Biobased Content for each of the applicable product categories, as found in the Register of Designated Categories on the BioPreferred Program website at *biopreferred.gov,* to become certified in each category. If the product's Biobased Content does not meet the specified minimum Biobased Content for the category that most closely matches the product's primary intended use, the product is not eligible to participate.


(2) *Products that do not meet the definition of at least one Defined Product Category.* If the Biobased Product does not meet the definition of a Defined Product Category that has been designated by USDA at the time the application for certification is submitted, the Applicable Minimum Biobased Content is 30 percent. USDA will evaluate such products as described in § 4270.6 to determine the viability of designating a new product category. If a new category is subsequently designated for preferred Federal procurement, the Applicable Minimum Biobased Content will become, as of the effective date indicated in the Register of Designated Categories, the minimum Biobased Content specified for the newly Defined Product Category.


(c) *Innovative Criteria.* In determining eligibility for certification under the BioPreferred Program, USDA will consider as eligible only those products that use innovative approaches in the growing, harvesting, sourcing, procuring, processing, manufacturing, or application of the Biobased Product. USDA will consider products that meet one or more of the criteria in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section to be eligible for certification. USDA will also consider other documentation of innovative approaches in the growing, harvesting, sourcing, procuring, processing, manufacturing, or application of Biobased Products on a case-by-case basis. USDA may deny or revoke certification for any products whose manufacturers are unable to provide USDA with the documentation necessary to verify claims that innovative approaches are used.


(1) *Product applications.* (i) The Biobased Product or material is used or applied in applications that differ from historical applications; or


(ii) The Biobased Product or material is grown, harvested, manufactured, processed, sourced, or applied in other innovative ways; or


(iii) The Biobased Content of the product or material makes its composition different from products or material used for the same historical uses or applications.


(2) *Manufacturing and processing.* (i) The Biobased Product or material is manufactured or processed using renewable, biomass energy or using technology that is demonstrated to increase energy efficiency or reduce reliance on fossil-fuel based energy sources; or


(ii) The Biobased Product or material is manufactured or processed with technologies that reduce waste and ensure high feedstock material recovery and use.


(3) *Environmental Product Declaration.* The product has a current Environmental Product Declaration as defined by International Standard ISO 14025, Environmental Labels and Declarations—Type III Environmental Declarations—Principles and Procedures.


(4) *Raw material sourcing.* (i) The raw material used in the product is sourced from a Legal Source, a Responsible Source, or a Certified Source as designated by ASTM D7612 (Standard Practice for Categorizing Wood and Wood-Based Products According to Their Fiber Sources); or


(ii) The raw material used in the product is 100% resourced or recycled (such as material obtained from building deconstruction or agricultural wastes); or


(iii) The raw material used in the product is acquired as a result of activities related to a natural disaster, debris clearing, right-of-way maintenance, tree health improvement, or public safety; or


(iv) The raw material used in the product is grown, harvested, manufactured, processed, sourced, or applied in other sustainable and ethically sourced ways as determined by USDA. Examples include but are not limited to rainforest and habitat conservation, wildlife protection, ethical workplace practices, and adherence to environmental management systems, such as ISO 14001.
