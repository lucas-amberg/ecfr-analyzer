# ยง 4279.16   Appeals.

Applicants, borrowers, lenders, and holders have appeal or review rights for Agency decisions made under this subpart, subpart B of this part, or subpart B of part 4287 of this chapter. Programmatic decisions based on clear and objective statutory or regulatory requirements are not appealable; however, such decisions are reviewable for appealability by the National Appeals Division (NAD). The borrower, lender, and holder can appeal any Agency decision that directly and adversely impacts them. For an adverse decision that impacts the borrower, the lender and borrower must jointly execute a written request for appeal for an alleged adverse decision made by the Agency. An adverse decision that only impacts the lender may be appealed by the lender only. An adverse decision that only impacts the holder may be appealed by the holder only. A decision by a lender adverse to the interest of the borrower is not a decision by the Agency, whether or not concurred in by the Agency. Appeals will be conducted by USDA NAD and will be handled in accordance with 7 CFR part 11.
