# § 4279.59   Environmental requirements.

The Agency is responsible for ensuring that the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (under 40 CFR part 1500) and related compliance actions, such as Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (under 36 CFR part 800) and Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, are met and will complete the appropriate level of environmental review in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970, “Environmental Policies and Procedures,” or successor regulation. Because development of the loan application occurs simultaneously with development of the environmental review, applicants, including lenders and borrowers, must not take any actions or incur any obligations that would either limit the range of alternatives to be considered in the environmental review or that would have an adverse effect on the environment. Satisfactory completion of the environmental review process must occur prior to issuance of the Conditional Commitment to the lender.
