(c) Loans made from repayments of REDG loans must be for eligible Program purposes;


(d) The Intermediary is solely responsible for the financial approval of Fund loans and all other Fund decisions and actions; and


(e) No changes will be made to a Rural Development-approved Revolving Loan Fund Plan without the prior written approval of Rural Development.
