# ยง 4284.1033   Submission requirements.

The following information identifies when applications can be submitted, where applications must be submitted, and the format of applications.


(a) *Submission period.* (1) The application period opens on November 1. Applications received prior to the opening date in a given fiscal year will not be considered.


(2) The application period closes at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time (ET) on January 31 of the following year. Applications received after the closing date will not be considered. This means that if the application is emailed prior to 11:59 p.m. ET on the closing date, but the Agency's system does not receive it until after the deadline, the application will not be considered for funding. Thus, applicants are encouraged to submit their applications well in advance of the closing date to ensure timely receipt by the Agency.


(b) *Submission address.* Applications must be submitted electronically to the email address listed on the program website.


(c) *Submission format.* All items required for the application must be submitted in a single application. No attachments other than the required items will be considered. Incomplete applications will be rejected.
