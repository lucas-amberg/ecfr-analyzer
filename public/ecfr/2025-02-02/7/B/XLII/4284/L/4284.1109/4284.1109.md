Applicants will be ineligible to receive funds under this subpart as discussed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.


(a) If the applicant has an outstanding judgment obtained by the U.S. in a Federal Court (other than in the United States Tax Court), is delinquent in the payment of Federal income taxes, or is delinquent on a Federal debt, the applicant is not eligible to receive a grant until the judgment is paid in full or otherwise satisfied or the delinquency is resolved. The Agency will check the Do Not Pay System to verify this information.
