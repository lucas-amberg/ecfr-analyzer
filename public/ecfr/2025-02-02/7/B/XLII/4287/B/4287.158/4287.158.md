# § 4287.158   Determination of loss and payment.

Unless the Agency anticipates a future recovery, the Agency will make a final settlement with the lender after the collateral is liquidated or after settlement and compromise of all parties has been completed. The Agency has the right to recover losses paid under the guarantee from any party that may be liable.


(a) *Report of loss form.* Form RD 449-30, “Loan Note Guarantee Report of Loss,” will be used for reporting and calculating all estimated and final loss determinations.


(b) *Estimated loss.* In accordance with the requirements of § 4287.157(f), the lender must prepare an estimated loss claim, based on liquidation appraisal value, and submit it to the Agency. When the lender is conducting the liquidation and owns any or all of the guaranteed portion of the loan, the lender must file an estimated loss claim once a decision has been made to liquidate if the liquidation will exceed 90 days. The estimated loss payment will be based on the liquidation value of the collateral.


(1) Such estimate will be prepared and submitted by the lender on Form RD 449-30 using the basic formula as provided on the report, except that the liquidation appraisal value will be used in lieu of the amount received from the sale of collateral. Interest accrual eligible for payment under the guarantee on the defaulted loan will be discontinued when the estimated loss is paid.


(2) A protective advance claim will be paid only at the time of the final report of loss payment.


(c) *Final loss.* Within 30 days after liquidation of all collateral is completed (except for certain unsecured personal or corporate guarantees as provided for in this section), the lender must prepare a final report of loss and submit it to the Agency. If the lender holds all or a portion of the guaranteed loan, the Agency will not guarantee interest to the lender accruing after 90 days from the most recent delinquency effective date. The Agency will not guarantee interest to any holder accruing after the greater of: 90 days from the date of the most recent delinquency effective date as reported by the lender or 30 days from the date of the interest termination letter. Before approval by the Agency of any final loss report, the lender must account for all funds during the period of liquidation, disposition of the collateral, all costs incurred, and any other information necessary for the successful completion of liquidation. Upon receipt of the final accounting and report of loss, the Agency may audit all applicable documentation to determine the final loss. The lender must make its records available and otherwise assist the Agency in making any investigation. The documentation accompanying the report of loss must support the amounts reported as losses on Form RD 449-30.


(1) The lender must make a determination regarding the collectability of unsecured personal and corporate guarantees. If reasonably possible, the lender must promptly collect or otherwise dispose of such guarantees in accordance with § 4287.157(j) prior to completion of the final loss report. However, in the event that collection from the guarantors appears unlikely or will require a prolonged period of time, the lender must file the report of loss when all other collateral has been liquidated. Unsecured personal or corporate guarantees outstanding at the time of the submission of the final loss claim will be treated as a future recovery with the net proceeds to be shared on a pro rata basis by the lender and the Agency. Debts owed to the Agency (Federal debt) may be collected using DCIA authority. The Agency may consider a compromise settlement of Federal debt after it has processed a final report of loss and issued a 60 day due process letter. Any funds collected on Federal debt will not be shared with the lender.


(2) The lender must document that all of the collateral has been accounted for and properly liquidated and that liquidation proceeds have been accounted for and applied correctly to the loan.


(3) The lender must provide receipts and a breakdown of any protective advance amount as to the payee, purpose of the expenditure, date paid, and evidence that the amount expended was proper.


(4) The lender must provide receipts and a breakdown of liquidation expenses as to the payee, purpose of the expenditure, date paid, and evidence that the amount expended was proper. Liquidation expenses are recoverable only from liquidation proceeds. The Agency may approve attorney/legal fees as liquidation expenses provided that the fees are reasonable, require the assistance of attorneys, and cover legal issues pertaining to the liquidation that could not be properly handled by the lender and its employees.


(5) The lender must support accrued interest by documenting how the amount was accrued. If the interest rate was a variable rate, the lender must include documentation of changes in both the selected base rate and the loan rate.


(6) The Agency will pay loss payments within 60 days after it has reviewed the complete final loss report and accounting of the collateral.


(d) *Loss limit.* The amount payable by the Agency to the lender cannot exceed the limits set forth in the Loan Note Guarantee.


(e) *Liquidation expenses.* The Agency will deduct liquidation expenses from the liquidation proceeds of the collateral. The lender cannot claim any liquidation expenses in excess of liquidation proceeds. Any changes to the liquidation expenses that exceed 10 percent of the amount proposed in the liquidation plan must be approved by the Agency. Reasonable attorney/legal expenses will be shared by the lender and Agency equally, including those instances where the lender has incurred such expenses from a trustee conducting the liquidation of assets. The lender cannot claim the guarantee fee or the annual renewal fee as authorized liquidation expenses, and no in-house expenses of the lender will be allowed. In-house expenses include, but are not limited to, employee's salaries, staff lawyers, travel, and overhead.


(f) *Rent.* The lender must apply any net rental or other income that it receives from the collateral to the guaranteed loan debt.


(g) *Payment.* Once the Agency approves Form RD 449-30 and supporting documents submitted by the lender:


(1) If the loss is greater than any estimated loss payment, the Agency will pay the additional amount owed by the Agency to the lender.


(2) If the loss is less than the estimated loss payment, the lender must reimburse the Agency for the overpayment plus interest at the note rate from the date of payment.
