# ยง 4290.210   Minimum capital requirements for RBICs.

(a) *General Rule.* Unless otherwise specified in a _Federal Register_ notice, you must have Regulatory Capital of at least $10,000,000, or such lesser amount (but not less than $5,000,000) and Leverageable Capital of at least $500,000, to become a RBIC.


(b) *Exception.* (1) The Agency in its sole discretion and based on a showing of special circumstances and good cause may license an Applicant with Regulatory Capital of at least $2,500,000, but only if the Applicant:


(i) Has satisfied all eligibility criteria for licensing as a RBIC as described in ยง 4290.390(a) of this part, except the capital requirement specified in paragraph (a)(1) of that section, as determined solely by the Agency;


(ii) Has a viable business plan reasonably projecting profitable operations; and


(iii) Has a reasonable timetable for achieving Regulatory Capital of at least $10,000,000.


(2) A RBIC licensed under this exception is not eligible to receive Leverage until it has complied with paragraph (a) of this section.


(c) *Time frame.* Each RBIC shall have a period of 2 years to meet the capital requirements set forth in this section.


(d) *Closing.* Each RBIC may conduct more than one closing to raise the specific amount of Regulatory Capital that the Applicant had projected in its application that it would raise (see ยง 4290.310(b)). One or more closings may take place subsequent to licensing as an RBIC to raise the difference between the required Regulatory Capital as provided under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the specific amount of Regulatory Capital that the Applicant had projected to raise in its application.
