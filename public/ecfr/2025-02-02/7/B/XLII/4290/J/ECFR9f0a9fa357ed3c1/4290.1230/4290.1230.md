# § 4290.1230   Draw-downs by RBIC under Leverage commitment.

(a) *RBIC's authorization of the Agency to guarantee securities.* By submitting a request for a draw against the Leverage commitment, you authorize the Agency, or the Agency's designated agent or trustee, to guarantee your Debenture and to sell it with the Agency's guarantee.


(b) *Limitations on amount of draw.* The amount of a draw must be a multiple of $5,000. The Agency, in its discretion, may determine a minimum dollar amount for draws against Leverage commitments. Any such minimum amounts will be published in Notices in the _Federal Register_ from time to time.


(c) *Effect of regulatory violations on RBIC's eligibility for draws*—(1) *General rule.* You are eligible to make a draw against your Leverage commitment only if you are in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Act and this part (*i.e.,* no unresolved statutory or regulatory violations) and your Participation Agreement.


(2) *Exception to general rule.* If you are not in compliance, you may still be eligible for draws if:


(i) The Agency determines that your outstanding violations are of non-substantive provisions of the Act or this part or your Participation Agreement and that you have not repeatedly violated any non-substantive provisions; or


(ii) You have agreed with the Agency in writing on a course of action to resolve your violations and such agreement does not prevent you from issuing Leverage.


(d) *Procedures for funding draws.* You may request a draw at any time during the term of the commitment. With each request, submit the following documentation:


(1) A statement certifying that there has been no material adverse change in your financial condition since your last filing of SBA Form 468 or other USDA-approved form(s) (see also § 4290.1220 for filing requirements).


(2) If your request is submitted more than 30 days following the end of your fiscal year, but before you have submitted your annual filing of SBA Form 468 or other USDA-approved form(s) in accordance with § 4290.630(a), a preliminary unaudited annual financial statement on SBA Form 468 (Short Form) or other USDA-approved form(s).


(3) A statement certifying that to the best of your knowledge and belief, you are in compliance with all provisions of the Act and this part (*i.e.,* no unresolved regulatory or statutory violations) and your Participation Agreement, or a statement listing any specific violations you are aware of. Either statement must be executed by one of the following:


(i) An officer of the RBIC;


(ii) An officer of a corporate general partner or managing member of the RBIC;


(iii) An individual who is authorized to act as or for a general partner of the RBIC; or


(iv) An individual who is authorized to act as or for a managing member of the RBIC.


(4) A statement that the proceeds are needed to fund one or more particular Enterprises or to provide liquidity for your operations. If required by the Agency, the statement must include the name and address of each Enterprise, and the amount and anticipated closing date of each proposed Financing.


(e) *Reporting requirements after drawing funds.* (1) Within 30 calendar days after the actual closing date of each Financing funded with the proceeds of your draw, you must file an SBA Form 1031 or other USDA-approved form(s) confirming the closing of the transaction.


(2) If the Agency required you to provide information concerning a specific planned Financing under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, and such Financing has not closed within 60 calendar days after the anticipated closing date, you must provide a written explanation of the failure to close.


(3) If you do not comply with this paragraph (e), you will not be eligible for additional draws. The Agency may also determine that you are not in compliance with the terms of your Leverage under § 4290.1810.
