# § 4290.3005   Qualifications for the Non-leveraged RBIC Program.

(a) *Business form.* In addition to complying with the applicable provisions of § 4290.100 not otherwise modified by this section, paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section apply.


(1) For RBICs applying for non-leveraged status, the types of investors eligible to invest in a RBIC must have been approved by the Agency. Investors seeking approval must submit a request to the Agency with sufficient documentation to support their request. The USDA will announce such approved categories and types of investors in a public notice published in the _Federal Register_ from time to time. Subsequent notices that modify the types of investors eligible to invest in a RBIC will not be applied retroactively.


(2) In lieu of complying with § 4290.100(d)(1)(i), you must have a minimum duration of 10 years. After 10 years, the Partnership RBIC may be terminated by a vote of your partners.


(3) In lieu of complying with § 4290.100(d)(2), if you are a LLC RBIC, you must have a minimum duration of 10 years. After 10 years, the LLC RBIC may be terminated by a vote of your members.


(4) In lieu of complying with § 4290.100(d)(3), if you are a Corporate RBIC, you must have a duration of not less than 30 years unless earlier dissolved by the shareholders.


(b) *Approval of initial Management Expenses.* Section 4290.140 does not apply to Non-leveraged RBICs. However, the Agency will provide a cap on these expenses in each _Federal Register_ notice soliciting applications for Non-leveraged RBICs.


(c) *Management and ownership diversity requirements.* A Non-leveraged RBIC is subject to the provisions of § 4290.150 unless it is exempted from these provisions by the Agency. Exemptions will only be granted when the applicant establishes, to the satisfaction of the Agency, that granting the exemption will not unduly impair the integrity and soundness of the Non-leveraged RBIC.


(d) *Special rules for Partnership RBICs and LLC RBICs.* Paragraph (c) of § 4290.160 does not apply to Non-leveraged RBICs.
