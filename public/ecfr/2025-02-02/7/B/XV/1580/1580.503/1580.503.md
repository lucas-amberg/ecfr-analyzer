(a) If the Administrator (FAS) determines that any producer has received any payment under this program to which the producer was not entitled, or has expended funds received under this program for purpose that was not approved by the Administrator (FAS) such producer will be liable to repay such amount. The Administrator (FAS) may waive such repayment if it is determined that:

The requirement for demand and notice and opportunity for a hearing under the debt collection procedures in 7 CFR part 3 shall satisfy the notice and hearing requirements under 19 U.S.C. 2401f(c), and the appeal procedures in ยง 1580.505 of this part shall not apply to collection of overpayments
