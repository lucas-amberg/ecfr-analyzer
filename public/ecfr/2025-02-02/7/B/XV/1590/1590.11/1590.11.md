(b) If the recipient has title to procured commodities that have been damaged or lost, and the value of the damaged or lost procured commodities is estimated to be in excess of $20,000, the recipient must:


(1) Notify FAS immediately and provide detailed information about the circumstances surrounding such damage or loss, the quantity of damaged or lost procured commodities, and the value of the damage or loss;


(2) Promptly upon discovery of the damage or loss, initiate a claim arising out of such damage or loss, including, if appropriate, initiating an action to collect pursuant to a commercial insurance contract;


(3) Take all necessary action to pursue the claim diligently and within any applicable periods of limitations; and


(4) Provide to FAS copies of all documentation relating to the claim.


(c) If the recipient has title to procured commodities that have been damaged or lost, and the value of the damaged or lost procured commodities is estimated to be $20,000 or less, the recipient must notify FAS in accordance with the agreement and provide detailed information about the damage or loss in the next report required to be filed under ยง 1590.14(e).


(d)(1) The value of a claim for lost procured commodities will be determined on the basis of the commodity acquisition, transportation, and related costs incurred by the recipient and paid by FAS with respect to such commodities.


(2) The value of a claim for damaged procured commodities will be determined on the basis of the commodity acquisition, transportation, and related costs incurred by the recipient and paid by FAS with respect to such commodities, less any funds generated if such commodities are sold in accordance with ยง 1590.10(f)(1).


(e) If FAS determines that a recipient has not initiated a claim or is not exercising due diligence in the pursuit of a claim, FAS may require the recipient to assign its rights to pursue the claim to FAS.

(f)(1) The recipient may retain any funds obtained as a result of a claims collection action initiated by it in accordance with this section, or recovered pursuant to any insurance policy or other similar form of indemnification, but such funds must be expended as provided for in the agreement or for other purposes approved in advance by FAS.
