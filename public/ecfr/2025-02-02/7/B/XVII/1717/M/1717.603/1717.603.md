(2) Acquisition or leasing of existing electric facilities or systems in service whose purchase price, or capitalized value in the case of a lease, exceeds 10 percent of the borrower's net utility plant; and 


(3) Construction, procurement, or leasing of electric facilities to serve a customer whose annual kWh purchases or maximum annual kW demand in the foreseeable future is projected to exceed 25 percent of the borrower's total kWh sales or maximum kW demand in the year immediately preceding the acquisition or start of construction. 


(b) *Power supply borrowers.* Prior written approval by RUS is required for a power supply borrower to extend or add to its electric system if the extension or addition will be financed by RUS. Requirements for RUS approval of extensions and additions that will not be financed by RUS are set forth in other RUS regulations.
