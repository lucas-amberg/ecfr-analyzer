# § 1717.856   Application contents: Normal review—100 percent private financing.

Applications for a lien accommodation or subordination for 100 percent private financing for eligible purposes that do not meet the requirements of § 1717.854 must include the following information and documents: 


(a) A certification by an authorized official of the borrower that: 


(1) The borrower and, as applicable, the loan are in compliance with all applicable provisions of §§ 1717.852 and 1717.853; and


(2) There are no actions or proceedings against the borrower, pending or overtly threatened in writing before any court, governmental agency, or arbitrator that would materially adversely affect the borrower's operations and/or financial condition. If this certification cannot be made, the application must include:


(i) An opinion of borrower's counsel regarding any actions or proceedings against the borrower, pending or overtly threatened in writing before any court, governmental agency, or arbitrator that would materially adversely affect the borrower's operations and/or financial condition. The opinion shall address the merits of the claims asserted in the actions or proceedings, and include, if appropriate, an estimate of the amount or range of any potential loss; and


(ii) A certification by an authorized official of the borrower as to the amount of any insurance coverage applicable to any loss that may result from the actions and proceedings addressed in the opinion of borrower's counsel;


(b) The information and documents set forth in § 1717.855 (b) through (n);


(c) A long-range financial forecast providing financial projections for at least 10 years, which demonstrates that the borrower's system is economically viable and that the proposed loan is financially feasible. The financial forecast must comply with the requirements of 7 CFR part 1710 subpart G. RUS may, in its sole discretion, waive the requirement of this paragraph that a long range financial forecast be provided, if:


(1) The borrower is current on all of its financial obligations and is in compliance with all requirements of its mortgage and loan agreement with RUS;


(2) In RUS's judgment, granting a lien accommodation or subordination for the proposed loan will not adversely affect the repayment and security of outstanding debt of the borrower owed to or guaranteed by RUS;


(3) The borrower has achieved the TIER and DSC and any other coverage ratios required by its mortgage or loan contract in each of the two most recent calendar years; and


(4) The amount of the proposed loan does not exceed the lesser of $10 million or 10 percent of the borrower's current net utility plant;


(d) [Reserved] 


(e) As applicable to the type of facilities being financed, a CWP, related engineering and cost studies, a power cost study. These documents must meet the requirements of 7 CFR part 1710, subpart F and, as applicable, subpart G;


(f) Unless the requirement has been waived in writing by RUS, a current load forecast, which must meet the requirements of 7 CFR part 1710, subpart E, to the same extent as if the loan were being made by RUS; and


(g) A discussion of the borrower's compliance with RUS requirements on accounting, financial reporting, record keeping, and irregularities (see § 1717.854(c)(5)). RUS will review the case and determine the effect of any noncompliance on the feasibility and security of RUS's loans, and whether the requested lien accommodation or subordination can be approved.
