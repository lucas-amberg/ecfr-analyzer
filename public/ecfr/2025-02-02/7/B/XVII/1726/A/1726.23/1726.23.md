# ยง 1726.23   Qualification of bidders.

(a) *Qualified bidder list (QBL).* The borrower shall (acting through its engineer, if applicable) review the qualifications of prospective bidders for contract construction and for material and equipment procurement, and select firms qualified for inclusion on the borrower's list of qualified bidders for each contract. (See also ยง 1726.16 and ยง 1726.17.) A bid may not be solicited from a prospective bidder or opened by the borrower unless that bidder has been determined to be a qualified bidder for the contract. When preparing the QBL, in addition to the actual experience of the borrower, if any, in dealing with a prospective bidder, the borrower may solicit information from that bidder or from other parties with firsthand experience regarding the firm's capabilities and experience. It is also important to consider the firm's performance record, safety record, and similar factors in determining whether to include that firm on the QBL, since the borrower may not evaluate these factors when evaluating a bid from a qualified and invited bidder.


(b) *Conflict of interest.* If there is a relationship between the borrower or engineer and a prospective bidder which might cause the borrower or engineer to have or appear to have a conflict of interest, that prospective bidder shall not be included on the QBL unless the engineer discloses the nature of the relationship to the borrower. In the case of the borrower, if its employees or directors have a relationship with a prospective bidder, the prospective bidder shall not be included on the qualified bidders list unless the nature of the relationship is disclosed to the board of directors, and the board of directors specifically approves the inclusion of that bidder in light of the potential for a conflict of interest.
