# § 1726.252   Prior approved contract modification related to liability for special and consequential damages.

This section applies only to transmission equipment purchases and generation contracts. Where the borrower anticipates difficulty in obtaining responsive bids on RUS standard contract forms due to a lack of limitation with respect to special and consequential damages, and where the borrower believes that such a modification will encourage competition through the receipt of an alternative bid which limits the bidder's liability for special and consequential damages, the borrower may make the following approved phrase modifications in the RUS standard contract form on which the borrower solicits bids:


(a) Insert new paragraphs in the “Notice and Instructions to Bidders” as follows: 


“Proposals are invited on the basis of alternative Liability Clause Numbers 1 and 2. The Owner will determine on which Liability Clause basis the award will be made. Any other liability clauses in the proposal or any other modifications will be considered not responsive and unacceptable. These Liability Clauses are defined as follows: 


*Liability Clause Number 1.* This will include unmodified all of the standard terms and conditions of the form of contract furnished by the Owner and attached hereto. 


*Liability Clause Number 2.* This will include the following paragraph, in addition to all of the standard terms and conditions, otherwise unmodified, of the form of contract furnished by the Owner and attached hereto: 


(b) Insert the following in the contract documents under the “Proposal” section:


(c) Insert the following in the acceptance section of the standard contract form:
