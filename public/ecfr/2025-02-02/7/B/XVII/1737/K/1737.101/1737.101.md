# § 1737.101   Amounts spent for preloan activities.

If the borrower desires to credit amounts spent for preloan activities against any equity or general funds required by the loan contract, it shall submit an itemized statement of such expenditures to the Area Office. These expenditures will be accounted for on RUS Form 503, “Release of Telephone Loan Funds,” if RUS determines that the amounts spent are reasonable based on normal industry practice and that the procedures set forth in 7 CFR part 1737, subpart D, have been complied with. Statements of preloan expenditures will be verified as to accuracy by loan fund audits.
