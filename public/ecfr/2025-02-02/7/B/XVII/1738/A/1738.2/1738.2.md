*Applicant* means an entity requesting approval of assistance under this part.


*Assistance* means a request for a loan, loan/grant combination, or loan guarantee.


*Associated loan* means any loan that is granted in association with a grant. Every grant will have an associated loan.


*Award* means a loan, loan/grant combination, or loan guarantee made under this part.


*Award documents* means, as applicable, all associated loan agreements, loan/grant combination agreements, or loan guarantee documents.


*Award term* means the term of the loan as defined in the Award documents. The Award term shall be equal to the composite economic life of the facilities being financed with RUS loan or grant funding plus 3 years.


*Awardee* means an entity that has applied for and been awarded assistance under this part.


*Borrower* means an entity that has applied for and been awarded loan funding under this part.

*Broadband lending speed* means the minimum bandwidth requirements, as published by the Agency in its latest notice in the _Federal Register_ that Applicants must propose to deliver to every customer in the proposed funded service area in order for the Agency to approve a broadband Award. Broadband lending speeds will vary depending on the technology proposed and the term of the average composite economic life of the facilities. Initially, the broadband lending speed for terrestrial service, whether fixed or wireless, as well as mobile broadband serving ranches and farmland is 25 megabits per second (Mbps) downstream and 3 Mbps upstream, until further amended by notice. If a new broadband lending speed is published in the _Federal Register_ while an application is pending, the pending application will be processed based on the broadband lending speed that was in effect when the application was submitted.

*Broadband service* means any technology identified by the Administrator as having the capacity to provide transmission facilities that enable the subscriber to receive a minimum level of service equal to at least a downstream transmission capacity of 25 Mbps and an upstream transmission capacity of 3 Mbps. The Agency will publish the minimum transmission capacity with respect to terrestrial service that will qualify as broadband service in a notice in the _Federal Register._ If a new minimum transmission capacity is published in the _Federal Register_ while an application is pending, broadband service for the purpose of reviewing the application will be defined by the minimum transmission capacity that was required at the time the application was received by the Agency.

*Density* means the total population to be served by the project divided by the total number of square miles to be served by the project. If multiple service areas are proposed, the density calculation will be made on the combined areas as if they were a single area, and not the average densities.
