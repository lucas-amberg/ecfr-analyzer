# § 1744.63   The telephone loan budget.

When the loan is made, RUS provides the borrower a Telephone Loan Budget, RUS Form 493. This budget divides the loan into budget accounts such as “Engineering.” When a contract or other document is approved by RUS, funds are encumbered from the appropriate budget account. See 7 CFR part 1753.
