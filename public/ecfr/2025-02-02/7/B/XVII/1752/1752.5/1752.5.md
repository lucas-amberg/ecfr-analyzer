# ยง 1752.5   Monetary default by Borrower.

A defaulting Borrower's primary responsibility is to expeditiously bring the delinquent account current. If a monetary default exceeds 60 days, RUS will attempt to discuss the situation with the Borrower and make the Borrower aware of options that may be available. In considering options, the prospects for providing a permanent cure without adversely affecting the risk to the Agency is the paramount objective. RUS will also work with entities that are not in monetary default but whose financial position is such that, without RUS action, a monetary default is imminent within the next 24 months, as evidenced by a financial forecast provided by the Borrower. RUS receives quarterly financial reports and annual audits from borrowers and actively monitors the borrower's Times Interest Earned Ratio (TIER), Current Ration, Debt Service Coverage Ratio, and Net Worth.
