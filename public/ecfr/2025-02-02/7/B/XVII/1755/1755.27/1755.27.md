# ยง 1755.27   Borrower contractual obligations.

(a) *Loan agreement.* As a condition of a loan or loan guaranteed under the RE Act, borrowers are normally required to enter into RUS loan agreements pursuant to which the borrowers agree to use RUS standard contract forms for construction, procurement, engineering services, and architectural services financed in whole or in part by the RUS loan. To comply with the provisions of the loan agreements as implemented by this part, borrowers must use those contract forms identified in the list of telecommunications standard contract forms, set forth in ยง 1755.30(c) of this part.


(b) *Compliance.* (1) If a borrower is required by part 1753 to use a listed contract form, the borrower shall use the listed contract form in the format available from RUS. The forms shall not be retyped, changed, modified, or altered in any manner not specifically authorized in this part or approved by RUS in writing. Any modifications approved by RUS must be clearly shown so as to indicate the difference from the listed contract form.


(2) The borrower may use electronic reproductions of a contract form if the contract documents submitted for RUS approval are exact reproductions of the RUS form and include the following certification by the borrower: I (Insert name of the person.), certify that the attached (Insert name of the contract form.), between (Insert name of the parties.), dated (Insert contract date.) is an exact reproduction of RUS Form (Insert form number), dated (Insert date of RUS form).


(c) *Amendment.* Where a borrower has entered into a contract in the form required by 7 CFR part 1753, no change may be made in the terms of the contract, by amendment, waiver or otherwise, without the prior written approval of RUS.


(d) *Waiver.* RUS may waive for good cause, on a case-by-case basis, the requirements imposed on a borrower pursuant to this part. Borrowers seeking an RUS waiver must provide RUS with a written request explaining the need for the waiver.


(e) *Violations.* A failure on the part of the borrower to use listed contracts as prescribed in 7 CFR part 1753 is a violation of the terms of the loan agreement with RUS and RUS may exercise any and all remedies available under the terms of the agreement or otherwise.
