# § 1770.12   Supplementary accounts.

(a) All borrowers shall maintain the supplementary accounts set forth in § 1770.15. These accounts conform in number and title with accounts prescribed in the FCC Uniform System of Accounts. In those instances in which a State regulatory body having jurisdiction over an RUS borrower has prescribed a system of accounts differing from that of the FCC, the account titles prescribed by RUS in § 1770.15 shall remain unchanged; however, the supplementary account numbers shall be changed to conform with the State's accounting system.


(b) In addition to the accounts set forth in § 1770.15, cooperative or other nonprofit borrowers shall maintain the supplementary accounts set forth in § 1770.16.


(c) Borrowers are permitted to deviate from the specific subaccount numbers detailed in §§ 1770.15 and 1770.16 provided that the primary account numbers and account descriptions conform with those prescribed.
