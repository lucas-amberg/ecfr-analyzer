(2) Shall not be eligible to apply for or receive direct or insured loans from RUS until the borrower has repaid to the RUS the sum of: 


(i) The amount (if any) by which the discount the borrower received by reason of the prepayment exceeds the discount the borrower would have received had the discount been based on the cost of funds to the Department of the Treasury as calculated at ยง 1786.153 at the time of the prepayment; and 


(ii) Interest on the amount described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section for the period beginning on the date of the prepayment and ending on the date of the repayment, at a rate equal to the average annual cost of borrowing by the Department of the Treasury.
