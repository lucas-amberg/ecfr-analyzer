# ยง 1789.155   Approval criteria.

RUS will consider approving the use of consultant services funded by a Borrower on a case by case basis taking into account, among other matters, the following: 


(a) Whether such services are required to facilitate timely action on a Borrower's Application. RUS shall determine what represents timely action with respect to each Application considering, among other matters, the review period normally required for such projects by RUS and other lenders and the consequences to the Borrower of adjusting the review period. 


(b) The availability of staff resources, the priorities of other projects then before RUS, and the efficiencies to be realized from the use of consultant services. 


(c) Whether it is in the best interest of RUS to use Borrower-funded Consultants. Certain types of projects, such as those involving issues of program-wide significance, may not be well suited for the use of Borrower funded Consultants.
