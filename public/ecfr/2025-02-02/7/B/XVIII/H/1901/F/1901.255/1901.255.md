L. 93-291. The State Director's letter to the Regional Director should request a response within 45 calendar days as to whether the National Park Service intends to cause a survey to be made, declines to undertake a survey, or that a survey is not warranted based on available data.

(5) When the survey made in paragraph (c)(3) of this section does not identify any historical and archeological properties that may be eligible for inclusion in the National Register, or the National Park Service is not going to undertake activity pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the State Director, after consultation with the SHPO and the National Park Service, will document the findings and proceed with processing of the application.


(6) When the survey identifies properties that may be eligible for inclusion in the National Register, the State Director will request the SHPO to proceed with the nomination of such properties. The State Director will then proceed as outlined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section for any properties accepted for inclusion in the National Register.
