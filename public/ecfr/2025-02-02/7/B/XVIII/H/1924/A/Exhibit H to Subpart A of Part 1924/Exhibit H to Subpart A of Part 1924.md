The Agency shall not permit the use of lead-based paint on applicable surfaces of any housing or buildings purchased, repaired, or rehabilitated for human habitation with financial assistance provided by this agency. Paints used on applicable surfaces shall not contain more than 0.06 percent lead by weight calculated as lead metal in the total nonvolatile content of liquid paints or in the dried film of paint already applied.

This includes any institutional structure where persons reside, such as an orphanage, boarding school, dormitory, day care center or extended care facility, college housing, domestic or migratory labor housing, hospitals, group practice facilities, community facilities, and business or industrial facilities.

B. For all existing housing and buildings built *after* 1950, on which a loan is closed after July 19, 1978, the Agency requires that the applicant, borrower or tenant be notified of the potential hazard of lead-based paints, of the symptoms and treatment of lead poisoning, and of the importance and availability of maintenance and removal techniques for eliminating such hazards. This will be accomplished by providing each applicant, borrower and/or tenant with a copy of attachment 1 to this exhibit H, “Lead-based Paint Hazards, Symptoms, Treatment and Techniques for Eliminating Hazards,” available in any Agency County Office. Copies of attachment 1 may be obtained by the County Supervisor from the Finance Office, 1520 Market Street, St. Louis, MO 63103.

E. All inventory housing or buildings built before 1950 to be repaired, renovated, or rehabilitated shall have tests for lead content, and where found to be hazardous, shall have any interior lead-based paint removed entirely. Loose or cracked surfaces shall be cleaned down to the base surface before repainting with a paint containing not more than six one-hundredths of 1 percentum lead by weight in the total nonvolatile content of the paint or the equivalent measure of lead in the dried film of paint already applied or both. Contracting officers shall include the following provision prohibiting the use of lead-based paint in all contracts and subcontracts for construction or rehabilitation of housing or buildings:


No lead-based paint containing more than .5 of 1 percentum lead by weight (calculated as lead metal) in the total nonvolatile content of the paint, or the equivalent measure of lead in the dried film of paint already applied, or both, or with respect to paint manufactured after June 22, 1977, no lead-based paint containing more than .06 of 1 percentum lead by weight (calculated as lead metal) in the total nonvolatile content of the paint, or the equivalent measure of lead in the dried film of paint already applied, or both, shall be used in the construction or rehabilitation of residential structures under this contract or any subsequent subcontractors.

Section 401 of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act as amended by the National Consumer Health Information and Health Promotion Act of 1976, Pub. L. 94-317, provides a requirement that each federal agency issue regulations and to take such other steps necessary to prohibit the use of lead-based paint on all applicable surfaces in Federal and Federally-assisted construction or rehabilitation of residential structures. The Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act, Pub. L. 91-695, January 13, 1971, provides for grants to units of general local government in any state for the purpose of detecting and treating incidents of lead-based paint poisoning. Title II of this Act also provides for grants to the same units to identify those areas of risk including testing to detect the presence of lead-based paint on surfaces of residential housing.
