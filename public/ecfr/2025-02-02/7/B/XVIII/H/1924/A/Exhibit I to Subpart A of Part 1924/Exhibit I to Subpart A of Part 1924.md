# Exhibit I to Subpart A of Part 1924—Guidelines for Seasonal Farm Labor Housing




General—This exhibit sets forth the guidelines and minimum standards for planning and construction of new Labor Housing (LH) that will be occupied on a seasonal basis. Rehabilitation LH projects will be in substantial conformance with these guidelines and standards. A “seasonal basis” is defined as 6 months or less per year. Seasonal housing for the farmworker need not be convertible to year-round occupancy; however, the living units shall be designed for the intended type of tenant, the time of occupancy, the location, the specific site, and the planned method of operation. It is important that the design of the LH site and buildings will help to create a pleasing lifestyle which will promote human dignity and pride among its tenants.


Codes and Regulations—Compliance is required with National, state and local codes or regulations affecting design, construction, mechanical, electrical, fire prevention, sanitation, and site improvement.


300-1 Complete architectural/engineering services in accordance with this subpart will be required if an LH grant is involved or the LH loan will involve more than four individual family units, or any number of group living units, or dormitory units accommodating 20 or more persons.


300-2 Buildings and site design shall provide for a safe, secure, economical, healthful, and attractive living facility and environment suited to the needs of the domestic farm laborer and his/her family.


300-3 At least 5 percent of the individual family units in a project, or one unit, whichever is greater, and all common use facilities will be accessible to or adaptable for physically handicapped persons.

Some of the features which must be considered are the topography, drainage, access, building orientation to sun and breezes; and advantageous features, such as vegetation, trees, good views, etc. or disadvantageous features, such as offensive odors, noxious plants, noise, dust, health hazards, etc.


301-2 Drainage—Surface and subsurface drainage systems shall be provided in accordance with the applicable development standard and subpart C of part 1924 of this chapter.
