# § 1940.593   Other Rural Business-Cooperative Service programs.

If the Agency determines that it is in the best interest of the Federal government to allocate funds to States for existing RBS programs other than those identified in §§ 1940.588 and 1940.589 of this subpart and for programs new to RBS (e.g., through new legislation), the Agency will use the process identified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.


(a) If the Agency determines that one of the State allocation procedures in § 1940.588 and § 1940.589 is appropriate for the program, the Agency will publish a _Federal Register_ notice identifying the program and which State allocation procedure will be used for the program.


(b) If the Agency determines that none of the procedures specified in § 1940.588 and § 1940.589 is appropriate for the program, the Agency will implement the following steps:


(1) The Agency will either develop a preliminary state allocation formula and administrative procedures specific to the requirements of the new program or use whichever of the procedures in § 1940.588 and § 1940.589 the Agency determines most closely matches the purpose of the program. The Agency will publish in the _Federal Register_ the State allocation formula and adminstrative procedures that it will use initially for the new program.


(2) The Agency will develop a State allocation formula and administrative provisions specific to the new program and publish them as a proposed rule change to this part in the _Federal Register_ for public comment.


(3) Until the program's State allocation formula and administrative requirements are finalized, the Agency will use the preliminary State allocation formula established under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to make State allocations and administer the new program.
