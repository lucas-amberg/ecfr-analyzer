# ยง 1944.75   Exception authority.

The Administrator may, in individual cases, make an exception to any requirement or provision of this subpart which is not inconsistent with the authorizing statute or other applicable law if the Administrator determines that the Government's interest would be adversely affected. The Administrator will exercise this authority only at the request of the State Director and recommendation of the Deputy Administrator, Single Family Housing. Requests for exceptions must be in writing by the State Director and supported with documentation to explain the adverse effect on the Government's interest and/or impact on the applicant, borrower, or community, proposed alternative courses of action, and show how the adverse effect will be eliminated or minimized if the exception is granted.
