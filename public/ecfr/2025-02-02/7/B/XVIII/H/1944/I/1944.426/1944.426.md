# § 1944.426   Grant closeout.

(a) *Grant purposes completed.* Promptly after the date of completion, grant closeout actions will be taken to allow the orderly discontinuance of grantee activity.


(1) The grantee will immediately refund to Rural Development any balance of grant funds that are not committed for the payment of authorized expenses.


(2) The grantee will furnish Form SF-269A, “Financial Status Report (short form)” to Rural Development within 90 days after the date of completion of the grant. All other financial, performance, and other reports required as a condition of the grant also will be completed.


(3) After the grant closeout, Rural Development retains the right to recover any disallowed costs which are discovered as a result of the final audit. 7 CFR part 3550 will be used by Rural Development to recover any unauthorized expenditures.


(4) The grantee will provide Rural Development an audit conforming to those requirements established in this part, including audits of self-help borrower accounts.


(5) Upon request from the recipient, any allowable reimbursable cost not covered by previous payments shall be promptly paid by Rural Development.


(b) *Grant purposes not completed*—(1) *Notification of termination.* The State Director will promptly notify the grantee and the National Office in writing of the termination action including the specific reasons for the decision and the effective date of the termination. The notification to the grantee will specify that if the grantee believes the reason for the proposed termination can be resolved, the grantee should, within 15 calendar days of the date of this notification, contact the State Director in writing requesting a meeting for further consideration. The meeting will be an informal proceeding at which the grantee will be given the opportunity to provide whatever additional information it believes should be considered in reaching a decision concerning the case. The grantee may have an attorney or any other person present at the meeting if desired. Within 7 calendar days of the meeting, the State Director will determine what action to take.


(i) If the State Director determines that termination is not necessary, the grantee will be informed by letter along with the District Director.


(ii) If the State Director determines that termination of the grant is appropriate, he/she will promptly inform the grantee by the use of exhibit B-3 of subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter.


(2) *National Office review.* (i) Upon receipt of a request from a grantee that the decision of the State Director be reconsidered, the National Office will make a preliminary decision concerning the continued funding of the grantee during the appeal period. Written notification of the decision will be given to the State Director and grantee.


(ii) The National Office will then obtain a comprehensive report on the matter from the State Office. This information will be considered together with any additional information that may be provided by the grantee.


(c) *Grant suspension.* When the grantee has failed to comply with the terms of the agreement, the District Director will promptly report the facts to the State Director. The State Director will consider termination or suspension of the grant usually only after a Grantee has been classified as “high risk” in accordance with § 1944.417(b)(2). When the State Director determines that the grantee has a reasonable potential to correct deficiencies the grant may be suspended. The State Director will request written authorization from the National Office to suspend a grantee. The suspension will adhere to 2 CFR part 200 as adopted by USDA through 2 CFR part 400. The grantee will be notified of the grant suspension in writing by the State Director. The State Director will also promptly inform the grantee of its rights to appeal the decision by use of Exhibit B-3 of Subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter.


(d) *Grant termination.* The State Director may terminate the grant agreement whenever Rural Development determines that the grantee has failed to comply with terms of the Agreement. The reasons for termination may include, but are not limited to, such problems as listed in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of exhibit A of this subpart. The State Director may also withhold further disbursement of grant funds and prohibit the grantee from incurring additional obligations of grant funds with written approval of the National Office. Rural Development will allow all necessary and proper costs which grantee could not reasonably avoid.


(1) *Termination for cause.* The grant agreement may be terminated in whole, or in part, at any time before date of completion, whenever Rural Development determines that the grantee has failed to comply with terms of the Agreement. The State Director will notify the grantee in writing giving the reasons for the action and inform the grantee of its rights of appeal by use of exhibit B-3 of subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter.


(2) *Termination for convenience.* FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 or the grantee may terminate the grant in whole, or in part, when both parties agree that the continuation of the grant would not produce beneficial results. The two parties will agree in writing to the termination conditions including the effective date. No notice of rights of appeal will be issued by Rural Development.
