(1) payment of reasonable salaries or contracts for professional, technical, and clerical staff actively assisting in the delivery of the HPG project.


(2) Payment of necessary and reasonable office expenses such as office rental, supplies, utilities, telephone services, and equipment. (Any item of nonexpendable personal property having a unit value of $1,000 or more, acquired with HPG funds, will be specifically identified to Rural Development in writing.)

(5) Payment of necessary and reasonable costs for an audit upon expiration of the grant agreement.


(6) Other reasonable travel and miscellaneous expenses necessary to accomplish the objectives of the specific HPG grant which were anticipated in the individual HPG grant proposal and which have been approved as eligible expenses at the time of grant approval.

(1) Preparing housing development plans and strategies except as necessary to accomplish the specific objectives of the HPG project.


(2) Substitution of any financial support previously provided or currently available from any other source.

(7) Any type of political activities prohibited by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-122.
