# ยง 1948.62   Environmental impact requirements.

(a) Issuance of grants and other actions taken under this subpart must comply with the environmental review requirements in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970.


(b) Subsequent to an energy impact area designation by the Governor and establishment of priorities, the Rural Development State Director, in consultation with the Governor, shall define the geographic boundaries or otherwise delineate the areas which will be studied for environmental impacts.


(c) Boundaries shall define the area within which the environmental impacts of the proposed action can be reasonably studied. Proper delineation of impact areas will avoid duplication of effort by using one assessment or impact statement to study a broad area rather than numerous overlapping documents prepared for smaller projects.
