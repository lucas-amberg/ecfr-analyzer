Herein called “Grantee,” and the United States of America acting through the Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, Department of Agriculture, herein called “Grantor,” Witnesseth:


Grantee has determined to undertake a project for site acquisition and/or site development as follows: ______________________________ (herein called project) to serve the approved designated energy impacted area under its jurisdiction at an estimated cost of $__________, and has duly authorized the undertaking of such project;


Grantee is able to finance not more than $__________ of the site acquisition and/or site development costs through revenues, charges, taxes or assessments, or funds otherwise available to Grantee. Said sum has been committed to and by Grantee for such project acquisition and/or site development costs.


The Grantor agrees to grant to Grantee a sum not to exceed $__________ subject to the terms and conditions established by the Grantor. Provided, however, that the proportionate share of any grant funds actually advanced and not needed for grant purposes shall be returned immediately to the Grantor. The Grantor may terminate the grant in whole, or in part, at any time before the date of completion, whenever it is determined that the Grantee has failed to comply with the conditions of the grant.


In consideration of said grant by Grantor to Grantee, to be made pursuant to Section 601 of the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-620) for the purpose only of defraying a part of the acquisition and/or site development costs, as defined by applicable Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 regulations:
