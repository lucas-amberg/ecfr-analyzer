(a) *Approval official's scope of authority.* Any action that is not in conflict with the limitations in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section shall not be undertaken until the approval official has consulted with the appropriate Regional Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Regional Director may or may not concur that the proposed action does or does not violate the provisions of the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA). Pursuant to the requirements of the CBRA, and except as specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, no maintenance or repair action may be taken for property located within a CBRS where:


(1) The action goes beyond maintenance, replacement-in-kind, reconstruction, or repair and would result in the expansion of any roads, structures or facilities. Water and waste disposal facilities as well as community facilities may be improved to the extent required to meet health and safety requirements but may not be improved or expanded to serve additional users, patients, or residents;


(2) The action is inconsistent with the purposes of the CBRA; or


(3) The property to be repaired or maintained was initially the subject of a financial transaction that violated the CBRA.


(b) *Administrator's review.* Any proposed maintenance or repair action that does not conform to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section must be forwarded to the Administrator for review and approval. Approval will not be granted unless the Administrator determines, through consultation with the Department of the Interior, that the proposed action does not violate the provisions of the CBRA.


(c) *Emergency provisions.* In emergency situations to prevent imminent loss of life, imminent substantial damage to the inventory property or the disruption of utility service, the approval official may take whatever minimum steps are necessary to prevent such loss or damage without first consulting with the appropriate Regional Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. However, the Regional Director must be immediately notified of any such emergency action.
