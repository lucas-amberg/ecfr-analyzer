# § 1955.146   Advertising.

(a) *General.* When property is being sold by Rural Development or through real estate brokers, it is the servicing official's responsibility to ensure adequate advertising of property to achieve a timely sale. The primary means of advertisements are newspaper advertisements in accordance with RD Instruction 2024-F (available in any Rural Development office), public notice using Form RD 1955-41, “Notice of Sale,” and notification of known interested parties. Other innovative means are encouraged, such as the use of a bulletin board to display photographs of inventory properties for sale with a brief synopsis of the property attached; posting Forms 1955-40 or 1955-43, as appropriate, in the reception area to attract applicant and broker interest; posting notices of sale at employment centers; door-to-door distribution of sales notices at apartment complexes; radio and/or television spots; group meetings with potential applicants/investors/real estate brokers; and advertisements in magazines and other periodicals. If Rural DevelopmentFmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 personnel are not available to perform these services, Rural Development may contract for such services in accordance with Rural Development Instruction 2024-A (available in any Rural Development office).


(b) *Large-value and complex properties.* Advertising for MFH, B&I and other large-value or complex properties should also be placed in appropriate newspapers and publications designed to reach the type of particular purchasers most likely to be interested in the inventory property. The State Director will assist the District Director in determining the scope of advertising necessary to adequately market these properties. Advertising for MFH and other complex properties must also include appropriate language stressing the need to obtain and submit complete application materials for the type program involved.


(c) *MFH restrictive-use provisions.* Advertisements for multi-family housing projects will advise prospective purchasers of any restrictive-use requirements that will be attached to the project and added to the title of the property.


(d) *Racial and socio-economic considerations.* In accordance with the policies set forth in § 1901.203(c) of subpart E of part 1901 of this chapter, the approval official will make a special effort to insure that those prospective purchasers in the marketing area who traditionally would not be expected to apply for housing assistance because of existing racial or socio-economic patterns are reached.


(e) *Rejected application for SFH loan.* If an application for a SFH loan is being rejected because income is too high, a statement should be included in the rejection letter that inventory properties may be available for which they may apply.
