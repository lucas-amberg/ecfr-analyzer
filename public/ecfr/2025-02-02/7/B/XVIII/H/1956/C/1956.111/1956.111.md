Rural Development personnel will process reorganization plans of debtors filing under Chapter 9, Chapter 11, or Chapter 13 as follows:


(a) Plans submitted by debtors under Chapters 9, 11, and 13 must be sent by the servicing official to the State Director who will recommend either acceptance or rejection of the plans and refer them to the United States Attorney through OGC. When the plan calls for the adjustment of a debt to Rural Development, the State Director will obtain the advice of the Administrator before providing OGC with a recommendation on acceptance or rejection of this plan.


(b) The United States Attorney will advise the State Director, through OGC, as to approval or rejection of the debtor's reorganization plan. The State Director will then notify the Finance Office by memorandum of the terms and conditions of the bankruptcy reorganization plan, including any adjustment of the debt.
