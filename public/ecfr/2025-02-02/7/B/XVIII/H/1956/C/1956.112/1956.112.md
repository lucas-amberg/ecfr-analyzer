(c) If an investigation for suspected fiscal irregularity is contemplated or pending, or


(d) When a claim has been referred to or a judgment has been obtained by the United States Attorney and the debtor requests settlement, the servicing official will explain to the debtor that the United States Attorney has exclusive jurisdiction over the claim or judgment, and therefore, Rural Devlopment has no authority to agree to a settlement offer.
