The rule provides to the Secretary of Energy (for purposes of Section 401(a) of the NGPA) and to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the following certifications: 


(a) Essential agricultural *uses* of natural gas, expressed as classes of establishments that use gas for essential agricultural purposes; and
