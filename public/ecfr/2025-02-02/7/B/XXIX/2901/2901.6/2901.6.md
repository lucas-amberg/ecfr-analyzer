# ยง 2901.6   Exceptions and exemptions.

(a) *Request for exception or exemption.* (1) Any person seeking an exception or exemption from the Essential Agricultural Uses and Requirements regulations in part 2900 shall file a formal written request with the Director. The request shall contain a full and complete statement of all relevant facts pertaining to the circumstance, act, or transaction that is the subject of the request and to the action sought. The request should state the special hardship, inequity or unfair distribution of burdens that will be prevented by making the exception or exemption. The Director shall publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ advising the public that a request for an exception or exemption has been received and that written comments will be accepted with respect thereto if received within 20 days of the notice. The _Federal Register_ notice will provide that copies of the request from which confidential information has been deleted in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be obtained from the petitioner. The Petitioner shall be afforded an opportunity to respond to such submissions.


(2) If the petitioner wishes to claim confidential treatment for any information contained in the request or other documents submitted under this part 2901, such person shall file together with the document a second copy of the document from which has been deleted the information for which such person wishes to claim confidential treatment. The petitioner shall indicate in the original document that it is confidential or contains confidential information and may file a statement specifying the justification for non-disclosure of the information for which non-disclosure is sought.

The Director shall publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ of the issuance of a decision and order on the request. The granting of a request for an exception or exemption shall be considered final agency action for purposes of judicial review under ยง 2901.8.


(c) *Denial of an exception or exemption.* A request for an exception or exemption shall be considered denied for purposes of review of such denial under ยง 2901.7 only if:
