# ยง 3200.9   Accountability and record keeping.

USDA requires that Federal excess personal property received by an eligible institution pursuant to this part shall be placed into use for a research, educational, technical, or scientific activity, or for a related purpose, within 1 year of receipt of the property, and used for such purpose for at least 1 year thereafter. The institution's property management officer must establish and maintain accountable records identifying the property's location, description, utilization and value. To ensure that the excess personal property is being used for its intended purpose under this part, compliance reviews will be conducted by an authorized representative of USDA. The review will include site visit inspections of the property and the accountability and record keeping systems.
