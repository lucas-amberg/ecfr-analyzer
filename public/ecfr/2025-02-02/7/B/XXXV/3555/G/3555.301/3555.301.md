(d) *Determine ability to cure.* The lender must make a reasonable effort to obtain from the borrower information regarding the reason for default, the borrower's current financial situation and any other necessary information to evaluate the borrower's ability to cure the default and determine a feasible plan for collection, and/or alternatives to foreclosure.
