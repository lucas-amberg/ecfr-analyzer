If the annual financial reports indicate that an ROI should not have been taken, borrowers will be required to return any unauthorized ROI.

(ii) The housing project has sufficient funds to address identified capital or operational needs.


(b) *Unpaid return on investment.* An earned, but unpaid ROI for the previous year only may be requested by the borrower and authorized by the Agency under the provisions of ยง 3560.305(a)(2) provided the current year's ROI has been paid first and a rent increase is not required to generate funds to pay the unpaid ROI.
