# ยง 3560.354   Borrower response to monitoring review notifications.

The Agency will notify borrowers, in writing, whenever Agency monitoring activities result in deficiency findings or compliance violations. The monitoring review notification will describe the deficiencies findings or compliance violations and will specify a time period by which corrective action must be taken by the borrower. The notification will offer borrowers an opportunity to discuss the reported deficiency findings or compliance violations with the Agency and will explain enforcement actions that the Agency may take if corrective action is not taken within the time period specified in the monitoring review notification. When civil rights non-compliance is found, the State Civil Rights Coordinator or Manager (SCRC/M) will be notified. If voluntary compliance cannot be obtained, appropriate enforcement or remedial action will be taken.
