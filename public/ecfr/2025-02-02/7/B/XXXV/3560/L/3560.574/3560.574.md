# § 3560.574   Operating assistance.

Operating assistance may be used in lieu of tenant-specific rental assistance in off-farm labor housing projects financed under section 514 or section 516(i) of the Housing Act of 1949 (U.S.C. 1486(i)) that serve migrant farmworkers. Owners of eligible projects may choose tenant-specific rental assistance as described in § 3560.573 or operating assistance, or a combination of both, however, any tenant or unit assisted under this section may not receive rental assistance under § 3560.572. The objective of this program is to provide assistance toward the cost of operating the project so that rents may be set at rates that are affordable to very low and low-income migrant farmworkers.


(a) *Project eligibility requirements.* To be eligible for the operating assistance program, projects must be:


(1) Off-farm labor housing projects financed under section 514 or section 516 with units that are for migrant farmworkers. Housing units for year-round farmworker households are ineligible; and


(2) Eligible for the Agency's rental assistance program as defined in § 3560.573.


(b) *Operating assistance limits.* The amount of operating assistance requested by the owner must be based on the project's actual income and expenses and must be approved by the Agency. In the case of a mixed project, the amount of operating assistance must be based on the portion of actual income and expenses that are attributable to the units that are for migrant farmworkers. In no instance may the annual amount of operating assistance exceed 90 percent of the annual operating costs that are attributable to the migrant units.


(c) *Owner responsibilities*—(1) *Requesting for operating assistance program.* Owners of off-farm labor housing projects with units for migrant farmworkers may request operating assistance by submitting a request to the Agency, which must include a budget. The budget must include:


(i) Estimated operating costs for the migrant units, including authorized expenditures such as reserve deposits;


(ii) Proposed rental rates for the migrant units to generate sufficient funds for operating costs of those units, taking into consideration all other sources of project income; and


(iii) Estimated rental income from tenants, based on a tenant contribution of 30 percent of the average adjusted monthly income of migrant farmworker households in the area.


(2) *Requesting operating assistance payments.* Each month, the owner will submit a request for operating assistance to the Agency.


(3) *Verifying tenant income eligibility.* Owners are responsible for verifying tenant income eligibility. Only very low or low-income households are eligible for the operating assistance rents. Households with incomes above the low-income limits must pay the full rent.


(4) *Reporting requirements.* (i) Owners will complete and submit to the Agency tenant certifications to document tenant income and eligibility.


(ii) Owners will complete and submit monthly to the Agency a project worksheet for operating assistance.


(iii) Owners must submit an annual planning budget to the Agency prior to the project's fiscal year.
