# § 3560.576   Occupancy restrictions.

(a) *Restrictions on conditions of occupancy.* (1) No borrower or grantee will be permitted to require that an occupant work on any particular farm or for any particular owner or interest as a condition of occupancy of the housing.


(2) Tenant selection should be in accordance with the loan agreement, subpart D of this part and § 3560.577.


(3) No borrower or grantee will discriminate, or permit discrimination by any agent, lessee, or other operator in the use or occupancy of the housing or related facilities because of race, color, religion, sex, age, disability, familial status, or national origin.


(b) *Eligible households.* To be eligible for occupancy in off-farm labor housing, households must meet the following requirements. 


(1) *Occupational.* An eligible household must include a domestic tenant or co-tenant farm laborer, a retired domestic farm laborer, or a disabled domestic farm laborer.


(2) *Income.* The household must meet the definition of income eligible as established in § 3560.152 and the tenant or co-tenant must receive a substantial portion of income from farm labor employment. To determine if a substantial portion of income is from farm labor employment, the following measures will be used.


(i) For housing rented to farm laborers and owned by public bodies, public or private nonprofit organizations, and limited partnerships when charging rent.


(A) Actual dollars earned from farm labor by domestic farm laborers other than migrant farmworkers must equal at least 65 percent of the annual income limits indicated for the Standard Federal regions as published by the Agency for their particular region of the country. For migrant farmworkers living in seasonal housing the actual dollars earned from farm labor by a domestic farm laborer must equal at least 50 percent of annual income limits indicated for the Standard Federal regions, as published by the Agency.


(B) An alternate measure for determining substantial portion of income when actual earnings are not available may be the duration of time a farm laborer worked on a farm or other farming enterprise as a domestic farmworker during the preceding 12 months. In order to be considered as substantial the farm laborer must have worked at least 110 whole days in farm work. For purposes of this section one whole day is the equivalent of at least 7 hours. When using a period of more than 1 year, a yearly average must amount to at least 110 days per year.


(ii) For housing owned by a farmer, family-farm partnership, family-farm corporation, or an association of farmers which was initially provided on a non-rental basis, a substantial portion of income is earned when housing is provided by the owner as part of employment compensation for farm labor.


(iii) When a natural disaster has occurred, such as a drought, flood, freeze, etc., figures for the 12 months preceding such disaster will be used to determine substantial portion of income under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.


(iv) The tenant who qualifies as a domestic farm laborer residing in a property with a nonrestrictive farm labor clause in the mortgage covenants must not have adjusted income which exceeds the moderate income limit for the appropriate household size and appropriate geographical area.


(3) *Occupancy.* The household must remain in compliance with the borrower's occupancy policy as established in § 3560.155.


(c) *Tenant eligibility requirements for operating assistance rents.* To be eligible for operating assistance rents, tenants must meet the rental assistance eligibility requirements described in § 3560.573 and in § 3560.252.


(d) *Ineligible tenants.* Tenants who, at any time, fail to meet all the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section will be deemed ineligible for occupancy in off-farm labor housing. Ineligible tenants in off-farm labor housing will be addressed in accordance with the requirements of § 3560.158.






(e) *Non-farm laborer tenants.* When there is a diminished need for housing for persons or families in the above categories, units in off-farm labor housing complexes may be made available to persons or families eligible for occupancy under § 3560.152. Eligible tenants under this section may occupy the labor housing until such time the units are again needed by persons or families eligible under paragraph (b) of this section. As the basis for Agency approval or disapproval of the borrower's determination of diminished need, the borrower must submit a current analysis of need and demand to the Agency, identical to the market analysis that is required of loan applicants in the loan origination process. The borrower's determination and the MFH Leadership Designee's recommendation should be forwarded to the National Office for concurrence. The procedures specified in § 3560.158 shall be followed when tenants are required to vacate housing to allow for occupancy by persons eligible under paragraph (b) of this section.
