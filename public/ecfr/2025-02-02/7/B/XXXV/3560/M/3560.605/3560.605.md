# ยง 3560.605   Eligibility requirements.

(a) To be eligible for an on-farm labor housing loan, the applicant must meet the requirements of ยง 3560.55(a) with the exception of ยง 3560.55(a)(1), (5), and (6) and the following requirements.


(1) The applicant must be a farm owner, family farm partnership, family farm corporation, or an association of farmers engaged in agricultural or aquacultural farming operations whose farming operations demonstrate a need for on-farm labor housing and who will own the housing and operate it on a nonprofit basis.


(2) The applicant must agree to use the labor housing to engage in the farming operations of the individual farm owner applicant, or in the farming operations of its members if it is a family farm corporation or partnership, or an association of farmers.


(3) The applicant must, as determined by the Agency, be unable to provide the necessary housing from the applicant's own resources and be unable to obtain credit from any other source upon terms and conditions which the applicant could reasonably be expected to fulfill. If the applicant is an association of farmers or family farm corporation or partnership, the individual members, individually and jointly, must be unable to provide the necessary housing by utilizing their own resources and be unable, by pledging their personal liability, to obtain other credit that would enable them to provide housing for farm workers at rental rates they can afford to pay. The individual resources of family farm corporation or partnership members with less than a 10 percent corporate or partnership interest should not be considered when determining if the applicant can obtain credit elsewhere.


(b) The Agency may make an exception to the requirement that an individual farm owner, family farm corporation, family farm partnership or an association of farmers be unable to obtain the necessary credit elsewhere when all of the following conditions exist:


(1) There is a housing need in the area for domestic farmworkers who are migrants and the applicant will provide such housing; and


(2) There are no qualified state or political subdivisions or public or private nonprofit organizations available, or likely to become available within 12 months of the application, that are willing and able to provide the housing.


(c) When an applicant is determined eligible under paragraph (b) of this section, the interest rate for such loans will be determined in accordance with 7 CFR part 1810, subpart A.


(d) On-farm labor housing that consists of buildings with less than three units is not subject to the requirement that five percent of the units be constructed as fully accessible units, as described in ยง 3560.60(d).
