(a) Grants are sometimes made by Federal Regional Commissions (designated under Title V of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965) for projects eligible for RHS assistance. RHS has agreed to administer such funds in a manner similar to administering RHS assistance.


(b) The transfer of funds from a Federal Regional Commission to RHS will be based on specific applications determined to be eligible for an authorized purpose in accordance with the requirements of RHS and the Federal Regional Commission.
