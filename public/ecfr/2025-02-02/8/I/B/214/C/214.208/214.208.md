# ยง 214.208   Compliance with any reasonable request for assistance in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of an act of trafficking.

(a) *Requirement.* To be eligible for T-1 nonimmigrant status, an applicant must have complied with any reasonable request for assistance from an LEA in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of acts of trafficking or the investigation of a crime where acts of trafficking are at least one central reason for the commission of that crime, unless the applicant meets an exception or exemption described in paragraph (e) of this section.


(b) *Applicability.* An applicant must, at a minimum, contact an LEA with proper jurisdiction to report the acts of a severe form of trafficking in persons. Credible evidence documenting a single contact with an LEA may suffice. Reporting may be telephonic, electronic, or through other means. An applicant who has never had contact with an LEA regarding the acts of a severe form of trafficking in persons will not be eligible for T-1 nonimmigrant status, unless they meet an exemption or exception as described in paragraph (e) of this section.


(c) *Reasonable requests.* An applicant need only show compliance with reasonable requests made by an LEA for assistance in the investigation or prosecution of the acts of trafficking in persons. The reasonableness of the request depends on the totality of the circumstances. Factors to consider include, but are not limited to:


(1) General law enforcement and prosecutorial practices;


(2) The nature of the victimization;


(3) The specific circumstances of the victim;


(4) The victim's capacity, competency, or lack thereof;


(5) Trauma suffered (both mental and physical) or whether the request would cause further trauma;


(6) Access to support services;


(7) The safety of the victim or the victim's family;


(8) Compliance with previous requests and the extent of such compliance;


(9) Whether the request would yield essential information;


(10) Whether the information could be obtained without the victim's compliance;


(11) Whether a qualified interpreter or attorney was present to ensure the victim understood the request;


(12) Cultural, religious, or moral objections to the request;


(13) The time the victim had to comply with the request;


(14) The age, health, and maturity of the victim; and


(15) Any other relevant circumstances surrounding the request.


(d) *Evidence.* An applicant must submit evidence that demonstrates that they have complied with any reasonable request for assistance in a Federal, State, Tribal, or local detection, investigation, or prosecution of trafficking in persons, or a crime where trafficking in persons is at least one central reason for the commission of that crime. In the alternative, an applicant can submit evidence to demonstrate that they should be exempt under paragraph (e) of this section. If USCIS has any question about whether the applicant has complied with a reasonable request for assistance, USCIS may contact the LEA. The applicant may satisfy this requirement by submitting any of the following:


(1) An LEA declaration as described in ยง 214.204(c);


(2) Documentation of a grant of Continued Presence under 28 CFR 1100.35; or


(3) Any other evidence, including affidavits of witnesses. In the victim's statement prescribed by ยง 214.204(c), the applicant should show that an LEA that has responsibility and authority for the detection, investigation, or prosecution of severe forms of trafficking in persons has information about such trafficking in persons, that the victim has complied with any reasonable request for assistance in the investigation or prosecution of such acts of trafficking, and, if the victim did not report the crime, why the crime was not previously reported.


(e) *Exception or exemption.* An applicant who has not had contact with an LEA or who has not complied with any reasonable request may be excepted or exempt from the requirement to comply with any reasonable request for assistance in an investigation or prosecution if either of the following circumstances apply:


(1) *Trauma.* The applicant is unable to cooperate with a reasonable request for assistance from an LEA in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of acts of trafficking in persons due to physical or psychological trauma. An applicant must submit credible evidence of the trauma experienced. The applicant may satisfy this exception by submitting:


(i) A personal statement describing the trauma and explaining the circumstances surrounding the trauma the applicant experienced, including their age, background, maturity, health, disability, and any history of abuse or exploitation;


(ii) A signed statement from a qualified professional, such as a medical professional, mental health professional, social worker, or victim advocate, who attests to the victim's mental state or medical condition;


(iii) Medical or psychological records documenting the trauma or its impact;


(iv) Witness statements;


(v) Photographs;


(vi) Police reports;


(vii) Court records and court orders;


(viii) Disability determinations;


(ix) Government agency findings; or


(x) Any other credible evidence.


(2) *Age.* The applicant was under 18 years of age at the time of victimization. An applicant who was under 18 years of age at the time at least one of the acts of trafficking occurred is exempt from the requirement to comply with any reasonable request for assistance in the detection, investigation, or prosecution, but they must submit evidence of their age at the time of the victimization. Where available, an applicant should include an official copy of their birth certificate, a passport, or a certified medical opinion. USCIS will also consider any other credible evidence submitted regarding the age of the applicant.


(f) *Exception or exemption established.* When an applicant has established that the exception or exemption applies, they are not required to have had any contact with law enforcement or comply with future requests for assistance, including reporting the trafficking. USCIS reserves the authority and discretion to contact the LEA involved in the case, if appropriate.
