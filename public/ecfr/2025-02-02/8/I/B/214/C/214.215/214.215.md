# ยง 214.215   USCIS employee referral.

(a) Any USCIS employee who, while carrying out their official duties, comes into contact with a noncitizen believed to be a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons and is not already working with an LEA may consult, as necessary, with the ICE officials responsible for victim protection, trafficking investigations and prevention, and deterrence.


(b) The ICE office may, in turn, refer the victim to another LEA with responsibility for detecting, investigating, or prosecuting acts of trafficking.


(c) If the noncitizen has a credible claim to victimization, USCIS may advise the individual that they can submit an Application for T Nonimmigrant Status and seek any other benefit or protection for which they may be eligible, provided doing so would not compromise the noncitizen's safety.
