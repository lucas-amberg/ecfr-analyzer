# § 274a.13   Application for employment authorization.

(a) *Application.* An alien requesting employment authorization or an Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766), or both, may be required to apply on a form designated by USCIS with any prescribed fee(s) in accordance with the form instructions. An alien may file such request concurrently with a related benefit request that, if granted, would form the basis for eligibility for employment authorization, only to the extent permitted by the form instructions or as announced by USCIS on its Web site.


(1) The approval of applications filed under 8 CFR 274a.12(c), except for 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(8), are within the discretion of USCIS. Where economic necessity has been identified as a factor, the alien must provide information regarding his or her assets, income, and expenses.


(2) An initial employment authorization request for asylum applicants under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(8) must be filed on the form designated by USCIS in accordance with the form instructions. The applicant also must submit a copy of the underlying application for asylum or withholding of deportation, together with evidence that the application has been filed in accordance with 8 CFR 208.3 and 208.4. An application for an initial employment authorization or for a renewal of employment authorization filed in relation to a pending claim for asylum shall be adjudicated in accordance with 8 CFR 208.7. An application for renewal or replacement of employment authorization submitted in relation to a pending claim for asylum, as provided in 8 CFR 208.7, must be filed, with fee or application for waiver of such fee.


(b) *Approval of application.* If the application is granted, the alien shall be notified of the decision and issued an employment authorization document valid for a specific period and subject to any terms and conditions as noted. 


(c) *Denial of application.* If the application is denied, the applicant shall be notified in writing of the decision and the reasons for the denial. There shall be no appeal from the denial of the application.


(d) *Renewal application*—(1) *Automatic extension of Employment Authorization Documents.* Except as otherwise provided in this chapter or by law, notwithstanding § 274a.14(a)(1)(i), the validity period of an expired or expiring Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766) and, for aliens who are not employment authorized incident to status, also the attendant employment authorization, will be automatically extended for an additional period not to exceed 540 days if the request for renewal meets all of the criteria listed in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section and was pending on May 4, 2022, or was properly filed on or after May 4, 2022. For renewal applications properly filed and adjudicated before May 4, 2022, the validity period of such an expired or expiring Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766) and, for aliens who were not employment authorized incident to status, also the attendant employment authorization, was automatically extended for an additional period not to exceed 180 days if the request for renewal met all of the criteria listed in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. The first day of the automatic extension under this paragraph is the day after the expiration date shown on the face of the expired or expiring Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766). To be eligible for the automatic extension under this paragraph, the request must be:


(i) Properly filed on a form designated by USCIS and as provided by form instructions before the expiration date shown on the face of the Employment Authorization Document, or, for Temporary Protected Status-related Employment Authorization Documents (EADs), during the re-registration filing period described in the applicable _Federal Register_ notice;


(ii) Based on the same employment authorization category as shown on the face of the expiring Employment Authorization Document or is for an individual approved for Temporary Protected Status whose EAD was issued pursuant to 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(19); and


(iii) Based on a class of aliens whose eligibility to apply for employment authorization continues notwithstanding expiration of the Employment Authorization Document and is based on an employment authorization category that does not require adjudication of an underlying application or petition before adjudication of the renewal application, including aliens described in 8 CFR 274a.12(a)(12) granted Temporary Protected Status and pending applicants for Temporary Protected Status who are issued an EAD under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(19), as may be announced on the USCIS Web site.


(2) *Terms and conditions.* Any extension authorized under this paragraph (d) shall be subject to any conditions and limitations noted in the immediately preceding employment authorization.


(3) *Termination.* For renewal requests pending on May 4, 2022, or properly filed on or after May 4, 2022, the period authorized by paragraph (d)(1) of this section automatically terminates the earlier of up to 540 days after the expiration date of the Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766), or upon issuance of notification of a decision denying the renewal request. For renewal applications that were properly filed and adjudicated before May 4, 2022, the period authorized by paragraph (d)(1) of this section automatically terminated upon the earlier of up to 180 days after the expiration date of the Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766) or issuance of notification of a decision denying the renewal request. Nothing in paragraph (d) of this section will affect DHS's ability to otherwise terminate any employment authorization or Employment Authorization Document, or extension period for such employment or document, by written notice to the applicant, by notice to a class of aliens published in the _Federal Register,_ or as provided by statute or regulation including 8 CFR 274a.14.


(4) *Unexpired Employment Authorization Documents.* An Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766) that has expired on its face is considered unexpired when combined with a Notice of Action (Form I-797C), which demonstrates that the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section have been met.
