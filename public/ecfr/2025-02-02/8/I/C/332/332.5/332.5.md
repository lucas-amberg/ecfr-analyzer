# § 332.5   Official forms for use by clerks of court.

(a) *Official forms essential to exercise of jurisdiction.* Before exercising jurisdiction in naturalization proceedings, the naturalization court shall direct the clerk of such court upon written application to obtain from the Service, in accordance with section 310(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, proper forms, records, booked, and supplies required in naturalization proceedings. Such jurisdiction may not be exercised until such official forms, records, and books have been supplied to such court. Only such forms as are supplied shall be used in naturalization proceedings. Where sessions of the court are held at different places, the judge of such court may require the clerk to obtain a separate supply of official forms, records and books for each such place. 


(b) *Official forms prescribed for use of clerks of naturalization courts.* Clerks of courts shall use only the forms listed in § 499.1 of this chapter in the exercise of naturalization jurisdiction. 


(c) *Initial application for official forms.* Whenever the initial application for forms, records, books and supplies is made by a State court of record, it shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Attorney General of the State, certifying that the said court is a court of record, having a seal, a clerk, and jurisdiction in actions at law or in equity, or at law and in equity, in which the amount in controversy is unlimited. 


(d) *Subsequent application for use of official forms.* Included with the initial supply of official forms, records, and books furnished to the various courts by the Service shall be Form N-3 entitled “Requisition for Forms and Binders,” and thereafter such forms shall be used by clerks of courts in making requisition for forms, records, books, and supplies for use in naturalization proceedings in their respective courts.
