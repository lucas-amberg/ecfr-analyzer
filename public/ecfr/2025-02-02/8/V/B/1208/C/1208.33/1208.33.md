# § 1208.33   Lawful pathways condition on asylum eligibility.

Notwithstanding any contrary section of this part, including §§ 1208.2, 1208.13, and 1208.30—


(a) *Condition on eligibility*—(1) *Applicability.* A rebuttable presumption of ineligibility for asylum applies to a noncitizen who enters the United States from Mexico at the southwest land border or adjacent coastal borders without documents sufficient for lawful admission as described in section 212(a)(7) of the Act and whose entry was:


(i) Between May 11, 2023, and May 11, 2025,


(ii) Subsequent to the end of implementation of the Title 42 public health Order issued on August 2, 2021, and related prior orders issued pursuant to the authorities in sections 362 and 365 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 265, 268) and the implementing regulation at 42 CFR 71.40, and


(iii) After the noncitizen traveled through a country other than the noncitizen's country of citizenship, nationality, or, if stateless, last habitual residence, that is a party to the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees.


(2) *Exceptions to applicability of the rebuttable presumption.* The rebuttable presumption described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply if:


(i) The noncitizen was, at the time of entry, an unaccompanied child as defined in 8 CFR 1001.1(hh); or


(ii) The noncitizen, or a member of the noncitizen's family as described in § 208.30(c) with whom the noncitizen is traveling:


(A) Was provided appropriate authorization to travel to the United States to seek parole, pursuant to a DHS-approved parole process;


(B) Presented at a port of entry, pursuant to a pre-scheduled time and place, or presented at a port of entry without a pre-scheduled time and place, if the noncitizen demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that it was not possible to access or use the DHS scheduling system due to language barrier, illiteracy, significant technical failure, or other ongoing and serious obstacle; or


(C) Sought asylum or other protection in a country through which the noncitizen traveled and received a final decision denying that application. A final decision includes any denial by a foreign government of the applicant's claim for asylum or other protection through one or more of that government's pathways for that claim. A final decision does not include a determination by a foreign government that the noncitizen abandoned the claim.


(3) *Rebuttal of the presumption.* (i) The presumption in paragraph (a)(1) of this section can be rebutted if a noncitizen demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that exceptionally compelling circumstances exist, including if the noncitizen demonstrates that, at the time of entry, the noncitizen or a member of the noncitizen's family as described in § 208.30(c) with whom the noncitizen is traveling:


(A) Faced an acute medical emergency;


(B) Faced an imminent and extreme threat to life or safety, such as an imminent threat of rape, kidnapping, torture, or murder; or


(C) Satisfied the definition of “victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons” provided in 8 CFR 214.201.


(ii) A noncitizen who demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence any of the circumstances in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section shall necessarily rebut the presumption in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


(b) *Application in credible fear determinations.* (1) Where an asylum officer has issued a negative credible fear determination pursuant to 8 CFR 208.33(b), and the noncitizen has requested immigration judge review of that credible fear determination, the immigration judge shall evaluate the case de novo, as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In all cases under paragraph (b)(2), the immigration judge's review shall, where relevant, include review of the asylum officer's application of any bars to withholding of removal pursuant to 8 CFR 208.33(b)(2). In doing so, the immigration judge shall take into account the credibility of the statements made by the noncitizen in support of the noncitizen's claim and such other facts as are known to the immigration judge.


(2) The immigration judge shall first determine whether the noncitizen is covered by the presumption at 8 CFR 208.33(a)(1) and 1208.33(a)(1) and, if so, whether the noncitizen has rebutted the presumption in accordance with 8 CFR 208.33(a)(3) and 1208.33(a)(3).


(i) Where the immigration judge determines that the noncitizen is not covered by the presumption, or that the presumption has been rebutted, the immigration judge shall further determine, consistent with § 1208.30, whether the noncitizen has established a significant possibility of eligibility for asylum under section 208 of the Act, or has established a significant possibility of eligibility for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act or withholding or deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture with respect to the country or countries of removal identified by DHS pursuant to section 241(b) of the Act. Where the immigration judge determines that the noncitizen has established a significant possibility of eligibility for one of those forms of relief or protection, the immigration judge shall issue a positive credible fear finding. Where the immigration judge determines that the noncitizen has not established a significant possibility of eligibility for any of those forms of relief or protection, the immigration judge shall issue a negative credible fear finding.


(ii) Where the immigration judge determines that the noncitizen is covered by the presumption and that the presumption has not been rebutted, the immigration judge shall further determine whether the noncitizen has established a reasonable possibility of persecution (meaning a reasonable possibility of being persecuted because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group) or torture with respect to the country or countries of removal identified by DHS pursuant to section 241(b) of the Act. Where the immigration judge determines that the noncitizen has established a reasonable possibility of persecution or torture, the immigration judge shall issue a positive credible fear finding. Where the immigration judge determines that the noncitizen has not established a reasonable possibility of persecution or torture, the immigration judge shall issue a negative credible fear finding.


(3) Following the immigration judge's determination, the case will proceed as indicated in 8 CFR 208.33(b)(2)(v)(A) through (C).


(4) If, under 8 CFR 208.33(b)(2), DHS issues a Form I-862, Notice to Appear, to commence removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act, the noncitizen may apply for asylum, withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture, or any other form of relief or protection for which the noncitizen is eligible during those removal proceedings.


(c) *Family unity and removal proceedings.* In removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act, where a principal asylum applicant is eligible for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act or withholding of removal under § 1208.16(c)(2) and would be granted asylum but for the presumption in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and where an accompanying spouse or child as defined in section 208(b)(3)(A) of the Act does not independently qualify for asylum or other protection from removal or the principal asylum applicant has a spouse or child who would be eligible to follow to join that applicant as described in section 208(b)(3)(A) of the Act, the presumption shall be deemed rebutted as an exceptionally compelling circumstance in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section.


(d) *Continuing applicability of condition on eligibility.* (1) Subject to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the condition on asylum eligibility in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall apply to any asylum application filed by a noncitizen who entered the United States during the time and in the manner specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and who is not covered by an exception in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, regardless of when the application is filed and adjudicated.


(2) The conditions on asylum eligibility in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not apply to an asylum application filed by a noncitizen described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section if the asylum application is filed after May 11, 2025, the noncitizen was under the age of 18 at the time of the entry referenced in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and the noncitizen is applying for asylum as a principal applicant.


(e) *Severability.* The Department intends that any provision of this section held to be invalid or unenforceable by its terms, or as applied to any person or circumstance, should be construed so as to continue to give the maximum effect to the provision permitted by law, unless such holding is that the provision is wholly invalid and unenforceable, in which event the provision should be severed from the remainder of this section and the holding should not affect the remainder of this section or the application of the provision to persons not similarly situated or to dissimilar circumstances.
