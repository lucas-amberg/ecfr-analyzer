(b) Any dog or cat exhibiting a vicious or overly aggressive disposition must be housed separately;


(c) Puppies or kittens 4 months of age or less may not be housed in the same primary enclosure with adult dogs or cats other than their dams or foster dams, except when permanently maintained in breeding colonies;


(d) Dogs or cats may not be housed in the same primary enclosure with any other species of animals, unless they are compatible; and


(e) Dogs and cats that have or are suspected of having a contagious disease must be isolated from healthy animals in the colony, as directed by the attending veterinarian.
