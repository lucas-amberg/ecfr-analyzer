Claims for compensation for livestock destroyed because of tuberculosis will not be allowed in any of the following cases: 


(a) The claimant has failed to comply with any of the requirements of this part: 


(b) All cattle, bison, and captive cervids 12 months of age or over in the claimant's herd have not been tested for tuberculosis under APHIS or State supervision: *Provided, however,* that cattle, bison, and captive cervids destroyed because of tuberculosis are exempt from this testing requirement if the cattle, bison, and captive cervids are subjected to a postmortem examination for tuberculosis by a Federal or State veterinarian. 


(c) There is substantial evidence that the owner of the animals or the agent of the owner has in any way been responsible for any attempt to obtain indemnity funds for the animals unlawfully or improperly. 


(d) At the time the cattle, bison, or captive cervids in the claimant's herd were tested for tuberculosis, the cattle, bison, captive cervids, or other livestock in the herd belonged to or were on the premises of any person to whom they had been sold, shipped, or delivered for slaughter unless or until all of the cattle, bison, captive cervids, and other livestock remaining on the premises or in the herd from which the tested cattle, bison, or captive cervids originated are tested or otherwise examined for tuberculosis in a manner satisfactory to the Administrator or his or her designated representative. 


(e) If the cattle, bison, or captive cervids were added to a herd while the herd was quarantined for tuberculosis, unless an approved herd plan was in effect at the time the claim was filed. As part of the approved herd plan, cattle, bison, or captive cervids added to a herd quarantined for tuberculosis must: 


(1) Be from an accredited herd, as defined in ยง 77.1 of this chapter; or 


(2)(i) Be from a herd that tested negative to an official tuberculin test, as defined in ยง 77.1 of this chapter, during the 60 days before the cattle, bison, or captive cervids were added to the claimant's herd; and 


(ii) Have been found negative to an official tuberculin test, as defined in ยง 77.1 of this chapter, during the 60 days before the cattle, bison, or captive cervids were added to the claimant's herd. 


(f) For exposed cattle, bison, or captive cervids destroyed during herd depopulation, if a designated tuberculosis epidemiologist has determined that other livestock in the herd have been exposed to tuberculosis by reason of association with tuberculous livestock, and those other livestock determined to have been exposed to tuberculosis have not been destroyed. 


(g) For livestock other than cattle, bison, and captive cervids that are destroyed because of association with herds of affected cattle, bison, or captive cervids: 


(1) If the livestock did not reside among the herd for a period of 4 months or more; 


(2) If the livestock have not received a postmortem examination for tuberculosis; or 


(3) If the livestock were added to a herd that was under quarantine for tuberculosis at the time the livestock were added to the herd, unless an approved herd plan was in effect at that time.
