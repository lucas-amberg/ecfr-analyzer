(2) Data to support reproducibility, that is, the ability to reproduce the same result repeatedly on a given sample; 


(3) Data to support suitability, that is, data to show that similar results can be produced when the test is run at other laboratories; 


(4) Data to support the sensitivity and specificity of the test; and 


(5) Any other data requested by the Administrator to determine the suitability of the test for program use. 


(c) Specific protocols for official CWD tests are available upon request to NVSL. 


(d) State, Federal, and university laboratories will be approved by the Administrator to conduct official CWD tests when he or she determines that the laboratory: 


(1) Employs personnel assigned to supervise the testing who are qualified to conduct the test based on education, training, and experience and who have been trained by NVSL or who have completed equivalent training approved by NVSL; 


(2) Has adequate facilities and equipment to conduct the test; 


(3) Follows standard test protocols; 


(4) Meets check test proficiency requirements; 


(5) Meets recordkeeping requirements; 


(6) Will retain records, slides, blocks, and other specimens from all cases for at least 1 year and from positive cases for 5 years;

(e) The Administrator may withdraw approval of any laboratory for failure to meet any of the conditions required by paragraph (d) of this section. The Administrator shall give written notice of the proposed withdrawal to the director of the laboratory and shall give the director an opportunity to respond. If there are conflicts as to any material fact concerning the reason for withdrawal, a hearing will be held to resolve the conflicts. The hearing will be conducted in accordance with rules of practice that will be adopted by the Administrator for the proceeding.
