# § 73.10   Permitted dips; substances allowed.

(a) The dips at present permitted by the Department for the treatment, as required in this part, of cattle affected with or exposed to scabies, are as follows: 


(1) Lime-sulphur dip, other than proprietary brands thereof, made in the proportion of 12 pounds of unslaked lime (or 16 pounds of commercial hydrated lime, not airslaked lime) and 24 pounds of flowers of sulphur or sulphur flour to 100 gallons of water; or a specifically permitted proprietary brand of lime-sulphur dip. 


(2) Dips made from specifically permitted proprietary brand emulsions of toxaphene and maintained throughout the dipping operation at a concentration between 0.50 and 0.60 percent toxaphene. Animals treated by such dips should not be slaughtered for food purposes until the expiration of such period as may be required under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C., Supp. III, 601 *et seq.*). The length of this required period shall be specified on each certificate issued by the APHIS inspector or State inspector who supervises the dipping with such dips. 


(3) Approved proprietary brands of coumaphos (Co-Ral ®), 25 percent wettable powder or flowable form used at a concentration of 0.30 percent. 


(4) Approved proprietary brands of organophosphorous insecticides (Prolate ®) used at a concentration of 0.15 percent to 0.25 percent. 


(b) The dipping bath for lime-sulphur dip must be used at a temperature of 95° to 105 °F., and must be maintained through the dipping operation at a concentration of not less than 2 percent of “sulphide sulphur”, as indicated by the field test for lime-sulphur dipping baths approved by the APHIS. 
1 The dipping bath for toxaphene emulsions must be kept within a temperature range of 40-80 °F., and at a concentration between 0.50 and 0.60 percent throughout the dipping operations.

(c) Proprietary brands of lime-sulphur or toxaphene dips may be used in official dipping only after specific permission therefor has been granted by the Administrator. Before a dip will be specifically approved as a permitted dip for the eradication of scabies in cattle, the APHIS 
3 will require that the product be registered under the provisions of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 135 *et seq.*); that is efficacy and stability have been demonstrated; that trials have been conducted to determine that its concentration can be maintained and that under actual filed conditions the dipping of cattle in a bath of definite strength will effectually eradicate scabies infection without injury to the animals dipped.
