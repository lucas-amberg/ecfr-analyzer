# ยง 77.3   Tuberculosis classifications of States and zones.

The Administrator shall classify each State for tuberculosis in accordance with this part. A zone comprising less than an entire State will be given a particular classification upon request of the State only if the Administrator determines that: 


(a) The State meets the requirements of this part for establishment of zones; 


(b) The State has adopted and is enforcing regulations that impose restrictions on the intrastate movement of cattle, bison, and captive cervids that are substantially the same as those in place under this part for the interstate movement of cattle, bison, and captive cervids; and 


(c) The designation of part of a State as a zone will otherwise be adequate to prevent the interstate spread of tuberculosis.
