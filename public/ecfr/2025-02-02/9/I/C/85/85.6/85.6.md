# § 85.6   Interstate movement of pseudorabies vaccinate swine, except swine from qualified negative gene-altered vaccinated herds, not known to be infected with or exposed to pseudorabies.

Pseudorabies vaccinate swine, except swine from qualified negative gene-altered vaccinated herds, not known to be infected with or exposed to pseudorabies shall only be moved interstate in accordance with the following provisions:


(a) *Movement of pseudorabies vaccinate swine, except swine from qualified negative gene-altered vaccinated herds, for slaughter.* Pseudorabies vaccinate swine, except swine from qualified negative gene-altered vaccinated herds, not known to be infected with or exposed to pseudorabies shall be moved interstate for slaughter only if:


(1) The swine are moved directly to a recognized slaughtering establishment or directly through one or more slaughter markets and then directly to a recognized slaughtering establishment;


(2) The swine are accompanied by a permit or owner-shipper statement and such permit or owner-shipper statement is delivered to the consignee; and


(3) The swine are moved to destination in one continuous movement without unloading enroute.


(b) *Movement of pseudorabies vaccinate swine, except swine from qualified negative gene-altered vaccinated herds, to a quarantined herd or quarantined feedlot.* Pseudorabies vaccinate swine, except swine from qualified negative gene-altered vaccinated herds, not known to be infected with or exposed to pseudorabies shall be moved interstate directly to a quarantined herd or quarantined feedlot only if:


(1) The swine are accompanied by a permit and such permit is delivered to the consignee; and


(2) The permit in addition to information described in § 85.1 states: (i) The pseudorabies status of the herd; (ii) the identification of the swine required by § 71.19 of this chapter; (iii) the date of the vaccination for pseudorabies; and (iv) that approval for the interstate movement has been issued by the State animal health official of the State of destination prior to the interstate movement of the swine.


(c) *General movements.* Swine vaccinated for pseudorabies with a glycoprotein I (gpI) deleted gene-altered pseudorabies vaccine and not known to be infected with or exposed to pseudorabies, but that are not from a qualified negative gene-altered vaccinated herd, may be moved interstate to destinations other than those set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section only if: 


(1) The swine are accompanied by a certificate and such certificate is delivered to the consignee; and 


(2) The certificate, in addition to the information described in § 85.1, states: 


(i) The identification required by § 71.19 of this chapter; 


(ii) That each animal to be moved was vaccinated for pseudorabies with a gpI-deleted gene-altered pseudorabies vaccine; 


(iii) That each animal to be moved was subjected to a gpI enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or a gpI Particle Concentration Fluorescence Immunoassay (PCFIA) approved differential pseudorabies test no more than 30 days prior to the interstate movement and was found negative; 


(iv) The date of the gpI ELISA or the gpI PCFIA approved differential pseudorabies test; and 


(v) The name of the laboratory that conducted the gpI ELISA or the gpI PCFIA approved differential pseudorabies test.
