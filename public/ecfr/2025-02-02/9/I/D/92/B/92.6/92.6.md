# ยง 92.6   Determination of the date of effective enforcement of a ruminant-to-ruminant feed ban.

(a) In order for APHIS to determine the eligibility of live bovines for importation from a region classified as BSE negligible risk or BSE controlled risk, APHIS must determine the date from which a ban on the feeding of ruminant material to ruminants has been effectively enforced in the region. APHIS will base its determination of the date of effective enforcement on the information included in the dossier the region submitted when it requested to be classified regarding BSE risk. The information APHIS will consider will include, but not be limited to:


(1) Policies and infrastructure for feed ban enforcement, including an awareness program for producers and farmers;


(2) Livestock husbandry practices;


(3) Disposition of processed animal protein produced from domestic bovines, including the feeding of such material to any animal species;


(4) Measures taken to control cross-contamination and mislabeling of feed; and


(5) Monitoring and enforcement of the ruminant-to-ruminant feed ban, including audit findings in rendering plants and feed mills that process ruminant material.


(b) After conducting its evaluation, APHIS will announce in the _Federal Register_ for public comment the date APHIS considers to be the date of effective enforcement of a ruminant-to-ruminant feed ban in the requesting region, and will make available to the public the evaluation conducted by APHIS, as well as the supporting documentation. Following review of any comments received, the Administrator will announce his or her final determination in the _Federal Register,_ along with a discussion of and response to pertinent issues raised by commenters.
