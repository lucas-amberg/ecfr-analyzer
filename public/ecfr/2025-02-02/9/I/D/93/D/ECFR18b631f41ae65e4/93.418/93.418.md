# § 93.418   Cattle and other bovines from Canada.

(a) *Health certificates.* Cattle intended for importation from Canada must be accompanied by a certificate issued in accordance with § 93.405(a). The certificate must state that the cattle have been inspected and were found to be free from any evidence of communicable disease and that, as far as can be determined, they have not been exposed to any such disease during the preceding 60 days. Cattle found unqualified upon inspection at the port of entry will be refused entry into the United States.


(b)-(c) [Reserved]


(d) *Conditions for importation.* In addition to meeting the other requirements of this section, bovines may be imported from Canada only under the following conditions:


(1) The bovines are imported for immediate slaughter under § 93.420; or


(2) The bovines are imported for other than immediate slaughter under the following conditions:


(i) The bovines were born after March 1, 1999, the date determined by APHIS to be the date of effective enforcement of a ruminant-to-ruminant feed ban in Canada;


(ii) The bovines are imported only through a port of entry listed in § 93.403(b) or as provided for in § 93.403(f);


(iii) The bovines were officially identified prior to arriving at the port of entry in the United States with unique individual identification that is traceable to each bovine's premises of origin. No person may alter, deface, remove, or otherwise tamper with the official identification while the animal is in the United States or moving into or through the United States, except that the identification may be removed at slaughter; and


(iv) The bovines are permanently and humanely identified using one of the following additional methods:


(A) A “CΛN” mark properly applied with a freeze brand, hot iron, or other method, and easily visible on the live animal and on the carcass before skinning. Such a mark must be not less than 2 inches nor more than 3 inches high, and must be applied to each animal's right hip, high on the tail-head (over the junction of the sacral and first coccygeal vertebrae); or


(B) A tattoo with the letters “CΛN” applied to the inside of one ear of the animal; or


(C) Other means of permanent identification upon request if deemed adequate by the Administrator to humanely identify the animal in a distinct and legible way as having been imported from Canada.


(3) The bovines are accompanied by a certificate issued in accordance with § 93.405 that states, in addition to the statements required by § 93.405, that the conditions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, as applicable, have been met.
