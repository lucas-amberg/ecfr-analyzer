(b) The commodities were derived from bovines that passed ante-mortem and post-mortem inspections.


(c) The commodities were derived from bovines that were not subjected to a stunning process, prior to slaughter, with a device injecting compressed air or gas into the cranial cavity, or to a pithing process.


(d) The commodities were produced and handled in a manner that ensured that such commodities do not contain and are not contaminated with either of the following:


(1) SRMs from regions of controlled risk for BSE; or


(2) Mechanically separated meat from the skull and vertebral column from bovines 30 months of age or older.


(e) The commodities are accompanied by an original certificate stating that the exporting region is classified by APHIS as a region of controlled risk for BSE, and that the conditions of this section have been met.
