# § 113.3   Sampling of biological products.

Each licensee and permittee shall furnish representative samples of each serial or subserial of a biological product manufactured in the United States or imported into the United States as prescribed in this section. Additional samples may be purchased in the open market by a Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service representative. 


(a) Either an employee of the Department of Agriculture, of the licensee, or of the permittee, as designated by the Administrator shall select prerelease samples of biological product in the number prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section. Each sample shall be marked for identification by the person making the selection after which they shall be packaged by the licensee or permittee, as the case may be, and forwarded to National Veterinary Services Laboratories; except that an employee of the Department may forward or deliver the samples to National Veterinary Services Laboratories if such action deemed advisable by the Administrator. 


(1) Selection shall be made as follows: 


(i) Nonviable liquid biological products—either bulk or final container samples of completed product shall be selected for purity, safety, or potency tests. Biological product in final container shall be selected to test for viable bacteria and fungi. 


(ii) Viable liquid biological products; samples shall be in final containers and shall be randomly selected at the end of the filling operation. Bulk containers of completed product may be sampled when authorized by the Administrator. 


(iii) Desiccated biological products; samples shall be in final containers and shall be randomly selected if desiccated in the final container. Biological products desiccated in bulk shall be sampled at the end of the filling operation. 


(iv) Representative samples of each serial or subserial in each shipment of imported biological products shall be selected. 


(2) Comparable samples shall be used by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the licensee, and the permittee for similar tests. 


(3) When bulk samples of completed product in liquid form are to be tested as prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the number of such samples from each serial and the minimum quantity of product to be provided in each sample shall be stated in the filed Outline of Production. 


(b) Unless otherwise prescribed by the Administrator, the number of final container samples to be selected from each serial and subserial shall be:


(1) *Vaccines:*

(i) Six multiple-dose samples of Brucella Abortus Vaccine;


(ii) Twelve samples of all other live bacterial vaccines;


(iii) Two samples of Coccidiosis Vaccine;


(iv) Eighteen samples of Rabies Vaccine, Modified Live Virus;


(v) Sixteen samples of all other vaccines consisting of live microorganisms;


(vi) Thirty single-dose or 14 multiple-dose samples of Equine Encephalomyelitis Vaccine, Killed Virus;


(vii) Twenty-two single-dose or 14 multiple-dose samples of Rabies Vaccine, Killed Virus;


(viii) Sixteen single-dose or 12 multiple-dose samples of all other vaccines consisting of killed microorganisms.


(2) *Bacterins and bacterin-toxoids:*

(i) Twelve samples of single-fraction products;


(ii) Thirteen samples of two-fraction products;


(iii) Fourteen samples of products consisting of 3 or more fractions.


(3) *Antiserums:* Twelve samples of antiserum recommended for large animals or 14 samples of antiserum recommended for small animals or the number of reagent serum samples prescribed in the filed Outline of Production for the product. 


(4) *Antitoxins:*

(i) Fourteen single-dose or 12 multiple dose samples of Tetanus Antitoxin;


(ii) Twelve samples of all other antitoxins.


(5) *Toxoids:*

(i) Eighteen single-dose or 12 multiple dose samples of all toxoids.


(6) *Antigens:* Twelve samples of poultry antigens or 20 samples of tuberculin or four samples of all other diagnostic antigens. 


(7) *Diagnostic test kits:* Two samples of diagnostic test kits. The licensee or permittee will hold one of these selected samples at the storage temperature recommended on the label while awaiting a request by the animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to submit the additional sample. If submission is not requested by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the additional sample may be returned to the serial inventory after the serial is released. In the case of diagnostic test kits in which final packaging consists of multiple microtiter test plates or strips, the licensee or permittee may submit a specified number of test plates or strips along with all other test reagents as prescribed in a filed Outline of Production and retain a similar amount as a second sample for submission upon request. When the initial sample is not representative of final packaging by the licensee of permittee, e.g., does not consist of all the microtiter test plates or strips, the second sample is not eligible to be returned to serial inventory after the serial is released.


(8) *Autogenous biologics:* With the exception of the first serial or subserial, 10 samples must be selected and submitted to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service from each serial or subserial of an autogenous biologic eligible to be shipped that consists of more than 50 containers. For first serials or subserials eligible for shipment consisting of more than 50 containers, 10 samples from each serial or subserial must be selected and held for submission to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service upon request in accordance with paragraph (e)(4) of this section. For serials or subserials of autogenous biologic with 50 or fewer containers, no samples, other than those required by paragraph (e) of this section, are required.


(9) *Miscellaneous:* The number of samples from products not in the categories provided for in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(8) of this section shall be prescribed in the filed Outline of Production for the product.


(c) Prelicensing and Outline of Production changes: Samples needed to support a license application or a change in the Outline of Production for a licensed product shall be submitted only upon request from the animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Except for miscellaneous products specified in paragraph (b)(9) of this section, the number of such samples shall be at least one and one-half times the number prescribed for such product in paragraph (b) of this section. Samples of Master Seeds and Master Cell Stocks with a minimum individual volume of 1 ml shall be submitted as follows:


(1) Ten samples of Bacterial Master Seeds.


(2) Thirteen samples of viral Master Seeds or nonviral Master Seeds requiring cell culture propagation. For Master Seeds isolated or passed in a cell line different from the species of intended use, an additional 2 samples are required for each additional species. For Master Seeds grown in cell culture and intended for use in more than one species, an additional 2 samples are required for each additional species.


(3) Thirty-six samples of at least 1 ml each or six samples of at least 1 ml each, one sample of at least 20 ml, and one sample of at least 10 ml of Master Cell Stocks. In the case of Master Cell Stocks which are persistently infected with a virus, an additional four samples of at least 1 ml each are required. If these persistently infected cell stocks are intended for use in more than one species, an additional two samples of at least 1 ml each are required for each additional species.


(4) Four samples of the Master Cell Stock + n (highest passage) cells.


(d) Sterile diluent: A sample of Sterile Diluent shall accompany each sample of product, other than Marek's Disease Vaccine, if such diluent is required to rehydrate or dilute the product before use. The volume of diluent shall be an appropriate amount to rehydrate or dilute the product. Samples of Sterile Diluent prepared for use with Marek's Disease Vaccine shall be submitted upon request from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.


(e) Reserve samples shall be selected from each serial and subserial of biological product. Such samples shall be selected at random from final containers of completed product by an employee of the Department, of the licensee, or of the permittee, as designated by the administrator. Each sample shall:


(1) Consist of 5 single-dose packages, 2 multiple-dose packages, or 2 diagnostic test kits, except that, in the case of diagnostic test kits in which final packaging consists of multiple microtiter test plates or strips, a sample may consist of a specified number of test plates or strips along with all other test reagents as prescribed in a filed Outline of Production;


(2) Be adequate in quantity for appropriate examination and testing;


(3) Be truly representative and in final containers;


(4) Be held in a special compartment set aside by the licensee or permittee for holding these samples under refrigeration at the storage temperature recommended on the labels for 6 months after the expiration date stated on the labels. The samples that are stored in this manner shall be delivered to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service upon request.
