# § 113.30   Detection of Salmonella contamination.

The test for detection of Salmonella contamination provided in this section shall be conducted when such a test is prescribed in an applicable Standard Requirement or in the filed Outline of Production for the product. 


(a) Samples shall be collected from the bulk suspension before bacteriostatic or bactericidal agents have been added. When tissue culture products are to be tested, 1 ml of tissue extract used as the source of cells or 1 ml of the minced tissue per se shall be tested. 


(b) Five ml of the liquid vaccine suspension shall be used to inoculate each 100 ml of liquid broth medium (tryptose and either selenite F or tetrathionate). The inoculated media shall be incubated 18-24 hours at 35-37 °C. 


(c) Transfers shall be made to either MacConkey agar or Salmonella-Shigella agar, incubated for 18-24 hours and examined. 


(d) If no growth typical of Salmonella is noted, the plates shall be incubated an additional 18-24 hours and again examined. 


(e) If suspicious colonies are observed, further subculture on suitable media shall be made for positive identification. If Salmonella is found, the bulk suspension is unsatisfactory.
