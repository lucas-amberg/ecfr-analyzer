# § 124.20   Patent term extension calculation.

(a) As provided in 37 CFR 1.779 of PTO's regulations, in order to determine a product's regulatory review period, APHIS will review the information in each application to determine the lengths of the following phases of the review period, and will then find their sum:


(1) The number of days in the period beginning on the date authorization to prepare an experimental biological product under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act became effective and ending on the date an application for a license was initially submitted under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act; and 


(2) The number of days in the period beginning on the date an application for a license was initially submitted for approval under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act and ending on the date such license was issued.


(b) A license application is “initially submitted” on the date it contains sufficient information to allow APHIS to commence review of the application. A product license is issued on the date of the APHIS letter informing the applicant of the issuance. The issuance of a license releases the product for commercial marketing or use.
