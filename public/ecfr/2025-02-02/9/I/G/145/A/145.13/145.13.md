# ยง 145.13   Debarment from participation.

Participants in the Plan, who after investigation by the Official State Agency or its representative, are notified in writing of their apparent noncompliance with the Plan provisions or regulations of the Official State Agency, shall be afforded a reasonable time, as specified by the Official State Agency, within which to demonstrate or achieve compliance. If compliance is not demonstrated or achieved within the specified time, the Official State Agency may debar the participant from further participation in the Plan for such period, or indefinitely, as the Agency may deem appropriate. The debarred participant shall be afforded notice of the bases for the debarment and opportunity to present his views with respect to the debarment in accordance with procedures adopted by the Official State Agency. The Official State Agency shall thereupon decide whether the debarment order shall continue in effect. Such decision shall be final unless the debarred participant, within 30 days after the issuance of the debarment order, requests the Administrator to determine the eligibility of the debarred participant for participation in the Plan. In such event the Administrator shall determine the matter de novo in accordance with the rules of practice in 7 CFR part 50, which are hereby made applicable to proceedings before the Administrator under this section. The definitions in 7 CFR 50.10 and the following definitions shall apply with respect to terms used in such rules of practice: 


(a) *Administrator* means the Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture or any officer or employee to whom authority has heretofore been delegated or to whom authority may hereafter be delegated to act in his stead.
