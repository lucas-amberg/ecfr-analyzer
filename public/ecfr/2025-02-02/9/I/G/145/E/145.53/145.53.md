(iv) All persons performing poultry disease diagnostic services within the State are required to report to the Official State Agency within 48 hours the source of all poultry specimens from which S. pullorum or S. gallinarum is isolated; 


(v) All reports of any disease outbreak involving a disease covered under the Plan are promptly followed by an investigation by the Official State Agency to determine the origin of the infection; *Provided,* That if the origin of the infection involves another State, or if there is exposure to poultry in another State from the infected flock, then the National Poultry Improvement Plan will conduct an investigation;


(vi) All flocks found to be infected with pullorum or typhoid are quarantined until marketed or destroyed under the supervision of the Official State Agency, or until subsequently blood tested, following the procedure for reacting flocks as contained in § 145.14(a)(5), and all birds fail to demonstrate pullorum or typhoid infection; 


(vii) All poultry, including exhibition, exotic, and game birds, but excluding waterfowl, going to public exhibition shall come from U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean or equivalent flocks, or have had a negative pullorum-typhoid test within 90 days of going to public exhibition; 


(viii) Discontinuation of any of the conditions or procedures described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), and (vii) of this section, or the occurrence of repeated outbreaks of pullorum or typhoid in poultry breeding flocks within or originating within the State shall be grounds for the Service to revoke its determination that such conditions and procedures have been met or complied with. Such action shall not be taken until a thorough investigation has been made by the Service and the Official State Agency has been given an opportunity to present its views.

(3) A sample of at least 30 birds must be tested and found negative to H5/H7 avian influenza within 21 days prior to movement to slaughter.


(f) *U.S. Salmonella Monitored.* The program in this paragraph (f) is intended to be the basis from which the breeding-hatching industry may conduct a program for the prevention and control of salmonellosis. It is intended to reduce the incidence of Salmonella organisms in hatching eggs and day-old poultry through an effective and practical sanitation and testing program at the breeder farm and in the hatchery. This will afford other segments of the poultry industry an opportunity to reduce the incidence of *Salmonella* in their products. The following requirements must be met for a flock or hatchery to be eligible for the classification in this paragraph (f) as determined by the Official State Agency:


(1) Hatcheries must be kept in a sanitary condition as applicable and as outlined in § 145.6 (within the NPIP Program Standards document, Program Standard C applies to hatcheries; alternatives to the program standards may also be approved by the Administrator under § 147.53 of this subchapter).


(2) An Authorized Agent shall collect and submit to an authorized laboratory:


(i) A minimum of five samples from the hatchery at least every 30 days while in operation. These samples may include: Hatchery debris, swabs from hatchers, setters, hatchery environment, hatchery equipment, sexing tables and belts, meconium, chick box papers, hatching trays, or chick transfer devices. Samples will be examined bacteriologically at an authorized laboratory for *Salmonella*; and


(ii) Annual environmental samples from each pullet and breeder farm in accordance with this section (within the NPIP Program Standards document, Program Standard B applies to bacteriological examination procedures; alternatives to the program standards may also be approved by the Administrator under § 147.53 of this subchapter). Samples will be examined bacteriologically at an authorized laboratory for *Salmonella.*

(3) If *Salmonella* is identified through this testing:


(i) A qualified poultry health professional knowledgeable with the operation will be consulted and will:


(A) Review test results to evaluate the *Salmonella* monitoring program.


(B) Use the *Salmonella* monitoring program test results to develop appropriate and practical *Salmonella* intervention measures.


(ii) [Reserved]


(4) To claim products are of the classification in this paragraph (f), all products shall be derived from a farm or hatchery that meets the requirements of the classification.
