# ยง 202.110   Rule 10: Prehearing conference.

(a) The presiding officer, at any time prior to the commencement of the hearing, may request the parties or their counsel to appear at a conference before the presiding officer to consider:


(1) The simplification of issues;


(2) The necessity of amendments to pleadings;


(3) The possibility of obtaining stipulations of fact and of the authenticity, accuracy, and admissibility of documents, which will avoid unnecessary proof;


(4) The limitation of the number of expert or other witnesses;


(5) The negotiation, compromise, or settlement of issues;


(6) The exchange of copies of proposed exhibits;


(7) The identification of documents or matters of which official notice may be requested;


(8) A schedule to be followed by the parties for completion of the actions decided at the conference; or


(9) Such other matters as may expedite and aid in the disposition of the proceeding.


(b) *Manner of the prehearing conference.* (1) The prehearing conference shall be conducted by telephone or correspondence unless the presiding officer determines that conducting the prehearing conference by audio-visual telecommunication: 


(i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party; 


(ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the prehearing conference; or 


(iii) Would cost less than conducting the prehearing conference by telephone or correspondence. If the presiding officer determines that a prehearing conference conducted by audio-visual telecommunication would measurably increase the United States Department of Agriculture's cost of conducting the prehearing conference, the prehearing conference shall be conducted by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the prehearing conference, by telephone, or by correspondence. 


(2) If the prehearing conference is not conducted by telephone or correspondence, the prehearing conference shall be conducted by audio-visual telecommunication unless the presiding officer determines that conducting the prehearing conference by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the prehearing conference: 


(i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party; 


(ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the prehearing conference; or 


(iii) Would cost less than conducting the prehearing conference by audio-visual telecommunication.
