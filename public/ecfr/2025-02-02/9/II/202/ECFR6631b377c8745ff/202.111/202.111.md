# ยง 202.111   Rule 11: Hearing, oral or written.

(a) *When held.* A hearing, oral or written, shall be held unless: 


(1) Each respondent admits or is deemed to admit sufficient allegations of the complaint to support the full amount claimed by the complainant as reparation; 


(2) Each respondent admits liability to the complainant in the full amount claimed by the complainant as reparation; 


(3) Before a hearing has been completed the parties agree in writing that the proceeding may be decided on the basis of the record as it stands at the time such agreement is filed; or 


(4) Before a hearing has been completed the parties settle their dispute or the complainant withdraws the complaint. 


(b) *Whether oral or written.* The hearing provided for in paragraph (a) of this section shall be oral if: 


(1) $10,000 or more is in controversy and any respondent files a written request for an oral hearing with such respondent's answer; or 


(2) $10,000 or more is in controversy and any complainant files a written request for an oral hearing on or before the 20th day after service on such complainant of notice that no respondent has filed a timely request for an oral hearing; or 


(3) Less than $10,000 is in controversy and the presiding officer determines, upon written request by any party thereto, that an oral hearing is necessary to establish the facts and circumstances giving rise to the controversy. The hearing shall be written if not oral. 


(c) *Withdrawal of request.* If $10,000 or more is in controversy and a party has timely filed a request for oral hearing, such party may withdraw such request at any time prior to completion of an oral hearing. If such a withdrawal leaves no pending request for oral hearing in the proceeding, and if the presiding officer has not decided that the hearing should be oral, each other party shall be served with notice of this and shall be given 20 days to request an oral hearing. If any party files a request for oral hearing in such time, the hearing shall be oral in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. 


(d) *Presiding Officer's recommendation.* The presiding officer may recommend voluntary withdrawal of a request for oral hearing, timely filed. Declining to make such withdrawal shall not affect the rights or interests of any party. 


(e) *Representation.* Any party may appear in an oral hearing, or file evidence in a written hearing, in person or by counsel or other representative. For unethical or contumacious conduct in or in connection with a proceeding, the presiding officer may preclude a person from further acting as attorney or representative for any party to the proceeding; any such order of the presiding officer shall be served on the parties; an appeal to the Judicial Officer may be taken from any such order immediately.
