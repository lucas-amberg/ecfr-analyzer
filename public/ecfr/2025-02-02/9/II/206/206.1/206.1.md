# § 206.1   Definitions.

The definitions in this section apply to the regulations in this part. The definitions in this section do not apply to other regulations issued under the Packers and Stockyards Act (P&S Act) or to the P&S Act as a whole.


*Accrual account.* (Synonymous with the term “ledger,” as defined in this section.) An account held by a packer on behalf of a producer that accrues a running positive or negative balance as a result of a pricing determination included in a contract that establishes a minimum and/or maximum level of base price paid. Credits and/or debits for amounts beyond these minimum and/or maximum levels are entered into the account. Further, the contract specifies how the balance in the account affects producer and packer rights and obligations under the contract.


*Base price.* The price paid for swine before the application of any premiums or discounts, expressed in dollars per unit.


*Boar.* A sexually-intact male swine.


*Ceiling price.* The maximum market price that will be paid for swine. Adjustments may be made to the base price if the market price rises above this price.


*Contract.* Any agreement, whether written or verbal, between a packer and a producer for the purchase of swine for slaughter, except a negotiated purchase (as defined in this section).


*Contract type.* The classification of contracts or risk management agreements for the purchase of swine committed to a packer, by the determination of the base price and the presence or absence of an accrual account or ledger (as defined in this section). The contract type categories are:


(1) Swine or pork market formula purchases with a ledger,


(2) Swine or pork market formula purchases without a ledger,


(3) Other market formula purchases with a ledger,


(4) Other market formula purchases without a ledger,


(5) Other purchase arrangements with a ledger, and


(6) Other purchase arrangements without a ledger.


*Floor price.* The minimum market price that will be paid for swine. Adjustments may be made to the base price if the market price falls below this price.


*Formula price.* A price determined by a mathematical formula under which the price established for a specified market serves as the basis for the formula.


*Ledger.* (Synonymous with “accrual account,” as defined in this section.) An account held by a packer on behalf of a producer that accrues a running positive or negative balance as a result of a pricing determination included in a contract that establishes a minimum and/or maximum level of base price paid. Credits and/or debits for amounts beyond these minimum and/or maximum levels are entered into the account. Further, the contract specifies how the balance in the account affects producer and packer rights and obligations under the contract.


*Negotiated purchase.* A purchase, commonly known as a “cash” or “spot market” purchase, of swine by a packer from a producer under which:


(1) The buyer-seller interaction that results in the transaction and the agreement on actual base price occur on the same day; and


(2) The swine are scheduled for delivery to the packer not later than 14 days after the date on which the swine are committed to the packer.


*Noncarcass merit premium or discount.* An increase or decrease in the price for the purchase of swine made available by an individual packer or packing plant, based on any factor other than the characteristics of the carcass, if the actual amount of the premium or discount is known before the purchase and delivery of the swine.


*Other market formula purchase.* A purchase of swine by a packer in which the pricing determination is a formula price based on any market other than the markets for swine, pork, or a pork product. This includes a formula purchase where the price formula is based on one or more futures or options contracts.


*Other purchase arrangement.* A purchase of swine by a packer that is not a negotiated purchase, swine or pork market formula purchase, or other market formula purchase, and does not involve packer-owned swine. This contract type includes long term contract agreements, fixed price contracts, cost of production formulas, and formula purchases with a floor, window or ceiling price.


*Packer.* Any person engaged in the business of buying swine in commerce for purposes of slaughter, of manufacturing or preparing meats or meat food products from swine for sale or shipment in commerce, or of marketing meats or meat food products from swine in an unmanufactured form, acting as a wholesale broker, dealer, or distributor in commerce. The regulations in this part apply only to a packer that meets the conditions in either paragraph (1) or (2) of this definition:


(1) A packer purchasing at least 100,000 swine per year and slaughtering swine at one or more federally inspected processing plants that meet either of the following conditions:


(i) A swine processing plant that slaughtered an average of at least 100,000 head of swine per year during the immediately preceding 5 calendar years, with the average based on those periods in which the plant slaughtered swine; or


(ii) A swine processing plant that did not slaughter swine during the immediately preceding 5 calendar years that has the capacity to slaughter at least 100,000 swine per year, based on plant capacity information.


(2) Any packer purchasing an average of at least 200,000 sows, boars, or any combination thereof, per year and slaughtering at least 200,000 sows, boars, or any combination thereof at one or more federally inspected processing plants during the immediately preceding 5 calendar years, with the average based on those periods in which the plant slaughtered swine.


*Producer.* Any person engaged, either directly or through an intermediary, in the business of selling swine to a packer for slaughter (including the sale of swine from a packer to another packer).


*Sow.* An adult female swine that has produced one or more litters.


*Swine.* A porcine animal raised to be a feeder pig, raised for seedstock, or raised for slaughter.


*Swine or pork market formula purchase.* A purchase of swine by a packer in which the pricing mechanism is a formula price based on a market for swine, pork, or pork product, other than any formula purchase with a floor, window or ceiling price, or a futures or option contract for swine, pork, or a pork product.


*Window price.* The range of market prices that will be paid for swine. Adjustments may be made to the base price if the market prices fall outside this range. The window price contains both the floor and ceiling prices.
