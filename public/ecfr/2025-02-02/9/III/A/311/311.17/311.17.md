# ยง 311.17   Necrobacillosis, pyemia, and septicemia.

From the standpoint of meat inspection, necrobacillosis may be regarded as a local infection at the beginning, and carcasses in which the lesions are localized may be passed for human food if in a good state of nutrition, after those portions affected with necrotic lesions are removed and condemned. However, when emaciation, cloudy swelling of the parenchymatous tissue of organs or enlargement of the lymph nodes is associated with the infection, it is evident that the disease has progressed beyond the condition of localization to a state of toxemia, and the entire carcass shall therefore be condemned as both unwholesome and noxious. Pyemia or septicemia may intervene as a complication of the local necrosis, and when present the carcass shall be condemned in accordance with ยง 311.16.
