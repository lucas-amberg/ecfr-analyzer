# § 311.23   Tapeworm cysts (cysticercus bovis) in cattle.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, carcasses of cattle affected with lesions of cysticercus bovis shall be disposed of as follows: 


(1) Carcasses of cattle displaying lesions of cysticercus bovis shall be condemned if the infestation is extensive or if the musculature is edematous or discolored. Carcasses shall be considered extensively infested if in addition to finding lesions in at least two of the usual inspection sites, namely the heart, diaphragm and its pillars, muscles of mastication, esophagus, tongue, and musculature exposed during normal dressing operations, they are found in at least two of the sites exposed by (i) an incision made into each round exposing the musculature in cross section, and (ii) a transverse incision into each forelimb commencing 2 or 3 inches above the point of the olecranon and extending to the humerus. 


(2) Carcasses of cattle showing one or more tapeworm lesions of cysticercus bovis but not so extensive as indicated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, as determined by a careful examination, including examination of, but not limited to, the heart, diaphragm and its pillars, muscles of mastication, esophagus, tongue, and musculature exposed during normal dressing operations, may be passed for human food after removal and condemnation of the lesions with surrounding tissues: *Provided,* That the carcasses, appropriately identified by retained tags, are held in cold storage under positive control of a USDA Food Inspector at a temperature not higher than 15 °F. continuously for a period of not less than 10 days, or in the case of boned meat derived from such carcasses, the meat, when in boxes, tierces, or other containers, appropriately identified by retained tags, is held under positive control of a Program Inspector at a temperature of not higher than 15 °F. continuously for a period of not less than 20 days. As an alternative to retention in cold storage as provided in this subparagraph, such carcasses and meat may be heated throughout to a temperature of at least 140 °F. under positive control of a Program Inspector. 


(b) Edible viscera and offal shall be disposed of in the same manner as the rest of the carcass from which they were derived unless any lesion of cysticercus bovis is found in these byproducts, in which case they shall be condemned.
