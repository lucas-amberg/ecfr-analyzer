# § 311.31   Livers affected with carotenosis; livers designated as “telangiectatic,” “sawdust,” or “spotted.”

(a) Livers affected with carotenosis shall be condemned. 


(b) Cattle livers and calf livers showing the conditions sometimes designated as “telangiectatic,” “sawdust,” or “spotted” shall be disposed of as follows: 


(1) When any or all of the conditions are slight in the organ, the whole organ shall be passed for human food without restriction. 


(2) When any or all of the conditions are more severe than slight and involve less than one-half of the organ, while in the remainder of the organ the conditions are slight or nonexistent, the remainder shall be passed for human food without restriction and the other portion shall be condemned. 


(3) When any or all of the conditions are more severe than slight and involve one-half or more of the organ, the whole organ shall be condemned. 


(4) The divisions of an organ into two parts as contemplated in this paragraph for disposition, shall be accomplished by one cut through the organ. This, of course, does not prohibit incisions which are necessary for inspection. 


(c) “Telangiectatic,” “sawdust,” or “spotted” livers and parts of livers which are condemned for human food may be shipped from an official establishment for purposes other than human food in accordance with § 314.10 of this subchapter.
