# § 319.702   Lard, leaf lard.

(a) Lard is the fat rendered from clean and sound edible tissues from swine. The tissues may be fresh, frozen, cooked, or prepared by other processes approved by the Administrator in specific cases, upon his determination that the use of such processes will not result in the adulteration or misbranding of the lard. The tissues shall be reasonably free from blood, and shall not include stomachs, livers, spleens, kidneys, and brains, or settlings and skimmings. “Leaf Lard” is lard prepared from fresh leaf (abdominal) fat. 


(b) Lard (when properly labeled) may be hardened by the use of lard stearin or hydrogenated lard or both and may contain refined lard and deodorized lard, but the labels of such lard shall state such facts, as applicable. 


(c) Products labeled “Lard” or “Leaf Lard” must have the following identity and quality characteristics to insure good color, odor, and taste of finished product:


(d) Product found upon inspection not to have the characteristics specified in paragraph (c) of this section but found to be otherwise sound and in compliance with paragraph (a) of this section may be further processed for the purpose of achieving such characteristics.
