# ยง 354.124   Quarantine of diseased rabbits.

If live rabbits, which are affected by any contagious disease which is transmissible to man, are brought into an official establishment, such rabbits shall be segregated. The slaughtering of such rabbits shall be deferred and they shall be dealt with in one of the following ways: 


(a) If it is determined by a veterinary inspector that further handling of the rabbits will not create a health hazard, the lot shall be subject to ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection pursuant to the regulations in this part. 


(b) If it is determined by a veterinary inspector that further handling of the rabbits will not create a health hazard, such rabbits may be released for treatment under the control of an appropriate State or Federal agency. If the circumstances are such that release for treatment is impracticable, a careful rabbit-by-rabbit ante-mortem inspection shall be made, and all rabbits found to be, or which are suspected of being, affected with the contagious disease transmissible to man shall be condemned.
