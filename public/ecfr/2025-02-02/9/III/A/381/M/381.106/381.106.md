# § 381.106   Export certification.

(a) Exporters must apply for export certification of inspected and passed products to any foreign country. Exporters may apply for an export certificate using a paper or electronic application. FSIS will assess exporters that submit an electronic application the charge in § 362.5(e) of this chapter.


(b) FSIS will issue only one certificate for each consignment, except in the case of error in the certificate or loss of the certificate originally issued.

The new certificate will carry the following statement: “Issued in replacement of ______”, with the numbers of the certificates that have been superseded.


(c) FSIS will deliver a copy of the certificate to the person who requested such certificate or his agent. Such persons may duplicate the certificate as required in connection with the exportation of the product.


(d) FSIS will retain a copy of the certificate.


(e) Exporters may request inspection personnel to issue certificates for export consignments of product of official establishments not under their supervision, provided the consignments are first identified as having been “U.S. inspected and passed,” are found to be neither adulterated nor misbranded, and are marked as required by § 381.105.
