# § 532.5   Exemption from definition of fish product of certain human food products containing fish.

The following articles contain fish ingredients only in a relatively small proportion or historically have not been considered by consumers to be products of the fish food products industry. Therefore, the articles are exempted from the definition of “fish product” and the requirements of the Act and the regulations that apply to fish products, if they comply with the conditions specified in this section.


(a) Any human food product if:


(1) It contains less than 3 percent raw or 2 percent cooked fish;


(2) The fish ingredients used in the product were prepared under Federal inspection or were inspected under a foreign inspection system approved under § 557.2 of this subchapter and imported in compliance with the Act and the regulations;


(3) The immediate container of the product bears a label which shows the name of the product in accordance with this section; and


(4) The product is not represented as a fish product. The percentage of cooked fish ingredients must be computed on the basis of the moist, deboned, cooked fish in the ready-to-serve product when prepared according to the serving directions on the consumer package.


(b) A product exempted under this section will be deemed to be represented as a fish product if the term “fish” or a term representing a fish species that is covered by the definition of “fish” in part 531 of this subchapter is used in the product name of the product without appropriate qualification.


(c) A product exempted under this section is subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
