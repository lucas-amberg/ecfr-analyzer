# § 541.7   Labels required; supervision of a Program employee.

(a) *General labeling requirements.* The requirements in part 317, subpart A, of this chapter, governing labels and labeling, safe-handling labeling, abbreviations of official marks, the use of approved labels, the labeling of products for foreign commerce, prohibited practices, the reuse of official inspection marks, filling of containers, relabeling of products, the storage and distribution of labels, and the requirements for packaging materials, apply to fish and fish products.


(b) A country of origin statement on the label of any fish “covered commodity” as defined in 7 CFR part 60, subpart A, that is sold by a “retailer,” as defined in 7 CFR 60.124, must comply with the requirements of 7 CFR 60.200 and 60.300.


(c) The safe handling instructions required on labels of fish and fish products specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall replace statements that include the terms “meat” and “poultry” with the following:


(1) In the rationale statement, “This product was prepared from inspected and passed fish. Some food products may contain bacteria that could cause illness if the product is mishandled and cooked improperly. For your protection, follow these safe handling instructions.” This statement shall be placed immediately after the heading and before the safe handling statements.


(2) In the labeling statements, “Keep raw fish separate from other foods. Wash working surfaces (including cutting boards), utensils, and hands after touching raw fish. (A graphic illustration of soapy hands under a faucet shall be displayed next to statement.)”


(d)(1) Labels and labeling of fish in the order Siluriformes and the products of those fish must bear the appropriate common or usual names of the fish. For example, among fish in the family Pangasiidae, the labels and labeling for fish of the species *Pangasius bocourti* must bear the term “basa”; for the species *Pangasius hypophthalmus* or *Pangasionodon hypophthalmus,* “swai,” “tra,” or “sutchi.”


(2) The labels and labeling only of fish and fish products within the family Icataluridae may bear the term “catfish.”


(e) The requirements in part 441 of this chapter, governing water retained from processing in raw meat and poultry, apply to retained water in fish. The requirements in part 442 of this chapter, governing quantity of contents labeling, the testing of scales, and the handling of product that is found to be out of compliance with net weight requirements, apply to fish and fish products.


(1) Packages of frozen or fresh-frozen fish carcasses or parts must be labeled to reflect 100-percent net weight after thawing. The de-glazed net weight must average 100 percent of the stated net weight of the frozen product when sampled and weighed according to the method prescribed in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Handbook 133 Chapter 2, Section 2.6.
