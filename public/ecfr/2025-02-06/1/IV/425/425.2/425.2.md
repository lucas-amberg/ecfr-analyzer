It is recommended that requests be made in writing. 


(b) Requests for notification of the existence of a record should state, if the requester is other than the individual to whom the record pertains, the relationship of the requester to that individual. (Note that requests will not be honored by the Commission pursuant to the Privacy Act unless made: (1) By the individual to whom the record pertains or (2) by such individual's legal guardian if the individual has been declared to be incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age by a court of competent jurisdiction.) 


(c) The Commission will acknowledge requests for the existence of records within 10 working days from the time it receives the request and will normally notify the requester of the existence or non-existence of records within 30 working days from receipt of request.
