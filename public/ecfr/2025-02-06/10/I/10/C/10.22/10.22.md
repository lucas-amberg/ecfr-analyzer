A notification letter, prepared by the Division of Facilities and Security, approved by the Office of the General Counsel, and signed by the Director, Office of Administration, must be presented to each individual whose eligibility for an access authorization and/or an employment clearance is in question. Where practicable, the letter will be presented to the individual in person. The letter will be accompanied by a copy of this part and must state:


(a) That reliable information in the possession of the NRC has created a substantial doubt concerning the individual's eligibility for an access authorization and/or an employment clearance;


(b) The information that creates a substantial doubt regarding the individual's eligibility for an access authorization and/or an employment clearance, that must be as comprehensive and detailed as the national security interests and other applicable law permit;


(c) That the individual has the right to be represented by counsel or other representative at their own expense;


(d) That the individual may request within 20 days of the date of the notification letter, any documents, records and reports which form the basis for the question of their eligibility for an access authorization and/or an employment clearance. The individual will be provided within 30 days all such documents, records and reports to the extent they are unclassified and do not reveal a confidential source. The individual may also request the entire investigative file, which will be promptly provided, as permitted by the national security interests and other applicable law;


(e) That unless the individual files with the Director, Office of Administration, a written request for a hearing within 20 days of the individual's receipt of the notification letter or 20 days after receipt of the information provided in response to a request made under paragraph (d) of this section, whichever is later, the Director, Division of Facilities and Security, through the Director, Office of Administration, will submit a recommendation as to the final action to the Deputy Executive Director for Materials, Waste, Research, State, Tribal, Compliance, Administration, and Human Capital Programs 

on the basis of the information in the possession of the NRC;


(f) That if the individual files a written request for a hearing with the Director, Office of Administration, the individual shall file with that request a written answer under oath or affirmation that admits or denies specifically each allegation and each supporting fact contained in the notification letter. A general denial is not sufficient to controvert a specific allegation. If the individual is without knowledge, he or she shall so state and that statement will operate as a denial. The answer must also state any additional facts and information that the individual desires to have considered in explanation or mitigation of allegations in the notification letter. Failure to specifically deny or explain or deny knowledge of any allegation or supporting fact will be deemed an admission that the allegation or fact is true.


(g) That if the individual does not want to exercise his or her right to a hearing, but does want to submit an answer to the allegations in the notification letter, the individual may do so by filing with the Director, Office of Administration, within 20 days of receipt of the notification letter or 20 days after receipt of the information provided in response to a request made under paragraph (d) of this section, whichever is later, a written answer in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section;


(h) That the procedures in ยง 10.24 *et seq.* will apply to any hearing and review.
