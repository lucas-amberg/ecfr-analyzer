# Appendix P to Part 110—Category 1 and 2 Radioactive Material 



The “sum of fractions” methodology for evaluating combinations of radionuclides being transported, is to be used when import or export shipments contain multiple sources or multiple radionuclides. The threshold limit values used in a sum of the fractions calculation must be the metric values (*i.e.*, TBq).


I. If multiple sources and/or multiple radionuclides are present in an import or export shipment, the sum of the fractions of the activity of each radionuclides must be determined to verify the shipment is less than the Category 1 or 2 limits of Table 1, as appropriate. If the calculated sum of the fractions ratio, using the following equation, is greater than or equal to 1.0, then the import or export shipment exceeds the threshold limits of Table 1 and the applicable security provisions of this part apply.


II. Use the equation below to calculate the sum of the fractions ratio by inserting the actual activity of the applicable radionuclides or of the individual sources (of the same radionuclides) in the numerator of the equation and the corresponding threshold activity limit from the Table 1 in the denominator of the equation. Ensure the numerator and denominator values are in the same units and all calculations must be performed using the TBq (*i.e.*, metric) values of Table 1.
