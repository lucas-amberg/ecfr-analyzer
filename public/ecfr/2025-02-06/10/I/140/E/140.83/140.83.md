If the Commission determines that both of the criteria set forth in §§ 140.84 and 140.85 have been met, it will make the determination that there has been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence. If the Commission publishes a notice in the _Federal Register_ in accordance with § 140.82(a) and does not make a determination within 90 days thereafter that there has been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence, the alleged event will be deemed not to be an extraordinary nuclear occurrence. The time for the making of a determination may be extended by the Commission by notice published in the _Federal Register._
