# ยง 15.57   Termination of collection action.

(a) Before terminating collection activity, the NRC should have pursued all appropriate means of collection and determined, based upon the results of the collection activity, that the debt is uncollectible. Termination of collection activity ceases active collection of the debt. The termination of collection activity does not preclude the NRC from retaining a record of the account for purposes of: 


(1) Selling the debt, if the Treasury determines that such sale is in the best interests of the United States; 


(2) Pursuing collection at a subsequent date in the event there is a change in the debtor's status or a new collection tool becomes available; 


(3) Offsetting against future income or assets not available at the time of termination of collection activity; or 


(4) Screening future applicants for prior indebtedness. 


(b) Generally, the NRC will terminate collection activity on a debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy, regardless of the amount. However, the NRC may continue collection activity, subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, for any payments provided under a plan of reorganization.
