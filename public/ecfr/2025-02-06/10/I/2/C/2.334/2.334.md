# ยง 2.334   Implementing hearing schedule for proceeding.

(a) Unless the Commission directs otherwise in a particular proceeding, the presiding officer assigned to the proceeding shall, based on information and projections provided by the parties and the NRC staff, take appropriate action to maintain the hearing schedule established by the presiding officer in accordance with 10 CFR 2.332(a) of this part for the completion of the evidentiary record and, as appropriate, the issuance of its initial decision.


(b) *Modification of hearing schedule.* A hearing schedule may not be modified except upon a finding of good cause by the presiding officer or the Commission. In making such a good cause determination, the presiding officer or the Commission should take into account the following factors, among other things:


(1) Whether the requesting party has exercised due diligence to adhere to the schedule;


(2) Whether the requested change is the result of unavoidable circumstances; and


(3) Whether the other parties have agreed to the change and the overall effect of the change on the schedule of the case.


(c) The presiding officer shall provide written notification to the Commission any time during the course of the proceeding when it appears that there will be a delay of more than forty-five (45) days in meeting any of the dates for major activities in the hearing schedule established by the presiding officer under 10 CFR 2.332(a), or that the completion of the record or the issuance of the initial decision will be delayed more than sixty (60) days beyond the time specified in the hearing schedule established under 10 CFR 2.332(a). The notification must include an explanation of the reasons for the projected delay and a description of the actions, if any, that the presiding officer or the Board proposes to take to avoid or mitigate the delay.
