# § 2.603   Acceptance and docketing of application for early review of site suitability issues in a construction permit proceeding.

(a) Each part of an application for a construction permit submitted in accordance with § 2.101(a-1) of this part will be initially treated as a tendered application. If it is determined that any one of the parts as described in § 2.101(a-1) is incomplete and not acceptable for processing, the Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation will inform the applicant of this determination and the respects in which the document is deficient. Such a determination of completeness will generally be made within a period of 30 days.


(b)(1) The Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation will accept for docketing part one of an application for a construction permit for a utilization facility which is subject to § 51.20(b) of this chapter and is of the type specified in § 50.21(b)(2) or (3) or § 50.22 of this chapter, or is a testing facility where part one of the application as described in § 2.101(a-1) is complete. Part one of any application will not be considered complete unless it contains proposed findings as required by § 2.101(a-1)(1)(i) and unless it describes the applicant's site selection process, specifies the extent to which that process involves the consideration of alternative sites, explains the relationship between that process and the application for early review of site suitability issues, and briefly describes the applicant's long-range plans for ultimate development of the site. Upon assignment of a docket number, the procedures in § 2.101(a)(3) and (4) relating to formal docketing and the submission and distribution of additional copies of the application shall be followed.


(2) Additional parts of the application will be docketed upon a determination by the Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation that they are complete.


(c) If part one of the application is docketed, the Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation will cause to be published in the _Federal Register_ and send to the Governor or other appropriate official of the State in which the site is located, a notice of docketing of the application which states the purpose of the application, states the location of the proposed site, states that a notice of hearing will be published, requests comments within 120 days or such other time as may be specified on the initiation or outcome of an early site review from Federal, State, and local agencies and interested persons.
