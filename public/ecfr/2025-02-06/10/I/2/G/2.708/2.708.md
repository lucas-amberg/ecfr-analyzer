# ยง 2.708   Admissions.

(a) Apart from any admissions made during or as a result of a prehearing conference, at any time after its answer has been filed, a party may file a written request for the admission of the genuineness and authenticity of any relevant document described in or attached to the request, or for the admission of the truth of any specified relevant matter of fact. A copy of the document for which an admission of genuineness and authenticity is requested must be delivered with the request unless a copy has already been furnished.


(b)(1) Each requested admission is considered made unless, within a time designated by the presiding officer or the Commission, and not less than ten (10) days after service of the request or such further time as may be allowed on motion, the party to whom the request is directed serves on the requesting party either:


(i) A sworn statement denying specifically the relevant matters of which an admission is requested or setting forth in detail the reasons why it can neither truthfully admit nor deny them; or


(ii) Written objections on the ground that some or all of the matters involved are privileged or irrelevant or that the request is otherwise improper in whole or in part.


(2) Answers on matters to which such objections are made may be deferred until the objections are determined. If written objections are made to only a part of a request, the remainder of the request must be answered within the time designated.


(c) Admissions obtained under the procedure in this section may be used in evidence to the same extent and subject to the same objections as other admissions.
