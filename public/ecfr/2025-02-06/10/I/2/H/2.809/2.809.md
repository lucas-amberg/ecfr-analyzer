(a) In its advisory capacity to the Commission, the ACRS may recommend that the Commission initiate rulemaking in a particular area. The Commission will respond to such rulemaking recommendation in writing within 90 days, noting its intent to implement, study, or defer action on the recommendation. In the event the Commission decides not to accept or decides to defer action on the recommendation, it will give its reasons for doing so. Both the ACRS recommendation and the Commission's response will be made available at the NRC Web site, *http://www.nrc.gov,* following transmittal of the Commission's response to the ACRS.


(b) When a rule involving nuclear safety matters within the purview of the ACRS is under development by the NRC Staff, the Staff will ensure that the ACRS is given an opportunity to provide advice at appropriate stages and to identify issues to be considered during rulemaking hearings.
