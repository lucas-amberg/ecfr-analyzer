# § 2.1023   Immediate effectiveness.

(a) Pending review and final decision by the Commission, an initial decision resolving all issues before the presiding officer in favor of issuance or amendment of either an authorization to construct a high-level radioactive waste repository at a geological repository operations area under parts 60 or 63 of this chapter, or a license to receive and possess high-level radioactive waste at a geologic repository operations area under parts 60 or 63 of this chapter will be immediately effective upon issuance except:


(1) As provided in any order issued in accordance with § 2.342 that stays the effectiveness of an initial decision; or


(2) As otherwise provided by the Commission in special circumstances.




(b) The Director of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, notwithstanding the filing or pendency of an appeal or a petition for review pursuant to § 2.1015 of this subpart, promptly shall issue a construction authorization or a license to receive and possess high-level radioactive waste at a geologic repository operations area, or amendments thereto, following an initial decision resolving all issues before the Presiding Officer in favor of the licensing action, upon making the appropriate licensing findings, except—


(1) As provided in paragraph (c) of this section; or


(2) As provided in any order issued in accordance with § 2.342 of this part that stays the effectiveness of an initial decision; or


(3) As otherwise provided by the Commission in special circumstances.


(c)(1) Before the Director of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards may issue a construction authorization or a license to receive and possess waste at a geologic repository operations area in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the Commission, in the exercise of its supervisory authority over agency proceedings, shall undertake and complete a supervisory examination of those issues contested in the proceeding before the Presiding Officer to consider whether there is any significant basis for doubting that the facility will be constructed or operated with adequate protection of the public health and safety, and whether the Commission should take action to suspend or to otherwise condition the effectiveness of a Presiding Officer decision that resolves contested issues in a proceeding in favor of issuing a construction authorization or a license to receive and possess high-level radioactive waste at a geologic repository operations area. This supervisory examination is not part of the adjudicatory proceeding. The Commission shall notify the Director in writing when its supervisory examination conducted in accordance with this paragraph has been completed.


(2) Before the Director of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards issues a construction authorization or a license to receive and possess high-level radioactive waste at a geologic repository operations area, the Commission shall review those issues that have not been contested in the proceeding before the Presiding Officer but about which the Director must make appropriate findings prior to the issuance of such a license. The Director shall issue a construction authorization or a license to receive and possess high-level radioactive waste at a geologic repository operations area only after written notification from the Commission of its completion of its review under this paragraph and of its determination that it is appropriate for the Director to issue such a construction authorization or license. This Commission review of uncontested issues is not part of the adjudicatory proceeding.


(3) No suspension of the effectiveness of a Presiding Officer's initial decision or postponement of the Director's issuance of a construction authorization or license that results from a Commission supervisory examination of contested issues under paragraph (c)(1) of this section or a review of uncontested issues under paragraph (c)(2) of this section will be entered except in writing with a statement of the reasons. Such suspension or postponement will be limited to such period as is necessary for the Commission to resolve the matters at issue. If the supervisory examination results in a suspension of the effectiveness of the Presiding Officer's initial decision under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Commission will take review of the decision sua sponte and further proceedings relative to the contested matters at issue will be in accordance with procedures for participation by the DOE, the NRC staff, or other parties and interested governmental participants to the Presiding Officer proceeding established by the Commission in its written statement of reasons. If a postponement results from a review under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, comments on the uncontested matters at issue may be filed by the DOE within ten days of service of the Commission's written statement.
