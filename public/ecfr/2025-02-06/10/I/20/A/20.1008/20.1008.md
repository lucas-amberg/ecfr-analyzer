(b) The applicable section of §§ 20.1001-20.2402 must be used in lieu of requirements in the standards for protection against radiation in effect prior to January 1, 1994 
1 that are cited in license conditions or technical specifications, except as specified in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section.

(c) Any existing license condition or technical specification that is more restrictive than a requirement in §§ 20.1001-20.2402 remains in force until there is a technical specification change, license amendment, or license renewal.


(d) If a license condition or technical specification exempted a licensee from a requirement in the standards for protection against radiation in effect prior to January 1, 1994, 
1 it continues to exempt a licensee from the corresponding provision of §§ 20.1001-20.2402.


(e) If a license condition cites provisions in requirements in the standards for protection against radiation in effect prior to January 1, 1994 
1 and there are no corresponding provisions in §§ 20.1001-20.2402, then the license condition remains in force until there is a technical specification change, license amendment, or license renewal that modifies or removes this condition.
