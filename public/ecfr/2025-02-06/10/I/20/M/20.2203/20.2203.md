(4) For licensees subject to the provisions of EPA's generally applicable environmental radiation standards in 40 CFR part 190, levels of radiation or releases of radioactive material in excess of those standards, or of license conditions related to those standards.


(b) *Contents of reports.* (1) Each report required by paragraph (a) of this section must describe the extent of exposure of individuals to radiation and radioactive material, including, as appropriate:


(i) Estimates of each individual's dose; and


(ii) The levels of radiation and concentrations of radioactive material involved; and


(iii) The cause of the elevated exposures, dose rates, or concentrations; and


(iv) Corrective steps taken or planned to ensure against a recurrence, including the schedule for achieving conformance with applicable limits, ALARA constraints, generally applicable environmental standards, and associated license conditions.


(2) Each report filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section must include for each occupationally overexposed

(c) For holders of an operating license or a combined license for a nuclear power plant, the occurrences included in paragraph (a) of this section must be reported in accordance with the procedures described in §§ 50.73(b), (c), (d), (e), and (g) of this chapter, and must include the information required by paragraph (b) of this section. Occurrences reported in accordance with § 50.73 of this chapter need not be reported by a duplicate report under paragraph (a) of this section.


(d) All licensees, other than those holding an operating license or a combined license for a nuclear power plant, who make reports under paragraph (a) of this section shall submit the report in writing either by mail addressed to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN: Document Control Desk, Washington, DC 20555-0001; by hand delivery to the NRC's offices at 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland; or, where practicable, by electronic submission, for example, Electronic Information Exchange, or CD-ROM. Electronic submissions must be made in a manner that enables the NRC to receive, read, authenticate, distribute, and archive the submission, and process and retrieve it a single page at a time. Detailed guidance on making electronic submissions can be obtained by visiting the NRC's Web site at *http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html;* by e-mail to *MSHD.Resource@nrc.gov;* or by writing the Office of the Chief Information Officer, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001.
