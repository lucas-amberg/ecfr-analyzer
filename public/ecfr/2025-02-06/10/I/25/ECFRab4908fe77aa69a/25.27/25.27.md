# ยง 25.27   Reopening of cases in which requests for access authorizations are canceled.

(a) In conjunction with a new request for access authorization (NRC Form 237 or CSA equivalent) for individuals whose cases were previously canceled, new fingerprint cards (FD-257) in duplicate and a new Security Acknowledgment (NRC Form 176), or CSA equivalent, must be furnished to the CSA along with the request.


(b) Additionally, if 90 days or more have elapsed since the date of the last Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-86), or CSA equivalent, the individual must complete a personnel security packet (see ยง 25.17(d)).
