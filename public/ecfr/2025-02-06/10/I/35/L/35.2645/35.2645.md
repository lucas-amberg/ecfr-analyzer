(3) An assessment of timer linearity and accuracy; 


(4) The calculated on-off error; 


(5) A determination of trunnion centricity; 


(6) The difference between the anticipated output and the measured output; 


(7) An assessment of source output against computer calculations; 


(8) Notations indicating the operability of radiation monitors, helmet microswitches, emergency timing circuits, emergency off buttons, electrical interlocks, source exposure indicator lights, viewing and intercom systems, timer termination, treatment table retraction mechanism, and stereotactic frames and localizing devices (trunnions); and
