# ยง 36.15   Commencement of construction.

Commencement of construction of a new irradiator may not occur prior to the submission to the NRC of both an application for a license for the irradiator and the fee required by ยง 170.31 of this chapter. Any activities undertaken prior to the issuance of a license are entirely at the risk of the applicant and have no bearing on the issuance of a license with respect to the requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (Act), as amended, and rules, regulations, and orders issued under the Act. Commencement of construction as defined in ยง 36.2 may include non-construction activities if the activity has a reasonable nexus to radiological safety and security.
