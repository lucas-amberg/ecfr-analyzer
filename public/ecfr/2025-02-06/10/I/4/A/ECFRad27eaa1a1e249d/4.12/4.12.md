# ยง 4.12   Specific discriminatory actions prohibited.

(a) A recipient to which this subpart applies may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, on the ground of sex, race, color, or national origin:


(1) Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;


(2) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit to an individual which is different, or is provided in a different manner, from that provided to others under the program;


(3) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;


(4) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;


(5) Treat an individual differently from others in determining whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibilty, membership or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;


(6) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program through the provision of services or otherwise or afford him an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program (including the opportunity to participate in the program as an employee but only to the extent set forth in ยง 4.13).


(b) A recipient in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their sex, race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respects individuals of a particular sex, race, color, or national origin.


(c) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient or applicant may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any program to which this subpart applies, on the grounds of sex, race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this subpart.


(d) As used in this section the services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial assistance shall be deemed to include any services, financial aid, or other benefit provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal financial assistance.


(e) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in this section and ยง 4.13 does not limit the generality of the prohibition in ยง 4.11.


(f) This subpart does not prohibit the consideration of sex, race, color, or national origin if the purpose and effect are to remove or overcome the consequences of practices or impediments which have restricted the availability of, or participation in, the program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, on the grounds of sex, race, color or national origin. Where previous discriminatory practice or usage tends, on the grounds of sex, race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to which this subpart applies, the applicant or recipient has an obligation to take reasonable action to remove or overcome the consequences of the prior discriminatory practice or usage, and to accomplish the purposes of the Act.
