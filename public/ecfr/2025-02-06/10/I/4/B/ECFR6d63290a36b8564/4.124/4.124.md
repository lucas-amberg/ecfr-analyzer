# ยง 4.124   Employment criteria.

(a) A recipient may not make use of any employment test or other selection criterion that screens out or tends to screen out disabled persons or any class of disabled persons unless:


(1) The test score or other selection criterion as used by the recipient is shown to be job-related for the position in question; and


(2) Alternative job-related tests or criteria that do not screen out or tend to screen out as many disabled persons are not available.


(b) A recipient shall select and administer tests concerning employment so as best to ensure that, when administered to an applicant or employee who has a disability that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's or employee's job skills, aptitude, or whatever other factor the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the applicant's or employee's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).
