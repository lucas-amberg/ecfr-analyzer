If the Owner has not established design set-pressure acceptance criteria, then for each valve tested for which the as-found set-pressure (first actuation) exceeds ±3 percent of valve nameplate set-pressure, two additional valves shall be tested from the same valve group.






(xi) *OM condition: Valve Position Indication.* When implementing paragraph ISTC-3700, “Position Verification Testing,” in the ASME OM Code, 2012 Edition through the latest edition of the ASME OM Code incorporated by reference in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section, licensees must verify that valve operation is accurately indicated by supplementing valve position indicating lights with other indications, such as flow meters or other suitable instrumentation to provide assurance of proper obturator position for valves with remote position indication within the scope of Subsection ISTC including its mandatory appendices and their verification methods and frequencies. For valves not susceptible to stem-disk separation, licensees may implement ASME OM Code Case OMN-28, “Alternative Valve Position Verification Approach to Satisfy ISTC-3700 for Valves Not Susceptible to Stem-Disk Separation,” which is incorporated by reference in paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(H) of this section. Where plant conditions make it impractical to perform the initial ISTC-3700 test as supplemented by paragraph (b)(3)(xi) of this section by the date 2 years following the previously performed ISTC-3700 test, a licensee may justify an extension of this initial supplemental valve position verification provided the ISTC-3700 test as supplemented by paragraph (b)(3)(xi) of this section is performed at the next available opportunity and no later than the next plant shutdown. This one-time extension of the ISTC-3700 test schedule as supplemented by paragraph (b)(3)(xi) of this section is acceptable provided the licensee has available for NRC review documented justification based on information obtained over the previous 5 years of the structural integrity of the stem-disk connection for the applicable valves. The licensee's justification could be based on, for example, verification of the valve stem-disk connection through an appropriate weak link analysis, appropriate disk motion confirmed during diagnostic testing, or allowance and cessation of flow through the valves. The licensee's justification must provide reasonable assurance that the remote indicating lights accurately reveal the position of the valve obturator until the next ISTC-3700 test as supplemented by paragraph (b)(3)(xi) of this section is performed.

The number of components inspected must equal or exceed the number of components found to be leaking under that item number. If circumferential cracking is identified in the sample, non-visual NDE must be performed in the remaining components under that item number.

(*6*) *Reporting requirements.* The licensee will promptly notify the NRC regarding any volumetric examination of a mitigated weld that detects growth of existing flaws in the required examination volume that exceed the previous IWB-3600 flaw evaluations, new flaws, or any indication in the weld overlay or excavate and weld repair material characterized as stress corrosion cracking. Additionally, the licensee will submit to the NRC a report summarizing the evaluation, along with inputs, methodologies, assumptions, and causes of the new flaw or flaw growth within 30 days following plant startup.


(*7*) *Defining “t”.* For Inspection Items G, H, J, and K, when applying the acceptance standards of ASME BPV Code, Section XI, IWB-3514, for planar flaws contained within the inlay or onlay, the thickness “t” in IWB-3514 is the thickness of the inlay or onlay. For planar flaws in the balance of the dissimilar metal weld examination volume, the thickness “t” in IWB-3514 is the combined thickness of the inlay or onlay and the dissimilar metal weld.




(*8*) *Optimized weld overlay examination.* Following initial inservice volumetric inspection for Inspection Items C-2 and F-2 of Table 1 of ASME Code Case N-770-7, for weld overlay examination volumes that show no indication of crack growth or new cracking, in lieu of sample population, 100 percent of these optimized weld overlayed welds shall be added to the ISI program in accordance with -2410 of ASME Code Case N-770-7 and shall be examined once each inspection interval.




(*9*) *Deferrals.* (*i*) The initial inservice volumetric examination of optimized weld overlays, Inspection Item C-2, shall not be deferred.


(*ii*) Volumetric inspection of peened dissimilar metal butt welds shall not be deferred.


*(iii*) For Inspection Item M-2, N-1 and N-2 welds, the second required inservice volumetric examination shall not be deferred.


(*10*) *Examination technique.* Note 14(b) of Table 1 and Note (b) of Figure 5(a) of ASME BPV Code Case N-770-5 may only be implemented if the requirements of Note 14(a) of Table 1 of ASME BPV Code Case N-770-5 cannot be met.


(*11*) [Reserved]


(*12*) *Stress improvement inspection coverage.* Under Paragraph I.5.1, for cast stainless steel items, the required examination volume shall be examined by Appendix VIII procedures to the maximum extent practical including 100 percent of the susceptible material volume.


(*13*) *Encoded ultrasonic examination.* Ultrasonic examinations of non-mitigated or cracked mitigated dissimilar metal butt welds in the reactor coolant pressure boundary must be performed in accordance with the requirements of Table 1 for Inspection Item A-1, A-2, B-1, B-2, E, F-2, J, K, N-1, N-2 and O. Essentially 100 percent of the required inspection volume shall be examined using an encoded method.


(*14*) *Excavate and weld repair cold leg.* For cold leg temperature M-2, N-1 and N-2 welds, initial volumetric inspection after application of an excavate and weld repair (EWR) shall be performed during the second refueling outage.


(*15*) *Cracked excavate and weld repair.* In lieu of the examination requirements for cracked welds with 360 excavate and weld repairs, Inspection Item N-1 of Table 1, welds shall be examined during the first or second refueling outage following EWR. Examination volumes that show no indication of crack growth or new cracking shall be examined once each inspection interval thereafter.


(*16*) *Partial arc excavate and weld repair.* Inspection Item O cannot be used without NRC review and approval.


(h) *Protection and safety systems.* Protection systems of nuclear power reactors of all types must meet the requirements specified in this paragraph. Each combined license for a utilization facility is subject to the following conditions.


(1) [Reserved]


(2) *Protection systems.* For nuclear power plants with construction permits issued after January 1, 1971, but before May 13, 1999, protection systems must meet the requirements in IEEE Std 279-1968, “Proposed IEEE Criteria for Nuclear Power Plant Protection Systems,” or the requirements in IEEE Std 279-1971, “Criteria for Protection Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations,” or the requirements in IEEE Std 603-1991, “Criteria for Safety Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations,” and the correction sheet dated January 30, 1995. For nuclear power plants with construction permits issued before January 1, 1971, protection systems must be consistent with their licensing basis or may meet the requirements of IEEE Std. 603-1991 and the correction sheet dated January 30, 1995.


(3) *Safety systems.* Applications filed on or after May 13, 1999, for construction permits and operating licenses under this part, and for design approvals, design certifications, and combined licenses under part 52 of this chapter, must meet the requirements for safety systems in IEEE Std. 603-1991 and the correction sheet dated January 30, 1995.


(i)-(x) [Reserved]


(y) *Definitions.* As used in this section:
