# § 50.83   Release of part of a power reactor facility or site for unrestricted use.

(a) Prior written NRC approval is required to release part of a facility or site for unrestricted use at any time before receiving approval of a license termination plan. Section 50.75 specifies recordkeeping requirements associated with partial release. Nuclear power reactor licensees seeking NRC approval shall—


(1) Evaluate the effect of releasing the property to ensure that—


(i) The dose to individual members of the public does not exceed the limits and standards of 10 CFR Part 20, Subpart D; 


(ii) There is no reduction in the effectiveness of emergency planning or physical security; 


(iii) Effluent releases remain within license conditions; 


(iv) The environmental monitoring program and offsite dose calculation manual are revised to account for the changes; 


(v) The siting criteria of 10 CFR Part 100 continue to be met; and 


(vi) All other applicable statutory and regulatory requirements continue to be met. 


(2) Perform a historical site assessment of the part of the facility or site to be released; and 


(3) Perform surveys adequate to demonstrate compliance with the radiological criteria for unrestricted use specified in 10 CFR 20.1402 for impacted areas. 


(b) For release of non-impacted areas, the licensee may submit a written request for NRC approval of the release if a license amendment is not otherwise required. The request submittal must include—


(1) The results of the evaluations performed in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section; 


(2) A description of the part of the facility or site to be released; 


(3) The schedule for release of the property; 


(4) The results of the evaluations performed in accordance with § 50.59; and 


(5) A discussion that provides the reasons for concluding that the environmental impacts associated with the licensee's proposed release of the property will be bounded by appropriate previously issued environmental impact statements. 


(c) After receiving an approval request from the licensee for the release of a non-impacted area, the NRC shall—


(1) Determine whether the licensee has adequately evaluated the effect of releasing the property as required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section; 


(2) Determine whether the licensee's classification of any release areas as non-impacted is adequately justified; and 


(3) Upon determining that the licensee's submittal is adequate, inform the licensee in writing that the release is approved. 


(d) For release of impacted areas, the licensee shall submit an application for amendment of its license for the release of the property. The application must include—


(1) The information specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section; 


(2) The methods used for and results obtained from the radiation surveys required to demonstrate compliance with the radiological criteria for unrestricted use specified in 10 CFR 20.1402; and 


(3) A supplement to the environmental report, under § 51.53, describing any new information or significant environmental change associated with the licensee's proposed release of the property. 


(e) After receiving a license amendment application from the licensee for the release of an impacted area, the NRC shall—


(1) Determine whether the licensee has adequately evaluated the effect of releasing the property as required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section; 


(2) Determine whether the licensee's classification of any release areas as non-impacted is adequately justified; 


(3) Determine whether the licensee's radiation survey for an impacted area is adequate; and 


(4) Upon determining that the licensee's submittal is adequate, approve the licensee's amendment application. 


(f) The NRC shall notice receipt of the release approval request or license amendment application and make the approval request or license amendment application available for public comment. Before acting on an approval request or license amendment application submitted in accordance with this section, the NRC shall conduct a public meeting in the vicinity of the licensee's facility for the purpose of obtaining public comments on the proposed release of part of the facility or site. The NRC shall publish a document in the _Federal Register_ and in a forum, such as local newspapers, which is readily accessible to individuals in the vicinity of the site, announcing the date, time, and location of the meeting, along with a brief description of the purpose of the meeting.
