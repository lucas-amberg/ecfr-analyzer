# § 51.33   Draft finding of no significant impact; distribution.

(a) As provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the appropriate NRC staff director may make a determination to prepare and issue a draft finding of no significant impact for public review and comment before making a final determination whether to prepare an environmental impact statement or a final finding of no significant impact on the proposed action.


(b) Circumstances in which a draft finding of no significant impact may be prepared will ordinarily include the following:


(1) A finding of no significant impact appears warranted for the proposed action but the proposed action is (i) closely similar to one which normally requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement, or (ii) without precedent; and


(2) The appropriate NRC staff director determines that preparation of a draft finding of no significant impact will further the purposes of NEPA.


(c) A draft finding of no significant impact will (1) be marked “Draft”, (2) contain the information specified in § 51.32, (3) be accompanied by or include a request for comments on the proposed action and on the draft finding within thirty (30) days, or such longer period as may be specified in the notice of the draft finding, and (4) be published in the _Federal Register_ as required by §§ 51.35 and 51.119.


(d) A draft finding will be distributed as provided in § 51.74(a). Additional copies will be made available in accordance with § 51.123.


(e) When a draft finding of no significant impact is issued for a proposed action, a final determination to prepare an environmental impact statement or a final finding of no significant impact for that action shall not be made until the last day of the public comment period has expired.
