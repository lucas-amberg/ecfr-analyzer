# § 51.21   Criteria for and identification of licensing and regulatory actions requiring environmental assessments.

All licensing and regulatory actions subject to this subpart require an environmental assessment except those identified in § 51.20(b) as requiring an environmental impact statement, those identified in § 51.22(c) as categorical exclusions, and those identified in § 51.22(d) as other actions not requiring environmental review. As provided in § 51.22(b), the Commission may, in special circumstances, prepare an environmental assessment on an action covered by a categorical exclusion.
