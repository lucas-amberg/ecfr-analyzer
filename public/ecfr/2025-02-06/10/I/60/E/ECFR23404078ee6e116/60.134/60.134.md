# ยง 60.134   Design of seals for shafts and boreholes.

(a) *General design criterion.* Seals for shafts and boreholes shall be designed so that following permanent closure they do not become pathways that compromise the geologic repository's ability to meet the performance objectives or the period following permanent closure. 


(b) *Selection of materials and placement methods.* Materials and placement methods for seals shall be selected to reduce, to the extent practicable: 


(1) The potential for creating a preferential pathway for groundwater to contact the waste packages or 


(2) For radionuclide migration through existing pathways.
