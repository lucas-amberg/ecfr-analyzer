The eye dose equivalent shall not exceed 0.15 Sv (15 rem), and the shallow dose equivalent to skin shall not exceed 0.5 Sv (50 rem). The minimum distance from the surface facilities in the geologic repository operations area to the boundary of the preclosure controlled area must be at least 100 meters.
