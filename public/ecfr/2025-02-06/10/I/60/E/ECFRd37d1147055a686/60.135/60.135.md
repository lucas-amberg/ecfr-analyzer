# § 60.135   Criteria for the waste package and its components.

(a) *High-level-waste package design in general.* (1) Packages for HLW shall be designed so that the in situ chemical, physical, and nuclear properties of the waste package and its interactions with the emplacement environment do not compromise the function of the waste packages or the performance of the underground facility or the geologic setting. 


(2) The design shall include but not be limited to consideration of the following factors: solubility, oxidation/reduction reactions, corrosion, hydriding, gas generation, thermal effects, mechanical strength, mechanical stress, radiolysis, radiation damage, radionuclide retardation, leaching, fire and explosion hazards, thermal loads, and synergistic interactions. 


(b) *Specific criteria for HLW package design*—(1) *Explosive, pyrophoric, and chemically reactive materials.* The waste package shall not contain explosive or pyrophoric materials or chemically reactive materials in an amount that could compromise the ability of the underground facility to contribute to waste isolation or the ability of the geologic repository to satisfy the performance objectives. 


(2) *Free liquids.* The waste package shall not contain free liquids in an amount that could compromise the ability of the waste packages to achieve the performance objectives relating to containment of HLW (because of chemical interactions or formation of pressurized vapor) or result in spillage and spread of contamination in the event of waste package perforation during the period through permanent closure. 


(3) *Handling.* Waste packages shall be designed to maintain waste containment during transportation, emplacement, and retrieval. 


(4) *Unique identification.* A label or other means of identification shall be provided for each waste package. The identification shall not impair the integrity of the waste package and shall be applied in such a way that the information shall be legible at least to the end of the period of retrievability. Each waste package identification shall be consistent with the waste package's permanent written records. 


(c) Waste form criteria for HLW. High-level radioactive waste that is emplaced in the underground facility shall be designed to meet the following criteria: 


(1) *Solidification.* All such radioactive wastes shall be in solid form and placed in sealed containers. 


(2) *Consolidation.* Particulate waste forms shall be consolidated (for example, by incorporation into an encapsulating matrix) to limit the availability and generation of particulates. 


(3) *Combustibles.* All combustible radioactive wastes shall be reduced to a noncombustible form unless it can be demonstrated that a fire involving the waste packages containing combustibles will not compromise the integrity of other waste packages, adversely affect any structures, systems, or components important to safety, or compromise the ability of the underground facility to contribute to waste isolation.


(d) *Design criteria for other radioactive wastes.* Design criteria for waste types other than HLW will be addressed on an individual basis if and when they are proposed for disposal in a geologic repository.
