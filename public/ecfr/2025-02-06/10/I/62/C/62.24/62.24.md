# § 62.24   Extension of emergency access.

(a) After the receipt of a request from any generator of low-level waste, or any Governor on behalf of any generator or generators in his or her State, for an extension of emergency access that was initially granted under § 62.21, the Commission shall make an initial determination of whether—


(1) Emergency access continues to be necessary because of an immediate and serious threat to the public health and safety or the common defense and security; 


(2) The threat cannot be mitigated by any alternative that is consistent with public health and safety; and


(3) The generator of low-level waste and the State have diligently though unsuccessfully acted during the period of the initial grant to eliminate the need for emergency access.


(b) After making a determination pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the requirements specified in §§ 62.21(c) and 62.22 of this part, must be followed.
