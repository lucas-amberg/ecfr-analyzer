(2) These lands must be held free and clear of all encumbrances, if significant, such as: 


(i) Rights arising under the general mining laws; 


(ii) Easements for right-of-way; and 


(iii) All other rights arising under lease, rights of entry, deed, patent, mortgage, appropriation, prescription, or otherwise. 


(b) *Additional controls for permanent closure.* Appropriate controls must be established outside of the geologic repository operations area. DOE shall exercise any jurisdiction and control over surface and subsurface estates necessary to prevent adverse human actions that could significantly reduce the geologic repository's ability to achieve isolation. The rights of DOE may take the form of appropriate possessory interests, servitudes, or withdrawals from location or patent under the general mining laws. 


(c) *Additional controls through permanent closure.* Appropriate controls must be established outside the geologic repository operations area. DOE shall exercise any jurisdiction or control of activities necessary to ensure the requirements at ยง 63.111(a) and (b) are met. Control includes the authority to exclude members of the public, if necessary.
