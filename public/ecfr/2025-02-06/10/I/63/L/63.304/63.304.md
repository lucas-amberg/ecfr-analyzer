# ยง 63.304   Reasonable expectation.

*Reasonable expectation* means that the Commission is satisfied that compliance will be achieved based upon the full record before it. Characteristics of reasonable expectation include that it: 


(1) Requires less than absolute proof because absolute proof is impossible to attain for disposal due to the uncertainty of projecting long-term performance; 


(2) Accounts for the inherently greater uncertainties in making long-term projections of the performance of the Yucca Mountain disposal system; 


(3) Does not exclude important parameters from assessments and analyses simply because they are difficult to precisely quantify to a high degree of confidence; and 


(4) Focuses performance assessments and analyses on the full range of defensible and reasonable parameter distributions rather than only upon extreme physical situations and parameter values.
