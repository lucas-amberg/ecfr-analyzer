(c) Except when the President or designee determines in writing that no notice should be published for reasons of national security, the Secretary of the Commission shall make a copy of the determination to close all or part of an NRC advisory committee meeting available to the public upon request. If such a determination has been issued, the meeting notice published in the _Federal Register_ should comply with the provisions of ยง 7.12 applicable to closed meetings.
