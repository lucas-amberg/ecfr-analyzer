# Appendix A to Part 71—Determination of A

I. Values of A_1_ and A_2_ for individual radionuclides, which are the bases for many activity limits elsewhere in these regulations, are given in Table A-1. The curie (Ci) values specified are obtained by converting from the Terabecquerel (TBq) value. The Terabecquerel values are the regulatory standard. The curie values are for information only and are not intended to be the regulatory standard. Where values of A_1_ and A_2_ are unlimited, it is for radiation control purposes only. For nuclear criticality safety, some materials are subject to controls placed on fissile material.


II. a. For individual radionuclides whose identities are known, but which are not listed in Table A-1, the A_1_ and A_2_ values contained in Table A-3 may be used. Otherwise, the licensee shall obtain prior Commission approval of the A_1_ and A_2_ values for radionuclides not listed in Table A-1, before shipping the material.


b. For individual radionuclides whose identities are known, but which are not listed in Table A-2, the exempt material activity concentration and exempt consignment activity values contained in Table A-3 may be used. Otherwise, the licensee shall obtain prior Commission approval of the exempt material activity concentration and exempt consignment activity values for radionuclides not listed in Table A-2, before shipping the material.


c. The licensee shall submit requests for prior approval, described under paragraphs II.a. and II.b. of this Appendix, to the Commission, in accordance with § 71.1 of this part.


III. In the calculations of A_1_ and A_2_ for a radionuclide not in Table A-1, a single radioactive decay chain, in which radionuclides are present in their naturally occurring proportions, and in which no daughter radionuclide has a half-life either longer than 10 days, or longer than that of the parent radionuclide, shall be considered as a single radionuclide, and the activity to be taken into account, and the A_1_ and A_2_ value to be applied, shall be those corresponding to the parent radionuclide of that chain. In the case of radioactive decay chains in which any daughter radionuclide has a half-life either longer than 10 days, or greater than that of the parent radionuclide, the parent and those daughter radionuclides shall be considered as mixtures of different radionuclides.


IV. For mixtures of radionuclides whose identities and respective activities are known, the following conditions apply:


a. For special form radioactive material, the maximum quantity transported in a Type A package is as follows:


b. For normal form radioactive material, the maximum quantity transported in a Type A package is as follows:


c. If the package contains both special and normal form radioactive material, the activity that may be transported in a Type A package is as follows:


d. Alternatively, the A_1_ value for mixtures of special form material may be determined as follows:


e. Alternatively, the A_2_ value for mixtures of normal form material may be determined as follows:


f. The exempt activity concentration for mixtures of nuclides may be determined as follows:


g. The activity limit for an exempt consignment for mixtures of radionuclides may be determined as follows:


V.a. When the identity of each radionuclide is known, but the individual activities of some of the radionuclides are not known, the radionuclides may be grouped, and the lowest A_1_ or A_2_ value, as appropriate, for the radionuclides in each group may be used in applying the formulas in paragraph IV. Groups may be based on the total alpha activity and the total beta/gamma activity when these are known, using the lowest A_1_ or A_2_ values for the alpha emitters and beta/gamma emitters.


b. When the identity of each radionuclide is known but the individual activities of some of the radionuclides are not known, the radionuclides may be grouped and the lowest [A] (activity concentration for exempt material) or A (activity limit for exempt consignment) value, as appropriate, for the radionuclides in each group may be used in applying the formulas in paragraph IV of this appendix. Groups may be based on the total alpha activity and the total beta/gamma activity when these are known, using the lowest [A] or A values for the alpha emitters and beta/gamma emitters, respectively.
