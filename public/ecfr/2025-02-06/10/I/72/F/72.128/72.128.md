# § 72.128   Criteria for spent fuel, high-level radioactive waste, reactor-related greater than Class C waste, and other radioactive waste storage and handling.

(a) *Spent fuel, high-level radioactive waste, and reactor-related GTCC waste storage and handling systems.* Spent fuel storage, high-level radioactive waste storage, reactor-related GTCC waste storage and other systems that might contain or handle radioactive materials associated with spent fuel, high-level radioactive waste, or reactor-related GTCC waste, must be designed to ensure adequate safety under normal and accident conditions. These systems must be designed with—


(1) A capability to test and monitor components important to safety, 


(2) Suitable shielding for radioactive protection under normal and accident conditions, 


(3) Confinement structures and systems, 


(4) A heat-removal capability having testability and reliability consistent with its importance to safety, and 


(5) means to minimize the quantity of radioactive wastes generated. 


(b) *Waste treatment.* Radioactive waste treatment facilities must be provided. Provisions must be made for the packing of site-generated low-level wastes in a form suitable for storage onsite awaiting transfer to disposal sites.
