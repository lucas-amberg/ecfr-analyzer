# § 73.67   Licensee fixed site and in-transit requirements for the physical protection of special nuclear material of moderate and low strategic significance.

(a) *General performance objectives.* (1) Each licensee who possesses, uses or transports special nuclear material of moderate or low strategic significance shall establish and maintain a physical protection system that will achieve the following objectives: 


(i) Minimize the possibilities for unauthorized removal of special nuclear material consistent with the potential consequences of such actions; and 


(ii) Facilitate the location and recovery of missing special nuclear material. 


(2) To achieve these objectives, the physical protection system shall provide: 


(i) Early detection and assessment of unauthorized access or activities by an external adversary within the controlled access area containing special nuclear material; 


(ii) Early detection of removal of special nuclear material by an external adversary from a controlled access area; 


(iii) Assure proper placement and transfer of custody of special nuclear material; and 


(iv) Respond to indications of an unauthorized removal of special nuclear material and then notify the appropriate response forces of its removal in order to facilitate its recovery. 




(b)(1) A licensee is exempt from the requirements of this section to the extent that he possesses, uses, or transports: 




(i) Special nuclear material which is not readily separable from other radioactive material and which has a total external radiation level in excess of 1 gray (100 rad) per hour at a distance of 1 meter (3.3 feet) from any accessible surface without intervening shielding, or 


(ii) Sealed plutonium-beryllium neutron sources totaling 500 grams or less contained plutonium at any one site or contiguous sites, or 


(iii) Plutonium with an isotopic concentration exceeding 80 percent in plutonium-238. 


(2) A licensee who has quantities of special nuclear material equivalent to special nuclear material of moderate strategic significance distributed over several buildings may, for each building which contains a quantity of special nuclear material less than or equal to a level of special nuclear material of low strategic significance, protect the material in that building under the lower classification physical security requirements. 


(c) Each licensee who possesses, uses, transports, or delivers to a carrier for transport special nuclear material of moderate strategic significance, or 10 kg or more of special nuclear material of low strategic significance shall: 


(1) Submit a security plan or an amended security plan describing how the licensee will comply with all the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), (f), and (g) of this section, as appropriate, including schedules of implementation. The licensee shall retain a copy of the effective security plan as a record for three years after the close of period for which the licensee possesses the special nuclear material under each license for which the original plan was submitted. Copies of superseded material must be retained for three years after each change.


(2) Within 30 days after the plan submitted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section is approved, or when specified by the NRC in writing, implement the approved security plan. 


(d) *Fixed site requirements for special nuclear material of moderate strategic significance.* Each licensee who possesses, stores, or uses quantities and types of special nuclear material of moderate strategic significance at a fixed site or contiguous sites, except as allowed by paragraph (b)(2) of this section and except those who are licensed to operate a nuclear power reactor pursuant to part 50, shall: 


(1) Use the material only within a controlled access area which is illuminated sufficiently to allow detection and surveillance of unauthorized penetration or activities, 


(2) Store the material only within a controlled access area such as a vault-type room or approved security cabinet or their equivalent which is illuminated sufficiently to allow detection and surveillance of unauthorized penetration or activities, 


(3) Monitor with an intrusion alarm or other device or procedures the controlled access areas to detect unauthorized penetration or activities, 


(4) Conduct screening prior to granting an individual unescorted access to the controlled access area where the material is used or stored, in order to obtain information on which to base a decision to permit such access, 


(5) Develop and maintain a controlled badging and lock system to identify and limit access to the controlled access areas to authorized individuals, 


(6) Limit access to the controlled access areas to authorized or escorted individuals who require such access in order to perform their duties,

(8) Establish a security organization or modify the current security organization to consist of at least one watchman per shift able to assess and respond to any unauthorized penetrations or activities in the controlled access areas, 


(9) Provide a communication capability between the security organization and appropriate response force, 


(10) Search on a random basis vehicles and packages leaving the controlled access areas, and 


(11) Establish and maintain written response procedures for dealing with threats of thefts or thefts of these materials. The licensee shall retain a copy of the response procedures as a record for the period during which the licensee possesses the appropriate type and quantity of special nuclear material requiring this record under each license for which the original procedures were developed and, for three years thereafter.
