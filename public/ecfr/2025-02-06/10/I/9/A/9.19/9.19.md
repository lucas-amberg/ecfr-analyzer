# § 9.19   Segregation of exempt information and deletion of identifying details.

(a) For records required to be made available under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), the NRC shall delete information that is exempt under one or more of the exemptions cited in § 9.17. The amount of information deleted will be indicated on the released portion of the record, unless providing this indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption(s) under which the matter has been withheld.


(b) In responding to a request for information submitted under § 9.23, in which it has been determined to withhold exempt information, the NRC shall segregate—


(1) Information that is exempt from public disclosure under § 9.17 from nonexempt information; and


(2) Factual information from advice, opinions, and recommendations in predecisional records unless the information is inextricably intertwined, or is contained in drafts, legal work products, and records covered by the lawyer-client privilege, or is otherwise exempt from disclosure.


(c) In denying a request for records, in whole or in part, NRC will make a reasonable effort to estimate the volume of any information requested that is denied and provide the estimate to the person making the request, unless providing the estimate would harm an interest protected by the exemption(s) under which the information has been denied.


(d) When entire records or portions thereof are denied and deletions are made from parts of the record by computer, the amount of information deleted will be indicated on the released portion of the record, unless providing this indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption(s) under which the matter has been denied.
