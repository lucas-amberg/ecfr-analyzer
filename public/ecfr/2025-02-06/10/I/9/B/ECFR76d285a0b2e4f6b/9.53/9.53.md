# § 9.53   Requests; how and where presented.

(a) Requests may be made in person or in writing. Assistance regarding equests or other matters relating to the Privacy Act of 1974 may be obtained by writing to the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act Officer, by an appropriate method listed in § 9.6. Requests relating to records in multiple systems of records should be made to the same Officer. That Officer shall assist the requestor in identifying his or her request more precisely and shall be responsible for forwarding the request to the appropriate system manager. 


(b) All written requests must be made to the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act Officer, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and sent by an appropriate method listed in § 9.6, and should clearly state on the envelope and in the letter, as appropriate: “Privacy Act Request,” “Privacy Act Disclosure Accounting Request,” “Privacy Act Correction Request.” The NRC does not consider a request received until the date it is actually received by the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act Officer.


(c) Requests may be made in person during official hours at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission office where the record is located, as listed in the “Notice of System of Records” for the system in which the record is contained.
