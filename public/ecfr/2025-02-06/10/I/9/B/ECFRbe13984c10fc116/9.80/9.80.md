# ยง 9.80   Disclosure of record to persons other than the individual to whom it pertains.

(a) NRC Commissioners and NRC personnel shall not disclose any record which is contained in a system of records maintained by NRC by any means of communication to any person, or to another Government agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains, unless disclosure of the record is:


(1) To NRC Commissioners and NRC personnel who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties;


(2) Required under 5 U.S.C. 552;


(3) For a routine use published in the _Federal Register_;


(4) To the Bureau of the Census for purposes of planning or carrying out a census or survey or related activity pursuant to the provisions of Title 13 of the United States Code;


(5) To a recipient who has provided the agency with advance adequate written assurance that the record will be used solely as a statistical research or reporting record and the record is transferred in a form that is not individually identifiable. The advance written statement of assurance shall (i) state the purpose for which the record is requested, and (ii) certify that the record will be used only for statistical purposes. Prior to release for statistical purposes in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, the record shall be stripped of all personally identifying information and reviewed to ensure that the identity of any individual cannot reasonably be determined by combining two or more statistical records;


(6) To the National Archives and Records Administration as a record that has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued preservation by the United States Government, or to the Archivist of the United States or designee for evaluation to determine whether the record has such value;


(7) To another agency or to an instrumentality of any governmental jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a civil or criminal law enforcement activity if the activity is authorized by law, and if the head of the agency or instrumentality has made a written request to the NRC specifying the particular portion of the record desired and the law enforcement activity for which the record is sought. A record may be disclosed to a law enforcement agency at the initiative of the NRC if criminal conduct is suspected, provided that such disclosure has been established as a routine use by publication in the _Federal Register,_ and the instance of misconduct is directly related to the purpose for which the record is maintained;


(8) To any person upon a showing of compelling circumstances affecting the health or safety of any individual;


(9) To either House of Congress or, to the extent of matter within its jurisdiction, to any committee or subcommittee thereof or to any joint committee of the Congress or to any subcommittee of such joint committee;


(10) To the Comptroller General, or any authorized representatives, in the course of the performance of the duties of the General Accounting Office;


(11) Pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction; or
