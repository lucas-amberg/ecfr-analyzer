# § 205.3   Appearance before the DOE or a State Office.

(a) A person may make an appearance, including personal appearances in the discretion of the DOE, and participate in any proceeding described in this part on his own behalf or by a duly authorized representative. Any application, appeal, petition, request or complaint filed by a duly authorized representative shall contain a statement by such person certifying that he is a duly authorized representative, unless a DOE form requires otherwise. Falsification of such certification will subject such person to the sanctions stated in 18 U.S.C. 1001 (1970). 


(b) Suspension and disqualification: The DOE or a State Office may deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of participating in proceedings, including oral presentation, to any individual who is found by the DOE—


(1) To have made false or misleading statements, either verbally or in writing; 


(2) To have filed false or materially altered documents, affidavits or other writings; 


(3) To lack the specific authority to represent the person seeking a DOE or State Office action; or 


(4) To have engaged in or to be engaged in contumacious conduct that substantially disrupts a proceeding.
