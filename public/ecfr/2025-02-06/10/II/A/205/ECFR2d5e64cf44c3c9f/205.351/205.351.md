# ยง 205.351   Reporting requirements.

For the purpose of this section, a report or a part of a report may be made jointly by two or more entities. Every electric utility or other entity engaged in the generation, transmission or distribution of electric energy for delivery and/or sale to the public shall report promptly, through the DOE Emergency Operations Center, by telephone, the occurrence of any event such as described in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. These reporting procedures are mandatory. Entities that fail to comply within 24 hours will be contacted and reminded of their reporting obligation.


(a) *Loss of Firm System Loads,* caused by:


(1) Any load shedding actions resulting in the reduction of over 100 megawatts (MW) of *firm* customer load for reasons of maintaining the *continuity* of the bulk electric power supply system.


(2) Equipment failures/system operational actions attributable to the loss of *firm* system loads for a period in excess of 15 minutes, as described below:


(i) Reports from entities with a previous year recorded peak load of over 3000 MW are required for all such losses of *firm* loads which total over 300 MW.


(ii) Reports from all other entities are required for all such losses of *firm* loads which total over 200 MW or 50 percent of the system load being supplied immediately prior to the incident, whichever is less.


(3) Other events or occurrences which result in a continuous interruption for 3 hours or longer to over 50,000 customers, or more than 50 percent of the total customers being served immediately prior to the interruption, whichever is less.


(b) *Voltage Reductions or Public Appeals:*

(1) Reports are required for any anticipated or actual system voltage reductions of 3 percent or greater for purposes of maintaining the *continuity* of the bulk electric power supply system.


(2) Reports are required for any issuance of a public appeal to reduce the use of electricity for purposes of maintaining the *continuity* of the bulk electric power system.


(c) *Vulnerabilities that could Impact System Reliability:*

(1) Reports are required for any actual or suspected act(s) of physical sabotage (not vandalism) or terrorism directed at an electric power supply system, local or regional, in an attempt to either:


(i) Disrupt or degrade the service reliability of the local or regional bulk electric power supply system, or


(ii) Disrupt, degrade, or deny bulk electric power service to:


(A) A specific facility (industrial, military, governmental, private), or


(B) A specific service (transportation, communications), or


(C) A specific locality (town, city, county).


(2) Reports are required for any abnormal emergency system operating condition(s) or other event(s) which in the judgment of the reporting entity could or would constitute a hazard to maintaining the *continuity* of the bulk electric power supply system. Examples will be provided in the DOE pamphlet on reporting procedures.


(d) *Fuel Supply Emergencies:*

(1) Reports are required for any anticipated or existing fuel supply emergency situation which would threaten the *continuity* of the bulk electric power supply system, such as:


(i) Fuel stocks or hydro project water storage levels are at 50 percent (or less) of normal for that time of the year, and a continued downward trend is projected.


(ii) Unscheduled emergency generation is dispatched causing an abnormal use of a particular fuel type, such that the future supply or stocks of that fuel could reach a level which threatens the reliability or adequacy of electric service.
