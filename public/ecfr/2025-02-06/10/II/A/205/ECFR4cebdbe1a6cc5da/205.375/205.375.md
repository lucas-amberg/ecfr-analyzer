# ยง 205.375   Guidelines defining inadequate fuel or energy supply.

An inadequate utility system fuel inventory or energy supply is a matter of managerial and engineering judgment based on such factors as fuels in stock, fuels en route, transportation time, and constraints on available storage facilities. A system may be considered to have an inadequate fuel or energy supply capability when, combined with other conditions, the projected energy deficiency upon the applicant's system without emergency action by the DOE, will equal or exceed 10 percent of the applicant's then normal daily net energy for load, or will cause the applicant to be unable to meet its normal peak load requirements based upon use of all of its otherwise available resources so that it is unable to supply adequate electric service to its ultimate customers. The following conditions will be considered in determining that a system has inadequate fuel or energy supply capability:


(1) System coal stocks are reduced to 30 days (or less) of normal burn days and a continued downward trend in stock is projected;


(2) System residual oil stocks are reduced to 15 days (or less) of normal burn days and a continued downward trend in stocks is projected;


(3) System distillate oil stocks which cannot be replaced by alternate fuels are reduced to 15 days (or less) of normal burn days and a continued downward trend in stocks is projected;


(4) System natural gas deliveries which cannot be replaced by alternate fuels have been or will be reduced 20 percent below normal requirements and no improvement in natural gas deliveries is projected within 30 days;


(5) Delays in nuclear fuel deliveries will extend a scheduled refueling shutdown by more than 30 days; and


(6) Water supplies required for power generation have been reduced to the level where the future adequacy of the power supply may be endangered and no near term improvement in water supplies is projected.
