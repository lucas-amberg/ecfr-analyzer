# § 205.305   Transferability.

(a) An authorization to transmit electric energy from the United States to a foreign country granted by order of the ERA under section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act shall not be transferable or assignable. Provided written notice is given to the ERA within 30 days, the authorization may continue in effect temporarily in the event of the involuntary transfer of this authority by operation of law (including transfers to receivers, trustees, or purchasers under foreclosure or judicial sale). This continuance is contingent on the filing of an application for permanent authorization and may be effective until a decision is made thereon.


(b) In the event of a proposed voluntary transfer of this authority to export electricity, the transferee and the transferor shall file jointly an application pursuant to this subsection, setting forth such information as required by §§ 205.300 through 205.304, together with a statement of reasons for the transfer.


(c) The ERA may at any time subsequent to the original order of authorization, after opportunity for hearing, issue such supplemental orders as it may find necessary or appropriate.
