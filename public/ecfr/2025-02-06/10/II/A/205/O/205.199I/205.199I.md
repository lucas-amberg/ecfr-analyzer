# ยง 205.199I   Remedies.

(a) A Remedial Order, a Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance, an Order of Disallowance, or a Consent Order may require the person to whom it is directed to roll back prices, to make refunds equal to the amount (plus interest) charged in excess of those amounts permitted under DOE Regulations, to make appropriate compensation to third persons for administrative expenses of effectuating appropriate remedies, and to take such other action as the DOE determines is necessary to eliminate or to compensate for the effects of a violation or any cost disallowance pursuant to ยง 212.83 or ยง 212.84. Such action may include a direction to the person to whom the Order is issued to establish an escrow account or take other measures to make refunds directly to purchasers of the products involved, notwithstanding the fact that those purchasers obtained such products from an intermediate distributor of such person's products, and may require as part of the remedy that the person to whom the Order is issued maintain his prices at certain designated levels, notwithstanding the presence or absence of other regulatory controls on such person's prices. In cases where purchasers cannot be reasonably identified or paid or where the amount of each purchaser's overcharge is incapable of reasonable determination, the DOE may refund the amounts received in such cases directly to the Treasury of the United States on behalf of such purchasers. 


(b) The DOE may, when appropriate, issue final Orders ancillary to a Remedial Order, Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance, Order of Disallowance, or Consent Order requiring that a direct or indirect recipient of a refund pass through, by such means as the DOE deems appropriate, including those described in paragraph (a) of this section, all or a portion of the refund, on a pro rata basis, to those customers of the recipient who were adversely affected by the initial overcharge. Ancillary Orders may be appealed to the Office of Hearings and Appeals only pursuant to subpart H.
