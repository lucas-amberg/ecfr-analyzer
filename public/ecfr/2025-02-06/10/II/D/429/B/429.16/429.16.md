# § 429.16   Central air conditioners and central air conditioning heat pumps.

(a) *Determination of Represented Value*—(1) *Required represented values.* Determine the represented values (including SEER, EER, HSPF, SEER2, EER2, HSPF2, P_W,OFF_, cooling capacity, and heating capacity, as applicable) for the individual models/combinations (or “tested combinations”) specified in the following table.


(2) *P*_W,OFF._ If individual models of single-package systems or individual combinations (or “tested combinations”) of split systems that are otherwise identical are offered with multiple options for off mode-related components, determine the represented value for the individual model/combination with the crankcase heater and controls that are the most consumptive. A manufacturer may also determine represented values for individual models/combinations with less consumptive off mode options; however, all such options must be identified with different model numbers for single-package systems or for outdoor units (in the case of split systems).


(3) *Refrigerants.* (i) If a model of outdoor unit (used in a single-split, multi-split, multi-circuit, multi-head mini-split, and/or outdoor unit with no match system) is distributed in commerce and approved for use with multiple refrigerants, a manufacturer must determine all represented values for that model using each refrigerant that can be used in an individual combination of the basic model (including outdoor units with no match or “tested combinations”). This requirement may apply across the listed categories in the table in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. A refrigerant is considered approved for use if it is listed on the nameplate of the outdoor unit. If any of the refrigerants approved for use is HCFC-22 or has a 95 °F midpoint saturation absolute pressure that is ± 18 percent of the 95 °F saturation absolute pressure for HCFC-22, or if there are no refrigerants designated as approved for use, a manufacturer must determine represented values (including SEER, EER, HSPF, SEER2, EER2, HSPF2, P_W,OFF_, cooling capacity, and heating capacity, as applicable) for, at a minimum, an outdoor unit with no match. If a model of outdoor unit is not charged with a specified refrigerant from the point of manufacture or if the unit is shipped requiring the addition of more than two pounds of refrigerant to meet the charge required for testing per section 2.2.5 of appendix M or appendix M1 (unless either (a) the factory charge is equal to or greater than 70% of the outdoor unit internal volume times the liquid density of refrigerant at 95 °F or (b) an A2L refrigerant is approved for use and listed in the certification report), a manufacturer must determine represented values (including SEER, EER, HSPF, SEER2, EER2, HSPF2, P_W,OFF_, cooling capacity, and heating capacity, as applicable) for, at a minimum, an outdoor unit with no match.


(ii) If a model is approved for use with multiple refrigerants, a manufacturer may make multiple separate representations for the performance of that model (all within the same individual combination or outdoor unit with no match) using the multiple approved refrigerants. In the alternative, manufacturers may certify the model (all within the same individual combination or outdoor unit with no match) with a single representation, provided that the represented value is no more efficient than its performance using the least-efficient refrigerant. If a manufacturer certifies a single model with multiple representations for the different approved refrigerants, it may use an AEDM to determine the represented values for all other refrigerants besides the refrigerant used for testing. A single representation made for multiple refrigerants may not include equipment in multiple categories or equipment subcategories listed in the table in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


(4) *Limitations for represented values of individual combinations.* The following paragraphs explains the limitations for represented values of individual combinations (or “tested combinations”).


(i) *Regional.* A basic model (model of outdoor unit) may only be certified as compliant with a regional standard if all individual combinations within that basic model meet the regional standard for which it is certified, including the coil-only combination as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, as applicable. A model of outdoor unit that is certified below a regional standard can only be rated and certified as compliant with a regional standard if the model of outdoor unit has a unique model number and has been certified as a different basic model for distribution in each region, where the basic model(s) certified as compliant with a regional standard meet the requirements of the first sentence. An ICM cannot certify an individual combination with a rating that is compliant with a regional standard if the individual combination includes a model of outdoor unit that the OUM has certified with a rating that is not compliant with a regional standard. Conversely, an ICM cannot certify an individual combination with a rating that is not compliant with a regional standard if the individual combination includes a model of outdoor unit that an OUM has certified with a rating that is compliant with a regional standard.


(ii) *Multiple product classes.* Models of outdoor units that are rated and distributed in individual combinations that span multiple product classes must be tested, rated, and certified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section as compliant with the applicable standard for each product class. This includes multi-split systems, multi-circuit systems, and multi-head mini-split systems with a represented value for a mixed combination including both SDHV and either non-ducted or ducted indoor units.


(5) *Requirements.* All represented values under paragraph (a) of this section must be based on testing in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section or the application of an AEDM or other methodology as allowed in paragraph (c) of this section.


(b) *Units tested*—(1) *General.* The general requirements of § 429.11 apply to central air conditioners and heat pumps; and


(2) *Individual model/combination selection for testing.* (i) The table identifies the minimum testing requirements for each basic model that includes multiple individual models/combinations; if a basic model spans multiple categories or subcategories listed in the table, multiple testing requirements apply. For each basic model that includes only one individual model/combination, test that individual model/combination. For single-split-system non-space-constrained air conditioners and heat pumps, when testing is required in accordance with 10 CFR part 430, subpart B, appendix M1, these requirements do not apply until July 1, 2024, provided that the manufacturer is certifying compliance of all basic models using an AEDM in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section and paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of § 429.70.


(ii) Each individual model/combination (or “tested combination”) identified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is not required to be tested for P_W,OFF_. Instead, at a minimum, among individual models/combinations with similar off-mode construction (even spanning different models of outdoor units), a manufacturer must test at least one individual model/combination for P_W,OFF_.


(3) *Sampling plans and represented values.* For individual models (for single-package systems) or individual combinations (for split-systems, including “tested combinations” for multi-split, multi-circuit, and multi-head mini-split systems) with represented values determined through testing, each individual model/combination (or “tested combination”) must have a sample of sufficient size tested in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart. For heat pumps (other than heating-only heat pumps), all units of the sample population must be tested in both the cooling and heating modes and the results used for determining all representations. The represented values for any individual model/combination must be assigned such that:


(i) *Off-Mode.* Any represented value of power consumption or other measure of energy consumption for which consumers would favor lower values must be greater than or equal to the higher of:


(A) The mean of the sample, where:


(B) The upper 90 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:


(ii) *SEER, EER, HSPF, SEER2, EER2, and HSPF2.* Any represented value of the energy efficiency or other measure of energy consumption for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:


(*A*) The mean of the sample, where:


(B) The lower 90 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:


(iii) *Cooling Capacity and Heating Capacity.* The represented values of cooling capacity and heating capacity must each be a self-declared value that is:


(A) Less than or equal to the lower of:


(*1*) The mean of the sample, where:


(*2*) The lower 90 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:


(B) Rounded according to:


(*1*) To the nearest 100 Btu/h if cooling capacity or heating capacity is less than 20,000 Btu/h,


(*2*) To the nearest 200 Btu/h if cooling capacity or heating capacity is greater than or equal to 20,000 Btu/h but less than 38,000 Btu/h, and


(*3*) To the nearest 500 Btu/h if cooling capacity or heating capacity is greater than or equal to 38,000 Btu/h and less than 65,000 Btu/h.


(c) *Determination of represented values for all other individual models/combinations besides those specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section*—(1) *All basic models except outdoor units with no match and multi-split systems, multi-circuit systems, and multi-head mini-split systems.* (i) For every individual model/combination within a basic model other than the individual model/combination required to be tested pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, either—


(A) A sample of sufficient size, comprised of production units or representing production units, must be tested as complete systems with the resulting represented values for the individual model/combination obtained in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (3) of this section; or


(B) The represented values of the measures of energy efficiency or energy consumption through the application of an AEDM in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and § 429.70. An AEDM may only be used to determine represented values for individual models or combinations in a basic model (or separate approved refrigerants within an individual combination) other than the individual model or combination(s) required for mandatory testing under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, except that, for single-split, non-space-constrained systems, when testing is required in accordance with 10 CFR part 430, subpart B, appendix M1, an AEDM may be used to rate the individual model or combination(s) required for mandatory testing under paragraph (b)(2) of this section until July 1, 2024, in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of § 429.70.


(ii) For every individual model/combination within a basic model tested pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, but for which P_W,OFF_ testing was not conducted, the represented value of P_W,OFF_ may be assigned through, either:


(A) The testing result from an individual model/combination of similar off-mode construction, or


(B) The application of an AEDM in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and § 429.70.


(2) *Outdoor units with no match.* All models of outdoor units with no match within a basic model must be tested.

When testing in accordance with 10 CFR part 430, subpart B, appendix M1, for basic models that include mixed combinations of indoor units (any two kinds of non-ducted, low-static, mid-static, and conventional ducted indoor units), the represented value for the mixed combination is the mean of the represented values for the individual component combinations as determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.


(iii) When testing in accordance with 10 CFR part 430, subpart B, appendix M, for basic models composed of both SDHV and non-ducted or ducted combinations, the represented value for the mixed SDHV/non-ducted or SDHV/ducted combination is the mean of the represented values for the SDHV, non-ducted, or ducted combinations, as applicable, as determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. When testing in accordance with 10 CFR part 430, subpart B, appendix M1, for basic models including mixed combinations of SDHV and another kind of indoor unit (any of non-ducted, low-static, mid-static, and conventional ducted), the represented value for the mixed SDHV/other combination is the mean of the represented values for the SDHV and other tested combination as determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
