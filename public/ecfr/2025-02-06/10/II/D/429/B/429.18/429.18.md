# § 429.18   Consumer furnaces.

(a) *Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.* (1) The requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to residential furnaces; and


(2)(i) For each basic model of furnaces, other than basic models of those sectional cast-iron boilers (which may be aggregated into groups having identical intermediate sections and combustion chambers) a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that—


(A) Any represented value of estimated annual operating cost, energy consumption or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:


(*1*) The mean of the sample, where:


Or,


(*2*) The upper 97
1/2 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:



and


(B) Any represented value of the annual fuel utilization efficiency or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:


(*1*) The mean of the sample, where:


Or,


(*2*) The lower 97
1/2 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:



(ii) For the lowest capacity basic model of a group of basic models of those sectional cast-iron boilers having identical intermediate sections and combustion chambers, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that—


(A) Any represented value of estimated annual operating cost, energy consumption or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:


(*1*) The mean of the sample, where:


Or,


(*2*) The upper 97
1/2 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:



(B) Any represented value of the fuel utilization efficiency or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:


(*1*) The mean of the sample, where:


Or,


(*2*) The lower 97
1/2 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:



(iii) For the highest capacity basic model of a group of basic models of those sectional cast-iron boilers having identical intermediate sections and combustion chambers, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that—


(A) Any represented value of estimated annual operating cost, energy consumption or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:


(*1*) The mean of the sample, where:


Or,


(*2*) The upper 97
1/2 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:



(B) Any represented value of the fuel utilization efficiency or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:


(*1*) The mean of the sample, where:


Or,


(*2*) The lower 97
1/2 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:



(iv) For each basic model or capacity other than the highest or lowest of the group of basic models of sectional cast-iron boilers having identical intermediate sections and combustion chambers, represented values of measures of energy consumption shall be determined by either—


(A) A linear interpolation of data obtained for the smallest and largest capacity units of the family, or


(B) Testing a sample of sufficient size to ensure that:


(*1*) Any represented value of estimated annual operating cost, energy consumption or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:


(*i*) The mean of the sample, where:


Or,


(*ii*) The upper 97
1/2 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:



(*2*) Any represented value of the energy factor or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:


(*i*) The mean of the sample, where:


Or,


(*ii*) The lower 97
1/2 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:



(v) Whenever measures of energy consumption determined by linear interpolation do not agree with measures of energy consumption determined by actual testing, the values determined by testing must be used for certification.


(vi) In calculating the measures of energy consumption for each unit tested, use the design heating requirement corresponding to the mean of the capacities of the units of the sample.


(vii) The represented value of annual fuel utilization efficiency must be rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a percentage point. The represented values of standby mode power and off mode power must be rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a watt.


(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of § 429.12 are applicable to residential furnaces; and


(2) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following public product-specific information:


(i) For consumer furnaces and boilers: The annual fuel utilization efficiency (AFUE) in percent (%) and the input capacity in British thermal units per hour (Btu/h).


(ii) For non-weatherized oil-fired furnaces (including mobile home furnaces), electric furnaces, and boilers: The standby mode power consumption (P_W,SB_) and off mode power consumption (P_W,OFF_) in watts.


(3) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following additional product-specific information:


(i) For cast-iron sectional boilers: A declaration of whether certification is based on linear interpolation or testing.


(ii) For gas-fired hot water boilers and gas-fired steam boilers: A declaration that the manufacturer has not incorporated a constant-burning pilot.


(iii) For gas-fired hot water boilers, oil-fired hot water boilers, and electric hot water boilers: Whether the boiler is equipped with tankless domestic water heating coils, and if not, a declaration that the manufacturer has incorporated an automatic means for adjusting water temperature).


(4) For multi-position furnaces, the annual fuel utilization efficiency (AFUE) reported for each basic model must be based on testing in the least efficient configuration. Manufacturers may also report and make representations of additional AFUE values based on testing in other configurations.
