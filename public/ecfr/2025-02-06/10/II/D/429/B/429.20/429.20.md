# § 429.20   Residential clothes washers.

(a) *Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.* (1) The requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to residential clothes washers; and


(2) For each basic model of residential clothes washers, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that—


(i) Any represented value of the integrated water factor, the estimated annual operating cost, the energy or water consumption, or other measure of energy or water consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:


(A) The mean of the sample, where:


Or,


(B) The upper 97
1/2 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:



(ii) Any represented value of the integrated modified energy factor, energy efficiency ratio, water efficiency ratio, or other measure of energy or water consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:


(A) The mean of the sample, where:


Or,


(B) The lower 97
1/2 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:



(3) The clothes container capacity of a basic model reported in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be the mean of the measured clothes container capacity, C, of all tested units of the basic model.


(4) The remaining moisture content (RMC) of a basic model reported in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be the mean of the final RMC value measured for all tested units of the basic model.




(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of § 429.12 are applicable to residential clothes washers; and


(2) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall contain the following public product-specific information:


(i) For residential clothes washers tested in accordance with appendix J to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter: the energy efficiency ratio (EER) in pounds per kilowatt hour per cycle (lb/kWh/cycle), the water efficiency ratio (WER) in pounds per gallon per cycle (lb/gal/cycle), the clothes container capacity in cubic feet (cu ft), the corrected remaining moisture content (RMC) expressed as a percentage, the type of control system (automatic or semi-automatic), and the type of loading (top-loading or front-loading).


(ii) For residential clothes washers tested in accordance with appendix J2 to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter: the integrated modified energy factor (IMEF) in cu ft/kWh/cycle, the integrated water factor (IWF) in gal/cycle/cu ft, the clothes container capacity in cu ft, the corrected RMC expressed as a percentage, and the type of loading (top-loading or front-loading).


(3) Pursuant to 10 CFR 429.12(b)(13), a certification report must include the following additional product-specific information: a list of all cycle selections comprising the complete energy test cycle for each basic model and the test cloth lot number used for certification testing.




(c) *Reported values.* Values reported pursuant to this subsection must be rounded as follows:


(1) MEF and IMEF to the nearest 0.01 cu ft/kWh/cycle;


(2) WF and IWF to the nearest 0.1 gal/cycle/cu ft;


(3) EER to the nearest 0.01 lb/kWh/cycle;


(4) WER to the nearest 0.01 lb/gal/cycle;


(5) RMC to the nearest 0.1 percentage point; and


(6) Clothes container capacity to the nearest 0.1 cu ft.
