# § 429.37   External power supplies.

(a) *Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.* (1) The requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to external power supplies; and


(2) For each basic model of external power supply selected for testing, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that—


(i) Any represented value of the estimated energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:


(A) The mean of the sample, where:


(B) The upper 97.5 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:



(ii) Any represented value of the estimated energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:


(A) The mean of the sample, where:


(B) The lower 97.5 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:



(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of § 429.12 are applicable to external power supplies except that required information may be reported on the basis of a basic model or a design family. If certifying using a design family, for § 429.12(b)(6), report the individual manufacturer's model numbers covered by the design family.


(2) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following public product-specific information:


(i) *External power supplies:* The average active mode efficiency as a percentage (%), no-load mode power consumption in watts (W), nameplate output power in watts (W), nameplate output voltage in volts (V), the effective wire gauge in American wire gauge (AWG) and length in feet (ft) of the recommended or included output cord, and, if missing from the nameplate, the output current in amperes (A) of the basic model or the output current in amperes (A) of the highest- and lowest-voltage models within the external power supply design family.


(ii) *Switch-selectable single-voltage external power supplies:* The average active mode efficiency as a percentage (%) value, no-load mode power consumption in watts (W) using the lowest and highest selectable output voltages, the lowest and highest selectable output voltages in volts (V), nameplate output power in watts (W), the effective wire gauge in American wire gauge (AWG) and length in feet (ft) of the recommended or included output cord, and, if missing from the nameplate, the output current in amperes (A).


(iii) *Adaptive single-voltage external power supplies:* The average active-mode efficiency as a percentage (%) at the highest and lowest nameplate output voltages, no-load mode power consumption in watts (W), nameplate output power in watts (W) at the lowest and highest nameplate output voltages, the lowest and highest nameplate output voltages in volts (V), the effective wire gauge in American wire gauge (AWG) and length in feet (ft) of the recommended or included output cord, and, if missing from the nameplate, the output current in amperes (A) at the highest and lowest nameplate output voltages.


(iv) *External power supplies that are exempt from no-load mode requirements under § 430.32(w)(5) of this chapter:* A statement that the product is designed to be connected to a security or life safety alarm or surveillance system component, the average active-mode efficiency as a percentage (%), the nameplate output power in watts (W), the nameplate output voltage in volts (V), the effective wire gauge in American wire gauge (AWG) and length in feet (ft) of the recommended or included output cord, and, if missing from the nameplate, the certification report must also include the output current in amperes (A) of the basic model or the output current in amperes (A) of the highest- and lowest-voltage models within the external power supply design family.




(3) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report for external power supplies that are exempt from the energy conservation standards at § 430.32(w)(1)(ii) of this chapter pursuant to § 430.32(w)(2) of this chapter must include the following additional information if, in aggregate, the total number of exempt EPSs sold as spare and service parts by the certifier exceeds 1,000 units across all models: The total number of units of exempt external power supplies sold during the most recent 12-calendar-month period ending on July 31, starting with the annual report due on September 1, 2017. The certification report must also include the exact timeframe (*e.g.,* from August 2016 to July 2017) of this most recent 12-calendar-month period.


(c) *Exempt external power supplies.* (1) For external power supplies that are exempt from energy conservation standards pursuant to § 430.32(w)(2) of this chapter and are not required to be certified pursuant to § 429.12(a) as compliant with an applicable standard, the importer or domestic manufacturer must, no later than September 1, 2017, and annually by each September 1st thereafter, submit a report providing the following information if, in aggregate, the total number of exempt EPSs sold as spare and service parts by the importer or manufacturer exceeds 1,000 units across all models:


(i) The importer or domestic manufacturer's name and address;


(ii) The brand name;


(iii) The number of units sold during the most recent 12-calendar-month period ending on July 31; and


(iv) The exact timeframe (*e.g.,* from August 2016 to July 2017) of this most recent 12-calendar-month period.


(2) The report must be submitted to DOE in accordance with the submission procedures set forth in § 429.12(h).
