(ii) For all wired and fixed-location wireless battery chargers other than uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) tested under appendix Y1 to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter: Battery discharge energy (E_batt_) in watt hours (Wh), active charge energy (E_a_) in watt hours (Wh), maintenance mode power (P_m_) in watts (W), no-battery mode power (P_nb_) in watts (W), standby mode power (P_sb_) in watts (W), off mode power (P_off_) in watts (W), and duration of the charge and maintenance mode test (t_cd_) in hours (hrs);


(iii) For all open-placement wireless battery chargers other than uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) tested under appendix Y1 to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter: no-battery mode power (P_nb_) in watts (W);


(iv) For UPSs: average load adjusted efficiency (Eff_avg_).




(2) *Units to be tested.* (i) The general requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to all battery chargers; and


(ii) For each basic model of battery chargers other than UPSs tested under appendix Y to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter, a sample of sufficient size must be randomly selected and tested to ensure that the represented value of UEC is greater than or equal to the higher of:




(A) The mean of the sample, where:


(B) The upper 97.5-percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:


(iii) For each basic model of battery chargers other than UPSs tested under appendix Y to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter, using the sample from paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, calculate the represented values of each metric (*i.e.,* maintenance mode power (P_m_), standby power (P_sb_), off mode power (P_off_), battery discharge energy (E_batt_), 24-hour energy consumption (E_24_), and duration of the charge and maintenance mode test (t_cd_)), where the represented value of the metric is:




(iv) For each basic model of UPSs, the represented value of Eff_avg_ must be calculated using one of the following two methods:


(A) A sample of sufficient size must be randomly selected and tested to ensure that the represented value of Eff_avg_ is less than or equal to the lower of:


(*1*) The mean of the sample, where:


(*2*) The lower 97.5-percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:


(B) The represented value of Eff_avg_ is equal to the Eff_avg_ of the single unit tested.




(v) For each basic model of battery chargers other than UPSs tested under appendix Y1 to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter, a sample of sufficient size must be randomly selected and tested to ensure that the represented value of E_a_ for all wired and fixed-location wireless chargers (or the represented value of P_nb_ for all open-placement wireless chargers) is greater than or equal to the higher of:


(A) The mean of the sample, where:


and, *x
* is the sample mean; *n* is the number of samples; and *x*_i_ is the E_a_ (or P_nb,_ when applicable) of the *i*th sample; or,


(B) The upper 97.5-percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:


and, *x
* is the sample mean; *s* is the sample standard deviation; *n* is the number of samples; and *t*_0.975_ is the Student's t-Distribution Values for a 97.5-percent one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A to this subpart).


(vi) For each basic model of battery chargers other than UPSs tested under appendix Y1 to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter, using the sample from paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section, calculate the applicable represented values of each metric (*i.e.,* maintenance mode power (P_m_), no-battery mode power (P_nb_), standby power (P_sb_), off mode power (P_off_), battery discharge energy (E_batt_), and duration of the charge and maintenance mode test (t_cd_)), where the represented value of the metric is:


and, *x
* is the sample mean; *n* is the number of samples; and *x*_i_ is the measured value of the *i*th sample for the metric.


(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of § 429.12 are applicable to all battery chargers.


(2) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), when tested under appendix Y to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter, a certification report must include the following product-specific information for all battery chargers other than UPSs: The nameplate battery voltage of the test battery in volts (V), the nameplate battery charge capacity of the test battery in ampere-hours (Ah), and the nameplate battery energy capacity of the test battery in watt-hours (Wh). A certification report must also include the represented values, as determined in paragraph (a) of this section for the maintenance mode power (P_m_), standby mode power (P_sb_), off mode power (P_off_), battery discharge energy (E_batt_), 24-hour energy consumption (E_24_), duration of the charge and maintenance mode test (t_cd_), and unit energy consumption (UEC).










(3) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), when tested under appendix Y to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter, a certification report must include the following product-specific information for all battery chargers other than UPSs: The manufacturer and model of the test battery, and the manufacturer and model, when applicable, of the external power supply.
