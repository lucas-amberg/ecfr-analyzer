(*1*) Representations for a basic model must be based on the least efficient individual model(s) distributed in commerce among all otherwise comparable model groups comprising the basic model, considering only individual models as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A)(*2*) of this section. For the purpose of this paragraph (a)(3), an “otherwise comparable model group” means a group of individual models distributed in commerce within the basic model that do not differ in components that affect energy consumption as measured according to the applicable test procedure specified at 10 CFR 431.96 other than those listed in table 1 to paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section. An otherwise comparable model group may include individual models distributed in commerce with any combination of the components listed in table 1 (or none of the components listed in table 1). An otherwise comparable model group may consist of only one individual model.


(*2*) For a basic model that includes individual models distributed in commerce with components listed in table 1 to paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section, the requirements for determining representations apply only to the individual model(s) of a specific otherwise comparable model group distributed in commerce with the least number (which could be zero) of components listed in table 1 included in individual models of the group. Testing under this paragraph shall be consistent with any component-specific test provisions specified in section 2.2.2 of appendix B to subpart F of part 431.

(*1*) The combination of indoor unit models shall be selected per the certified tested combination in the STI, subject to the provisions in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B)(*2*) of this section.


(*2*) For each indoor unit model identified in the tested combination for which the model number certified in the STI does not fully specify the presence or absence of all components, a fully-specified indoor unit model shall be selected that meets the following qualifications:


(*i*) Is distributed in commerce; and


(*ii*) Has a model number consistent with the certified indoor unit model number (*i.e.,* shares all digits of the model number that are specified in the certified indoor unit model number); and


(*iii*) Among the group of all indoor models meeting the criteria from paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(B)(*2*)(*i*) and (*ii*) of this section, has the least number (which could be zero) of components listed in Table 2 to paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B)(*2*) of this section.


(C) *Represented Values for Different Indoor Unit Combinations.* (*1*) If a basic model includes only one type of indoor unit combination (*i.e.,* ducted, non-ducted, or SDHV), a manufacturer must determine the represented values for the basic model in accordance with the sampling plan set forth in § 429.11 and paragraph (a)(1) of this section if the represented values are determined through testing, or in accordance with the provisions for applying an AEDM set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and § 429.70. Indoor unit models must be selected in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.


(*2*) If a basic model includes more than one type of indoor unit combination (*i.e.,* ducted, non-ducted, and/or SDHV):


(*i*) A manufacturer must determine separate represented values for each type of indoor unit combination. If the represented values are determined through testing, a manufacturer must test, at a minimum, a single tested combination that represents each type of indoor unit combination included in that basic model. A manufacturer may alternatively determine separate represented values through application of an AEDM as set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and § 429.70. Indoor unit models within the indoor unit combination must be selected in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.


(*ii*) A manufacturer may also determine optional “mixed” representations by calculating the mean value across any two required representations described in the paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(C)(*2*)(*i*) of this section (*i.e.,* a representation for “mixed ducted/non-ducted” would be determined by averaging the ducted representation and the non-ducted representation; a representation for “mixed ducted/SDHV” would be determined by averaging the ducted representation and the SDHV representation, and a representation for “mixed non-ducted/SDHV” would be determined by averaging the non-ducted representation and the SDHV representation).
