# § 429.59   Pumps.

(a) *Determination of represented value.* Manufacturers must determine the represented value, which includes the certified rating, for each basic model of general purpose pump either by testing (which includes the calculation-based methods in the test procedure), in conjunction with the following sampling provisions, or by application of an AEDM that meets the requirements of § 429.70 and the provisions of this section. Manufacturers must determine the represented value, which includes the certified rating, for each basic model of dedicated-purpose pool pump by testing, in conjunction with the following sampling provisions. Manufacturers must update represented values to account for any change in the applicable motor standards in subpart B of part 431 of this chapter and certify amended values as of the next annual certification.




(1) Units to be tested. The requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to pumps; and for each basic model, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that—


(i) Any representation of the constant load pump energy index (PEI_CL_), variable load pump energy index (PEI_VL_), circulator energy index (CEI), or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:


(A) The mean of the sample,


Or,


(B) The upper 95 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05,


(ii) Any representation of weighted energy factor of a basic model must be less than or equal to the lower of:


(A) The mean of the sample, where:


And x
 is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and x_i_ is the maximum of the ith sample; or,


(B) The lower 95 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:


And x
 is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t_0.95_ is the t statistic for a 95 percent one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A of this subpart).


(2) *Other representations*—(i) *Rated hydraulic horsepower.* The representative value of rated hydraulic horsepower of a basic model of dedicated-purpose pool pump or circulator pump must be the mean of the rated hydraulic horsepower for each tested unit.

(v) *Input power.* The representative value(s) of input power of a basic model of circulator pump at a load point(s) used in the calculation of CEI must be determined based on the mean of the input power at measured data point(s) for each tested unit.


(vi) *Flow at BEP and maximum speed.* The representative value of flow at BEP and maximum speed of a basic model of circulator pump must be determined based on the mean of the flow at BEP and maximum speed for each tested unit.


(vii) *Head at BEP and maximum speed.* The representative value of head at BEP and maximum speed of a basic model of circulator pump must be determined based on the mean of the head at BEP and maximum speed for each tested unit.


(viii) *Other reported values.* The representative value of any other reported value of a basic model of circulator pump must be determined based on the mean of that value for each tested unit.


(3) *Alternative efficiency determination methods.* In lieu of testing, a represented value of efficiency or consumption for a basic model of pump must be determined through the application of an AEDM pursuant to the requirements of § 429.70 and the provisions of this section, where:


(i) Any represented value of energy consumption or other measure of energy use of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the output of the AEDM and less than or equal to the Federal standard for that basic model; and


(ii) Any represented value of energy efficiency or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the output of the AEDM and greater than or equal to the Federal standard for that basic model.
