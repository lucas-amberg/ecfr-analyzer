# Appendix C to Subpart C of Part 429—Sampling Plan for Enforcement Testing of Distribution Transformers


(a) When testing distribution transformers, the number of units in the sample (m_1_) shall be in accordance with § 429.47(a) and DOE shall perform the following number of tests:


(1) If DOE tests four or more units, it will test each unit once;


(2) If DOE tests two or three units, it will test each unit twice; or


(3) If DOE tests one unit, it will test that unit four times.


(b) DOE shall determine compliance as follows:


(1) Compute the mean (X_1_) of the measured energy performance of the n_1_ tests in the first sample as follows:


(2) Compute the sample standard deviation (S_1_) of the measured efficiency of the n_1_ tests in the first sample as follows:


(3) Compute the standard error (SE(X_1_)) of the mean efficiency of the first sample as follows:


(4) Compute the sample size discount (SSD(m_1_)) as follows:


(5) Compute the lower control limit (LCL_1_) for the mean of


(6) Compare the mean of the first sample (X_1_) with the lower control limit (LCL_1_) to determine one of the following:


(i) If the mean of the first sample is below the lower control limit, then the basic model is not compliant and testing is at an end.


(ii) If the mean is equal to or greater than the lower control limit, no final determination of compliance or noncompliance can be made; proceed to Step (7).


(7) Determine the recommended sample size (n) as follows:


Given the value of n, determine one of the following:


(i) If the value of n is less than or equal to n_1_ and if the mean energy efficiency of the first sample (X_1_) is equal to or greater than the lower control limit (LCL_1_), the basic model is in compliance and testing is at an end.


(ii) If the value of n is greater than n_1_, the basic model is not compliant. The size of a second sample n_2_ is determined to be the smallest integer equal to or greater than the difference n−n_1_. If the value of n_2_ so calculated is greater than 21−n_1_, set n_2_ equal to 21−n_1_.


(8) Compute the combined (X_2_) mean of the measured energy performance of the n_1_ and n_2_ units of the combined first and second samples as follows:


(9) Compute the standard error (SE(X_2_)) of the mean full-load efficiency of the n_1_ and n_2_ units in the combined first and second samples as follows:


(Note that S_1_ is the value obtained above in (2).)


(10) Set the lower control limit (LCL_2_) to,


(i) If the mean of the combined sample (X_2_) is less than the lower control limit (LCL_2_), the basic model is not compliant and testing is at an end.


(ii) If the mean of the combined sample (X_2_) is equal to or greater than the lower control limit (LCL_2_), the basic model is in compliance and testing is at an end.
