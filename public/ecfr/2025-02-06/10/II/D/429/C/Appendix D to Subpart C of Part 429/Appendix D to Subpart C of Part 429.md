# Appendix D to Subpart C of Part 429â€”Sampling Plan for Enforcement Testing of Uninterruptible Power Supplies


(a) The minimum sample size for enforcement testing will be one unit.


(b) Compute the average load adjusted efficiency (*Eff*_avg_) of the unit in the sample.


(c) Determine the applicable DOE energy efficiency standard (EES).


(d) If all *Eff*_avg_ are equal to or greater than EES, then the basic model is in compliance and testing is at an end.


(e) If any *Eff*_avg_ is less than EES, then the basic model is in noncompliance and testing is at an end.
