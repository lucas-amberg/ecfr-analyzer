# Appendix B to Subpart B of Part 430—Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Freezers








DOE incorporated by reference HRF-1-2019, *Energy and Internal Volume of Consumer Refrigeration Products* (“HRF-1-2019”) in its entirety in § 430.3; however, only enumerated provisions of this document are applicable to this appendix. If there is any conflict between HRF-1-2019 and this appendix, follow the language of the test procedure in this appendix, disregarding the conflicting industry standard language.


(a) AHAM HRF-1-2019, (“HRF-1-2019”), Energy and Internal Volume of Consumer Refrigeration Products:


(i) Section 3—Definitions, as specified in section 3 of this appendix;


(ii) Section 4—Method for Determining the Refrigerated Volume of Consumer Refrigeration Products, as specified in section 4.1 of this appendix;


(iii) Section 5—Method for Determining the Energy Consumption of Consumer Refrigeration Products (excluding Table 5-1 and sections 5.5.6.5, 5.8.2.1.2, 5.8.2.1.3, 5.8.2.1.4, 5.8.2.1.5, and 5.8.2.1.6), as specified in section 5 of this appendix; and


(iv) Section 6—Method for Determining the Adjusted Volume of Consumer Refrigeration Products, as specified in section 4.2 of this appendix.


(b) Reserved.


If there is any conflict between HRF-1—2019 and this appendix, follow the language of the test procedure in this appendix, disregarding the conflicting industry standard language.


This appendix provides the test procedure for measuring the annual energy use in kilowatt-hours per year (kWh/yr), the total refrigerated volume in cubic feet (ft
3), and the total adjusted volume in cubic feet (ft
3) of freezers.


Section 3, *Definitions,* of HRF-1-2019 applies to this test procedure. In case of conflicting terms between HRF-1-2019 and DOE's definitions in this appendix or in § 430.2, DOE's definitions take priority.


*Through-the-door ice/water dispenser* means a device incorporated within the cabinet, but outside the boundary of the refrigerated space, that delivers to the user on demand ice and may also deliver water from within the refrigerated space without opening an exterior door. This definition includes dispensers that are capable of dispensing ice and water or ice only.


Determine the refrigerated volume and adjusted volume for freezers in accordance with the following sections of HRF-1-2019, respectively:


4.1. Section 4, Method for Determining the Refrigerated Volume of Consumer Refrigeration Products; and


4.2. Section 6, Method for Determining the Adjusted Volume of Consumer Refrigeration Products.


Determine the annual energy use (“AEU”) in kilowatt-hours per year (kWh/yr), for freezers in accordance with section 5, *Method for Determining the Energy Consumption of Consumer Refrigeration Products,* of HRF-1-2019, except as follows.


(a) In section 5.3.1 of HRF-1-2019, the top of the unit shall be determined by the refrigerated cabinet height, excluding any accessories or protruding components on the top of the unit.


(b) The ambient temperature and vertical ambient temperature gradient requirements specified in section 5.3.1 of HRF-1-2019 shall be maintained during both the stabilization period and the test period.


(c) The power supply requirements as specified in section 5.5.1 of HRF-1-2019 shall be maintained based on measurement intervals not to exceed one minute.


(d) The ice storage compartment temperature requirement as specified in section 5.5.6.5 in HRF-1-2019 is not required.


(e) For cases in which setup is not clearly defined by this test procedure, manufacturers must submit a petition for a waiver (See section 6 of this appendix).


(f) If the interior arrangements of the unit under test do not conform with those shown in Figure 5-2 of HRF-1-2019, as appropriate, the unit must be tested by relocating the temperature sensors from the locations specified in the figures to avoid interference with hardware or components within the unit, in which case the specific locations used for the temperature sensors shall be noted in the test data records maintained by the manufacturer in accordance with 10 CFR 429.71, and the certification report shall indicate that non-standard sensor locations were used. If any temperature sensor is relocated by any amount from the location prescribed in Figure 5-2 of HRF-1- 2019 in order to maintain a minimum 1-inch air space from adjustable shelves or other components that could be relocated by the consumer, except in cases in which the Figure prescribes a temperature sensor location within 1 inch of a shelf or similar feature, this constitutes a relocation of temperature sensors that must be recorded in the test data and reported in the certification report as described in this paragraph.


(a) For the purposes of comparing compartment temperatures with standardized temperatures, as described in section 5.6 of HRF-1-2019, the freezer compartment temperature shall be as specified in section 5.8.1.2.5 of HRF-1-2019.


(b) In place of Table 5-1 in HRF-1-2019, refer to Table 1 of this section.


Section 5.8.2, *Energy Consumption,* of HRF-1-2019 applies to this test procedure, except as follows:




(a) In place of section 5.8.2.1.2 of HRF-1-2019, use the calculations provided in this section. For units with long-time automatic defrost control using the two-part test period, the test cycle energy shall be calculated as:


(b) In place of sections 5.8.2.1.3 and 5.8.2.1.4 of HRF-1-2019, use the calculations provided in this section. For units with variable defrost control, the test cycle energy shall be calculated as set forth in section 5.3(a) of this appendix with the following addition:


CT shall be calculated equivalent to:


For freezers: To demonstrate compliance with the energy conservation standards at § 430.32(a) applicable to products manufactured on or after September 15, 2014, but before the compliance date of any amended standards published after January 1, 2022, IET, expressed in kilowatt-hours per cycle, equals 0.23 for a product with one or more automatic icemakers and otherwise equals 0 (zero). To demonstrate compliance with any amended standards published after January 1, 2022, IET, expressed in kilowatt-hours per cycle, is as defined in section 5.9.2.1 of HRF-1-2019.






To the extent that the procedures contained in this appendix do not provide a means for determining the energy consumption of a basic model, a manufacturer must obtain a waiver under § 430.27 to establish an acceptable test procedure for each such basic model. Such instances could, for example, include situations where the test setup for a particular basic model is not clearly defined by the provisions of this appendix. For details regarding the criteria and procedures for obtaining a waiver, please refer to § 430.27.
