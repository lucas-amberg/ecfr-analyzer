Additionally, the following requirements are also applicable.


2.1 *Installation Requirements.*

The installation requirements described in section 2.1 of AHAM DW-1-2020 are applicable to all dishwashers, with the following additions:


2.1.1 *In-Sink Dishwashers.*

For in-sink dishwashers, the requirements pertaining to the rectangular enclosure for under-counter or under-sink dishwashers are not applicable. For such dishwashers, the rectangular enclosure must consist of a front, a back, two sides, and a bottom. The front, back, and sides of the enclosure must be brought into the closest contact with the appliance that the configuration of the dishwasher will allow. The height of the enclosure shall be as specified in the manufacturer's instructions for installation height. If no instructions are provided, the enclosure height shall be 36 inches. The dishwasher must be installed from the top and mounted to the edges of the enclosure.


2.1.2 *Dishwashers without a Direct Water Line.*

Manually fill the built-in water reservoir to the full capacity reported by the manufacturer, using water at a temperature in accordance with section 2.3 of AHAM DW-1-2020.


2.2 *Water pressure.*

The water pressure requirements described in section 2.4 of AHAM DW-1-2020 are applicable to all dishwashers except dishwashers that do not have a direct water line.


2.3 *Test load items.*

The test load items described in section 2.7.1 of AHAM DW-1-2020 apply to this test procedure, including the applicable provisions of section 3.4 of AHAM DW-2-2020, as referenced in section 2.7.1 of AHAM DW-1-2020. The following test load items may be used in the alternative.


2.4 *Preconditioning requirements.*

The preconditioning requirements described in section 2.9 of AHAM DW-1-2020 are applicable to all dishwashers. For dishwashers that do not have a direct water line, measurement of the prewash fill water volume, V_pw_, if any, and measurement of the main wash fill water volume, V_mw_, are not taken.




2.5 *Detergent.*

2.5.1 *Detergent Formulation.* Either Cascade with the Grease Fighting Power of Dawn or Cascade Complete Powder may be used.










2.5.2 *Detergent Dosage.*

2.5.2.1 *Dosage for any dishwasher other than water re-use system dishwashers.*

If Cascade with the Grease Fighting Power of Dawn detergent is used, the detergent dosing specified in section 2.5.2.1.1 of this appendix must be used.


If Cascade Complete Powder detergent is used, consult the introductory note to this appendix regarding use of the detergent dosing specified in either section 2.5.2.1.1 or section 2.5.2.1.2 of this appendix.


2.5.2.1.1 *Dosage based on fill water volumes.* Determine detergent dosage as follows:


*Prewash Detergent Dosing.* If the cycle setting for the test cycle includes prewash, determine the quantity of dry prewash detergent, D_pw,_ in grams (g) that results in 0.25 percent concentration by mass in the prewash fill water as:


*Main Wash Detergent Dosing.* Determine the quantity of dry main wash detergent, D_mw,_ in grams (g) that results in 0.25 percent concentration by mass in the main wash fill water as:


For dishwashers that do not have a direct water line, V_mw_ is equal to the manufacturer reported water capacity used in the main wash stage of the test cycle.


2.5.2.1.2 *Dosage based on number of place settings.* Determine detergent dosage as specified in sections 2.10 and 2.10.1 of AHAM DW-1-2020.


2.5.2.2 *Dosage for water re-use system dishwashers.* Determine detergent dosage as specified in section 2.10.2 of AHAM DW-1-2020.


2.5.3 *Detergent Placement.*

Prewash and main wash detergent must be placed as specified in sections 2.10 and 2.10.1 of AHAM DW-1-2020. For any dishwasher that does not have a main wash detergent compartment and the manufacturer does not recommend a location to place the main wash detergent, place the main wash detergent directly into the dishwasher chamber.




2.6 *Connected functionality.*

For dishwashers that can communicate through a network (*e.g.,* Bluetooth® or internet connection), disable all network functions that can be disabled by means provided in the manufacturer's user manual, for the duration of testing. If network functions cannot be disabled by means provided in the manufacturer's user manual, conduct the standby power test with network function in the “as-shipped” condition.


For this test procedure, the test instruments are to be calibrated annually according to the specifications in sections 3.1 through 3.7 of AHAM DW-1-2020, including the applicable provisions of IEC 62301 as referenced in section 3.6 of AHAM DW-1-2020. Additionally, the following requirements are also applicable.


3.1 *Water meter.*

The water meter requirements described in section 3.3 of AHAM DW-1-2020 are applicable to all dishwashers except dishwashers that do not have a direct water line. For such dishwashers these water meter conditions do not apply and water is added manually pursuant to section 2.1.1 of this appendix.


3.2 *Water pressure gauge.*

The water pressure gauge requirements described in section 3.4 of AHAM DW-1-2020 are applicable to all dishwashers except dishwashers that do not have a direct water line. For such dishwashers these water pressure gauge conditions do not apply and water is added manually pursuant to section 2.1.1 of this appendix.


The test cycle and measurement specifications in sections 4.1 through 4.2 of AHAM DW-1-2020 apply to this test procedure, including section 5.1, note 1, and section 5.3.2 of IEC 62301 as referenced in section 4.2 of AHAM DW-1-2020. Additionally, the following requirements are also applicable.


4.1 *Water consumption.*

The water consumption requirements described in section 4.1.4 of AHAM DW-1-2020 are applicable to all dishwashers except dishwashers that do not have a direct water line. For such dishwashers these water consumption measurement requirements do not apply and water consumption, V, is the value reported by the manufacturer.


The calculations in section 5.1 through 5.7 of AHAM DW-1-2020 apply to this test procedure. The following additional requirements are also applicable:


(a) In sections 5.1.3, 5.1.4, 5.1.5, 5.4.3, 5.4.4, 5.4.5, and 5.7 of AHAM DW-1-2020, use N = 215 cycles/year in place of N = 184 cycles/year.


(b) In section 5.7 of AHAM DW-1-2020, use S_LP_ = 8,465 for dishwashers that are not capable of operating in fan-only mode.


(c) For dishwashers that do not have a direct water line, water consumption is equal to the volume of water use in the test cycle, as specified by the manufacturer.


(d) In sections 5.6.1.3, 5.6.1.4, 5.6.2.3, and 5.6.2.4 of AHAM DW-1-2020, use (C/e) in place of K.
