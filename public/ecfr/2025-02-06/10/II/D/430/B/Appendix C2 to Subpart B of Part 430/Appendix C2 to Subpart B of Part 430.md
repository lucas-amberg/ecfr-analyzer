2.6 *Detergent.*

The detergent requirements described in section 2.10 of AHAM DW-1-2020 are applicable to all dishwashers. For any dishwasher that does not have a main wash detergent compartment and the manufacturer does not recommend a location to place the main wash detergent, place the detergent directly into the dishwasher chamber.


2.7 *Connected functionality.*

For dishwashers that can communicate through a network (*e.g.,* Bluetooth® or internet connection), disable all network functions that can be disabled by means provided in the manufacturer's user manual, for the duration of testing. If network functions cannot be disabled by means provided in the manufacturer's user manual, conduct the standby power test with network function in the “as-shipped” condition.


2.8 *Evaluation Room Lighting Conditions.*

The lighting setup in the evaluation room where the test load is scored shall be according to the requirements specified in section 5.10 of AHAM DW-2-2020.


For this test procedure, the test instruments are to be calibrated annually according to the specifications in section 3.1 through 3.7 of AHAM DW-1-2020, including the applicable provisions of IEC 62301 as referenced in section 3.6 of AHAM DW-1-2020. Additionally, the following requirements are also applicable.


3.1 *Water meter.*

The water meter requirements described in section 3.3 of AHAM DW-1-2020 are applicable to all dishwashers except dishwashers that do not have a direct water line. For such dishwashers these water meter conditions do not apply and water is added manually pursuant to section 2.1.1 of this appendix.


3.2 *Water pressure gauge.*

The water pressure gauge requirements described in section 3.4 of AHAM DW-1-2020 are applicable to all dishwashers except dishwashers that do not have a direct water line. For such dishwashers these water pressure gauge conditions do not apply and water is added manually pursuant to section 2.1.1 of this appendix.


The test cycle and measurement specifications in sections 4.1 through 4.2 of AHAM DW-1-2020 and the scoring specifications in section 5.10.1.1 of AHAM DW-2-2020 apply to this test procedure, including section 5.1, note 1, and section 5.3.2 of IEC 62301 as referenced in section 4.2 of AHAM DW-1-2020. Additionally, the following requirements are also applicable.


4.1 *Active mode cycle.*

The active mode energy consumption measurement requirements described in section 4.1 of AHAM DW-1-2020 are applicable to all dishwashers. Additionally, the following requirements are also applicable:


(a) After the completion of each test cycle (sensor heavy response, sensor medium response, and sensor light response), the test load shall be scored according to section 4.2 of this appendix and its cleaning index calculated according to section 5.1 of this appendix.


(b) A test cycle is considered valid if its cleaning index is 70 or higher; otherwise, the test cycle is invalid and the data from that test run is discarded.


(c) For soil-sensing dishwashers, if the test cycle at any soil load is invalid, clean the dishwasher filter according to manufacturer's instructions and repeat the test at that soil load on the most energy-intensive cycle (determined as provided in section 4.1.1 of this appendix) that achieves a cleaning index of 70 or higher.


(d) For non-soil-sensing dishwashers, perform testing as described in section 4.1.a through 4.1.c of this appendix, except that, if a test cycle at a given soil load meets the cleaning index threshold criteria of 70 when tested on the normal cycle, no further testing is required for test cycles at lesser soil loads.


4.1.1 *Determination of most energy-intensive cycle.*

If the most energy-intensive cycle is not known and needs to be determined via testing, ensure the filter is cleaned as specified in the manufacturer's instructions and test each available cycle type, selecting the default cycle options for that cycle type. In the absence of manufacturer recommendations on washing and drying temperature options, the highest energy consumption options must be selected. Following the completion of each test cycle, the machine electrical energy consumption and water consumption shall be measured according to sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.4 of AHAM DW-1-2020, respectively. The total cycle energy consumption, E_MEI_, of each tested cycle type shall be calculated according to section 5.2 of this appendix. The most energy-intensive cycle is the cycle type with the highest value of E_MEI_.


For standard dishwashers, test each cycle with a clean load of eight place settings plus six serving pieces, as specified in section 2.7 of AHAM DW-1-2020. For compact dishwashers, test each cycle with a clean load of four place settings plus six serving pieces, as specified in section 2.7 of AHAM DW-1-2020. If the capacity of the dishwasher, as stated by the manufacturer, is less than four place settings, then the test load must be the stated capacity.


4.1.2 *Water consumption.*

The water consumption requirements described in section 4.1.4 of AHAM DW-1-2020 are applicable to all dishwashers except dishwashers that do not have a direct water line. For such dishwashers these water consumption measurement requirements do not apply and water consumption, V, is the value reported by the manufacturer.


4.2 *Scoring.*

Following the termination of an active mode test, each item in the test load shall be scored on a scale from 0 to 9 according to the instructions in section 5.10.1.1 of AHAM DW-2-2020.


The calculations in sections 5.1 through 5.7 of AHAM DW-1-2020 and section 5.12.3.1 of AHAM DW-2-2020 apply to this test procedure. The following additional requirements are also applicable:


(a) For both soil-sensing and non-soil-sensing dishwashers, use the equations specified for soil-sensing dishwashers.


(b) If a non-soil-sensing dishwasher is not tested at a certain soil load as specified in section 4.1.d of this appendix, use the energy and water consumption values of the preceding soil load when calculating the weighted average energy and water consumption values (*i.e.,* if the sensor medium response and sensor light response tests on the normal cycle are not conducted, use the values of the sensor heavy response test for all three soil loads; if only the sensor light response test is not conducted, use the values of the sensor medium response test for the sensor light response test).


(c) For dishwashers that do not have a direct water line, water consumption is equal to the volume of water use in the test cycle, as specified by the manufacturer.


(d) In sections 5.6.1.3, 5.6.1.4, 5.6.2.3, and 5.6.2.4 of AHAM DW-1-2020, use (C/e) in place of K.


5.1 *Cleaning Index.*

Determine the per-cycle cleaning index for each test cycle using the equation in section 5.12.3.1 of AHAM DW-2-2020.


5.2 *Calculation for determination of the most energy-intensive cycle type.*

The total cycle energy consumption for the determination of the most energy-intensive cycle specified in section 4.1.1 of this appendix is calculated for each tested cycle type as:
