Establishes test requirements to measure the energy performance of single-duct and dual-duct, and single-speed and variable-speed portable air conditioners in accordance with AHAM PAC-1-2022, unless otherwise specified.


Definitions for industry standards, terms, modes, calculations, etc. are in accordance with AHAM PAC-1-2022, section 4, with the following added definition:


*Annualized Energy Efficiency Ratio* means the energy efficiency of a portable air conditioner as measured in accordance with this test procedure as the total annual cooling delivered divided by the total annual energy consumption in per watt-hours (Btu/Wh) and determined in section 5.4.


Follow requirements and instructions for test conduct and test setup in accordance with AHAM PAC-1-2022, section 7, excluding section 7.1.3, including references to ASHRAE 37-2009, sections 5.1 and 5.3, and IEC 62301 sections 4.2, 4.3.2, 4.4, and 5.2, and Annex D. If the portable air conditioner has network functions, disable all network functions throughout testing if possible. If an end-user cannot disable a network function or the product's user manual does not provide instruction for disabling a network function, test the unit with that network function in the factory default configuration for the duration of the test.


3.1 *Duct temperature measurements.* Install any insulation and sealing provided by the manufacturer. For a dual-duct or single-duct unit, adhere four thermocouples per duct, spaced along the entire length equally, to the outer surface of the duct. Measure the surface temperatures of each duct. For a combined-duct unit, adhere sixteen thermocouples to the outer surface of the duct, spaced evenly around the circumference (four thermocouples, each 90 degrees apart, radially) and down the entire length of the duct (four sets of four thermocouples, evenly spaced along the entire length of the duct), ensuring that the thermocouples are spaced along the entire length equally, on the surface of the combined duct. Place at least one thermocouple preferably adjacent to, but otherwise as close as possible to, the condenser inlet aperture and at least one thermocouple on the duct surface preferably adjacent to, but otherwise as close as possible to, the condenser outlet aperture. Measure the surface temperature of the combined duct at each thermocouple. Temperature measurements must have an error no greater than ±0.5 °F over the range being measured.


Follow requirements for test conduct in active and inactive modes of operation in accordance with AHAM PAC-1-2022, section 8, except section 8.1.b, including references to sections 5.4, 6.2, 6.3, 7.3, 7.7, 8.7, 9, 10, and 11 of ASHRAE 37-2009, referring to Figure 12 and Figure 12 Notes of ANSI/AMCA 210 to determine placement of static pressure taps, and including references to ASHRAE 41.1-1986 and ASHRAE 41.6-1994. When conducting cooling mode testing for a variable-speed dual-duct portable air conditioner, use test configurations 1C and 1E in Table 2 of AHAM PAC-1-2022. Conduct the first test in accordance with ambient conditions for test configuration 1C in Table 2 of AHAM PAC-1-2022, and measure cooling capacity (Capacity_DD_95_Full_) and input power (P_DD_95_Full_). Conduct the second test in accordance with the ambient conditions for test configuration 1E in Table 2 of AHAM PAC-1-2022, with the compressor speed set to low for the duration of cooling mode testing (in accordance with the manufacturer instructions as described in section 7.1.10), and measure cooling capacity (Capacity_DD_83_Low_) and input power (P_DD_83_Low_). When conducting standby power testing using the sampling method described in section 5.3.2 of IEC 62301, if the standby mode is cyclic and irregular or unstable, collect 10 cycles worth of data. As discussed in Paragraph 5.1, Note 1 of IEC 62301, allow sufficient time for the unit to reach the lowest power state before proceeding with the test measurement.


Perform calculations from test measurements to determine Seasonally Adjusted Cooling Capacity (SACC) and Annualized Energy Efficiency Ratio (AEER) in accordance with AHAM PAC-1-2022, section 9 unless otherwise specified in this section.






5.1 *Adjusted Cooling Capacity.* Calculate the adjusted cooling capacities at the 95  °F and 83  °F operating conditions specified below of the sample unit, in Btu/h, according to the following equations.

5.2 *Seasonally Adjusted Cooling Capacity.* Calculate the seasonally adjusted cooling capacity for the sample unit, SACC, in Btu/h, according to:


5.3 *Annual Energy Consumption.* Calculate the annual energy consumption in each operating mode, AECm, in kilowatt-hours per year (kWh/year). Use the following annual hours of operation for each mode:


Calculate total annual energy consumption in all modes according to the following equations:


For a single-duct single-speed unit:


For a single-duct variable-speed unit:


For a dual-duct single-speed unit:


For a dual-duct variable-speed unit:
