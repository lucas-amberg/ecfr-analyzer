(b) Continuous functions, including information or status displays or sensor-based functions.


*Thermal stack damper* means a type of stack damper that relies exclusively upon the changes in temperature in the stack gases to open or close the damper.


3. *Classifications.* Classifications are as specified in section 4 of ASHRAE 103-2017.


4. *Requirements.* Requirements are as specified in section 5 of ASHRAE 103-2017.


5. *Instruments.* Instruments must be as specified in section 6 of ASHRAE 103-2017. In addition to the requirements in Section 6.3 of ASHRAE 103-2017, instruments for oil pressure shall be calibrated so that the error is no greater than ±0.5 psi.


6. *Apparatus.* The apparatus used in conjunction with the boiler during the testing must be as specified in section 7 of ASHRAE 103-2017 except for sections 7.1 and 7.8; and as specified in sections 6.1 and 6.2 of this appendix. In section 7.2.3.1 of ASHRAE 103-2017, substitute “in accordance with the I&O manual” for “in accordance with manufacturer instructions” with regard to installing the stack damper.


6.1 *General.*

(a) Install the boiler in the test room in accordance with the I&O manual, as defined in section 2.5 of this appendix, except that if provisions within this appendix are specified, then the provisions herein drafted and prescribed by DOE govern. If the I&O manual and any additional provisions of this appendix are not sufficient for testing a boiler, the manufacturer must request a waiver from the test procedure pursuant to § 430.27.


(b) The apparatuses described in section 6 of this appendix are used in conjunction with the boiler during testing. Each piece of apparatus shall conform to material and construction specifications listed in this appendix and in ASHRAE 103-2017, and the reference standards cited in this appendix and in ASHRAE 103-2017.


(c) Test rooms containing equipment must have suitable facilities for providing the utilities (including but not limited to environmental controls, sufficient fluid source(s), applicable measurement equipment, and any other technology or tools) necessary for performance of the test and must be able to maintain conditions within the limits specified in section 6 of this appendix.


6.2 *Condensate collection.* Attach condensate drain lines to the unit as specified in the I&O manual. Maintain a continuous downward slope of drain lines from the unit. Additional precautions (such as eliminating any line configuration or position that would otherwise restrict or block the flow of condensate or checking to ensure a proper connection with condensate drain spout that allows for unobstructed flow) must be taken to facilitate uninterrupted flow of condensate during the test. Collection containers must be glass or polished stainless steel to facilitate removal of interior deposits. The collection container must have a vent opening to the atmosphere.


7. *Testing conditions.* The testing conditions must be as specified in section 8 of ASHRAE 103-2017 (except for the excluded sub-sections as enumerated in section 0.1(g) of this appendix); and as specified in sections 7.1 to 7.8 of this appendix, respectively. For condensing furnaces and boilers, the relative humidity of the room air shall be measured in accordance with one of the methods described in ASHRAE 41.6-2014 (see section 8.5 of ASHRAE 103-2017).


7.1 *Fuel supply, gas.* In conducting the tests specified herein, gases with characteristics as shown in Table 1 of ASHRAE 103-2017 shall be used. Maintain the gas supply, ahead of all controls for a boiler, at a test pressure between the normal and increased values shown in Table 1 of ASHRAE 103-2017. Maintain the regulator outlet pressure at a level approximating that recommended in the I&O manual, as defined in section 2.5 of this appendix, or, in the absence of such recommendation, to the regulator settings used when the product is shipped by the manufacturer. Use a gas having a specific gravity of approximately that shown in Table 1 of ASHRAE 103-2017 and with a higher heating value within ±5% of the higher heating value shown in Table 1 of ASHRAE 103-2017. Determine the actual higher heating value in Btu per standard cubic foot of gas (defined in section 2 of this appendix) to be used in the test within an error no greater than 1%.


7.2 *Installation of piping.* Install piping equipment in accordance with the I&O manual. In the absence of such specification, install piping in accordance with section 8.3.1.1 of ASHRAE 103-2017.


7.3 *Gas burner.* Adjust the burners of gas-fired boilers to their maximum Btu input ratings at the normal test pressure specified by section 7.1 of this appendix. Correct the burner input rate to reflect gas characteristics at a temperature of 60 °F and atmospheric pressure of 30 in of Hg and adjust to within ±2 percent of the hourly Btu nameplate input rating specified by the manufacturer as measured at the maximum input rate during the steady-state performance test in section 8 of this appendix. Set the primary air shutters in accordance with the I&O manual to give a good flame at this condition. If, however, the setting results in the deposit of carbon on the burners during any test specified herein, the tester shall adjust the shutters and burners until no more carbon is deposited and shall perform the tests again with the new settings (*see* Figure 9 of ASHRAE 103-2017). After the steady-state performance test has been started, do not make additional adjustments to the burners during the required series of performance tests specified in section 9 of ASHRAE 103-2017. If a vent-limiting means is provided on a gas pressure regulator, keep it in place during all tests.


7.4 *Modulating gas burner adjustment at reduced input rate.* For gas-fired boilers equipped with modulating-type controls, adjust the controls to operate the unit at the nameplate minimum input rate. If the modulating control is of a non-automatic type, adjust the control to the setting recommended in the I&O manual. In the absence of such recommendation, the midpoint setting of the non-automatic control shall be used as the setting for determining the reduced fuel input rate. Start the boiler by turning the safety control valve to the “ON” position. Use a supply water temperature that will allow for continuous operation without shutoff by the control. If necessary to achieve such continuous operation, supply water may be increased above 120 °F; in such cases, gradually increase the supply water temperature to determine what minimum supply water temperature, with a 20 °F temperature rise across the boiler, will be needed to adjust for the minimum input rate at the reduced input rate control setting. Monitor regulated gas pressure out of the modulating control valve (or entering the burner) to determine when no further reduction of gas pressure results. The flow rate of water through the boiler shall be adjusted to achieve a 20 °F temperature rise.


7.5 *Oil burner.* Adjust the burners of oil-fired boilers to give a CO_2_ reading specified in the I&O manual and an hourly Btu input within ±2% of the hourly Btu nameplate input rating as specified in the I&O manual and as measured at maximum input rate during steady-state performance test as described in section 8 of this appendix. Smoke in the flue may not exceed a No. 1 smoke during the steady-state performance test as measured by the procedure in ASTM D2156-09 (R2018). Maintain the average draft over the fire and in the flue during the steady-state performance test at the value specified in the I&O manual. Do not allow draft fluctuations exceeding 0.005 in. water. Do not make additional adjustments to the burner during the required series of performance tests. The instruments and measuring apparatus for this test are described in section 6 of this appendix and shown in Figure 8 of ASHRAE 103-2017.


7.6 *Measurement of jacket surface temperature.* Divide the jacket of the boiler into 6-inch squares when practical, and otherwise into 36-square-inch regions comprising 4 inch by 9 inch or 3 inch by 12 inch sections, and determine the surface temperature at the center of each square or section with a surface thermocouple. Record the surface temperature of the 36-square-inch areas in groups where the temperature differential of the 36-square-inch areas is less than 10 °F for temperature up to 100 °F above room temperature, and less than 20 °F for temperatures more than 100 °F above room temperature.


7.7 *Installation of vent system.* Keep the vent or air intake system supplied by the manufacturer in place during all tests. Test units intended for installation with a variety of vent pipe lengths with the minimum vent length as specified in the I&O manual, or a 5-ft. flue pipe if there are no recommendations in the I&O manual. Do not connect a boiler employing a direct vent system to a chimney or induced-draft source. Vent combustion products solely by using the venting incorporated in the boiler and the vent or air intake system supplied by the manufacturer. For units that are not designed to significantly preheat the incoming air, see section 7.5 of this appendix and Figure 4a or 4b in section 7 of ASHRAE 103-2017. For units that do significantly preheat the incoming air, *see* Figure 4c or 4d in section 7 of ASHRAE 103-2017.


7.8 *Additional optional method of testing for determining D*_P_* and D*_F_. On units whose design is such that there is no measurable airflow through the combustion chamber and heat exchanger when the burner(s) is (are) off as determined by the optional test procedure in section 7.8.1 of this appendix, D_F_ and D_P_ may be set equal to 0.05.


7.8.1 *Optional test method for indicating the absence of flow through the heat exchanger.* Manufacturers may use the following test protocol to determine whether air flows through the combustion chamber and heat exchanger when the burner(s) is (are) off. The minimum default draft factor may be used only for units determined pursuant to this protocol to have no airflow through the combustion chamber and heat exchanger.


7.8.1.1 *Test apparatus.* Use a smoke stick that produces smoke that is easily visible and has a density less than or approximately equal to air. Use a smoke stick that produces smoke that is non-toxic to the test personnel and produces gas that is unreactive with the environment in the test chamber.


7.8.1.2 *Test conditions.* Minimize all air currents and drafts in the test chamber, including turning off ventilation if the test chamber is mechanically ventilated. Wait at least two minutes following the termination of the boiler on-cycle before beginning the optional test method for indicating the absence of flow through the heat exchanger.


7.8.1.3 *Location of the test apparatus.* After all air currents and drafts in the test chamber have been eliminated or minimized, position the smoke stick based on the following equipment configuration:


(a) For horizontal combustion air intakes, approximately 4 inches from the vertical plane at the termination of the intake vent and 4 inches below the bottom edge of the combustion air intake; or


(b) for vertical combustion air intakes, approximately 4 inches horizontal from vent perimeter at the termination of the intake vent and 4 inches down (parallel to the vertical axis of the vent). In the instance where the boiler combustion air intake is closer than 4 inches to the floor, place the smoke device directly on the floor without impeding the flow of smoke.


7.8.1.4 *Duration of test.* Establish the presence of smoke from the smoke stick and then monitor the direction of the smoke flow for no less than 30 seconds.


7.8.1.5 *Test results.* During visual assessment, determine whether there is any draw of smoke into the combustion air intake vent.


If absolutely no smoke is drawn into the combustion air intake, the boiler meets the requirements to allow use of the minimum default draft factor provided in section 7.8 of this appendix.


If there is any smoke drawn into the intake, proceed with the methods of testing as prescribed in section 8.8 of ASHRAE 103-2017.


7.8.2 [Reserved]


8. *Test procedure.* Conduct testing and measurements as specified in Section 9 of ASHRAE 103-2017 (except for the excluded sub-sections as enumerated in section 0.1(h) of this appendix); and as specified in sections 8.1 through 8.9 of this appendix. Section 8.4 of this appendix may be used in lieu of section 9.2 of ASHRAE 103-2017.


8.1 *Fuel input.* For gas units, measure and record the steady-state gas input rate in Btu/h, including pilot gas, corrected to standard conditions of 60 °F and 30 in. Hg. Use measured values of gas temperature and pressure at the meter and barometric pressure to correct the metered gas flow rate to the above standard conditions. For oil units, measure and record the steady-state fuel input rate. For maximum input rate, the measured burner input rate shall be within ±2% of the hourly Btu nameplate input rating (Q_IN_) specified by the manufacturer. For modulating furnaces and boilers operating at reduced input rate, the measured reduced heat input rate (Q_IN,R_) shall be recorded. At the discretion of the one testing, the hourly Btu nameplate minimum input rating specified by the manufacturer may be used in the calculations in place of Q_IN,R_ if the measured rate is within ±2% of the nameplate rating.


8.2 *Electrical input.* During the steady-state test, perform a single measurement of all of the electrical power involved in burner operation (PE), including energizing the ignition system, controls, gas valve or oil control valve, and draft inducer, if applicable. For boilers, the measurement of PE must include the boiler pump if so equipped. If the boiler pump does not operate during the measurement of PE, add the boiler pump nameplate power to the measurement of PE. If the boiler pump nameplate power is not available, use 0.13 kW. For hot water boilers, use the circulating water pump nameplate power for BE, or if the pump nameplate power is not available, use 0.13 kW.


8.3 *Input to interrupted ignition device.* For burners equipped with an interrupted ignition device, record the nameplate electric power used by the ignition device, PE_IG_, or record that PE_IG_ = 0.4 kW if no nameplate power input is provided. Record the nameplate ignition device on-time interval, t_IG_, or, if the nameplate does not provide the ignition device on-time interval, measure the on-time interval with a stopwatch at the beginning of the test, starting when the burner is turned on. Set t_IG_ = 0 and PE_IG_ = 0 if the device on-time interval is less than or equal to 5 seconds after the burner is on.


8.4 *Cycling Test Requirements.* For the measurement of condensate heat loss under cyclic conditions (for condensing boilers), section 9.8 of ASHRAE 103-2017 shall apply. Cycle times calculated from Table 7 of ASHRAE 103-2017 shall be rounded to the nearest second.


8.5 *Optional test procedures for condensing boilers, measurement of condensate during the establishment of steady-state conditions.* For units with step-modulating or two-stage controls, conduct the test at both the maximum and reduced inputs. In lieu of collecting the condensate immediately after the steady state conditions have been reached as required by section 9.2 of ASHRAE 103-2017, condensate may be collected during the establishment of steady state conditions as defined by section 9.1.2.1 of ASHRAE 103-2017. Perform condensate collection for at least 30 minutes. Measure condensate mass immediately at the end of the collection period to prevent evaporation loss from the sample. Record fuel input for the 30-minute condensate collection test period. Observe and record fuel higher heating value (HHV), temperature, and pressures necessary for determining fuel energy input (Q_C,SS_). Measure the fuel quantity and HHV with errors no greater than 1%. The humidity for the room air shall at no time exceed 80%. Determine the mass of condensate for the establishment of steady state conditions (M_C,SS_) in pounds by subtracting the tare container weight from the total container and condensate weight measured at the end of the 30-minute condensate collection test period.


8.6 *Cool-down test for gas- and oil-fueled boilers without stack dampers.* After steady-state testing has been completed, turn the main burner(s) “OFF” and measure the flue gas temperature at 3.75 minutes (temperature designated as T_F,OFF_(t_3_)) and 22.5 minutes (temperature designated as T_F,OFF_(t_4_)) after the burner shut-off using the thermocouple grid described in section 7.6 of ASHRAE 103-2017.


a. During this off-period, for units that do not have pump delay after shut-off, do not allow any water to circulate through the hot water boilers.


b. For units that have pump delay on shut-off, except those having pump controls sensing water temperature, the unit control must stop the pump. Measure and record the time between burner shut-off and pump shut-off (t
+) to the nearest second.


c. For units having pump delay controls that sense water temperature, operate the pump for 15 minutes and record t
+ as 15 minutes. While the pump is operating, maintain the inlet water temperature and flow rate at the same values as used during the steady-state test, as specified in sections 9.1 and 8.4.2.3 of ASHRAE 103-2017.


d. For boilers that employ post-purge, measure the length of the post-purge period with a stopwatch. Record the time from burner “OFF” to combustion blower “OFF” (electrically de-energized) as t_P_. Measure the flue gas temperature by means of the thermocouple grid described in section 7.6 of ASHRAE 103-2017 at the end of the post-purge period t_P_ (T_F,OFF_(t_P_)) and at (3.75 + t_P_) minutes (T_F,OFF_(t_3_)) and (22.5 + t_P_) minutes (T_F,OFF_(t_4_)) after the main burner shuts off. If t_P_ is prescribed by the I&O manual or measured to be greater than 3 minutes, also measure the flue gas temperature at the midpoint of the post-purge period t_P_/2 (T_F,OFF_(t_P_/2)). If the measured t_P_ is less than or equal to 30 seconds, record t_P_ as 0 and conduct the cool-down test as if there is no post-purge.


8.7 [Reserved]


8.8 *Calculation options.* The rate of the flue gas mass flow through the boiler and the factors D_P_, D_F_, and D_S_ are calculated by the equations in sections 11.6.1, 11.6.2, 11.6.3, 11.6.4, 11.7.1, and 11.7.2 of ASHRAE 103-2017. On units whose design is such that there is no measurable airflow through the combustion chamber and heat exchanger when the burner(s) is (are) off (as determined by the optional test procedure in section 7.8 of this appendix), D_F_ and D_P_ may be set equal to 0.05.


8.9 *Optional test procedures for condensing boilers that have no off-period flue losses.* For units that have applied the test method in section 7.8 of this appendix to determine that no measurable airflow exists through the combustion chamber and heat exchanger during the burner off-period and having post-purge periods of less than 30 seconds, the cool-down and heat-up tests specified in sections 9.5 and 9.6 of ASHRAE 103-2017 may be omitted. In lieu of conducting the cool-down and heat-up tests, the tester may use the losses determined during the steady-state test described in section 9.1 of ASHRAE 103-2017 when calculating heating seasonal efficiency, Effy_HS_.


8.10 *Measurement of electrical standby and off mode power.*

8.10.1 *Standby power measurement.* With all electrical auxiliaries of the boiler not activated, measure the standby power (P_W,SB_) in accordance with the procedures in IEC 62301, except that section 8.5, *Room Ambient Temperature,* of ASHRAE 103-2017 and the voltage provision of section 8.2.1.4, *Electrical Supply,* of ASHRAE 103-2017 shall apply in lieu of the corresponding provisions of IEC 62301 at section 4.2, *Test room,* and the voltage specification of section 4.3, *Power supply.* Frequency shall be 60Hz.

Round the recorded standby power (P_W,SB_) to the second decimal place, except for loads greater than or equal to 10W, which must be recorded to at least three significant figures.


8.10.2 *Off mode power measurement.* If the unit is equipped with an off switch or there is an expected difference between off mode power and standby mode power, measure off mode power (P_W_,_OFF_) in accordance with the standby power procedures in IEC 62301, except that section 8.5, *Room Ambient Temperature,* of ASHRAE 103-2017 and the voltage provision of section 8.2.1.4, *Electrical Supply,* of ASHRAE 103-2017 shall apply in lieu of the corresponding provisions of IEC 62301 at section 4.2, *Test room,* and the voltage specification of section 4.3, *Power supply.* Frequency shall be 60Hz. Clarifying further, IEC 62301 section 4.4, *Power measurement instruments,* and section 5, *Measurements,* apply for this measurement in lieu of SHRAE 103-2017 section 6.10, *Energy Flow Rate.* Measure the wattage so that all possible off mode wattage for the entire appliance is recorded, not just the off mode wattage of a single auxiliary. If there is no expected difference in off mode power and standby mode power, let P_W,OFF_ = P_W,SB_, in which case no separate measurement of off mode power is necessary. Round the recorded off mode power (P_W,OFF_) to the second decimal place, except for loads greater than or equal to 10W, in which case round the recorded value to at least three significant figures.
