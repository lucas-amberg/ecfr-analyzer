(a) Sections 4.2 through 4.6;


(b) Sections 5 through 7;


(c) Section 8.1;


(d) Annex A;


(e) Annex I; and


(f) AHAM Standard Interpretation.

(e) Sections 6 and 7.


(a) Sections 4.4.1 through 4.4.3; and


(b) Section 5.3.


This appendix contains the test requirements to measure the energy performance of a conventional room air cleaner, as defined at § 430.2, with smoke CADR and dust CADR between 10 to 600 cubic feet per minute (cfm), inclusive.


The definitions in sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.4.1 through 2.4.2.4, 2.6 through 2.8, and 2.9 of AHAM AC-7-2022 apply to this test procedure, including the applicable provisions of Annex I of AHAM AC-1-2020 as referenced in section 2.9 of AHAM AC-7-2022.


Testing conditions shall be as specified in sections 3.1 through 3.6.3 of AHAM AC-7-2022, including the applicable provisions of sections 4.2 through 4.6 and Annex A of AHAM AC-1-2020 as referenced in sections 3.2.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6.2 of AHAM AC-7-2022 and the applicable provisions of ASTM E 741-11(2017) as referenced in section 3.3 of AHAM AC-7-2022. Additionally, the following requirements are also applicable:


3.1. *Placement for Testing.* The air cleaner test unit shall be placed in the test chamber as specified in section 3.6.2 of AHAM AC-7-2022. Additionally, the placement instructions specified in AHAM Standard Interpretation in AHAM AC-1-2020 are also applicable.


3.2. *Air Cleaners with Network Mode Capability.* The air cleaner software update requirements specified in section 3.6.3.8 of AHAM AC-7-2022 are applicable. Additionally, software updates shall be conducted, if available, prior to initiating any testing. Software updates shall not be bypassed, even if the unit will operate without updates.


Test instruments shall be as specified in section 4 of AHAM AC-7-2022, including the applicable provisions of sections 4.4.1 through 4.4.3 of IEC 62301.


Measurement of smoke CADR, dust CADR, and pollen CADR shall be as specified in sections 5 through 7 of AHAM AC-1-2020, respectively. Measurement of active mode power shall be as specified in sections 5.3 through 5.7.4 of AHAM AC-7-2022, including the applicable provisions of sections 5.2.5 and 6.2.5 of AHAM AC-1-2020 as referenced in section 5.7.1 of AHAM AC-7-2022. Additionally, the following requirement is also applicable:


5.1. *Calculation of PM*_2.5_* CADR.*

5.1.1 PM_2.5_ CADR should be calculated as specified in section 2.9 of AHAM AC-7-2022.










5.1.2. For determining compliance only with the standards specified in § 430.32(ee)(1), PM_2.5_ CADR may alternately be calculated using the smoke CADR and dust CADR values determined according to Sections 5 and 6, respectively, of AHAM AC-1-2020, according to the following equation:




Standby mode power consumption shall be measured as specified in section 6 of AHAM AC-7-2022, including the applicable provisions of section 5.3 of IEC 62301.


Annual energy consumption, expressed in kilowatt-hours per year, and integrated energy factor, expressed in CADR per watt, shall be calculated as specified in section 7 of AHAM AC-7-2022.
