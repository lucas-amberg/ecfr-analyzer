# Appendix GG to Subpart B of Part 430—Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Portable Electric Spas






DOE incorporated by reference in § 430.3, the entire standard for ANSI/APSP/ICC-14 2019 and CSA C374:11 (R2021). However, only enumerated provisions of ANSI/APSP/ICC-14 2019 and CSA C374:11 (R2021), as listed in this section 0 are required. To the extent there is a conflict between the terms or provisions of a referenced industry standard and the CFR, the CFR provisions control. Non-enumerated provisions of ANSI/APSP/ICC-14 2019 are specifically excluded.


(a) Section 3—Definitions (excluding the definitions for *cover, specified; fill volume; rated volume; and standby mode*), as specified in section 2.1 of this appendix;


(b) Section 5—Test Method (excluding Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.5.2, 5.5.4, 5.5.5, and 5.7), as specified in sections 3, 3.1.6, 3.2.2, and 3.2.3 of this appendix;


(c) Appendix A—Minimum Chamber Requirements (excluding section titled *Chamber floor*), as specified in section 3.1.1 of this appendix.


(a) Clause 5.1.1—Test room, as specified in section 3.1.2 of this appendix;


(b) Figure 1—Test platform, as specified in section 3.1.2 of this appendix.


This appendix provides the test procedure for measuring the standby loss in watts and the fill volume in gallons of portable electric spas.


2.1. Section 3, Definitions, of ANSI/APSP/ICC-14 2019 applies to this test procedure. In case of conflicting terms between ANSI/APSP/ICC-14 2019 and DOE's definitions in this appendix or in § 430.2, DOE's definitions take priority.


2.2. *Combination spa* means a portable electric spa with two separate and distinct reservoirs, where—


(a) One reservoir is an exercise spa;


(b) The second reservoir is a standard spa; and


(c) Each reservoir has an independent water temperature setting control.


2.3. *Exercise spa* means a variant of a portable electric spa in which the design and construction includes specific features and equipment to produce a water flow intended to allow recreational physical activity including, but not limited to, swimming in place. An exercise spa is also known as a swim spa.


2.4. *Exercise spa portion* means the reservoir of a combination spa that is an exercise spa.


2.5. *Fill volume* means the volume of water held by the portable electric spa when it is filled as specified in section 3.1.4 of this appendix.


2.6. *Inflatable spa* means a portable electric spa where the structure is collapsible and is designed to be filled with air to form the body of the spa.


2.7. *Standard spa* means a portable electric spa that is not an inflatable spa, an exercise spa, or the exercise spa portion of a combination spa.


2.8. *Standard spa portion* means the reservoir of a combination spa that is a standard spa.


2.9. *Standby loss* means the mean normalized power required to operate the portable electric spa in default operation mode with the cover on, as calculated in section 3.3 of this appendix.


Determine the standby loss in watts and fill volume in gallons for portable electric spas in accordance with section 5, *Test Method,* of ANSI/APSP/ICC-14 2019, except as follows.


Install the portable electric spa in a chamber satisfying the requirements specified for *Chamber internal dimensions, Air flow,* and *Chamber insulation* in appendix A, *Minimum Chamber Requirements,* to ANSI/APSP/ICC-14 2019.


Install the portable electric spa on a platform as specified in Clause 5.1.1(b) and Figure 1 of CSA C374:11 (R2021).


If the portable electric spa can be installed or configured with multiple options of voltage, maximum amperage, or both, use the hierarchy in section 3.1.3.2 of this appendix to determine the configuration for testing.


Use the as-shipped configuration, if such a configuration is provided.


If no configuration is provided in the as-shipped condition, use the option specified in the manufacturer's instructions as the recommended configuration for normal consumer use.


If no configuration is provided in the as-shipped condition and the manufacturer's instructions do not provide a recommended configuration for normal consumer use, use the maximum voltage specified in the manufacturer's installation instructions and maximum amperage that the manufacturer's installation instructions specify for use with the maximum voltage.


Follow the manufacturer's instructions for filling the portable electric spa with water, connecting and/or priming the pump(s), and starting up the spa. After verifying that the spa is operating normally and that all water lines are filled, power off the spa and adjust the fill level as needed to meet the following specifications before starting the test.


If the manufacturer's instructions specify a single fill level, fill to that level with a tolerance of ±0.125 inches.


If the manufacturer's instructions specify a range of fill levels and not a single fill level, fill to the middle of that range with a tolerance of ±0.125 inches.


If the manufacturer's instructions do not specify a fill level or range of fill levels, fill to the halfway point between the bottom of the skimmer opening and the top of the skimmer opening with a tolerance of ±0.125 inches.


If the manufacturer's instructions do not specify a fill level or range of fill levels, and there is no wall skimmer, fill to 6.0 inches ±0.125 inches below the overflow level of the spa.


Measure the volume of water added to the spa with a water meter while filling the spa. Measure any water removed from the spa using a water meter, graduated container, or scale, each with an accuracy of ±2 percent of the quantity measured. The fill volume is the volume of water held by the spa when the spa is filled as specified above.


Install the spa cover following the manufacturer's instructions.


If no cover is designated by the spa manufacturer for use with the spa, cover the portable electric spa with a single layer of 6 mil thickness (0.006 inches; 0.15 mm) plastic film. Cut the plastic to cover the entire top surface of the spa and extend over the edge of the spa approximately 6 inches below the top surface of the spa. Use fasteners or weights to keep the plastic in place during the test, but do not seal the edges of the plastic to the spa (by using tape, for example).


The ambient air temperature measurement point specified in section 5.6.3 of ANSI/APSP/ICC-14 2019 must be located above the center of the spa.


Maintain the ambient air temperature at a maximum of 63.0 °F for the duration of the test. This requirement applies to each individual ambient air temperature measurement taken for the duration of the stabilization period and test period.


Adjust the spa water temperature settings to meet the applicable temperature requirements in section 5.6.1 of ANSI/APSP/ICC-14 2019. The spa water temperature settings must not be adjusted between the start of the stabilizing period specified in section 5.6.1 of ANSI/APSP/ICC-14 2019 and the end of the test period specified in section 5.6.4.7 of ANSI/APSP/ICC-14 2019.


Each individual water temperature measurement taken during the stabilization period and test period must meet the applicable water temperature requirements specified in section 5.6.1 of ANSI/APSP/ICC-14 2019.


Calculate standby loss in watts by calculating the measured standby loss using Equation 1 of this appendix, calculating the measured temperature difference using Equation 2 of this appendix, and normalizing the standby loss using Equation 3 of this appendix. Use the standby loss calculated in Equation 3 as the standby loss value for the test.


46.0 °F for all inflatable spas, standard spas, standard spa portions of a combination spa, exercise spas, and exercise spa portions of a combination spa tested to a minimum water temperature of 100 °F; or 31.0 °F for all exercise spas or exercise spa portions of a combination spa tested to a minimum water temperature of 85 °F.
