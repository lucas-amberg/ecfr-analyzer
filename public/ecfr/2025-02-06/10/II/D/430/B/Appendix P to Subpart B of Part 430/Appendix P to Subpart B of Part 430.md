# Appendix P to Subpart B of Part 430—Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Pool Heaters






1. *Definitions:*

*Active electrical power* means the maximum electrical power consumption in active mode for an electric pool heater.


*Active mode* means the condition during the pool heating season in which the pool heater is connected to the power source, and the main burner, electric resistance element, or heat pump is activated to heat pool water.


*Coefficient of performance (COP),* as applied to heat pump pool heaters, means the ratio of heat output in kW to the total power input in kW.


*Electric heat pump pool heater* means an appliance designed for heating nonpotable water and employing a compressor, water-cooled condenser, and outdoor air coil.


*Electric resistance pool heater* means an appliance designed for heating nonpotable water and employing electric resistance heating elements.


*Fossil fuel-fired pool heater* means an appliance designed for heating nonpotable water and employing gas or oil burners.


*Hybrid pool heater* means an appliance designed for heating nonpotable water and employing both a heat pump (compressor, water-cooled condenser, and outdoor air coil) and a fossil fueled burner as heating sources.


*Input capacity* means the maximum fuel input rate for a fossil fuel-fired pool heater.


*Off mode* means the condition during the pool non-heating season in which the pool heater is connected to the power source, and neither the main burner, nor the electric resistance elements, nor the heat pump is activated, and the seasonal off switch, if present, is in the “off” position.


*Output capacity* for an electric pool or spa heater means the maximum rate at which energy is transferred to the water.


*Seasonal off switch* means a switch that results in different energy consumption in off mode as compared to standby mode.


*Standby mode* means the condition during the pool heating season in which the pool heater is connected to the power source, and neither the main burner, nor the electric resistance elements, nor the heat pump is activated.

3.2 *Standby mode and off mode.* After completing the active mode tests described in sections 3.1 and 4.1 of this appendix, reduce the thermostat setting to a low enough temperature to put the pool heater into standby mode. Reapply the energy sources and operate the pool heater in standby mode for 60 minutes.
