This appendix specifies the test methods required for determining the electrical and photometric performance characteristics of general service fluorescent lamps (GSFLs), incandescent reflector lamps (IRLs), and general service incandescent lamps (GSILs).


2.1 To the extent that definitions in the referenced IES and CIE standards do not conflict with the DOE definitions, the definitions specified in Section 3.0 of IES LM-9-20, Section 3.0 of IES LM-20-20, Section 3.0 of IES LM-45-20, Section 3.0 of IES LM-58-20, and Appendix 1 of CIE 13.3 apply in this appendix.


2.2 *Initial input power* means the input power to the lamp, measured at the end of the lamp seasoning and stabilization.


2.3 *Initial lamp efficacy* means the lamp efficacy (as defined in § 430.2), measured at the end of the lamp seasoning and stabilization.


2.4 *Initial lumen output* means the lumen output of the lamp, measured at the end of the lamp seasoning and stabilization.


2.5 *Time to failure* means the time elapsed between first use and the point at which the lamp ceases to produce measurable lumen output.


3.1 When there is a conflict, the language of the test procedure in this appendix takes precedence over any materials incorporated by reference.


3.2 Maintain lamp operating orientation throughout seasoning and testing, except that for T5 miniature bipin standard and high output GSFLs, follow Section 6.2.2 of IES LM-9-20. For all GSFLs, maintain lamp orientation when transferring lamps from a warm-up position to the photometric equipment per Section 6.2.4 of IES LM-9-20. Maintain lamp orientation at all other times, if practical.


3.3 If a lamp breaks, becomes defective, fails to stabilize, exhibits abnormal behavior (such as swirling), or stops producing light prior to the end of the seasoning period, replace the lamp with a new unit. However, if a lamp exhibits one of the conditions listed in the previous sentence only after the seasoning period ends, include the lamp's measurements in the sample.


3.4 Operate GSILs and IRLs at the rated voltage for incandescent lamps as defined in 10 CFR 430.2.

Operate lamps using high frequency reference ballast settings and without cathode power. Voluntary representations must be in addition to, not instead of, a representation in accordance with sections 1.0 to 4.0 of this appendix for GSFLs. As a best practice, an indication of high frequency operation should be provided with the voluntary representations.
