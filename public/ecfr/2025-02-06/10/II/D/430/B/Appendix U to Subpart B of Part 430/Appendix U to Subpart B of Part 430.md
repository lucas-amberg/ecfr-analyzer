The provisions in this appendix apply to ceiling fans except:


(1) Ceiling fans where the plane of rotation of a ceiling fan's blades is not less than or equal to 45 degrees from horizontal, or cannot be adjusted based on the manufacturer's specifications to be less than or equal to 45 degrees from horizontal;


(2) Centrifugal ceiling fans;


(3) Belt-driven ceiling fans that are not high-speed belt-driven ceiling fans; and


(4) Oscillating ceiling fans.


The test apparatus and test measurement used to determine energy performance depend on the ceiling fan's blade span, and in some cases the ceiling fan's blade edge thickness. For each tested ceiling fan, measure the lateral distance from the center of the axis of rotation of the fan blades to the furthest fan blade edge from the center of the axis of rotation. Measure this lateral distance at the resolution of the measurement instrument, using an instrument with a measurement resolution of least 0.25 inches. Multiply the lateral distance by two and then round to the nearest whole inch to determine the blade span. For ceiling fans having a blade span greater than 18 inches and less than or equal to 84 inches, measure the ceiling fan's blade edge thickness. To measure the fan blade edge thickness, use an instrument with a measurement resolution of at least 0.001 inch and measure the thickness of one fan blade's leading edge (in the forward direction) according to the following:


(1) Locate the cross-section perpendicular to the fan blade's radial length that is at least one inch from the tip of the fan blade and for which the blade is thinnest, and


(2) Measure at the thickest point of that cross-section within one inch from the leading edge of the fan blade.


See Figure 1 of this appendix for an instructional schematic on the fan blade edge thickness measurement. Figure 1 depicts a ceiling fan from above. Round the measured blade edge thickness to the nearest 0.01 inch.


3.1. General instructions.


3.1.1. Record measurements at the resolution of the test instrumentation. Round off calculations to the number of significant digits present at the resolution of the test instrumentation, except for blade span, which is rounded to the nearest inch. Round the final ceiling fan efficiency value to the nearest whole number as follows:


3.1.1.1. A fractional number at or above the midpoint between the two consecutive whole numbers shall be rounded up to the higher of the two whole numbers; or


3.1.1.2. A fractional number below the midpoint between the two consecutive whole numbers shall be rounded down to the lower of the two whole numbers.


3.1.2. For multi-head ceiling fans, the effective blade span is the blade span (as specified in section 3) of an individual fan head, if all fan heads are the same size. If the fan heads are of varying sizes, the effective blade span is the blade span (as specified in section 3) of the largest fan head.


3.2. Test apparatus for low-speed small-diameter and high-speed small-diameter ceiling fans: All instruments are to have accuracies within ±1% of reading, except for the air velocity sensors, which must have accuracies within ±5% of reading or 2 feet per minute (fpm), whichever is greater. Equipment is to be calibrated at least once a year to compensate for variation over time.


3.2.1. *Air Delivery Room Requirements*

(1) The air delivery room dimensions are to be 20 ± 0.75 feet x 20 ± 0.75 feet with an 11 ± 0.75 foot-high ceiling. The control room shall be constructed external to the air delivery room.


(2) The ceiling shall be constructed of sheet rock or stainless plate. The walls must be of adequate thickness to maintain the specified temperature and humidity during the test. The paint used on the walls, as well as the paint used on the ceiling material, must be of a type that minimizes absorption of humidity and that keeps the temperature of the room constant during the test (*e.g.,* oil-based paint).


(3) The room must not have any ventilation other than an air conditioning and return system used to control the temperature and humidity of the room. The construction of the room must ensure consistent air circulation patterns within the room. Vents must have electronically-operated damper doors controllable from a switch outside of the testing room.


3.2.2. *Equipment Set-Up*

(1) Make sure the transformer power is off. Hang the ceiling fan to be tested directly from the ceiling, according to the manufacturer's installation instructions. Hang all non-multi-mount ceiling fans in the fan configuration that minimizes the distance between the ceiling and the lowest point of the fan blades. Hang and test multi-mount fans in two configurations: The configuration associated the definition of a standard fan that minimizes the distance between the ceiling and the lowest point of the fan blades and the configuration associated with the definition of a hugger fan that minimizes the distance between the ceiling and the lowest point of the fan blades. For all tested configurations, measure the distance between the ceiling and the lowest point of the fan blade using an instrument with a measurement resolution of at least 0.25 inches. Round the measured distance from the ceiling to the lowest point of the fan blade to the nearest quarter inch.


(2) Connect wires as directed by manufacturer's wiring instructions. *Note:* Assemble fan prior to the test; lab personnel must follow the instructions provided with the fan by the fan manufacturer. Balance the fan blade assembly in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions to avoid excessive vibration of the motor assembly (at any speed) during operation.


(3) With the ceiling fan installed, adjust the height of the air velocity sensors to ensure the vertical distance between the lowest point on the ceiling fan blades and the air velocity sensors is 43 inches.


(4) A single rotating sensor arm, two rotating sensor arms, or four fixed sensor arms can be used to take air velocity measurements along four axes, labeled A-D. Axes A, B, C, and D are at 0, 90, 180, and 270 degree positions. Axes A-D must be perpendicular to the four walls of the room. See Figure 2 of this appendix.


(5) Minimize the amount of exposed wiring. Store all sensor lead wires under the floor, if possible.


(6) Place the sensors at intervals of 4 ± 0.0625 inches along a sensor arm, starting with the first sensor at the point where the four axes intersect, aligning the sensors perpendicular to the direction of airflow. Do not touch the actual sensor prior to testing. Use enough sensors to record air delivery within a circle 8 inches larger in diameter than the blade span of the ceiling fan being tested. The experimental set-up is shown in Figure 3 of this appendix.


(7) Table 1 of this appendix shows the appropriate number of sensors needed per each of four axes (including the first sensor at the intersection of the axes) for common fan sizes.


(8) Install an RPM (revolutions per minute) meter, or tachometer, to measure RPM of the ceiling fan blades.


(9) Use an RMS sensor capable of measuring power with an accuracy of ±1% to measure ceiling fan power consumption. If the ceiling fan operates on multi-phase power input, measure the active (real) power in all phases simultaneously. Measure test voltage within 6” of the connection supplied with the ceiling fan.


(10) Complete any conditioning instructions provided in the ceiling fan's instruction or installation manual must be completed prior to conducting testing.


3.2.3. *Multi-Head Ceiling Fan Test Set-Up.*

Hang a multi-headed ceiling fan from the ceiling such that one of the ceiling fan heads is centered directly over sensor 1 (*i.e.,* at the intersection of axes A, B, C, and D). The distance between the lowest point any of the fan blades of the centered fan head can reach and the air velocity sensors is to be such that it is the same as for all other small-diameter ceiling fans (*see* Figure 3 of this appendix). If the multi-head ceiling fan has an oscillating function (*i.e.,* the fan heads change their axis of rotation relative to the ceiling) that can be switched off, switch it off prior to taking air velocity measurements. If any multi-head fan does not come with the blades preinstalled, install fan blades only on the fan head that will be directly centered over the intersection of the sensor axes. (Even if the fan heads in a multi-head ceiling fan would typically oscillate when the blades are installed on all fan heads, the ceiling fan is subject to this test procedure if the centered fan head does not oscillate when it is the only fan head with the blades installed.) If the fan blades are preinstalled on all fan heads, measure air velocity in accordance with section 3.3 of this appendix except turn on only the centered fan head. Take the power consumption measurements separately, with the fan blades installed on all fan heads and with any oscillating function, if present, switched on.


3.2.4. Test Set-Up for Ceiling Fans with Airflow Not Directly Downward


For ceiling fans where the airflow is not directly downward, adjust the ceiling fan head such that the airflow is as vertical as possible prior to testing. For ceiling fans where a fully vertical orientation of airflow cannot be achieved, orient the ceiling fan (or fan head, if the ceiling fan is a multi-head fan) such that any remaining tilt is aligned along one of the four sensor axes. Instead of measuring the air velocity for only those sensors directly beneath the ceiling fan, the air velocity is to be measured at all sensors along that axis, as well as the axis oriented 180 degrees with respect to that axis. For example, if the tilt is oriented along axis A, air velocity measurements are to be taken for all sensors along the A-C axis. No measurements would need to be taken along the B-D axis in this case. All other aspects of test set-up remain unchanged from sections 3 through 3.2.2.


3.3. Active mode test measurement for low-speed small-diameter and high-speed small-diameter ceiling fans.


3.3.1. *Test conditions to be followed when testing:*

(1) Maintain the room temperature at 70 degrees ± 5 degrees Fahrenheit and the room humidity at 50% ± 5% relative humidity during the entire test process.


(2) If present, the ceiling fan light fixture is to be installed but turned off during testing.


(3) If present, any additional accessories or features sold with the ceiling fan that do not relate to the ceiling fan's ability to create airflow by rotation of the fan blades (for example light kit, heater, air ionization, ultraviolet technology) is to be installed but turned off during testing. If such an accessory or feature cannot be turned off, it shall be set to the lowest energy-consuming mode during testing. If the ceiling fan is offered with a default controller, test using the default controller. If multiple controllers are offered, test using the minimally functional controller.


(4) If present, turn off any oscillating function causing the axis of rotation of the fan head(s) to change relative to the ceiling during operation prior to taking air velocity measurements. Turn on any oscillating function prior to taking power measurements.


(5) Test ceiling fans rated for operation with only a single- or multi-phase power supply with single- or multi-phase electricity, respectively. Test ceiling fans capable of operating with single- and multi-phase electricity with single-phase electricity. DOE will allow manufacturers of ceiling fans capable of operating with single- and multi-phase electricity to test such fans with single-phase power and make representations of efficiency associated with both single and multi-phase electricity if a manufacturer desires to do so, but the test results in the multi-phase configuration will not be valid to assess compliance with any amended energy conservation standard. All tested power supply should be at 60 Hz.


(6) The supply voltage shall be:


(i) for ceiling fans tested with single-phase electricity, the supply voltage shall be:


(a) 120 V if the ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage is 120 V or the lowest rated voltage range contains 120 V,


(b) 240 V if the ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage is 240 V or the lowest rated voltage range contains 240 V, or


(c) The ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage (if a voltage range is not given) or the mean of the lowest rated voltage range, in all other cases.


(ii) for ceiling fans tested with multi-phase electricity, the supply voltage shall be:


(a) 240 V if the ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage is 240 V or the lowest rated voltage range contains 240 V, or


(b) The ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage (if a voltage range is not given) or the mean of the lowest rated voltage range, in all other cases.


(iii) The test voltage shall not vary by more than ±1% during the tests.


(7) Conduct the test with the fan connected to a supply circuit at the rated frequency.


(8) Measure power input at a point that includes all power-consuming components of the ceiling fan (but without any attached light kit energized; or without any additional accessory or feature energized, if possible; and if not, with the additional accessory or feature set at the lowest energy-consuming mode). If the ceiling fan is offered with a default controller, test using the default controller. If multiple controllers are offered, test using the minimally functional controller.


3.3.2. *Air Velocity and Power Consumption Testing Procedure:*

Measure the air velocity (FPM) and power consumption (W) for HSSD ceiling fans until stable measurements are achieved, measuring at high speed only. Measure the air velocity and power consumption for LSSD and VSD ceiling fans that also meet the definition of an LSSD fan until stable measurements are achieved, measuring first at low speed and then at high speed. To determine low speed, start measurements at the lowest available speed and move to the next highest speed until the low speed definition in section 1.13 of this appendix is met. Air velocity and power consumption measurements are considered stable for high speed if:


(1) The average air velocity for each sensor varies by less than 5 percent or 2 FPM, whichever is greater, compared to the average air velocity measured for that same sensor in a successive set of air velocity measurements, and


(2) Average power consumption varies by less than 1 percent in a successive set of power consumption measurements.


(a) Air velocity and power consumption measurements are considered stable for low speed if:


(1) The average air velocity for each sensor varies by less than 10 percent or 2 FPM, whichever is greater, compared to the average air velocity measured for that same sensor in a successive set of air velocity measurements, and


(2) Average power consumption varies by less than 1 percent in a successive set of power consumption measurements.


(b) These stability criteria are applied differently to ceiling fans with airflow not directly downward. *See* section 3.3.3 of this appendix.


*Step 1:* Set the first sensor arm (if using four fixed arms), two sensor arm (if using a two-arm rotating setup), or single sensor arm (if using a single-arm rotating setup) to the 0 degree Position (Axis A). If necessary, use a marking as reference. If using a single-arm rotating setup or two-arm rotating setup, adjust the sensor arm alignment until it is at the 0 degree position by remotely controlling the antenna rotator.


*Step 2:* Set software up to read and record air velocity, expressed in feet per minute (FPM) in 1 second intervals. (Temperature does not need to be recorded in 1 second intervals.) Record current barometric pressure.


*Step 3:* Allow test fan to run 15 minutes at rated voltage and at high speed if the ceiling fan is an HSSD ceiling fan. If the ceiling fan is an LSSD or VSD ceiling fan that also meets the definition of an LSSD fan, allow the test fan to run 15 minutes at the rated voltage and at the lowest available ceiling fan speed. Turn off all forced-air environmental conditioning equipment entering the chamber (*e.g.,* air conditioning), close all doors and vents, and wait an additional 3 minutes prior to starting test session.


*Step 4a:* For a rotating sensor arm: Begin recording readings. Starting with Axis A, take 100 air velocity readings (100 seconds run-time) and record these data. For all fans except multi-head fans and fans capable of oscillating, also measure power during the interval that air velocity measurements are taken. Record the average value of the air velocity readings for each sensor in feet per minute (FPM). Determine if the readings meet the low speed definition as defined in section 1.13 of this appendix. If not, restart Step 4a at the next highest speed until the low-speed definition is met. Once the low speed definition is met, rotate the arm, stabilize the arm, and allow 30 seconds to allow the arm to stop oscillating. Repeat data recording and rotation process for Axes B, C, and D. Step 4a is complete when the readings for all axes meet the low speed definition at the same speed. Save the data for all axes only for those measurements that meet the low speed definition. Using the measurements applicable to low speed, record the average value of the power measurement in watts (W) (400 readings). Record the average value of the air velocity readings for each sensor in feet per minute (FPM) (400 readings).


*Step 4b:* For a two-arm rotating setup: Begin recording readings. Starting with Axes A and C, take 100 air velocity readings (100 seconds run-time) for both axes and record these data. For all fans except multi-head fans and fans capable of oscillating, also measure power during the interval that air velocity measurements are taken. Record the average value of the air velocity readings for each sensor in feet per minute (FPM). Determine if the readings meet the low speed definition as defined in section 1.13 of this appendix. If not, restart Step 4b at the next highest speed until the low speed definition is met. Once the low speed definition is met, rotate the two-arm, stabilize the arm, and allow 30 seconds to allow the arm to stop oscillating. Repeat data recording for Axes B and D. Step 4b is complete when the readings for all axes meet the low speed definition at the same speed. Save the data for all axes only for those measurements that meet the low speed definition. Using the measurements applicable to low speed, record the average value of the power measurement in watts (W) (200 readings). Record the average value of the air velocity readings for each sensor in feet per minute (FPM) (200 readings).


*Step 4c:* For four fixed sensor arms: Begin recording readings. Take 100 air velocity readings (100 seconds run-time) and record this data. Take the readings for all sensor arms (Axes A, B, C, and D) simultaneously. For all fans except multi-head fans and fans capable of oscillating, also measure power during the interval that air velocity measurements are taken. Record the average value of the air velocity readings for each sensor in feet per minute (FPM). Determine if the readings meet the low speed definition as defined in section 1.13 of this appendix. If not, restart Step 4c at the next highest speed until the low speed definition is met. Step 4c is complete when the readings for all axes meet the low speed definition at the same speed. Save the data for all axes only for those measurements that meet the low speed definition. Using the measurements applicable to low speed, record the average value of the power measurement in watts (W) (100 readings). Record the average value of the air velocity readings for each sensor in feet per minute (FPM) (100 readings).


*Step 5:* Repeat step 4a, 4b or 4c until stable measurements are achieved.


*Step 6:* Repeat steps 1 through 5 above on high speed for LSSD and VSD ceiling fans that also meet the definition of an LSSD fan. Note: Ensure that temperature and humidity readings are maintained within the required tolerances for the duration of the test (all tested speeds). Forced-air environmental conditioning equipment may be used and doors and vents may be opened between test sessions to maintain environmental conditions.


*Step 7:* If testing a multi-mount ceiling fan, repeat steps 1 through 6 with the ceiling fan in the ceiling fan configuration (associated with either hugger or standard ceiling fans) not already tested.


If a multi-head ceiling fan includes more than one category of ceiling fan head, then test at least one of each unique category. A fan head with different construction that could affect air movement or power consumption, such as housing, blade pitch, or motor, would constitute a different category of fan head.


*Step 8:* For multi-head ceiling fans, measure active (real) power consumption in all phases simultaneously at each speed continuously for 100 seconds with all fan heads turned on, and record the average value at each speed in watts (W).


For ceiling fans with an oscillating function, measure active (real) power consumption in all phases simultaneously at each speed continuously for 100 seconds with the oscillating function turned on. Record the average value of the power measurement in watts (W).


For both multi-head ceiling fans and fans with an oscillating function, repeat power consumption measurement until stable power measurements are achieved.


3.3.3. *Air Velocity Measurements for Ceiling Fans with Airflow Not Directly Downward:*

Using the number of sensors that cover the same diameter as if the airflow were directly downward, record air velocity at each speed from the same number of continuous sensors with the largest air velocity measurements. This continuous set of sensors must be along the axis that the ceiling fan tilt is directed in (and along the axis that is 180 degrees from the first axis). For example, a 42-inch fan tilted toward axis A may create the pattern of air velocity shown in Figure 4 of this appendix. As shown in Table 1 of this appendix, a 42-inch fan would normally require 7 active sensors per axis. However, because the fan is not directed downward, all sensors must record data. In this case, because the set of sensors corresponding to maximum air velocity are centered 3 sensor positions away from the sensor 1 along the A axis, substitute the air velocity at A axis sensor 4 for the average air velocity at sensor 1. Take the average of the air velocity at A axis sensors 3 and 5 as a substitute for the average air velocity at sensor 2, take the average of the air velocity at A axis sensors 2 and 6 as a substitute for the average air velocity at sensor 3, etc. Lastly, take the average of the air velocities at A axis sensor 10 and C axis sensor 4 as a substitute for the average air velocity at sensor 7. Stability criteria apply after these substitutions. For example, air velocity stability at sensor 7 are determined based on the average of average air velocity at A axis sensor 10 and C axis sensor 4 in successive measurements. Any air velocity measurements made along the B-D axis are not included in the calculation of average air velocity.


3.4. *Test apparatus for large-diameter ceiling fans and high-speed belt-driven ceiling fans:*

The test apparatus and instructions for testing large-diameter ceiling fans and HSBD ceiling fans must conform to the requirements specified in Sections 3 through 7 (including Test Figure 1) of AMCA 230-15, with the following modifications:


3.4.1. A “ceiling fan” is defined as in 10 CFR 430.2.


3.4.2. Test ceiling fans rated for operation with only a single- or multi-phase power supply with single- or multi-phase electricity, respectively. Test ceiling fans capable of operating with single- and multi-phase electricity with multi-phase electricity. DOE will allow manufacturers of ceiling fans capable of operating with single- and multi-phase electricity to test such fans with single-phase power and make representations of efficiency associated with both single and multi-phase electricity if a manufacturer desires to do so, but the test results in the single-phase configuration will not be valid to assess compliance with any amended energy conservation standard. All tested power supply should be at 60 Hz.


3.4.3. Supply Voltage:


(1) For ceiling fans tested with single-phase electricity, the supply voltage shall be:


(a) 120 V if the ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage is 120 V or the lowest rated voltage range contains 120 V,


(b) 240 V if the ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage is 240 V or the lowest rated voltage range contains 240 V, or


(c) The ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage (if a voltage range is not given) or the mean of the lowest rated voltage range, in all other cases.


(2) For ceiling fans tested with multi-phase electricity, the supply voltage shall be:


(a) 240 V if the ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage is 240 V or the lowest rated voltage range contains 240 V, or


(b) The ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage (if a voltage range is not given) or the mean of the lowest rated voltage range, in all other cases.


3.5. *Active mode test measurement for large-diameter ceiling fans and high-speed belt-driven ceiling fans:*

(1) Test large-diameter ceiling fans and high-speed belt-driven ceiling fans in accordance with AMCA 208-18, in all phases simultaneously at:


(a) High speed, and


(b) 40 percent or the nearest speed that is not less than 40 percent speed.


(2) When testing at 40 percent speed for large-diameter ceiling fans that can operate over an infinite number of speeds (*e.g.,* ceiling fans with VFDs), ensure the average measured RPM is within the greater of 1 percent of the average RPM at high speed or 1 RPM. For example, if the average measured RPM at high speed is 50 RPM, for testing at 40 percent speed, the average measured RPM should be between 19 RPM and 21 RPM. If the average measured RPM falls outside of this tolerance, adjust the ceiling fan speed and repeat the test. Calculate the airflow and measure the active (real) power consumption in all phases simultaneously in accordance with the test requirements specified in Sections 8 and 9, AMCA 230-15, with the following modifications:


3.5.1. Measure active (real) power consumption in all phases simultaneously at a point that includes all power-consuming components of the ceiling fan. If present, any additional accessories or features sold with the ceiling fan that do not relate to the ceiling fan's ability to create airflow by rotation of the fan blades (for example light kit, heater, air ionization, ultraviolet technology) are to be installed but turned off during testing. If the accessory/feature cannot be turned off, it shall be set to the lowest energy-consuming mode during testing. If the ceiling fan is offered with a default controller, test using the default controller. If multiple controllers are offered, test using the minimally functional controller.


3.5.2. Measure active (real) power consumption in all phases simultaneously continuously at the rated voltage that represents normal operation over the time period for which the load differential test is conducted.


3.6. *Test measurement for standby power consumption.*

(1) Measure standby power consumption if the ceiling fan offers one or more of the following user-oriented or protective functions:


(a) The ability to facilitate the activation or deactivation of other functions (including active mode) by remote switch (including remote control), internal sensor, or timer.


(b) Continuous functions, including information or status displays (including clocks), or sensor-based functions.


(2) Measure standby power consumption after completion of active mode testing and after the active mode functionality has been switched off (*i.e.,* the rotation of the ceiling fan blades is no longer energized). The ceiling fan must remain connected to the main power supply and be in the same configuration as in active mode (*i.e.,* any ceiling fan light fixture should still be attached). Measure standby power consumption according to Sections 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.4, and 5.3.1 through 5.3.2, of IEC 62301 with the following modifications:


3.6.1. Allow 3 minutes between switching off active mode functionality and beginning the standby power test. (No additional time before measurement is required.)


3.6.2. Simultaneously in all phases, measure active (real) power consumption continuously for 100 seconds, and record the average value of the standby power measurement in watts (W).


3.6.3. Determine power consumption according to section 5.3.2 of IEC 62301, or by using the following average reading method. Note that a shorter measurement period may be possible using the sample method in section 5.3.2 of IEC 62301.


(1) Connect the product to the power supply and power measuring instrument.


(2) Select the mode to be measured (which may require a sequence of operations and could require waiting for the product to automatically enter the desired mode) and then monitor the power.


(3) Calculate the average power using either the average power method or the accumulated energy method. For the average power method, where the power measuring instrument can record true average power over an operator selected period, the average power is taken directly from the power measuring instrument. For the accumulated energy method, determine the average power by dividing the measured energy by the time for the monitoring period. Use units of watt-hours and hours for both methods to determine average power in watts.


4.1. Calculation of effective area for small-diameter ceiling fans other than high-speed belt-driven ceiling fans:


Calculate the effective area corresponding to each sensor used in the test method for small-diameter ceiling fans other than high-speed belt-driven ceiling fans (section 3.3 of this appendix) with the following equations:


(1) For sensor 1, the sensor located directly underneath the center of the ceiling fan, the effective width of the circle is 2 inches, and the effective area is:


(2) For the sensors between sensor 1 and the last sensor used in the measurement, the effective area has a width of 4 inches. If a sensor is a distance *d,* in inches, from sensor 1, then the effective area is:


(3) For the last sensor, the width of the effective area depends on the horizontal displacement between the last sensor and the point on the ceiling fan blades furthest radially from the center of the fan. The total area included in an airflow calculation is the area of a circle 8 inches larger in diameter than the ceiling fan blade span (as specified in section 3 of this appendix).


Therefore, for example, for a 42-inch ceiling fan, the last sensor is 3 inches beyond the end of the ceiling fan blades. Because only the area within 4 inches of the end of the ceiling fan blades is included in the airflow calculation, the effective width of the circle corresponding to the last sensor would be 3 inches. The calculation for the effective area corresponding to the last sensor would then be:


For a 46-inch ceiling fan, the effective area of the last sensor would have a width of 5 inches, and the effective area would be:


4.2 Calculation of airflow and efficiency for small-diameter ceiling fans other than high-speed belt-driven ceiling fans:


Calculate fan airflow using the overall average of both sets of air velocity measurements at each sensor position from the successive sets of measurements that meet the stability criteria from section 3.3 of this appendix. To calculate airflow for HSSD, LSSD, and VSD ceiling fans, multiply the overall average air velocity at each sensor position from section 3.3 (for high speed for HSSD, LSSD, and VSD ceiling fans that also meet the definition of an LSSD ceiling fan; and repeated for low speed only for LSSD and VSD ceiling fans that also meet the definition of an LSSD ceiling fan) by that sensor's effective area (see section 4.1 of this appendix), and then sum the products to obtain the overall calculated airflow at the tested speed.


For each speed, using the overall calculated airflow and the overall average power consumption measurements from the successive sets of measurements as follows:


Calculate two ceiling fan efficiencies for multi-mount ceiling fans: One efficiency corresponds to the ceiling fan mounted in the configuration associated with the definition of a hugger ceiling fan, and the other efficiency corresponds to the ceiling fan mounted in the configuration associated with the definition of a standard ceiling fan.


4.3 Calculation of airflow and efficiency for multi-head ceiling fans:


Calculate airflow for each fan head using the method described in section 4.2 of this appendix. To calculate overall airflow at a given speed for a multi-head ceiling fan, sum the airflow for each fan head included in the ceiling fan (a single airflow can be applied to each of the identical fan heads, but at least one of each unique fan head must be tested). The power consumption is the measured power consumption with all fan heads on. Using the airflow as described in this section, and power consumption measurements from section 3.3 of this appendix, calculate ceiling fan efficiency for a multi-head ceiling fan as follows:


Calculate CFEI, which is the FEI for large-diameter ceiling fans and high-speed belt-driven ceiling fans, at the speeds specified in section 3.5 of this appendix according to AMCA 208-18, with the following modifications:


(1) Using an Airflow Constant (Q_0_) of 26,500 cubic feet per minute;


(2) Using a Pressure Constant (P_0_) of 0.0027 inches water gauge; and


(3) Using a Fan Efficiency Constant (η_0_) of 42 percent.
