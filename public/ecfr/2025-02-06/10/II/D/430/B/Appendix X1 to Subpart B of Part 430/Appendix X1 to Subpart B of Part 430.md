This appendix covers the test requirements used to measure the energy performance of dehumidifiers.








Definitions for terms, modes, calculations, etc. are in accordance with AHAM DH-1-2022, section 3, with the following added definitions:


*Energy factor for dehumidifiers* means a measure of energy efficiency of a dehumidifier calculated by dividing the water removed from the air by the energy consumed, measured in liters per kilowatt-hour (L/kWh).


*External static pressure (ESP)* means the process air outlet static pressure minus the process air inlet static pressure, measured in inches of water column (in. w.c.).


*Process air* means the air supplied to the dehumidifier from the dehumidified space and discharged to the dehumidified space after some of the moisture has been removed by means of the refrigeration system.


*Product capacity* for dehumidifiers means a measure of the ability of the dehumidifier to remove moisture from its surrounding atmosphere, measured in pints collected per 24 hours of operation under the specified ambient conditions.


*Product case volume* for whole-home dehumidifiers means a measure of the rectangular volume that the product case occupies, exclusive of any duct attachment collars or other external components.


*Reactivation air* means the air drawn from unconditioned space to remove moisture from the desiccant wheel of a refrigerant-desiccant dehumidifier and discharged to unconditioned space.




3.1 *Active mode.*

3.1.1 *Portable dehumidifiers and whole-home dehumidifiers other than refrigerant-desiccant dehumidifiers.* The test apparatus and instructions for testing in dehumidification mode and off-cycle mode must conform to the requirements specified in Section 4, “Instrumentation,” section 5.1, “General,” section 5.2, “Test Room,” Section 5.3, “Positioning of Test Unit,” and section 5.5, “Control settings” of AHAM DH-1-2022, with the following exceptions. If a product is able to operate as either a portable or whole-home dehumidifier by means of removal or installation of an optional ducting kit, in accordance with any manufacturer instructions available to a consumer, test and rate both configurations.




3.1.1.1 *Testing configuration for whole-home dehumidifiers other than refrigerant-desiccant dehumidifiers.* Test dehumidifiers, other than refrigerant-desiccant dehumidifiers, with ducting attached to the process air outlet port. The duct configuration and component placement must conform to the requirements specified in section 3.1.3 of this appendix and Figure 1 or Figure 3, except that the flow straightener and dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity instruments are not required. Maintain the external static pressure in the process air flow and measure the external static pressure as specified in section 3.1.2.2.3.1 of this appendix.




3.1.1.2 *Instrumentation placement.* If using a sampling tree, follow the instrumentation placement instructions in sections 5.3 and 8.4 of AHAM DH-1-2022. If not using a sampling tree, place the aspirating psychrometer or relative humidity and dry-bulb temperature sensors perpendicular to, and 1 ft. in front of, the center of the process air intake grille. During each test, use the psychrometer or relative humidity and dry-bulb sensors to monitor inlet conditions of only one unit under test. When using relative humidity and dry-bulb temperature sensors without sampling trees to test a unit that has multiple process air intake grilles, place a relative humidity sensor and dry-bulb temperature sensor perpendicular to, and 1 ft. in front of, the center of each process air intake grille.




3.1.1.3 *Condensate collection.* If means are provided on the dehumidifier for draining condensate away from the cabinet, collect the condensate in a substantially closed vessel to prevent re-evaporation and place the vessel on the weight-measuring instrument. If no means for draining condensate away from the cabinet are provided, disable any automatic shutoff of dehumidification mode operation that is activated when the collection container is full and collect any overflow in a pan. Select a collection pan large enough to ensure that all water that overflows from the full internal collection container during the rating test period is captured by the collection pan. Cover the pan as much as possible to prevent re-evaporation without impeding the collection of overflow water. Place both the dehumidifier and the overflow pan on the weight-measuring instrument for direct reading of the condensate weight collected during the rating test. Do not use any internal pump to drain the condensate into a substantially closed vessel unless such pump operation is provided for by default in dehumidification mode.






3.1.1.4 *Control settings.* Follow the control settings instructions in section 5.5 of AHAM DH-1-2022.




3.1.1.5 *Run-in period.* Perform a single run-in period during which the compressor operates for a cumulative total of at least 24 hours prior to dehumidification mode testing.


3.1.2 *Refrigerant-desiccant dehumidifiers.* The test apparatus and instructions for testing refrigerant-desiccant dehumidifiers in dehumidification mode must conform to the requirements specified in section 3, “Definitions,” section 4, “Instrumentation,” and section 5.1, “General,” section 5.2, “Test Room,” and section 5.5, “Control settings,” of AHAM DH-1-2022, except as follows.






3.1.2.1 *Testing configuration.* Test refrigerant-desiccant dehumidifiers with ducting attached to the process air inlet and outlet ports and the reactivation air inlet port. The duct configuration and components must conform to the requirements specified in section 3.1.3 of this appendix and Figure 1 through Figure 3. Install a cell-type airflow straightener that conforms to the specifications in Section 5.2.1.6, “Airflow straightener”, and Figure 6A, “Flow Straightener—Cell Type”, of ANSI/AMCA 210 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3) in each duct consistent with Figure 1 through Figure 3.


3.1.2.2 *Instrumentation.*

3.1.2.2.1 *Temperature.* Install dry-bulb temperature sensors in a grid centered in the duct, with the plane of the grid perpendicular to the axis of the duct. Determine the number and locations of the sensors within the grid according to Section 5.3.5, “Centers of Segments—Grids,” of ANSI/ASHRAE 41.1 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3).


3.1.2.2.2 *Relative humidity.* Measure relative humidity with a duct-mounted, relative humidity sensor with an accuracy within ±1 percent relative humidity. Place the relative humidity sensor at the duct centerline within 1 inch of the dry-bulb temperature grid plane.


3.1.2.2.3 *Pressure.* The pressure instruments used to measure the external static pressure and velocity pressures must have an accuracy within ±0.01 in. w.c. and a resolution of no more than 0.01 in. w.c.


*3.1.2.2.3.1 External static pressure.* Measure static pressures in each duct using pitot-static tube traverses, a flow nozzle or a bank of flow nozzles. For pitot-static tube traverses, conform to the specifications in section 4.3.1, “Pitot Traverse,” of ANSI/AMCA 210 and section 4.2.2, “Pitot-Static Tube,” of ANSI/AMCA 210, except use only two intersecting and perpendicular rows of pitot-static tube traverses. For a flow nozzle or bank of flow nozzles, conform to the specifications in section 4.3.2, “Flow nozzle,” of ANSI/AMCA 210 and section 4.2.3, “Static pressure tap” of ANSI/AMCA 210. Record the static pressure within the test duct as follows. When using pitot-static tube traverses, record the pressure as measured at the pressure tap in the manifold of the traverses that averages the individual static pressures at each pitot-static tube. When using a flow nozzle or bank of nozzles, record the pressure or in accordance with section 4.2.3.2, “Averaging,” of ANSI/AMCA 210. Calculate duct pressure losses between the unit under test and the plane of each static pressure measurement in accordance with section 7.5.2, “Pressure Losses,” of ANSI/AMCA 210. The external static pressure is the difference between the measured inlet and outlet static pressure measurements, minus the sum of the inlet and outlet duct pressure losses. For any port with no duct attached, use a static pressure of 0.00 in. w.c. with no duct pressure loss in the calculation of external static pressure. During dehumidification mode testing, the external static pressure must equal 0.20 in. w.c. ± 0.02 in. w.c.




*3.1.2.2.3.2 Velocity pressure.* Measure velocity pressures using the same pitot traverses or nozzles as used for measuring external static pressure, which are specified in section 3.1.2.2.3.1 of this appendix. When using pitot-static tube traverses, determine velocity pressures at each pitot-static tube in a traverse as the difference between the pressure at the impact pressure tap and the pressure at the static pressure tap and calculate volumetric flow rates in each duct in accordance with section 7.3.1, “Velocity Traverse,” of ANSI/AMCA 210. When using a flow nozzle or a bank of flow nozzles, calculate the volumetric flow rates in each duct in accordance with section 7.3.2, “Nozzle,” of ANSI/AMCA 210.




3.1.2.2.4 *Weight.* No weight-measuring instruments are required.




3.1.2.3 *Control settings.* Follow the control settings instructions in section 5.5 of AHAM DH-1-2022.




3.1.2.4 *Run-in period.* Perform a single run-in period during which the compressor operates for a cumulative total of at least 24 hours prior to dehumidification mode testing.


3.1.3 *Ducting for whole-home dehumidifiers.* Cover and seal with tape any port designed for intake of air from outside or unconditioned space, other than for supplying reactivation air for refrigerant-desiccant dehumidifiers. Use only ducting constructed of galvanized mild steel and with a 10-inch diameter. Position inlet and outlet ducts either horizontally or vertically to accommodate the default dehumidifier port orientation. Install all ducts with the axis of the section interfacing with the dehumidifier perpendicular to plane of the collar to which each is attached. If manufacturer-recommended collars do not measure 10 inches in diameter, use transitional pieces to connect the ducts to the collars. The transitional pieces must not contain any converging element that forms an angle with the duct axis greater than 7.5 degrees or a diverging element that forms an angle with the duct axis greater than 3.5 degrees. Install mechanical throttling devices in each outlet duct consistent with Figure 1 and Figure 3 to adjust the external static pressure and in the inlet reactivation air duct for a refrigerant-desiccant dehumidifier. Cover the ducts with thermal insulation having a minimum R value of 6 h-ft
2 − °F/Btu (1.1 m
2 − K/W). Seal seams and edges with tape.


3.1.4 *Recording and rounding.* When testing either a portable dehumidifier or a whole-home dehumidifier, record measurements at the resolution of the test instrumentation. Record measurements for portable dehumidifiers and whole-home dehumidifiers other than refrigerant-desiccant dehumidifiers at intervals no greater than 10 minutes. Record measurements for refrigerant-desiccant dehumidifiers at intervals no greater than 1 minute. Round off calculations to the same number of significant digits as the previous step. Round the final product capacity, energy factor and integrated energy factor values to two decimal places, and for whole-home dehumidifiers, round the final product case volume to one decimal place.


3.2 *Inactive mode and off mode.*

3.2.1 *Installation requirements.* For the inactive mode and off mode testing, install the dehumidifier in accordance with Section 5, Paragraph 5.2 of IEC 62301 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3), disregarding the provisions regarding batteries and the determination, classification, and testing of relevant modes.


3.2.2 *Electrical energy supply.*
