# ยง 430.35   Petitions with respect to general service lamps.

(a) Any person may petition the Secretary for an exemption for a type of general service lamp from the requirements of this subpart. The Secretary may grant an exemption only to the extent that the Secretary finds, after a hearing and opportunity for public comment, that it is not technically feasible to serve a specialized lighting application (such as a military, medical, public safety or certified historic lighting application) using a lamp that meets the requirements of this subpart. To grant an exemption for a product under this paragraph, the Secretary shall include, as an additional criterion, that the exempted product is unlikely to be used in a general service lighting application.


(b) Any person may petition the Secretary to establish standards for lamp shapes or bases that are excluded from the definition of general service lamps. The petition shall include evidence that the availability or sales of exempted lamps have increased significantly since December 19, 2007. The Secretary shall grant a petition if the Secretary finds that:


(1) The petition presents evidence that demonstrates that commercial availability or sales of exempted incandescent lamp types have increased significantly since December 19, 2007 and are being widely used in general lighting applications; and


(2) Significant energy savings could be achieved by covering exempted products, as determined by the Secretary based on sales data provided to the Secretary from manufacturers and importers.
