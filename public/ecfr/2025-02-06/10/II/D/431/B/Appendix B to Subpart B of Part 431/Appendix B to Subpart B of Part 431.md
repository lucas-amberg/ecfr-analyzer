# Appendix B to Subpart B of Part 431—Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Efficiency of Electric Motors


For any other electric motor that is not currently covered by the energy conservation standards at § 431.25, manufacturers of this equipment must test in accordance with this appendix 180 days after the effective date of the final rule adopting energy conservation standards for such motor. For any other electric motor that is not currently covered by the energy conservation standards at § 431.25, manufacturers choosing to make any representations respecting of energy efficiency for such motors must test in accordance with this appendix.


In § 431.15, DOE incorporated by reference the entire standard for CSA C390-10, CSA C747-09, IEC 60034-1:2010, IEC 60034-2-1:2014, IEC 60051-1:2016, IEC 61800-9-2:2017, IEEE 112-2017, IEEE 114-2010, and NEMA MG 1-2016; however, only enumerated provisions of those documents are applicable as follows. In cases where there is a conflict, the language of this appendix takes precedence over those documents. Any subsequent amendment to a referenced document by the standard-setting organization will not affect the test procedure in this appendix, unless and until the test procedure is amended by DOE.

2.4. Test Procedures for Electric Motors that are Synchronous Motors and Inverter-only Electric Motors


Section 2.4.1 of this appendix applies to electric motors that are synchronous motors that do not require an inverter to operate. Sections 2.4.2. and 2.4.3. of this appendix apply to electric motors that are synchronous motors and are inverter-only; and to induction electric motors that are inverter-only electric motors.


2.4.1. The efficiencies and losses of electric motors that are synchronous motors that do not require an inverter to operate, are determined in accordance with IEC 60034-2-1:2014, Section 3 “Terms and definitions,” Section 4 “Symbols and abbreviations,” Section 5 “Basic requirements,” and Section 7.1. “Preferred Testing Methods.”


2.4.2. The efficiencies and losses of electric motors (inclusive of the inverter) that are that are inverter-only and do not include an inverter, are determined in accordance with IEC 61800-9-2:2017. Test must be conducted using an inverter that is listed as recommended in the manufacturer's catalog or that is offered for sale with the electric motor. If more than one inverter is available in manufacturer's catalogs or if more than one inverter is offered for sale with the electric motor, test using the least efficient inverter. Record the manufacturer, brand and model number of the inverter used for the test. If there are no inverters specified in the manufacturer catalogs or offered for sale with the electric motor, testing must be conducted using an inverter that meets the criteria described in section 2.4.2.2. of this appendix.


2.4.2.1. The inverter shall be set up according to the manufacturer's instructional and operational manual included with the product. Manufacturers shall also record switching frequency in Hz, max frequency in Hz, Max output voltage in V, motor control method (*i.e.,* V/f ratio, sensor less vector, etc.), load profile setting (constant torque, variable torque, etc.), and saving energy mode (if used). Deviation from the resulting settings, such as switching frequency or load torque curves for the purpose of optimizing test results shall not be permitted.


2.4.2.2. If there are no inverters specified in the manufacturer catalogs or offered for sale with the electric motor, test with a two-level voltage source inverter. No additional components influencing output voltage or output current shall be installed between the inverter and the motor, except those required for the measuring instruments. For motors with a rated speed up to 3 600 min-1, the switching frequency shall not be higher than 5 kHz. For motors with a rated speed above 3 600 min-1, the switching frequency shall not be higher than 10 kHz. Record the manufacturer, brand and model number of the inverter used for the test.


2.4.3. The efficiencies and losses of electric motors (inclusive of the inverter) that are inverter-only and include an inverter are determined in accordance with IEC 61800-9-2:2017.


2.4.3.1. The inverter shall be set up according to the manufacturer's instructional and operational manual included with the product. Manufacturers shall also record switching frequency in Hz, max frequency in Hz, Max output voltage in V, motor control method (*i.e.,* V/f ratio, sensor less vector, etc.), load profile setting (constant torque, variable torque, etc.), and saving energy mode (if used). Deviation from the resulting settings, such as switching frequency or load torque curves for the purpose of optimizing test results shall not be permitted.


Prior to testing according to section 2 of this appendix, each basic model of the electric motor categories listed below must be set up in accordance with the instructions of this section to ensure consistent test results. These steps are designed to enable a motor to be attached to a dynamometer and run continuously for testing purposes. For the purposes of this appendix, a “standard bearing” is a 600- or 6000-series, either open or grease-lubricated double-shielded, single-row, deep groove, radial ball bearing.


3.1. Brake Electric Motors:


Brake electric motors shall be tested with the brake component powered separately from the motor such that it does not activate during testing. Additionally, for any 10-minute period during the test and while the brake is being powered such that it remains disengaged from the motor shaft, record the power consumed (*i.e.,* watts). Only power used to drive the motor is to be included in the efficiency calculation; power supplied to prevent the brake from engaging is not included in this calculation. In lieu of powering the brake separately, the brake may be disengaged mechanically, if such a mechanism exists and if the use of this mechanism does not yield a different efficiency value than separately powering the brake electrically.


3.2. Close-Coupled Pump Electric Motors and Electric Motors with Single or Double Shaft Extensions of Non-Standard Dimensions or Design:


To attach the unit under test to a dynamometer, close-coupled pump electric motors and electric motors with single or double shaft extensions of non-standard dimensions or design must be tested using a special coupling adapter.


3.3. Electric Motors with Non-Standard Endshields or Flanges:


If it is not possible to connect the electric motor to a dynamometer with the non-standard endshield or flange in place, the testing laboratory shall replace the non-standard endshield or flange with an endshield or flange meeting NEMA or IEC specifications. The replacement component should be obtained from the manufacturer or, if the manufacturer chooses, machined by the testing laboratory after consulting with the manufacturer regarding the critical characteristics of the endshield.


3.4. Electric Motors with Non-Standard Bases, Feet or Mounting Configurations:


An electric motor with a non-standard base, feet, or mounting configuration may be mounted on the test equipment using adaptive fixtures for testing as long as the mounting or use of adaptive mounting fixtures does not have an adverse impact on the performance of the electric motor, particularly on the cooling of the motor.


3.5. Electric Motors with a Separately-Powered Blower:


For electric motors furnished with a separately-powered blower, the losses from the blower's motor should not be included in any efficiency calculation. This can be done either by powering the blower's motor by a source separate from the source powering the electric motor under test or by connecting leads such that they only measure the power of the motor under test.


3.6. Immersible Electric Motors:


Immersible electric motors shall be tested with all contact seals removed but be otherwise unmodified.


3.7. Partial Electric Motors:


Partial electric motors shall be disconnected from their mated piece of equipment. After disconnection from the equipment, standard bearings and/or endshields shall be added to the motor, such that it is capable of operation. If an endshield is necessary, an endshield meeting NEMA or IEC specifications should be obtained from the manufacturer or, if the manufacturer chooses, machined by the testing laboratory after consulting with the manufacturer regarding the critical characteristics of the endshield.


3.8. Vertical Electric Motors and Electric Motors with Bearings Incapable of Horizontal Operation:


Vertical electric motors and electric motors with thrust bearings shall be tested in a horizontal or vertical configuration in accordance with the applicable test procedure under section 2 through section 2.4.3. of this appendix, depending on the testing facility's capabilities and construction of the motor, except if the motor is a vertical solid shaft normal thrust general purpose electric motor (subtype II), in which case it shall be tested in a horizontal configuration in accordance with the applicable test procedure under section 2 through section 2.4.3. of this appendix. Preference shall be given to testing a motor in its native orientation. If the unit under test cannot be reoriented horizontally due to its bearing construction, the electric motor's bearing(s) shall be removed and replaced with standard bearings. If the unit under test contains oil-lubricated bearings, its bearings shall be removed and replaced with standard bearings. If necessary, the unit under test may be connected to the dynamometer using a coupling of torsional rigidity greater than or equal to that of the motor shaft.
