2. Name(s) to be Marked on Electric Motors to Which this Compliance Certification Applies:


3. If manufacturer or private labeler wishes to receive a unique Compliance Certification number for use with any particular brand name, trademark, or other label name, fill out the following two items:


A. List each brand name, trademark, or other label name for which the company requests a Compliance Certification number:


B. List other name(s), if any, under which the company sells electric motors (if not listed in item 2 above):


Submit electronically at *https://www.regulations.doe.gov/ccms.*

*Submit paper form by Certified Mail to:* U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Building Technologies (EE-2J), Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585-0121.


This Compliance Certification reports on and certifies compliance with requirements contained in 10 CFR Part 431 (Energy Conservation Program for Certain Commercial and Industrial Equipment) and Part C of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (Pub. L. 94-163), and amendments thereto. It is signed by a responsible official of the above named company. Attached and incorporated as part of this Compliance Certification is a Listing of Electric Motor Efficiencies. For each rating of electric motor* for which the Listing specifies the nominal full load efficiency of a basic model, the company distributes no less efficient basic model with that rating and all basic models with that rating comply with the applicable energy efficiency standard.


* For this purpose, the term “rating” means one of the combinations of an electric motor's horsepower (or standard kilowatt equivalent), number of poles, motor type, and open or enclosed construction, with respect to which § 431.25 of 10 CFR Part 431 prescribes nominal full load efficiency standards.

*Basic Model* means all units of a given type of electric motor (or class thereof) manufactured by a single manufacturer, and which (i) have the same rating, (ii) have electrical design characteristics that are essentially identical, and (iii) do not have any differing physical or functional characteristics that affect energy consumption or efficiency.


*Rating* means one of the combinations of an electric motor's horsepower (or standard kilowatt equivalent), number of poles, motor type, and open or enclosed construction, with respect to which § 431.25 of 10 CFR Part 431 prescribes nominal full load efficiency standards.
