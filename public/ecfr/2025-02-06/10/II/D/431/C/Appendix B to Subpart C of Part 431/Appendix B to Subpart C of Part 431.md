1.1.2. For each commercial refrigerator, freezer, or refrigerator-freezer with a remote condensing unit, also use AHRI 1200-2023, section 5.1, “Rating Requirements for Remote Commercial Refrigerated Display Merchandisers and Storage Cabinets.”


1.1.3. For each commercial refrigerator, freezer, or refrigerator-freezer used with a secondary coolant, test according to section 1.1.2 of this appendix, except in place of the equations for CDEC and CEC in sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.2.1 of AHRI 1200-2023, respectively, apply the following equations:


Where CPEC and Q_CP_ are as specified in sections 5.2.7 and 5.2.8 of AHRI 1320-2011 and EER is determined based on a temperature that is 6.0 °F lower than the secondary coolant cabinet inlet temperature.


1.2. Methodology for Determining Applicability of Transparent Door Equipment Families. To determine if a door for a given model of commercial refrigeration equipment is transparent:


(a) Calculate the outer door surface area including frames and mullions;


(b) calculate the transparent surface area within the outer door surface area excluding frames and mullions;


(c) calculate the ratio of (2) to (1) for each of the outer doors; and


(d) the ratio for the transparent surface area of all outer doors must be greater than 0.25 to qualify as a transparent equipment family.


1.3. Drawers. Drawers shall be treated as identical to doors when conducting the DOE test procedure. Commercial refrigeration equipment with drawers intended for use with pans shall be configured with stainless steel food service pans, installed in a configuration per the manufacturer's instructions utilizing the maximum pan sizes specified. If the manufacturer does not specify the pan sizes, the maximum pan depth and pan volume allowed shall be used. For commercial refrigeration equipment with drawers intended for use with pans, the net usable volume includes only the interior volume of the pan(s) in the drawer. The net usable volume shall be measured by the amount of water needed to fill all the pan(s) to within 0.5 inches of the top rim, or determined by calculating the total volume of all pan(s) using the pan manufacturers' published pan volume. For commercial refrigeration equipment with drawers not intended for pans, the net usable volume shall be equal to the total volume of the drawer to the top edge of the drawer. Test simulators shall be placed in commercial refrigeration equipment with drawers as follows: For each drawer, there shall be two test simulators placed at each of the following locations: at the left end, at the right end, and at consistent 24 inch to 48 inch intervals across the width of the drawer (for drawers wider than 48 inches). For drawers with overall internal width of 48 inches or less, only the left and right ends shall have test simulators. If test simulators are to be placed at a pan edge or divider, the test simulator shall be placed at the nearest adjacent location. For each drawer, one test simulator shall be placed on the bottom of the pan or drawer at each of the front and rear test simulator locations of the drawer. Test simulators shall be placed in contact with the drawer or pan end or ends unless load limiting stops are provided as part of the case. Test simulators shall be secured such that the test simulators do not move during the test. The net usable volume where test simulators are not required shall be filled with filler material so that between 60 percent and 80 percent of the net usable volume is occupied by test simulators and uniformly occupied by filler material.


1.4. Long-time Automatic Defrost. For commercial refrigeration equipment not capable of operating with defrost intervals of 24 hours or less, testing may be conducted using a two-part test method.


1.4.1. First Part of Test. The first part of the test shall be a 24-hour test starting in steady-state conditions and including eight hours of door opening (according to ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata). The energy consumed in this test, ET1, shall be recorded.


1.4.2. Second Part of Test. The second part of the test shall be a defrost cycle, including any operation associated with a defrost. The start and end of the test period be determined as the last time before and first time after a defrost occurrence when the measured average simulator temperature (*i.e.,* the instantaneous average of all test simulator temperature measurements) is within 0.5 °F of the IAT as measured during the first part of the test. The energy consumed in this test, ET2, and duration, t_DI_, shall be recorded.


1.4.3. Daily Energy Consumption. Based on the measured energy consumption in these two tests, the daily energy consumption (DEC) in kWh shall be calculated as:


1.5. Customer Order Storage Cabinets. Customer order storage cabinets shall conduct door openings according to ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata, except that each door shall be opened to the fully open position for 8 seconds, once every 2 hours, for 6 door-opening cycles.


1.5.1. Ambient Compartments. For customer order storage cabinets that have at least one individual-secured compartment that is not capable of maintaining an integrated average temperature below the ambient dry-bulb temperature, the individual-secured compartment(s) at ambient dry-bulb temperature shall be categorized as a high-temperature refrigerator compartment for the purpose of testing and rating. All volume, total display area, and energy consumption calculations shall be included within the high-temperature refrigerator category and summed with other high-temperature refrigerator category compartment(s) calculations.


1.5.2. Convertible Compartments. For customer order storage cabinets that have individual-secured compartments that are convertible between the ambient dry-bulb temperature and the ≥32 °F operating temperature, the convertible compartment shall be tested as a medium-temperature refrigerator compartment or at the lowest application product temperature as specified in section 2.2 of this appendix.


1.5.3. Inverse Refrigeration Load Test. For customer order storage cabinets that supply refrigerant to multiple individual-secured compartments and that allow the suction pressure from the evaporator in each individual-secured compartment to float based on the temperature required to store the customer order in that individual-secured compartment, test according to section 1.1.2 of this appendix, except that energy (heat) loss shall be allowed at a rate and ΔT equivalent to the energy gains of a standard refrigerated cabinet as specified in sections 1.5.3.1-1.5.3.3 of this appendix.


1.5.3.1. Anti-sweat door heaters. Anti-sweat door heaters shall be de-energized for the inverse refrigeration load test specified in section 1.5.3. of this appendix.


1.5.3.2. Integrated Average Temperature. For medium-temperature refrigerator compartments, the integrated average temperature shall be 112.4 °F ±2.0 °F. For low-temperature freezer compartments, the integrated average temperature shall be 150.4 °F ±2.0 °F. For ambient compartments, the integrated average temperature shall be 75.4 °F ±2.0 °F.


1.5.3.3. Daily Energy Consumption. Determine the calculated daily energy consumption (“CDEC”) and the EER based on AHRI 1200-2023, section 5.1, “Rating Requirements for Remote Commercial Refrigerated Display Merchandisers and Storage Cabinets,” except that the compressor energy consumption (“CEC”) shall be calculated by applying the following equations:


2.1. Integrated Average Temperatures. Conduct the testing required in section 1 of this appendix, and determine the daily energy consumption at the applicable integrated average temperature as follows:


2.1.1. Ice-Cream Freezers. Test ice-cream freezers and ice-cream freezer compartments to the integrated average temperature specified in section 4.1.1.2, “Ice Cream Applications,” of AHRI 1200-2023.


2.1.2. Low-Temperature Freezers. Test low-temperature freezers and low-temperature freezer compartments to the integrated average temperature specified in section 4.1.1.3, “Low Temperature Applications,” of AHRI 1200-2023.


2.1.3. Medium-Temperature Refrigerators. Test medium-temperature refrigerators and medium-temperature refrigerator compartments to the integrated average temperature specified in section 4.1.1.4, “Medium Temperature Applications,” of AHRI 1200-2023.


2.1.4. High-Temperature Refrigerators. Test high-temperature refrigerators and high-temperature refrigerator compartments to the integrated average temperature specified in section 4.1.1.1, “High Temperature Applications,” of AHRI 1200-2023.


2.2. Lowest Application Product Temperature. If a unit of commercial refrigeration equipment is not able to be operated at the integrated average temperature specified in section 2.1 of this appendix, test the unit at the lowest application product temperature (LAPT), as defined in § 431.62. For units equipped with a thermostat, LAPT is the measured temperature at the lowest thermostat setting of the unit (for units that are only able to operate at temperatures above the specified test temperature) or the highest thermostat setting of the unit (for units that are only able to operate at temperatures below the specified test temperature). For remote condensing equipment without a thermostat or other means of controlling temperature at the case, the lowest application product temperature is measured at the temperature achieved with the dew point temperature (as defined in section 3.2.8, “Dew Point,” of AHRI 1200-2023) or mid-point evaporator temperature (as defined in section 9, “Symbols and Subscripts,” of AHRI 1200-2023) set to 5 degrees colder than that required to maintain the manufacturer's specified application temperature that is closest to the specified integrated average temperature.


2.3. Testing at NSF Test Conditions. For commercial refrigeration equipment that is also tested in accordance with NSF test procedures (Type I and Type II), integrated average temperatures and ambient conditions used for NSF testing may be used in place of the DOE-prescribed integrated average temperatures and ambient conditions provided they result in a more stringent test. That is, the measured daily energy consumption of the same unit, when tested at the rating temperatures and/or ambient conditions specified in the DOE test procedure, must be lower than or equal to the measured daily energy consumption of the unit when tested with the rating temperatures or ambient conditions used for NSF testing. The integrated average temperature measured during the test may be lower than the range specified by the DOE applicable temperature specification provided in section 2.1 of this appendix, but may not exceed the upper value of the specified range. Ambient temperatures and/or humidity values may be higher than those specified in the DOE test procedure.


2.4. Liquid Refrigerant Pressure Required Accuracy. The liquid refrigerant pressure required accuracy is ±35 kPa (±5.1 psi).


2.5 Commercial Refrigerator, Freezer, and Refrigerator-Freezer connected to a Direct Expansion Remote Condensing Unit with R-744. For commercial refrigerators, freezers, and refrigerator-freezers connected to a direct expansion remote condensing unit with R-744, instead of the liquid refrigerant measurements for direct-expansion remote units specified in appendix A to ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata, the liquid refrigerant measurements for direct-expansion remote units shall be: liquid refrigerant temperature shall be 30.0 °F with a tolerance for the average over test period of ±3.0 °F and a tolerance for the individual measurements of ±5.0 °F; liquid refrigerant pressure shall be the saturated liquid pressure corresponding to a condensing temperature in the range of 32.0 °F to 44.0 °F for the average over test period; and liquid refrigerant subcooling shall be greater than 2.0 °R for the average over test period.


2.6 Chef Base or Griddle Stand Test Conditions. For chef bases or griddle stands, instead of the dry-bulb temperature, wet-bulb temperature, and radiant heat temperature specified in appendix A to ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata: dry-bulb temperature shall be 86.0 °F with a tolerance for the average over test period of ±1.8 °F and a tolerance for the individual measurements of ±3.6  °F; wet-bulb temperature shall be 73.7 °F with a tolerance for the average over test period of ±1.8 °F and a tolerance for the individual measurements of ±3.6 °F; and radiant heat temperature shall be greater than or equal to 81.0 °F.


3.1. Determination of Volume. Determine the volume of a commercial refrigerator, freezer, and refrigerator-freezer using the method set forth in AHRI 1200-2023, appendix C, “Commercial Refrigerated Display Merchandiser and Storage Cabinet Refrigerated Volume Calculation—Normative.”


3.2. Determination of Total Display Area. Determine the total display area of a commercial refrigerator, freezer, and refrigerator-freezer using the method set forth in AHRI 1200-2023, section 3.2.20, “Total Display Area (TDA),” and appendix D, “Commercial Refrigerated Display Merchandiser and Storage Cabinet Total Display Area (TDA) Calculation—Normative.”
