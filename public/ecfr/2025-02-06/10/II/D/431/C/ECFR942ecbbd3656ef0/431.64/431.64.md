# ยง 431.64   Uniform test method for the measurement of energy consumption of commercial refrigerators, freezers, and refrigerator-freezers.

(a) *Scope.* This section provides the test procedures for measuring, pursuant to EPCA, the energy consumption or energy efficiency for a given equipment category of commercial refrigerators, freezers, and refrigerator-freezers.


(b) *Testing and calculations.* (1) Determine the daily energy consumption and volume or total display area of each covered commercial refrigerator, freezer, or refrigerator-freezer by conducting the appropriate test procedure set forth below in appendix B, to this subpart. The daily energy consumption of commercial refrigeration equipment shall be calculated using raw measured values and the final test results shall be reported in increments of 0.01 kWh/day.


(2) Determine the daily energy consumption and pan storage volume, pan display area, and refrigerated volume of each buffet table or preparation table by conducting the appropriate test procedure set forth below in appendix C to this subpart. The daily energy consumption shall be calculated using raw measured values and the final test results shall be recorded in increments of 0.01 kWh/day.


(3) Determine the energy consumption per weight of product and product capacity of each blast chiller and blast freezer by conducting the appropriate test procedure set forth below in appendix D to this subpart. The energy consumption per weight of product shall be calculated using raw measured values and the final test results shall be recorded in increments of 0.01 kWh/lb.
