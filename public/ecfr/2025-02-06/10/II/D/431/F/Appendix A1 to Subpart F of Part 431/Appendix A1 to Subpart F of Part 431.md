For air conditioners and heat pumps, determine IVEC and IVHE (as applicable) in accordance with this appendix and the applicable sections of AHRI 1340-2023 and ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009. Representations of energy efficiency ratio 2 (EER2) and IVHE_C_ may optionally be made. Representations of coefficient of performance 2 (COP2) at 5  °F, 17  °F, and 47  °F may optionally be made.


Sections 3 and 4 of this appendix provide additional instructions for testing. In cases where there is a conflict, the language of this appendix takes highest precedence, followed by AHRI 1340-2023, followed by ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009. Any subsequent amendment to a referenced document by the standard-setting organization will not affect the test procedure in this appendix, unless and until the test procedure is amended by DOE.


The following conditions specified in AHRI 1340-2023 apply when testing to certify to the energy conservation standards in § 431.97. For cooling mode, use the rating conditions in Table 7 of AHRI 1340-2023. For heat pump heating mode tests, use the rating conditions in Table 23 of AHRI 1340-2023 and the IVHE building load profile in Table 22 of AHRI 1340-2023.


Representations of EER2 made using the “Cooling Bin A” conditions in Table 7 of AHRI 1340-2023 are optional. Representations of IVHE_C_ made using the IVHE_C_ Cold Climate building load profile in Table 22 of AHRI 1340-2023 are optional. Representations of COP2_47_, COP2_17_, and COP2_5_ are optional.


Where equations 8, 10, 11, and 13 to AHRI 1340-2023 call for using the cooling tower fan and condenser water pump power rate (TFPPR) for the cooling bin specified in Table 7 to AHRI 1340-2023, instead use the TFPPR value for the cooling bin specified in table 1 to this appendix. Where equation 22 to AHRI 1340-2023 calls for using a value of 0.0094 W/(Btu/h) for TFPPR, instead use a value of 0.0102 W/(Btu/h).


In place of the boost2 heating operating level definition in section 3.2.31.2 of AHRI 1340-2023, use the following definition: An operating level allowed by the controls at 5.0  °F outdoor dry-bulb temperature with a capacity at 5.0  °F outdoor dry-bulb temperature that is less than or equal to the maximum capacity allowed by the controls at 5.0  °F outdoor dry-bulb temperature and greater than the capacity of:


(a) The boost heating operating level at 5.0  °F outdoor dry-bulb temperature, if there is an operating level that meets the definition for boost heating operating level specified in section 3.2.31.1 of AHRI 1340-2023; or


(b) The high heating operating level at 5.0  °F outdoor dry-bulb temperature, if there is not an operating level that meets the definition for boost heating operating level specified in section 3.2.31.1 of AHRI 1340-2023.


In place of the third to last paragraph of section 6.3.6 of AHRI 1340-2023, use the following provisions.


Run the H5B2 test in Table 23 of AHRI 1340-2023 only if there is an operating level allowed by the controls at 5.0  °F that meets the definition of the boost2 heating operating level specified in section 5.1 of this appendix, and the H5B2 test is being used to determine the capacity at 5.0  °F outdoor dry-bulb temperature and/or COP2_5_.


If the unit has a boost heating operating level, run the H5B2 test in Table 23 of AHRI 1340-2023 with an operating level allowed by the controls at 5.0  °F outdoor dry-bulb temperature that has a capacity at 5.0  °F outdoor dry-bulb temperature that is greater than the capacity of the boost heating operating level at 5.0  °F outdoor dry-bulb temperature and less than or equal to the maximum capacity allowed by the controls at 5.0  °F outdoor dry-bulb temperature.


If the unit does not have a boost heating operating level, run the H5B2 test in Table 23 of AHRI 1340-2023 with an operating level allowed by the controls at 5.0  °F outdoor dry-bulb temperature that has a capacity at 5.0  °F outdoor dry-bulb temperature that is greater than the capacity of the high heating operating level at 5.0  °F outdoor dry-bulb temperature and less than or equal to the maximum capacity allowed by the controls at 5.0  °F outdoor dry-bulb temperature. Use the indoor airflow that is used by the controls at 5.0  °F outdoor dry-bulb temperature when operating at the chosen operating level.


The H5B2 test shall not be used in the calculation of IVHE or IVHE_C_.


Any references to COP2_H_ in AHRI 1340-2023 shall be considered synonymous with COP2 as defined in § 431.92. In place of section 6.3.14.2 of AHRI 1340-2023, use the following provisions.


To determine COP2_47_, use capacity and power determined for the H47H test.


To determine COP2_17_, the following provisions apply. For units without a boost heating operating level, use capacity and power determined for the H17H test. For units with a boost operating level, use capacity and power determined for the H17B test.


To determine COP2_5_, the following provisions apply. For units without a boost heating operating level and without a boost2 heating operating level, use capacity and power determined for the H5H test. For units with a boost heating operating level and without a boost2 heating operating level, use capacity and power determined for the H5B test. For units with a boost2 heating operating level, use capacity and power determined for the H5B2 test.


When testing equipment that includes any of the features listed in table 2 to this appendix, test in accordance with the set-up and test provisions specified in table 2.
