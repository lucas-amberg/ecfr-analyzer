# Appendix E to Subpart F of Part 431—Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Computer Room Air Conditioners


1. *Incorporation by Reference.*

DOE incorporated by reference in § 431.95 the entire standard for ASHRAE 127-2007. However, certain enumerated provisions of ASHRAE 127-2007, as listed in section 1.1, are inapplicable. To the extent that there is a conflict between the terms or provisions of a referenced industry standard and the CFR, the CFR provisions control.


1.1 ASHRAE 127-2007:


(a) Section 5.11 is inapplicable as specified in section 2 of this appendix.


(b) [Reserved]


1.2 [Reserved]


2. *General.* Determine the sensible coefficient of performance (SCOP) in accordance with ASHRAE 127-2007.


3. *Optional break-in period.* Manufacturers may optionally specify a “break-in” period, not to exceed 20 hours, to operate the equipment under test prior to conducting the test method specified in this appendix. A manufacturer who elects to use an optional compressor break-in period in its certification testing should record this period's duration as part of the information in the supplemental testing instructions under 10 CFR 429.43.


4. *Additional provisions for equipment set-up.* The only additional specifications that may be used in setting up the basic model for test are those set forth in the installation and operation manual shipped with the unit. Each unit should be set up for test in accordance with the manufacturer installation and operation manuals. Sections 4.1 and 4.2 of this appendix provide specifications for addressing key information typically found in the installation and operation manuals.


4.1. If a manufacturer specifies a range of superheat, sub-cooling, and/or refrigerant pressure in its installation and operation manual for a given basic model, any value(s) within that range may be used to determine refrigerant charge or mass of refrigerant, unless the manufacturer clearly specifies a rating value in its installation and operation manual, in which case the specified rating value must be used.


4.2. The airflow rate used for testing must be that set forth in the installation and operation manuals being shipped to the commercial customer with the basic model and clearly identified as that used to generate the DOE performance ratings. If a rated airflow value for testing is not clearly identified, a value of 400 standard cubic feet per minute (scfm) per ton must be used.
