# Appendix F to Subpart F of Part 431—Uniform Test Method for the Measurement of Energy Consumption of Air-Cooled, Three-Phase, Small Commercial Package Air Conditioning and Heating Equipment With a Cooling Capacity of Less Than 65,000 Btu/h and Air-Cooled, Three-Phase, Variable Refrigerant Flow Multi-Split Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps With a Cooling Capacity of Less Than 65,000 Btu/h


DOE incorporated by reference in § 431.95, the entire standard for ANSI/AHRI 210/240-2008 and ANSI/AHRI 1230-2010. However, certain enumerated provisions of those standards, as set forth in this section 1, are inapplicable. To the extent there is a conflict between the terms or provisions of a referenced industry standard and the CFR, the CFR provisions control.


1.1 ANSI/AHRI 210/240-2008:


(a) Section 6.5—*Tolerances*

(b) Reserved.


1.2 ANSI/AHRI 1230-2010:


(a) Section 5.1.2—*Manufacturer involvement*

(b) Section 6.6—*Verification testing and uncertainty*

2.1 Air-cooled, three-phase, small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h. Determine the seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER) and heating seasonal performance factor (HSPF) (as applicable) in accordance with ANSI/AHRI 210/240-2008. Sections 3 to 6 of this appendix provide additional instructions for determining SEER and HSPF.


2.2 Air-cooled, three-phase, variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h. Determine the SEER and HSPF (as applicable) in accordance with ANSI/AHRI 1230-2010.


Sections 3 through 6 of this appendix provide additional instructions for determining SEER and HSPF.


3. *Optional break-in period.* Manufacturers may optionally specify a “break-in” period, not to exceed 20 hours, to operate the equipment under test prior to conducting the test method specified in this appendix. A manufacturer who elects to use an optional compressor break-in period in its certification testing should record this period's duration as part of the information in the supplemental testing instructions under 10 CFR 429.43.


4. *Additional provisions for equipment set-up.* The only additional specifications that may be used in setting up the basic model for test are those set forth in the installation and operation manual shipped with the unit. Each unit should be set up for test in accordance with the manufacturer installation and operation manuals. Sections 3.1 through 3.3 of this appendix provide specifications for addressing key information typically found in the installation and operation manuals.


4.1. If a manufacturer specifies a range of superheat, sub-cooling, and/or refrigerant pressure in its installation and operation manual for a given basic model, any value(s) within that range may be used to determine refrigerant charge or mass of refrigerant, unless the manufacturer clearly specifies a rating value in its installation and operation manual, in which case the specified rating value shall be used.


4.2. The airflow rate used for testing must be that set forth in the installation and operation manuals being shipped to the commercial customer with the basic model and clearly identified as that used to generate the DOE performance ratings. If a rated airflow value for testing is not clearly identified, a value of 400 standard cubic feet per minute (scfm) per ton shall be used.


4.3. For air-cooled, three-phase, variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h, the test set-up and the fixed compressor speeds (*i.e.,* the maximum, minimum, and any intermediate speeds used for testing) should be recorded and maintained as part of the test data underlying the certified ratings that is required to be maintained under 10 CFR 429.71.


5. *Refrigerant line length corrections for air-cooled, three-phase, variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h.* For test setups where it is physically impossible for the laboratory to use the required line length listed in Table 3 of ANSI/AHRI 1230-2010, then the actual refrigerant line length used by the laboratory may exceed the required length and the following cooling capacity correction factors are applied:


6. *Manufacturer involvement in assessment or enforcement testing for air-cooled, three-phase, variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps with a cooling capacity of less than 65,000 Btu/h.* A manufacturer's representative will be allowed to witness assessment and/or enforcement testing. The manufacturer's representative will be allowed to inspect and discuss set-up only with a DOE representative and adjust only the modulating components during testing in the presence of a DOE representative that are necessary to achieve steady-state operation. Only previously documented specifications for set-up as specified under sections 3 and 4 of this appendix will be used.
