# Appendix G to Subpart F of Part 431—Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Single Package Vertical Air Conditioners and Single Package Vertical Heat Pumps


DOE incorporated by reference in § 431.95 the entire standard for AHRI 390-2021 and ASHRAE 37-2009. However, only certain enumerated provisions of AHRI 390-2021 and ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 are required or excluded as listed in this section 1. To the extent there is a conflict between the terms or provisions of a referenced industry standard and this appendix, the appendix provisions control, followed by AHRI 390-2021, followed by ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009.


1.1. Only the following provisions of AHRI 390-2021 apply:


1.2. All provisions of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 apply except for the following provisions:


*2. General.* Determine cooling capacity (Btu/h) and energy efficiency ratio (EER) for all single package vertical air conditioners and heat pumps and coefficient of performance (COP) for all single package vertical heat pumps, in accordance with the specified sections of AHRI 390-2021 and the specified sections of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009. Only identified provisions of AHRI 390-2021 are applicable and certain sections of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 are inapplicable, as set forth in section 1 of this appendix. In addition, the instructions in section 3 of this appendix apply to determining EER and COP. Any subsequent amendment to a referenced document by a standard-setting organization will not affect the test procedure in this appendix, unless and until the test procedure is amended by DOE.


*3. Test Conditions.* The “Standard Rating Full Load Capacity Test, Cooling” conditions for cooling mode tests and “Standard Rating Full Load Capacity Test, Heating” conditions for heat pump heating mode tests specified in Table 3 of section 5.8.3 of AHRI 390-2021 shall be used.


*3.1. Optional Representations.* Representations of COP for single package vertical heat pumps made using the “Low Temperature Operation, Heating” condition specified in Table 3 of section 5.8.3 of AHRI 390-2021 are optional and are determined according to the applicable provisions in section 1 of this appendix.


3.2. [Reserved]
