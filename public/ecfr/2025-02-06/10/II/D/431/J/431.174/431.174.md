(v) A cross-flow fan;


(vi) A fan manufactured exclusively to be powered by internal combustion engines;


(vii) A fan that create a vacuum of 30 inches water gauge or greater;


(viii) A fan that is designed and marketed to operate at or above 482 degrees Fahrenheit (250 degrees Celsius); or


(ix) A fan and blower embedded in the equipment listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section;


(3) Is not an embedded fan subject to the following exclusions:


(i) The test procedure in this section does not apply to fans or blowers that are embedded in:


(A) Single phase central air conditioners and heat pumps rated with a certified cooling capacity less than 65,000 British thermal units per hour (“Btu/h”) cooling capacity, that are subject to DOE's energy conservation standard at 10 CFR 430.32(c);


(B) Three phase, air-cooled, small commercial packaged air-conditioning and heating equipment rated with a certified cooling capacity less than 65,000 Btu/h cooling capacity, that are subject to DOE's energy conservation standard at § 431.97(b);


(C) Transport refrigeration (*i.e.,* Trailer refrigeration, Self-powered truck refrigeration, Vehicle-powered truck refrigeration, Marine/Rail container refrigerant);


(D) Vacuum cleaners;


(E) Heat Rejection Equipment: Packaged evaporative open-circuit cooling towers; Evaporative field-erected open-circuit cooling towers; Packaged evaporative closed-circuit cooling towers; Evaporative field-erected closed-circuit cooling towers; Packaged evaporative condensers; Field-erected evaporative condensers; Packaged air-cooled (dry) coolers; Field-erected air-cooled (dry) cooler; Air-cooled steam condensers; Hybrid (water saving) versions of all of the previously listed equipment that contain both evaporative and air-cooled heat exchange sections;


(F) Air curtains; and


(G) Direct expansion-dedicated outdoor air system that are subject to any of DOE's test procedures in appendix B to subpart F of this part.


(ii) The test procedure in this section does not apply to supply or condenser fans or blowers that are embedded in:


(A) Air-cooled commercial package air conditioners and heat pumps (“CUAC,” “CUHP”) with a certified cooling capacity between 5.5 ton (65,000 Btu/h) and 63.5 ton (760,000 Btu/h) that are subject to DOE's energy conservation standard at § 431.97(b);


(B) Water-cooled and evaporatively-cooled commercial air conditioners that are subject to DOE's energy conservation standard at § 431.97(b);


(C) Water-source heat pumps that are subject to DOE's energy conservation standard at § 431.97(b);


(D) Single package vertical air conditioners and heat pumps that are subject to DOE's energy conservation standard at § 431.97(d);


(E) Packaged terminal air conditioners (“PTAC”) and packaged terminal heat pumps (PTHP) that are subject to DOE's energy conservation standard at § 431.97(c);


(F) Computer room air conditioners that are subject to DOE's energy conservation standard at § 431.97(e); and


(G) Variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps that are subject to DOE's energy conservation standard at § 431.97(f); and


(4) In addition, the test procedure is only applicable to fan or blower duty points with the following characteristics, measured or calculated in accordance with the test procedure set forth in appendix A of this subpart:


(i)(A) Fan shaft input power equal to or greater than 1 horsepower; or


(B) Fan electrical power equal to or greater than 0.89 kW; and


(ii)(A) Fan static air power equal to or less than 150 horsepower for fans using a static pressure basis fan energy index (“FEI”) in accordance with the required test configuration listed in table 7.1 of AMCA 214-21 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.173); or


(B) Fan total air power equal to or less than 150 horsepower for fans using a total pressure basis FEI in accordance with the required test configuration listed in table 7.1 of AMCA 214-21;


(b) *Scope for air circulating fans.* The test procedure in this section applies to all air circulating fans with input power greater than or equal to 125W at maximum speed.


(c) *Testing and calculations for fans and blowers other than air circulating fans.* Determine the FEI, the fan electrical power (“FEP”), and fan shaft power (as applicable) at each duty point, as specified by the manufacturer, using the test procedure set forth in appendix A of this subpart.


(d) *Testing and calculations for air circulating fan.* Determine the air circulating fan efficacy in cubic feet per minute per watt at maximum speed using the test procedure set forth in appendix B to this subpart.
