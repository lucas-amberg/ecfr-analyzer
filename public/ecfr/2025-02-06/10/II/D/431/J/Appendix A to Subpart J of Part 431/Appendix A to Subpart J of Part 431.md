The definitions applicable to this appendix are defined in § 431.172 and in section 3, “Definitions,” of AMCA 214-21. In cases where there is a conflict, the definitions in § 431.172 take precedence over AMCA 214-21.


2.1. *General.*

This section describes the test procedure for fans and blowers other than air circulating fans. In cases where there is a conflict, the provisions in this appendix take precedence over AMCA 214-21. Where AMCA 214-21 refers to Annex A, “Polyphase Regulated Motor Efficiencies (Normative),” of AMCA 214-21, Table 5 of § 431.25 or the currently applicable standards in § 431.25 must be used instead.


2.2.1. *General.*

The fan electrical power (FEPact) in kilowatts must be determined at every duty point specified by the manufacturer in accordance with one of the test methods listed in table 1, and the following sections of AMCA 214-21: Section 2, “References (Normative)”; Section 7, “Testing,” including the provisions of AMCA 210-16 and ISO 5801:2017 as referenced by Section 7 and implicated by sections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 of this appendix; Section 8.1, “Laboratory Measurement Only” (as applicable); and Annex J, “Other data and calculations to be retained.”


Testing must be performed in accordance with the required test configuration listed in Table 7.1 of AMCA 214-21. The following values must be determined in accordance with this appendix at each duty point specified by the manufacturer: fan airflow in cubic feet per minute; fan air density; fan total pressure in inches of water gauge for fans using a total pressure basis FEI in accordance with Table 7.1 of AMCA 214-21; fan static pressure in inches of water gauge for fans using a static pressure basis FEI in accordance with Table 7.1 of AMCA 214-21; fan speed in revolutions per minute; and fan shaft input power in horsepower for fans tested in accordance with sections 6.3 or 6.4 of AMCA 214-21.


In addition, if applying the equations in Section E.2 of Annex E of AMCA 214-21 for compressible flows, the compressibility coefficients must be included in the equations as applicable.


All measurements must be recorded at the resolution of the test instrumentation and calculations must be rounded to the number of significant digits present at the resolution of the test instrumentation.


In cases where there is a conflict, the provisions in AMCA 214-21 take precedence over AMCA 210-16 and ISO 5801:2017. In addition, the provisions in this appendix apply.








*2.2.2 Power Roof Ventilators*

Centrifugal Power Roof Ventilators that are both supply and exhaust must be tested in both supply and exhaust configurations as listed in table 7.1 of AMCA 214-21.


*2.2.3 Embedded Fans*

Embedded fans that are not manufactured in a standalone configuration must be tested in a standalone configuration. If some components of the bare shaft fan are not removable without causing irreversible damage to the equipment into which the fan is embedded, testing must be performed using additional fan components, except for the fan impeller, that are geometrically identical to that of the fan embedded inside the larger piece of equipment for testing.


*2.3. Power Supply*

Any wire-to-air testing must be conducted at the supply frequency, phase, and voltages specified in this section. The frequency and voltage must be selected in accordance with section 7.8. of AMCA 214-21. Fans and blowers rated for operation for single- or multi-phase power supply must be tested with single- or multi-phase electricity, respectively. Fans and blowers, capable of operating with single- and multi-phase power supply, must be tested using multi-phase electricity.




*2.4. Stability Conditions.*

The following conditions must be met to establish system stability prior to collecting test data:


(a) Barometric pressure, dry bulb temperature and wet bulb temperature in the general test area must be captured at least every five seconds after the run-in period is completed and the ambient air density calculated from these values shall not vary by more than ±1 percent during verification of fan speed and fan input power stability.



 


(b) After the fan has been run-in, record the fan speed in rpm and the input power (in horsepower or watts) at least every 5 seconds for at least three 60-second intervals. Readings shall be made simultaneously. Repeat these measurements over 60-second intervals until:


(1) The average fan speed from the last 60-second interval varies by less than the absolute value of 1 percent or 1 rpm, whichever is greater, when compared to the average fan speed measured during the previous 60-second test interval;


(2) The average input power from the last 60-second interval by reaction dynamometer, torque meter or calibrated motor must be ±4 percent, or the average input power by electrical meter must be ±2 percent of the mean or 1 watt, whichever is greater, compared to the average input power measured during the previous 60-second test interval; and


(3) The slopes of a linear fit trendline calculated from the individual data collected for fan speed and input power during at least three 60-second sampling intervals include both positive and negative values (*e.g.,* two positive and one negative slope value or one positive and two negative slope values). If three positive or three negative slopes are determined in succession, additional sampling intervals are required until slopes from three successive sampling intervals include both positive and negative values.




*2.5. Sampling Intervals for Testing.*

A test measurement must meet the following conditions:


(a) The sampling interval over which average test values are determined shall not exceed 60 seconds;


(b) The average fan speed from the most recent 60-second interval varies by less than the absolute value of 1 percent or 1 rpm, whichever is greater, when compared to the average fan speed measured during the previous 60-second test interval; and


(c) the average input power from the last 60-second interval by reaction dynamometer, torque meter or calibrated motor must be ±4 percent, or the average input power by electrical meter must be ±2 percent of the mean or 1 watt, whichever is greater, compared to the average input power measured during the previous 60-second test interval.


*2.6. FEI calculation*

The FEI must be determined at every duty point in accordance with Section 4, “Calculation of the FEI for a single duty point,” and Section 5, “Reference Fan Electrical Power (FEP_ref_)” of AMCA 214-21. In addition, the FEI must be rounded to the nearest hundredths place; FEP must be rounded to three significant figures; and all measurements must be recorded at the resolution of the test instrument.
