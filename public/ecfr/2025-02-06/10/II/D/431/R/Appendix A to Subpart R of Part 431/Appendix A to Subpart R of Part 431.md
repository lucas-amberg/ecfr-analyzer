This appendix covers the test requirements used to measure the energy consumption of the components that make up the envelope of a walk-in cooler or walk-in freezer.


The definitions contained in § 431.302 are applicable to this appendix.


4.1 *Automatic door opener/closer* means a device or control system that “automatically” opens and closes doors without direct user contact, such as a motion sensor that senses when a forklift is approaching the entrance to a door and opens it, and then closes the door after the forklift has passed.


4.2 *Percent time off (PTO)* means the percent of time that an electrical device is assumed to be off.




4.3 *Rated power* means the input power of an electricity-consuming device as specified on the device's nameplate. If the device does not have a nameplate or such nameplate does not list the device's input power, then the rated power must be determined from the device's product data sheet, literature, or installation instructions that come with the device or are available online.


4.4 *Rating conditions* means, unless explicitly stated otherwise, all conditions shown in table A.1 of this appendix.
