# Appendix C1 to Subpart R of Part 431—Uniform Test Method for the Measurement of Net Capacity and AWEF2 of Walk-In Cooler and Walk-In Freezer Refrigeration Systems




DOE incorporated by reference in § 431.303, the entire standard for AHRI 1250-2020, ANSI/ASHRAE 16, ANSI/ASHRAE 23.1-2010, ANSI/ASHRAE 37, ANSI/ASHRAE 41.1, ANSI/ASHRAE 41.3, ANSI/ASHRAE 41.6, and ANSI/ASHRAE 41.10. However, certain enumerated provisions of these standards, as set forth in sections 0.1 through 0.8 of this appendix are inapplicable. To the extent there is a conflict between the terms or provisions of a referenced industry standard and the CFR, the CFR provisions control. To the extent there is a conflict between the terms or provisions of AHRI 1250-2020, ANSI/ASHRAE 16, ANSI/ASHRAE 23.1-2010, ANSI/ASHRAE 37, ANSI/ASHRAE 41.1, ANSI/ASHRAE 41.3, ANSI/ASHRAE 41.6, and ANSI/ASHRAE 41.10, the AHRI 1250-2020 provisions control.


This appendix covers the test requirements used to determine the net capacity and the AWEF2 of the refrigeration system of a walk-in cooler or walk-in freezer.


The definitions contained in § 431.302, AHRI 1250-2020, ANSI/ASHRAE 37, and ANSI/ASHRAE 16 apply to this appendix. When definitions in standards incorporated by reference are in conflict or when they conflict with this section, the hierarchy of precedence shall be in the following order: § 431.302, AHRI 1250-2020, and then either ANSI/ASHRAE 37 or ANSI/ASHRAE 16.


The term “unit cooler” used in AHRI 1250-2020 and this subpart shall be considered to address both “unit coolers” and “ducted fan coil units,” as appropriate.


2.2.1. *Digital Compressor* means a compressor that uses mechanical means for disengaging active compression on a cyclic basis to provide a reduced average refrigerant flow rate in response to a control system input signal.


2.2.2. *Displacement Ratio,* applicable to staged positive displacement compressor systems, means the swept volume rate, e.g. in cubic centimeters per second, of a given stage, divided by the swept volume rate at full capacity.


2.2.3. *Duty Cycle,* applicable to digital compressors, means the fraction of time that the compressor is engaged and actively compressing refrigerant.


2.2.4. *Maximum Speed,* applicable to variable-speed compressors, means the maximum speed at which the compressor will operate under the control of the dedicated condensing system control system for extended periods of time, *i.e.* not including short-duration boost-mode operation.


2.2.5. *Minimum Speed,* applicable to variable-speed compressors, means the minimum compressor speed at which the compressor will operate under the control of the dedicated condensing system control system.


2.2.6. *Multiple-Capacity,* applicable for describing a refrigeration system, indicates that it has three or more stages (levels) of capacity.


2.2.7. *Speed Ratio,* applicable to variable-speed compressors, means the ratio of operating speed to the maximum speed.


Determine the Annual Walk-in Energy Factor (AWEF2) and net capacity of walk-in cooler and walk-in freezer refrigeration systems by conducting the test procedure set forth in AHRI 1250-2020, with the modifications to that test procedure provided in this section. However, certain sections of AHRI 1250-2020, ANSI/ASHRAE 37, and ANSI/ASHRAE 16 are not applicable, as set forth in sections 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 of this appendix. Round AWEF2 measurements to the nearest 0.01 Btu/Wh. Round net capacity measurements as indicated in table 1 of this appendix.


The following sections of this appendix provide additional instructions for testing. In cases where there is a conflict, the language of this appendix takes highest precedence, followed by AHRI 1250-2020, then ANSI/ASHRAE 37 or ANSI/ASHRAE 16. Any subsequent amendment to a referenced document by the standard-setting organization will not affect the test procedure in this appendix, unless and until the test procedure is amended by DOE. Material is incorporated as it exists on the date of the approval, and a notification of any change in the incorporation will be published in the _Federal Register_.

However, the unit under test must be inspected and confirmed to be free from frost before initiating steady state testing.


3.5.2.1 Refrigerant Temperature Measurements


When testing a condensing unit alone, measure refrigerant liquid temperature leaving the condensing unit, and the refrigerant vapor temperature entering the condensing unit as required in section C7.5.1.1.2 of Appendix C of AHRI 1250-2020 using the same measurement approach specified for the unit cooler in section C3.1.3 of Appendix C of AHRI 1250-2020. In all cases in which thermometer wells or immersed sheathed sensors are prescribed, if the refrigerant tube outer diameter is less than 
1/2 inch, the refrigerant temperature may be measured using the average of two temperature measuring instruments with a minimum accuracy of ±0.5 °F placed on opposite sides of the refrigerant tube surface—resulting in a total of up to 8 temperature measurement devices used for the DX Dual Instrumentation method. In this case, the refrigerant tube shall be insulated with 1-inch thick insulation from a point 6 inches upstream of the measurement location to a point 6 inches downstream of the measurement location. Also, to comply with this requirement, the unit cooler/evaporator entering measurement location may be moved to a location 6 inches upstream of the expansion device and, when testing a condensing unit alone, the entering and leaving measurement locations may be moved to locations 6 inches from the respective service valves.


3.5.2.2 Mass Flow Meter Location


When using the DX Dual Instrumentation test method of AHRI 1250-2020, applicable for unit coolers, dedicated condensing units, and matched pairs, the second mass flow meter may be installed in the suction line as shown in Figure C1 of AHRI 1250-2020.


3.5.2.3 Subcooling at Refrigerant Mass Flow Meter


In section C3.4.5 of Appendix C of AHRI 1250-2020, when verifying subcooling at the mass flow meters, only the sight glass and a temperature sensor located on the tube surface under the insulation are required. Subcooling shall be verified to be within the 3 °F requirement downstream of flow meters located in the same chamber as a condensing unit under test and upstream of flow meters located in the same chamber as a unit cooler under test, rather than always downstream as indicated in AHRI 1250-2009, section C3.4.5. If the subcooling is less than 3 °F when testing a unit cooler, dedicated condensing unit, or matched pair (not a single-packaged system), cool the line between the condensing unit outlet and this location to achieve the required subcooling. When providing such cooling while testing a matched pair (a) set up the line-cooling system and also set up apparatus to heat the liquid line between the mass flow meters and the unit cooler, (b) when the system has achieved steady state without activation of the heating and cooling systems, measure the liquid temperature entering the expansion valve for a period of at least 30 minutes, (c) activate the cooling system to provide the required subcooling at the mass flow meters, (d) if necessary, apply heat such that the temperature entering the expansion valve is within 0.5 °F of the temperature measured during step (b), and (e) proceed with measurements once condition (d) has been verified.


3.5.2.4 Installation Instructions


Manufacturer installation instructions or installation instructions described in this section refer to the instructions that come packaged with or appear on the labels applied to the unit. This does not include online manuals.


*Installation Instruction Hierarchy:* If a given installation instruction provided on the label(s) applied to the unit conflicts with the installation instructions that are shipped with the unit, the label takes precedence. For testing of matched pairs, the installation instructions for the dedicated condensing unit shall take precedence. Setup shall be in accordance with the field installation instructions (laboratory installation instructions shall not be used). Achieving test conditions shall always take precedence over installation instructions.


3.5.2.5. Refrigerant Charging and Adjustment of Superheat and Subcooling.


All dedicated condensing systems (dedicated condensing units tested alone, matched pairs, and single packaged dedicated systems) that use flooding of the condenser for head pressure control during low-ambient-temperature conditions shall be charged, and superheat and/or subcooling shall be set, at Refrigeration C test conditions unless otherwise specified in the installation instructions.


If after being charged at Refrigeration C condition the unit under test does not operate at the Refrigeration A condition due to high pressure cut out, refrigerant shall be removed in increments of 4 ounces or 5 percent of the test unit's receiver capacity, whichever quantity is larger, until the unit operates at the Refrigeration A condition. All tests shall be run at this final refrigerant charge. If less than 0 °F of subcooling is measured for the refrigerant leaving the condensing unit when testing at B or C condition, calculate the refrigerant-enthalpy-based capacity (*i.e.*, when using the DX dual instrumentation, the DX calibrated box, or single-packaged unit refrigerant enthalpy method) assuming that the refrigerant is at saturated liquid conditions at the condensing unit exit.


All dedicated condensing systems that do not use a flooded condenser design shall be charged at Refrigeration A test conditions unless otherwise specified in the installation instructions.


If the installation instructions give a specified range for superheat, sub-cooling, or refrigerant pressure, the average of the range shall be used as the refrigerant charging parameter target and the test condition tolerance shall be ±50 percent of the range. Perform charging of near-azeotropic and zeotropic refrigerants only with refrigerant in the liquid state. Once the correct refrigerant charge is determined, all tests shall run until completion without further modification.


3.5.2.5.1. When charging or adjusting superheat/subcooling, use all pertinent instructions contained in the installation instructions to achieve charging parameters within the tolerances. However, in the event of conflicting charging information between installation instructions, follow the installation instruction hierarchy listed in section 3.5.2.4. Conflicting information is defined as multiple conditions given for charge adjustment where all conditions specified cannot be met. In the event of conflicting information within the same set of charging instructions (e.g., the installation instructions shipped with the dedicated condensing unit), follow the hierarchy in Table 19 for priority. Unless the installation instructions specify a different charging tolerance, the tolerances identified in table 19 of this appendix shall be used.


3.5.2.5.2. *Dedicated Condensing Unit.*

If the Dedicated Condensing Unit includes a receiver and the subcooling target leaving the condensing unit provided in installation instructions cannot be met without fully filling the receiver, the subcooling target shall be ignored. Likewise, if the Dedicated Condensing unit does not include a receiver and the subcooling target leaving the condensing unit cannot be met without the unit cycling off on high pressure, the subcooling target can be ignored. Also, if no instructions for charging or for setting subcooling leaving the condensing unit are provided in the installation instructions, the refrigeration system shall be set up with a charge quantity and/or exit subcooling such that the unit operates during testing without shutdown (e.g., on a high-pressure switch) and operation of the unit is otherwise consistent with the requirements of the test procedure of this appendix and the installation instructions.


3.5.2.5.3. *Unit Cooler.* Use the shipped expansion device for testing. Otherwise, use the expansion device specified in the installation instructions. If the installation instructions specify multiple options for the expansion device, any specified expansion device may be used. The supplied expansion device shall be adjusted until either the superheat target is met, or the device reaches the end of its adjustable range. In the event the device reaches the end of its adjustable range and the super heat target is not met, test with the adjustment at the end of its range providing the closest match to the superheat target, and the test condition tolerance for super heat target shall be ignored. The measured superheat is not subject to a test operating tolerance. However, if the evaporator exit condition is used to determine capacity using the DX dual instrumentation method or the refrigerant enthalpy method, individual superheat value measurements may not be equal to or less than zero. If this occurs, or if the operating tolerances of measurements affected by expansion device fluctuation are exceeded, the expansion device shall be replaced, operated at an average superheat value higher than the target, or both, in order to avoid individual superheat value measurements less than zero and/or to meet the required operating tolerances.


3.5.2.5.4. *Single-Packaged Unit.* Unless otherwise directed by the installation instructions, install one or more refrigerant line pressure gauges during the setup of the unit, located depending on the parameters used to verify or set charge, as described in this section:


3.5.2.5.4.1. Install a pressure gauge in the liquid line if charging is on the basis of subcooling, or high side pressure or corresponding saturation or dew point temperature.


3.5.2.5.4.2. Install a pressure gauge in the suction line if charging is on the basis of superheat, or low side pressure or corresponding saturation or dew point temperature. Install this gauge as close to the evaporator as allowable by the installation instructions and the physical constraints of the unit. Use methods for installing pressure gauge(s) at the required location(s) as indicated in the installation instructions if specified.


3.5.2.5.4.3. If the installation instructions indicate that refrigerant line pressure gauges should not be installed and the unit fails to operate due to high-pressure or low-pressure compressor cut off, then a charging port shall be installed, and the unit shall be evacuated of refrigerant and charged to the nameplate charge.


3.5.2.6 Ducted Units


For systems with ducted evaporator air, or that can be installed with or without ducted evaporator air: Connect ductwork on both the inlet and outlet connections and determine external static pressure (ESP) as described in sections 6.4 and 6.5 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37. Use pressure measurement instrumentation as described in section 5.3.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37. Test at the fan speed specified in the installation instructions—if there is more than one fan speed setting and the installation instructions do not specify which speed to use, test at the highest speed. Conduct tests with the ESP equal to 50% of the maximum ESP allowed in the installation instructions, within a tolerance of −0.00/+0.05 inches of water column. If the installation instructions do not provide the maximum ESP, the ESP shall be set for testing such that the air volume rate is 
2/3 of the air volume rate measured when the ESP is 0.00 inches of water column within a tolerance of −0.00/+0.05 inches of water column.


If testing using either the indoor or outdoor air enthalpy method to measure the air volume rate, adjust the airflow measurement apparatus fan to set the external static pressure—otherwise, set the external static pressure by symmetrically restricting the outlet of the test duct. In case of conflict, these requirements for setting airflow take precedence over airflow values specified in manufacturer installation instructions or product literature.


3.5.2.7. Two-Speed or Multiple-Speed Evaporator Fans. Two-Speed or Multiple-Speed evaporator fans shall be considered to meet the qualifying control requirements of section C4.2 of Appendix C of AHRI 1250-2020 for measuring off-cycle fan energy if they use a fan speed no less than 50% of the speed used in the maximum capacity tests.


3.5.2.8. Defrost


Use section C10.2.1 of Appendix C of AHRI 1250-2020 for defrost testing. The Test Room Conditioning Equipment requirement of section C10.2.1.1 of Appendix C of AHRI 1250-2020 does not apply.


3.5.2.8.1 Adaptive Defrost


When testing to certify compliance to the energy conservation standards, use N_DF_ = 4, as instructed in section C10.2.1.7 or C10.2.2.1 of AHRI 1250-2020. When determining the represented value of the calculated benefit for the inclusion of adaptive defrost, use N_DF_ = 2.5, as instructed in section C10.2.1.7 or C10.2.2.1 of AHRI 1250-2020.


3.5.2.8.2 Hot Gas Defrost


When testing to certify compliance to the energy conservation standards, remove the hot gas defrost mechanical components and disconnect all such components from electrical power. Test the units as if they are electric defrost units, but do not conduct the defrost tests described in section C10.2.1 of AHRI 1250-2020. Use the defrost heat and power consumption values as described in section C10.2.2 of AHRI 1250-2020 for the AWEF2 calculations.


3.5.2.9 Dedicated condensing units that are not matched for testing and are not single-packaged dedicated systems.


The temperature measurement requirements of sections C3.1.3 and C4.1.3.1 appendix C of AHRI 1250-2020 shall apply only to the condensing unit exit rather than to the unit cooler inlet and outlet, and they shall be applied for two measurements when using the DX Dual Instrumentation test method.


3.5.2.10. Single-packaged dedicated systems


Use the test method in section C9 of appendix C of AHRI 1250-2020 (including the applicable provisions of ASHRAE 16-2016, ASHRAE 23.1-2010, ASHRAE 37-2009, and ASHRAE 41.6-2014, as referenced in section C9.1 of AHRI 1250-2020) as the method of test for single-packaged dedicated systems, with modifications as described in this section. Use two test methods listed in table 20 of this appendix to calculate the net capacity and power consumption. The test method listed with a lower “Hierarchy Number” and that has “Primary” as an allowable use in table 20 of this appendix shall be considered the primary measurement and used as the net capacity.


3.5.2.10.1 Single-Packaged Refrigerant Enthalpy Method


The single-packaged refrigerant enthalpy method shall follow the test procedure of the DX Calibrated Box method in AHRI 1250-2020, appendix C, section C8 for refrigerant-side measurements with the following modifications:


3.5.2.10.1.1 Air-side measurements shall follow the requirements of the primary single-packaged method listed in table 20 of this appendix. The air-side measurements and refrigerant-side measurements shall be collected over the same intervals.


3.5.2.10.1.2 A preliminary test at Test Rating Condition A is required using the primary method prior to any modification necessary to install the refrigerant-side measuring instruments. Install surface mount temperature sensors on the evaporator and condenser coils at locations not affected by liquid subcooling or vapor superheat (i.e., near the midpoint of the coil at a return bend), entering and leaving the compressor, and entering the expansion device. These temperature sensors shall be included in the regularly recorded data.


3.5.2.10.1.3 After the preliminary test is completed, the refrigerant shall be removed from the equipment and the refrigerant-side measuring instruments shall be installed. The equipment shall then be evacuated and recharged with refrigerant. Once the equipment is operating at Test Condition A, the refrigerant charge shall be adjusted until, as compared to the average values from the preliminary test, the following conditions are achieved:


(a) Each on-coil temperature sensor indicates a reading that is within ±1.0 °F of the measurement in the initial test,


(b) The temperatures of the refrigerant entering and leaving the compressor are within ±4 °F, and


(c) The refrigerant temperature entering the expansion device is within ±1 °F.


3.5.2.10.1.4 Once these conditions have been achieved over an interval of at least 10 minutes, refrigerant charging equipment shall be removed and the official tests shall be conducted.


3.5.2.10.1.5 The lengths of liquid line to be added shall be 5 feet maximum, not including the requisite flow meter. This maximum length applies to each circuit separately.


3.5.2.10.1.6 Use section C9.2 of appendix C of AHRI 1250-2020 for allowable refrigeration capacity heat balance. Calculate the single-packaged refrigerant enthalpy (secondary) method test net capacity


UA_cond_ and UA_amb_ are, for the condenser/evaporator partition and the evaporator compartment walls exposed to ambient air, respectively, the product of the overall heat transfer coefficient and surface area of the unit as manufactured, *i.e.* without external insulation that might have been added during the test. The areas shall be calculated based on measurements, and the thermal resistance values shall be based on insulation thickness and insulation material;


T_evapside_ is the air temperature in the evaporator compartment—the measured evaporator air inlet temperature may be used;


T_condside_ is the air temperature in the condenser compartment—the measured chamber ambient temperature may be used, or a measurement may be made using a temperature sensor placed inside the condenser box at least 6 inches distant from any part of the refrigeration system; and


T_amb_ is the air temperature outside the single-packaged system.


3.5.2.10.1.7 For multi-circuit single-packaged systems utilizing the single-packaged refrigerant enthalpy method, apply the test method separately for each circuit and sum the separately-calculated refrigerant-side gross refrigeration capacities.


3.5.2.10.2 Calibrated Box Test Procedure


3.5.2.10.2.1 Measurements. Refer to section C3 of AHRI 1250-2020 (including the applicable provisions of ASHRAE 41.1-2013, ASHRAE 41.3-2014, and ASHRAE 41.10-2013, as referenced in section C3 of AHRI 1250-2020) for requirements of air-side and refrigerant-side measurements.


3.5.2.10.2.2 Apparatus setup for Calibrated Box Calibration and Test. Refer to section C5 of AHRI 1250-2020 and section C8 of AHRI 1250-2020 for specific test setup.


3.5.2.10.2.3 The calibrated box shall be installed in a temperature-controlled enclosure in which the temperature can be maintained at a constant level. When using the calibrated box method for Single-Packaged Dedicated Systems, the enclosure air temperature shall be maintained such that the condenser air entering conditions are as specified for the test.


3.5.2.10.2. The temperature-controlled enclosure shall be of a size that will provide clearances of not less than 18 in at all sides, top and bottom, except that clearance of any one surface may be reduced to not less than 5.5 inches.


3.5.2.10.2.5 The heat leakage of the calibrated box shall be noted in the test report.


3.5.2.10.2.6 Refrigerant lines within the calibrated box shall be well insulated to avoid appreciable heat loss or gain.


3.5.2.10.2.7 Instruments for measuring the temperature around the outside of the calibrated box to represent the enclosure temperature T_en_ shall be located at the center of each wall, ceiling, and floor. Exception: in the case where a clearance around the outside of the calibrated box, as indicated in section 3.5.2.10.2.4 of this appendix, is reduced to less than 18 inches, the number of temperature measuring devices on the outside of that surface shall be increased to six, which shall be treated as a single temperature to be averaged with the temperature of each of the other five surfaces. The six temperature measuring instruments shall be located at the center of six rectangular sections of equal area. If the refrigeration system is mounted at the location that would cover the center of the face on which it is mounted, up to four temperature measurements shall be used on that face to represent its temperature. Each sensor shall be aligned with the center of the face's nearest outer edge and centered on the distance between that edge and the single-packaged unit (this is illustrated in figure C5 of this section when using surface temperature sensors), and they shall be treated as a single temperature to be averaged with the temperature of each of the other five surfaces. However, any of these sensors shall be omitted if either (a) the distance between the outer edge and the single-packaged unit is less than one foot or (b) if the sensor location would be within two feet of any of the foot square surfaces discussed in section 3.5.2.10.2.8 of this appendix representing a warm discharge air impingement area. In this case, the remaining sensors shall be used to represent the average temperature for the surface.


3.5.2.10.2.8 One of the following two approaches shall be used for the box external temperature measurement. Box calibration and system capacity measurement shall both be done using the same one of these approaches. 1: Air temperature sensors. Each temperature sensor shall be at a distance of 6 inches from the calibrated box. If the clearance from a surface of the box (allowed for one surface only) is less than 12 inches, the temperature measuring instruments shall be located midway between the outer wall of the calibrated box and the adjacent surface. 2: Surface temperature sensors. Surface temperature sensors shall be mounted on the calibrated box surfaces to represent the enclosure temperature, T_en_.


3.5.2.10.2.9 Additional surface temperature sensors may be used to measure external hot spots during refrigeration system testing. If this is done, two temperature sensors shall be used to measure the average temperature of the calibrated box surface covered by the condensing section—they shall be located centered on equal-area rectangles comprising the covered calibrated box surface whose common sides span the short dimension of this surface. Additional surface temperature sensors may be used to measure box surfaces on which warm condenser discharge air impinges. A pattern of square surfaces measuring one foot square shall be mapped out to represent the hot spot upon which the warm condenser air impinges. One temperature sensor shall be used to measure surface temperature at the center of each square (see figure C5 of this section). A drawing showing this pattern and identifying the surface temperature sensors shall be provided in the test report. The average surface temperature of the overall calibrated box outer surface during testing shall be calculated as follows.


3.5.2.10.2.11 The average air dry-bulb temperature in the calibrated box during Single-Packaged Dedicated System tests and calibrated box heat leakage tests shall be the average of eight temperatures measured at the corners of the box at a distance of 2 inches to 4 inches from the walls. The instruments shall be shielded from any cold or warm surfaces except that they shall not be shielded from the adjacent walls of the box. The Single-Packaged Dedicated System under test shall be mounted such that the temperature instruments are not in the direct air stream from the discharge of the Single-Packaged Dedicated System.


3.5.2.10.2.12 Calibration of the Calibrated Box. Calibration of the Calibrated Box shall occur prior to installation of the Single-Packaged Dedicated System. This shall be done either (a) prior to cutting the opening needed to install the Single-Packaged Dedicated System, or (b) with an insulating panel with the same thickness and thermal resistance as the box wall installed in the opening intended for the Single-Packaged Dedicated System installation. Care shall be taken to avoid thermal shorts in the location of the opening either during calibration or during subsequent installation of the Single-Packaged Dedicated System. A calibration test shall be made for air movements comparable to those expected for Single-Packaged Dedicated System capacity measurement, *i.e.,* with air volume flow rate within 10 percent of the air volume flow rate of the Single-Packaged Dedicated System evaporator.


3.5.2.10.2.13 The heat input shall be adjusted to maintain an average box temperature not less than 25.0 °F above the test enclosure temperature.


3.5.2.10.2.14 The average dry-bulb temperature inside the calibrated box shall not vary more than 1.0 °F over the course of the calibration test.


3.5.2.10.2.15 A calibration test shall be the average of 11 consecutive hourly readings when the box has reached a steady-state temperature condition.


3.5.2.10.2.16 The box temperature shall be the average of all readings after a steady-state temperature condition has been reached.


3.5.2.10.2.17 The calibrated box has reached a steady-state temperature condition when: The average box temperature is not less than 25 °F above the test enclosure temperature. Temperature variations do not exceed 5.0 °F between temperature measuring stations. Temperatures do not vary by more than 2 °F at any one temperature- measuring station.


3.5.2.10.2.18 Data to be Measured and Recorded. Refer to Table C5 in section C6.2 of AHRI 1250-2020 for the required data that need to measured and recorded.


3.5.2.10.2.19 Refrigeration Capacity Calculation.


The heat leakage coefficient of the calibrated box is calculated by


For each Dry Rating Condition, calculate the Net Capacity:


3.5.2.10.3 Detachable single-packaged systems shall be tested as single-packaged dedicated refrigeration systems.


3.5.2.11 *Variable-Capacity and Multiple-Capacity Dedicated Condensing Refrigeration Systems*

3.5.2.11.1 Manufacturer-Provided Equipment Overrides


Where needed, the manufacturer must provide a means for overriding the controls of the test unit so that the compressor(s) operates at the specified speed or capacity and the indoor blower operates at the speed consistent with the compressor operating level as would occur without override.


3.5.2.11.2 Compressor Operating Levels


For variable-capacity and multiple-capacity compressor systems, the minimum capacity for testing shall be the minimum capacity that the system control would operate the compressor in normal operation. Likewise, the maximum capacity for testing shall be the maximum capacity that the system control would operate the compressor in normal operation. For variable-speed compressor systems, the intermediate speed for testing shall be the average of the minimum and maximum speeds. For digital compressor systems, the intermediate duty cycle shall be the average of the minimum and maximum duty cycles. For multiple-capacity compressor systems with three capacity levels, the intermediate operating level for testing shall be the middle capacity level. For multiple-capacity compressor systems with more than three capacity levels, the intermediate operating level for testing shall be the level whose displacement ratio is closest to the average of the maximum and minimum displacement ratios.


3.5.2.11.3 Refrigeration Systems with Digital Compressor(s)


Use the test methods described in section 3.5.2.10.1 of this appendix as the secondary method of test for refrigeration systems with digital compressor(s) with modifications as described in this section. The Test Operating tolerance for refrigerant mass flow rate and suction pressure in Table 2 of AHRI 1250-2020 shall be ignored. Temperature and pressure measurements used to calculate shall be recorded at a frequency of once per second or faster and based on average values measured over the 30-minute test period.


3.5.2.11.3.1 For Matched pair (not including single-packaged systems) and Dedicated Condensing Unit refrigeration systems, the preliminary test in sections 3.5.2.10.1.2 and 3.5.2.10.1.3 of this appendix is not required. The liquid line and suction line shall be 25 feet ± 3 inches, not including the requisite flow meters. Also, the term in the equation to calculate net capacity shall be set equal to zero.


3.5.2.11.3.2 For Dedicated Condensing Unit refrigeration systems, the primary capacity measurement method shall be balanced ambient outdoor calorimeter, outdoor air enthalpy, or outdoor room calorimeter.
