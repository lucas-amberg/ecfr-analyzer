# § 431.442   Definitions.

The following definitions are applicable to this subpart:


*Alternative efficiency determination method,* or AEDM, means, with respect to a small electric motor, a method of calculating the total power loss and average full-load efficiency.


*Average full-load efficiency* means the arithmetic mean of the full-load efficiencies of a population of small electric motors of duplicate design, where the full-load efficiency of each motor in the population is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the motor's useful power output to its total power input when the motor is operated at its full rated load, rated voltage, and rated frequency.


*Basic model* means, with respect to a small electric motor, all units of a given type of small electric motor (or class thereof) manufactured by a single manufacturer, and which have the same rating, have electrical characteristics that are essentially identical, and do not have any differing physical or functional characteristics that affect energy consumption or efficiency. For the purpose of this definition, “rating” means a combination of the small electric motor's group (i.e., capacitor-start, capacitor-run; capacitor-start, induction-run; or polyphase), horsepower rating (or standard kilowatt equivalent), and number of poles with respect to which § 431.446 prescribes nominal full load efficiency standards.


*Breakdown torque* means the maximum torque that the motor will develop with rated voltage and frequency applied without an abrupt drop in speed. The breakdown torque is the local maximum of the torque-speed plot of the motor, closest to the synchronous speed of the motor, determined in accordance with NEMA MG 1-2016 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.443).


*CSA* means Canadian Standards Association.


*DOE* or *the Department* means the U.S. Department of Energy.


*EPCA* means the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6291-6317.


*IEC* means International Electrotechnical Commission.


*IEEE* means Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.


*NEMA* means National Electrical Manufacturers Association.


*Rated frequency* means 60 hertz.


*Rated load* (or *full load, full rated load,* or *rated full load*) means the rated output power of a small electric motor.


*Rated output power* means the mechanical output power that corresponds to the small electric motor's breakdown torque as specified in NEMA MG 1-2016 Table 10-5 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.443) for single-phase motors or 140 percent of the breakdown torque values specified in NEMA MG 1-2016 Table 10-5 for polyphase motors. For purposes of this definition, NEMA MG 1-2016 Table 10-5 is applied regardless of whether elements of NEMA MG 1-2016 Table 10-5 are identified as for small or medium motors.


*Rated voltage* means the input voltage of a small electric motor used when making representations of the performance characteristics of a given small electric motor and selected by the motor's manufacturer to be used for testing the motor's efficiency.


*Small electric motor* means a NEMA general purpose alternating current single-speed induction motor, built in a two-digit frame number series in accordance with NEMA Standards Publication MG1-1987, including IEC metric equivalent motors.
