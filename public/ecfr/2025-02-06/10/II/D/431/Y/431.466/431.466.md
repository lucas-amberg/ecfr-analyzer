(1) *Pump nameplate*—(i) *Required information.* The permanent nameplate must be marked clearly with the following information:


(A) For bare pumps and pumps sold with electric motors but not continuous or non-continuous controls, the rated pump energy index—constant load (PEI_CL_), and for pumps sold with motors and continuous or non-continuous controls, the rated pump energy index—variable load (PEI_VL_);


(B) The bare pump model number; and


(C) If transferred directly to an end-user, the unit's impeller diameter, as distributed in commerce. Otherwise, a space must be provided for the impeller diameter to be filled in.


(ii) *Display of required information.* All orientation, spacing, type sizes, typefaces, and line widths to display this required information must be the same as or similar to the display of the other performance data on the pump's permanent nameplate. The PEI_CL_ or PEI_VL_, as appropriate to a given pump model, must be identified in the form “PEI_CL_ ________” or “PEI_VL_ ________.” The model number must be in one of the following forms: “Model ________” or “Model number ________” or “Model No. ________.” The unit's impeller diameter must be in the form “Imp. Dia. ________(in.).”


(2) *Disclosure of efficiency information in marketing materials.* (i) The same information that must appear on a pump's permanent nameplate pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, must also be prominently displayed:


(A) On each page of a catalog that lists the pump; and

(1) *Pump nameplate*—(i) *Required information.* The permanent nameplate must be marked clearly with the following information:


(A) The weighted energy factor (WEF); and


(B) The dedicated-purpose pool pump motor total horsepower.


(ii) *Display of required information.* All orientation, spacing, type sizes, typefaces, and line widths to display this required information must be the same as or similar to the display of the other performance data on the pump's permanent nameplate.


(A) The WEF must be identified in the form “WEF ________.”


(B) The dedicated-purpose pool pump motor total horsepower must be identified in one of the following forms: “Dedicated-purpose pool pump motor total horsepower __________,” “DPPP motor total horsepower __________,” “motor total horsepower __________,” “motor THP __________,” or “THP __________.”


(2) [Reserved]
