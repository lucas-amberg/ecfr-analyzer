# Appendix B to Subpart Y of Part 431—Uniform Test Method for the Measurement of Energy Efficiency of Dedicated-Purpose Pool Pumps


A.1 Test Method. To determine the weighted energy factor (WEF) for dedicated-purpose pool pumps, perform “wire-to-water” testing in accordance with HI 40.6-2014-B, except section 40.6.4.1, “Vertically suspended pumps”; section 40.6.4.2, “Submersible pumps”; section 40.6.5.3, “Test report”; section 40.6.5.5, “Test conditions”; section 40.6.5.5.2, “Speed of rotation during testing”; section 40.6.6.1, “Translation of test results to rated speed of rotation”; section 40.6.6.2, “Pump efficiency”; section 40.6.6.3, “Performance curve”; section A.7, “Testing at temperatures exceeding 30 °C (86  °F)”; and appendix B, “Reporting of test results”; (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463) with the modifications and additions as noted throughout the provisions below. Do not use the test points specified in section 40.6.5.5.1, “Test procedure” of HI 40.6-2014-B and instead use those test points specified in section D.3 of this appendix for the applicable dedicated-purpose pool pump variety and speed configuration. When determining overall efficiency, best efficiency point, or other applicable pump energy performance information, section 40.6.5.5.1, “Test procedure”; section 40.6.6.2, “Pump efficiency”; and section 40.6.6.3, “Performance curve” must be used, as applicable. For the purposes of applying this appendix, the term “volume per unit time,” as defined in section 40.6.2, “Terms and definitions,” of HI 40.6-2014-B shall be deemed to be synonymous with the term “flow rate” used throughout that standard and this appendix.


A.2. Calculations and Rounding. All terms and quantities refer to values determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in this appendix for the rated pump. Perform all calculations using raw measured values without rounding. Round WEF, EF, maximum head, vertical lift, and true priming time values to the tenths place (*i.e.,* 0.1) and rated hydraulic horsepower to the thousandths place (*i.e.,* 0.001). Round all other reported values to the hundredths place unless otherwise specified.


B.1 For the purposes of measuring flow rate, speed of rotation, temperature, and pump power output, the equipment specified in HI 40.6-2014-B Appendix C (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463) necessary to measure head, speed of rotation, flow rate, and temperature must be used and must comply with the stated accuracy requirements in HI 40.6-2014-B Table 40.6.3.2.3, except as specified in section B.1.1 and B.1.2 of this appendix. When more than one instrument is used to measure a given parameter, the combined accuracy, calculated as the root sum of squares of individual instrument accuracies, must meet the specified accuracy requirements.


B.1.1 Electrical measurement equipment for determining the driver power input to the motor or controls must be capable of measuring true root mean squared (RMS) current, true RMS voltage, and real power up to the 40th harmonic of fundamental supply source frequency, and have a combined accuracy of ±2.0 percent of the measured value at the fundamental supply source frequency.


B.1.2 Instruments for measuring distance (*e.g.,* height above the reference plane or water level) must be accurate to and have a resolution of at least ±0.1 inch.


B.2 Calibration. Calibration requirements for instrumentation are specified in appendix D of HI 40.6-2014-B (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463). Historical calibration data may be used to justify time periods up to three times longer than those specified in table D.1 of HI 40.6-2014-B provided the supporting historical data shows maintenance of calibration of the given instrument up to the selected extended calibration interval on at least two unique occasions, based on the interval specified in HI 40.6-2014-B.


C.1 Pump Specifications. Conduct testing at full impeller diameter in accordance with the test conditions, stabilization requirements, and specifications of HI 40.6-2014-B section 40.6.3, “Pump efficiency testing”; section 40.6.4, “Considerations when determining the efficiency of a pump”; section 40.6.5.4 (including appendix A), “Test arrangements”; and section 40.6.5.5, “Test conditions” (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463).


C.2 Power Supply Requirements. The following conditions also apply to the mains power supplied to the DPPP motor or controls, if any:


(1) Maintain the voltage within ±5 percent of the rated value of the motor,


(2) Maintain the frequency within ±1 percent of the rated value of the motor,


(3) Maintain the voltage unbalance of the power supply within ±3 percent of the value with which the motor was rated, and


(4) Maintain total harmonic distortion below 12 percent throughout the test.


C.3 Test Conditions. Testing must be carried out with water that is between 50 and 107 °F with less than or equal to 15 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU).


C.4 Tolerances. For waterfall pumps, multi-speed self-priming and non-self-priming pool filter pumps, and variable-speed self-priming and non-self-priming pool filter pumps all measured load points must be within ±2.5 percent of the specified head value and comply with any specified flow values or thresholds. For all other dedicated-purpose pool pumps, all measured load points must be within the greater of ±2.5 percent of the specified flow rate values or ±0.5 gpm and comply with any specified head values or thresholds.


D.1 Damping Devices. Use of damping devices, as described in section 40.6.3.2.2 of HI 40.6-2014-B (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463), are only permitted to integrate up to the data collection interval used during testing.

F.1 Test Method. Determine the vertical lift and true priming time of non-self-priming pool filter pumps and self-priming pool filter pumps that are not already certified as self-priming under NSF/ANSI 50-2015 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463) by testing such pumps pursuant to section C.3 of appendix C of NSF/ANSI 50-2015, except for the modifications and exceptions listed in the following sections F.1.1 through F.1.5 of this appendix:


F.1.1 Where section C.3.2, “Apparatus,” and section C.3.4, “Self-priming capability test method,” of NSF/ANSI 50-2015 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463) state that the “suction line must be essentially as shown in annex C, figure C.1;” the phrase “essentially as shown in Annex C, figure C.1” means:


• The centerline of the pump impeller shaft is situated a vertical distance equivalent to the specified vertical lift (VL), calculated in accordance with section F.1.1.1. of this appendix, above the water level of a water tank of sufficient volume as to maintain a constant water surface level for the duration of the test;


• The pump draws water from the water tank with a riser pipe that extends below the water level a distance of at least 3 times the riser pipe diameter (*i.e.,* 3 pipe diameters);


• The suction inlet of the pump is at least 5 pipe diameters from any obstructions, 90° bends, valves, or fittings; and


• The riser pipe is of the same pipe diameter as the pump suction inlet.


F.1.1.1 The vertical lift (VL) must be normalized to 5.0 feet at an atmospheric pressure of 14.7 psia and a water density of 62.4 lb/ft
3 in accordance with the following equation:


F.1.2 The equipment accuracy requirements specified in section B, “Measurement Equipment,” of this appendix also apply to this section F, as applicable.


F.1.2.1 All measurements of head (gauge pressure), flow, and water temperature must be taken at the pump suction inlet and all head measurements must be normalized back to the centerline of the pump impeller shaft in accordance with section A.3.1.3.1 of HI 40.6-2014-B (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463).


F.1.3 All tests must be conducted with clear water that meets the requirements adopted in section C.3 of this appendix.


F.1.4 In section C.3.4, “Self-priming capability test method,” of NSF/ANSI 50-2015 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463), “the elapsed time to steady discharge gauge reading or full discharge flow” is determined when the changes in head and flow, respectively, are within the tolerance values specified in table 40.6.3.2.2, “Permissible amplitude of fluctuation as a percentage of mean value of quantity being measured at any test point,” of HI 40.6-2014-B (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463). The measured priming time (MPT) is determined as the point in time when the stabilized load point is first achieved, not when stabilization is determined. In addition, the true priming time (TPT) is equivalent to the MPT.


F.1.5 The maximum true priming time for each test run must not exceed 10.0 minutes. Disregard section C.3.5 of NSF/ANSI 50-2015 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.463).


G.1 Energy Factor. When making representations regarding the EF of dedicated-purpose pool pumps, determine EF on one of four system curves (A, B, C, or D) and at any given speed (*s*) according to the following equation:


G.1.1 System Curves. The energy factor may be determined at any speed (*s*) and on any of the four system curves A, B, C, and/or D specified in the Table 3:


G.2 Replacement Dedicated-Purpose Pool Pump Motors. To determine the WEF for replacement DPPP motors, test each replacement DPPP motor paired with each dedicated-purpose pool pump bare pump for which the replacement DPPP motor is advertised to be paired, as stated in the manufacturer's literature for that replacement DPPP motor model, according to the testing and calculations described in sections A, B, C, D, and E of this appendix. Alternatively, each replacement DPPP motor may be tested with the most consumptive dedicated-purpose pool pump bare pump for which it is advertised to be paired, as stated in the manufacturer's literature for that replacement DPPP motor model. If a replacement DPPP motor is not advertised to be paired with any specific dedicated-purpose pool pump bare pumps, test with the most consumptive dedicated-purpose pool pump bare pump available.
