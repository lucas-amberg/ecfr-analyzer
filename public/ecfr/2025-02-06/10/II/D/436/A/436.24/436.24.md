# ยง 436.24   Uncertainty analyses.

If particular items of cost data or timing of cash flows are uncertain and are not fixed under ยง 436.14, Federal agencies may examine the impact of uncertainty on the calculation of life cycle cost effectiveness or the assignment of rank order by conducting additional analyses using any standard engineering economics method such as sensitivity and probabilistic analysis. If additional analysis casts substantial doubt on the life cycle cost analysis results, a Federal agency should consider obtaining more reliable data or eliminating the building energy or water system alternative.
