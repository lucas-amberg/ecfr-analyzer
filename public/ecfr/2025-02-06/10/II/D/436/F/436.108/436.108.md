Such a response will either (1) grant the request with any conditions determined to be necessary to further the purposes of this subpart, (2) deny the request based on a determination that the reasons given in the request for a waiver do not establish a need that takes precedence over the futherance of the purposes of this subpart, or (3) deny the request based on the failure to submit adequate information upon which to grant a waiver.

The agency official that submitted the request may attend any scheduled meeting of the “656” Committee at which the request is planned to be discussed. The determination to approve or disapprove a request for a waiver shall be made by the Under Secretary.
