(1) The screening of applicants for eligibility for available State funds; 


(2) The identification of applicants which are seeking or have obtained private sector funds; and, 


(3) Limiting or excluding (at the option of the State) the availability of financial assistance under this part for funding particular measures for which funding is being provided by other sources in the State (such as utility rebates) together with any requirements for potential applicants to first seek other sources of funding and document the results of that attempt before seeking financial assistance under this part and a description of the State's plan to assist potential applicants in identifying and obtaining other sources of funding;


(n) The procedures for determining that technical assistance programs performed without the use of Federal funds and used as the basis for energy conservation measure grant applications have been performed in compliance with the requirements of § 455.62, for the purposes of satisfying the eligibility requirements contained in § 455.71(a)(3);


(o) The State's policy regarding reasonable selection of energy conservation measures for study in a technical assistance program including any restrictions based on category of building or on groups of structures where measures may, or may not, be appropriate for all the structures and any additional State requirements for the conduct of such a program;
