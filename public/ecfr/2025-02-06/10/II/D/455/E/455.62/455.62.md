# § 455.62   Contents of a technical assistance program.

(a) The purpose of a technical assistance program is to provide a report based on an on-site analysis of the building which meets the requirements of this section and the State's procedures for implementing this section. 


(b) A technical assistance program shall be designed to identify and document energy conservation maintenance and operating procedure changes and energy conservation measures in sufficient detail to support possible application for an energy conservation measure grant and to provide reviewers and decision makers handling such applications sufficient information upon which to base a judgment as to their reasonableness and a decision whether to pursue any or all of the recommended improvements. 


(c) A technical assistance program shall be conducted by a technical assistance analyst who has the qualifications established in the State Plan in accordance with § 455.20(r). 


(d) At the conclusion of a technical assistance program, the technical assistance analyst shall prepare a report which shall include: 


(1) A description of building characteristics and energy data including: 


(i) The results of the energy audit or energy use evaluation of the building together with a statement as to the accuracy and completeness of the energy audit or energy use evaluation data and recommendations;


(ii) The operation characteristics of energy-using systems; and 


(iii) The estimated remaining useful life of the building; 


(2) An analysis of the estimated energy consumption of the building, by fuel type in total Btus and Btu/sq.ft./yr., using conversion factors prescribed by the State in the State Plan, at optimum efficiency (assuming implementation of all energy conservation maintenance and operating procedures); 


(3) A description and analysis of all identified energy conservation maintenance and operating procedure changes, if any, and energy conservation measures selected in accordance with the State Plan, including renewable resource measures, setting forth: 


(i) A description of each energy conservation maintenance and operating procedure change and an estimate of the costs of adopting such energy conservation maintenance and operating procedure changes; 


(ii) An estimate of the cost of design, acquisition and installation of each energy conservation measure, discussing pertinent assumptions as necessary; 


(iii) Estimated useful life of each energy conservation measure; 


(iv) An estimate of any increases or decreases in maintenance and operating costs that would result from each conservation measure, if relevant to the cost effectiveness test applicable under this part; 


(v) An estimate of any significant salvage value or disposal cost of each energy conservation measure at the end of its useful life if relevant to the cost effectiveness test applicable under this part; 


(vi) An estimate, supported by all data and assumptions used in arriving at the estimate, of the annual energy savings, the annual cost of energy to be saved, and total annual cost savings using current energy prices including demand charges expected from each energy conservation maintenance and operating procedure change and the acquisition and installation of each energy conservation measure. In calculating the potential annual energy savings, annual cost of energy to be saved, or total annual cost savings of each energy conservation measure, including renewable resource measures, the technical assistance analyst shall: 


(A) Assume that all energy savings obtained from energy conservation maintenance and operating procedures have been realized; 


(B) Calculate the total annual energy savings, annual cost of energy to be saved, and total annual cost savings, by fuel type, expected to result from the acquisition and installation of the energy conservation measures, taking into account the interaction among the various measures; 


(C) Calculate that portion of the total annual energy savings, annual cost of energy to be saved, and total annual cost savings, as determined in paragraph (d)(3)(vi)(B) of this section, attributable to each individual energy conservation measure; and 


(D) Consider climate and other variables; 


(vii) An analysis of the cost effectiveness of each energy conservation measure consistent with § 455.63 and, if applicable, § 455.64 of this part; 


(viii) The estimated cost of the measure, which shall be the total cost for design and other professional service (excluding the cost of a technical assistance program), if any, and acquisition and installation costs. If required by the State in its State Plan, or if requested by the applicant, the technical assistance report shall provide a life-cycle cost analysis which is consistent with § 455.64 and states the discount and energy cost escalation rates that were used; 


(ix) The simple payback period of each energy conservation measure, calculated pursuant to § 455.63(a); 


(4) Energy use and cost data, actual or estimated, for each fuel type used for the prior 12-month period, by month, if possible; 


(5) Documentation of demand charges paid by the institution for the prior 12-month period, by month if possible, when demand charges are included in current energy prices or when the technical assistance report recommends an energy conservation measure that shifts energy usage to periods of lower demand and cost; and 


(6) A signed and dated certification that the technical assistance program has been conducted in accordance with the requirements of this section and that the data presented is accurate to the best of the technical assistance analyst's knowledge.
