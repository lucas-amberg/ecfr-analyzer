# § 455.63   Cost-effectiveness testing.

(a) This paragraph applies to calculation of the simple payback period of energy conservation measures. 


(1) The simple payback period of each energy conservation measure (except measures to shift demand, or renewable resource measures) shall be calculated, taking into account the interactions among the various measures, by dividing the estimated total cost of the measure, as determined pursuant to § 455.62(d)(3)(ii), by the estimated annual cost savings accruing from the measure (adjusted for demand charges), as determined pursuant to § 455.62(d)(3)(vi), provided that: 


(i) At least 50 percent of the annual cost savings used in this calculation shall be from the cost of the energy to be saved or a higher percent if required by a State in its State Plan pursuant to § 455.20(u)(3); and 


(ii) No more than 50 percent of the annual cost savings used in this calculation shall be from other cost savings, such as those resulting from energy conservation maintenance and operating procedures related to particular energy conservation measures, or from changes in type of fuel used, or a lower percent if required by a State in its State Plan pursuant to § 455.20(u)(3). 


(2) The simple payback period of each renewable resource energy conservation measure shall be calculated, taking into account the interactions among the various measures, by dividing the estimated total cost of the measure, as determined pursuant to § 455.62(d)(3)(ii), by the estimated annual cost savings accruing from the measure taking into account at least the annual cost of the non-renewable fuels displaced less the annual cost of the renewable fuel, if any, and the annual cost of any backup non-renewable fuel needed to operate the system, adjusted for demand charges, as determined pursuant to § 455.62(d)(3)(vi). 


(3) The simple payback period of each energy conservation measure designed to shift demand to a period of lower demand and lower cost shall be calculated, taking into account the interactions among the various measures, by dividing the estimated total cost of the measure, as determined pursuant to § 455.62(d)(3)(ii), by the estimated annual cost savings accruing from the measure taking into account at least the annual cost of the energy used before the measure is installed less the estimated annual cost of the energy to be used after the measure is installed, adjusted for demand charges, as determined pursuant to § 455.62(d)(3)(vi). 


(b) This paragraph applies, in addition to paragraph (a) of this section, if the State plan requires the cost effectiveness of an energy conservation measure to be determined by life-cycle cost analysis or if the applicant requests such an analysis. 


(1) A life-cycle cost analysis, showing a savings-to-investment ratio greater than or equal to one over the useful life of the energy conservation measure or 15 years, whichever is less, shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements set forth in the State Plan pursuant to §§ 455.20(u)(2), 455.20(u)(3) and § 455.64. 


(2) The resulting savings-to-investment ratio shall be used for the purpose of ranking applications.
