# ยง 460.104   Building thermal envelope air leakage.

Manufactured homes must be sealed against air leakage at all joints, seams, and penetrations associated with the building thermal envelope in accordance with the component manufacturer's installation instructions and the requirements set forth in table 1 to 460.104. Sealing methods between dissimilar materials must allow for differential expansion, contraction and mechanical vibration, and must establish a continuous air barrier upon installation of all opaque components of the building thermal envelope. All gaps and penetrations in the exterior ceiling, exterior floor, and exterior walls, including ducts, flue shafts, plumbing, piping, electrical wiring, utility penetrations, bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans, recessed lighting fixtures adjacent to unconditioned space, and light tubes adjacent to unconditioned space, must be sealed with caulk, foam, gasket or other suitable material. The air barrier installation criteria are adapted from section R402 of the 2021 IECC.
