# § 473.10   Required information from applicant.

In accordance with applicable procedures of § 473.11 any applicant for a grant, cooperative agreement, or contract under the Act to support research and development activities of an advanced automobile propulsion system shall—


(a) State whether the activities will initiate or continue research and development of an advanced automobile propulsion system; 


(b) State, insofar as the applicant has information, whether and to what extent the activities to be supported are technically the same as activities conducted previously or to be conducted during the annual funding period by any person for research and development of a substantially similar advanced automobile propulsion system; 


(c) Justify research and development activities on an advanced automobile propulsion system abandoned by any person because of a lack of mass production potential by presenting information showing a significant intervening technological advance, promising conceptual innovation, or other special consideration; 


(d) Provide—


(1) An assurance that the amount of funds to be expended for research and development of advanced automobile propulsion systems during the initial annual funding period will exceed the amount of funds expended, if any, during the previous year for the same purpose by at least the amount of the grant, cooperative agreement, or contract being sought; and 


(2) An assurance that the level of research and development effort on advanced automobile propulsion systems in the initial annual funding period will not be decreased in future annual funding periods. 


(e) Provide to the extent possible—


(1) An assurance that the time period for completing research and development of the advanced automobile propulsion is likely to be shorter as a result of a grant, cooperative agreement, or contract; and 


(2) The estimated delay, if any, which is likely to occur if the application for a grant, cooperative agreement, or contract is denied.
