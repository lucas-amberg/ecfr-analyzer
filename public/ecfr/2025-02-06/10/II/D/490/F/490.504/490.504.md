# § 490.504   Credit allocation.

(a) Based on annual credit activity report information, as described in § 490.508, DOE shall allocate:


(1) One alternative fueled vehicle credit for each alternative fueled vehicle, regardless of the vehicle's gross vehicle weight rating, that a fleet or covered person acquires in excess of the number of light duty alternative fueled vehicles that the fleet or covered person is required to acquire under § 490.201 or § 490.302; and


(2) One-half of an alternative fueled vehicle credit for each medium- or heavy-duty fuel cell electric vehicle that is not an alternative fueled vehicle and each medium- or heavy-duty electric vehicle that is not an alternative fueled vehicle, either or both of which a fleet or covered person acquires in excess of the number of light duty alternative fueled vehicles that the fleet or covered person is required to acquire under § 490.201 or § 490.302.


(b) If an alternative fueled vehicle, regardless of the vehicle's gross vehicle weight rating, is acquired by a fleet or covered person in a model year before the first model year that the fleet or covered person is required to acquire light duty alternative fueled vehicles by this part, as reported in the annual credit activity report, DOE shall allocate one credit per alternative fueled vehicle for each year the alternative fueled vehicle is acquired before the model year when acquisition requirements apply.


(c) DOE shall allocate credits to fleets and covered persons under paragraph (b) of this section only for alternative fueled vehicles acquired on or after October 24, 1992.


(d) Based on annual credit activity report information, as described in § 490.508, DOE shall allocate alternative fueled vehicle credit in the amount set forth below for the associated creditable actions that a fleet or covered person undertakes as described in § 490.503(d):


(1) A hybrid electric vehicle that is a light duty motor vehicle, but that is not an alternative fueled vehicle—
1/2 credit;


(2) A plug-in electric drive vehicle that is a light duty motor vehicle, but that is not an alternative fueled vehicle—
1/2 credit;


(3) A fuel cell electric vehicle that is a light duty motor vehicle, but that is not an alternative fueled vehicle—
1/2 credit; and


(4) A neighborhood electric vehicle—
1/4 credit.


(e) Based on annual credit activity report information, as described in § 490.508, DOE shall allocate one alternative fueled vehicle credit for every $25,000 that a fleet or covered person invests, as described in § 490.503(c), in:


(1) Alternative fuel infrastructure that is:


(i) Publicly accessible, provided that the maximum number of credits under this paragraph shall not exceed ten for the model year and the alternative fuel infrastructure became operational in the same model year, and provided further that the total number of credits allocated under this paragraph (e)(1)(i) and paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section do not exceed ten in a given model year; or


(ii) Not publicly accessible, provided that the maximum number of credits under this paragraph shall not exceed five for the model year and the alternative fuel infrastructure became operational in the same model year, and provided further that the total number of credits allocated under this paragraph (e)(1)(ii) and paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section do not exceed ten in a given model year; or


(2) Alternative fuel non-road equipment, provided that the maximum number of credits under this paragraph (e)(2) shall not exceed five for the model year, and provided further that the equipment is being operated on alternative fuel.


(f) Based on annual credit activity report information, as described in § 490.508 of this subpart, DOE shall allocate two alternative fueled vehicle credits for the first $50,000, and one alternative fueled vehicle credit for every $25,000 thereafter, that a fleet or covered person invests, as described in § 490.503(c), in emerging technology, provided that the maximum number of credits under this paragraph (f) shall not exceed five for the model year, and provided further that the amount for which credit is allocated under this paragraph has not been the basis for credit allocation under paragraphs (a), (b), or (d) of this section.


(g) A fleet or covered person may aggregate the amount of money invested in alternative fuel infrastructure, alternative fuel non-road equipment, and emerging technology such that funds from multiple categories may be used to achieve the applicable threshold for the purpose of earning an alternative fueled vehicle credit, so long as no funds are aggregated from a category for which the fleet has already been allocated the maximum number of credits allowed for that category, as set forth in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.
