(iii) The number of required alternative fueled vehicles existing in the fleet that were acquired during years in which no waiver was in force; and excluding


(iv) Any required alternative fuel vehicles acquired during a waiver or non-waiver year or light-duty vehicles acquired in lieu of alternative fuels vehicles during a waiver year that are to be retired before the beginning of the waiver year;


(3) The anticipated amount of gasoline and diesel and alternative fuel (calculated in gasoline gallon equivalents (gge)) to be used by the covered light-duty vehicles in the fleet for the waiver year including an estimate of per vehicle average fuel use in these vehicles;


(4) A petroleum reduction plan as described in paragraph (d) of this section; and
