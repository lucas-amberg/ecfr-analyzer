# § 501.51   Prohibitions by order—electing powerplants.

(a) OFE may prohibit by order the use of petroleum or natural gas as a primary energy source or in amounts in excess of the minimum amount necessary to maintain reliability of operation consistent with reasonable fuel efficiency in an electing powerplant, if: 


(1) That facility has not been identified as a member of a category subject to a final rule at the time of the issuance of such order; and 


(2) The requirements of § 504.6 have been met. 


(b) *Notice of order and public participation.* (1) OFE may hold a conference with the proposed order recipient prior to issuing the proposed order. 


(2) Pursuant to section 701 of FUA, prior to the issuance of a final order to an electing powerplant, OFE shall publish a proposed order in the _Federal Register_ together with a statement of the reasons for the order. In the case of a proposed order that would prohibit the use of petroleum or natural gas as a primary energy source, the finding required by former section 301(b)(1) of the Act shall be published with such proposed order.


(3) OFE shall provide a period for the submission of written comments of at least three months after the date of the proposed order. During this period, the recipient of the proposed order and any other interested person must submit any evidence that they have determined at that time to support their respective positions as to each of the findings that OFE is required to make under section 301(b) of the Act. A proposed order recipient may submit additional new evidence at any time prior to the close of the public comment period which follows publication of the Tentative Staff Analysis or prior to the close of the record of any public hearing, whichever occurs later. A request by the proposed order recipient for an extension of the three-month period may be granted at OFE's discretion.


(4) Subsequent to the end of the comment period, OFE will issue a notice of whether OFE intends to proceed with the prohibition order proceeding. 


(5) An owner or operator of a facility that may be subject to an order may demonstrate prior to issuance of a final prohibition order that the facility would qualify for an exemption if the prohibition had been established by rule. OFE will not delay the issuance of a final prohibition order or stay the effective date of such an order for the purpose of determining whether a proposed order recipient qualifies for a particular exemption unless the demonstration or qualification is submitted prior to or during the second three-month comment period, commencing after issuance of a notice of intention to proceed, or unless materials submitted after the period (i) could not have been submitted during the period through the exercise of due diligence, (ii) address material changes in fact or law occurring after the close of the period, or (iii) consist of amplification or rebuttal occasioned by the subsequent course of the proceeding. A request by the proposed order recipient for an extension of this time period may be granted at OFE's discretion. 


(6) Subsequent to the end of the second three (3) month period, OFE will, if it intends to issue a final prohibition order, prepare and issue a Notice of Availability of a Tentative Staff Analysis. Interested persons wishing a hearing must request a hearing within forty-five (45) day after issuance of the Notice of Availability of the Tentative Staff Analysis. During this forty-five (45) days period, interested persons may also submit written comments on the Tentative Staff Analysis. 


(7) If a hearing has been requested, OFE shall provide interested persons with an opportunity to present oral data, views and arguments at a public hearing held in accordance with subpart C of this part. The hearing will consider the findings which OFE must make in order to issue a final prohibition order and any exemption for which the proposed order recipient submitted its demonstration in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section. 


(8) Upon request by the recipient of the proposed prohibition order, the combined public comment periods provided for in this section may be reduced to a minimum of forty-five (45) days from the time of publication of the proposed order. 


(9) OFE may terminate a prohibition order proceeding at any time prior to the date upon which a final order shall become effective. Should OFE terminate the proceeding, it will notify the proposed order recipient, and publish a notice in the _Federal Register._

(c) *Decision to issue a final order.* (1) OFE will base its determination to issue an order on consideration of the whole record or those parts thereof cited by a party and supported by and in accordance with reliable, probative and substantial evidence. 


(2) OFE shall include in the final order a written statement of the pertinent facts, a statement of the basis upon which the final order is issued, a recitation of the conclusions regarding the required findings and qualifications for exemptions. The final order shall state the effective date of the prohibition contained therein. If it is demonstrated that the facility would have been granted a temporary exemption, the effective date of the prohibition contained in the final order shall be delayed until such time as the temporary exemption would have terminated. If it is demonstrated that a facility will need a period of time to comply with the final order, the effective date of the prohibition contained in the final order may be delayed, in OFE's discretion, so as to allow an order recipient to comply with the final order. 


(3) OFE will enclose with a copy of the final order, where appropriate, a schedule of steps that should be taken by a stated date (a compliance schedule) to ensure that the affected facility will be able to comply with the prohibitions stated in the order by the effective date of the prohibition contained in the final order. The compliance schedule may require the affected person to take steps with regard to a unit 60 days after service of the final order. 


(4) A copy of the final order and a summary of the basis therefore will be published in the _Federal Register._ The order will become effective 60 days after publication in the _Federal Register._

(d) *Request for order.* (1) A proceeding for issuance of a prohibition order to a specific unit may be commenced by OFE, in its sole discretion, in response to a request for an order filed by the owner or operator of a facility. 


(2) A petition requesting OFE to commence a prohibition order proceeding should include the following information for all units to be covered by the prohibition order: 


(i) A statement of the reasons the owner or operator is seeking the issuance of a prohibition order; and 


(ii) Sufficient information for OFE to make the findings required by section 301(b) of FUA.


(3) If OFE determines to accept the request, OFE shall publish a proposed order in the _Federal Register_ together with a statement of the reasons for the order.
