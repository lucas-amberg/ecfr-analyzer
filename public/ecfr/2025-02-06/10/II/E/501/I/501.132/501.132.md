(a) A request for an interpretation must contain a complete statement of all the facts believed to be relevant to the circumstances, acts or transactions that are the subject of the request. The facts must include the names and addresses of all potentially affected persons (if reasonably ascertainable) and a full discussion of the pertinent provisions and relevant facts contained in any documents submitted with the request.

(b) The requesting party must include in the request a discussion of all relevant legal authorities, rulings, regulations, interpretations and decisions on appeal relied upon to support the particular interpretation sought.


(c) DOE may refuse to issue an interpretation if it determines that there is insufficient information upon which to base an interpretation.
