(3) The granting of the exemption would be in the public interest and would be consistent with the purposes of the Act;


(4) The petitioner is not entitled to an exemption for lack of alternate fuel supply, site limitation, environmental requirements, or inability to obtain adequate capital at the site of the proposed powerplant or at any reasonable alternative site for the alternate fuel(s) considered; 


(5) At the proposed site and every reasonable alternative site where the petitioner is not entitled to an exemption for lack of alternate fuel supply, site limitation, environmental requirements, or inability to obtain adequate capital, the petitioner nevertheless would be barred at each such proposed or alternate site from burning an alternate fuel by reason of a State or local requirement; 


(6) No alternate power supply exists, as required under § 503.8 of these regulations; and
