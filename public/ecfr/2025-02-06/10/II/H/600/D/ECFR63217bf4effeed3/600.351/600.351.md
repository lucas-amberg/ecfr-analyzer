# ยง 600.351   Termination.

(a) Awards may be terminated in whole or in part only in accordance with one of the following:


(1) By the contracting officer, if a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award.


(2) By the contracting officer with the consent of the recipient, in which case the two parties must agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated.


(3) By the recipient upon sending to the contracting officer written notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. The recipient must provide such notice at least 30 calendar days prior to the effective date of the termination. However, if the contracting officer determines in the case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the award will not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made, he or she may terminate the award in its entirety.


(b) If the recipient incurred allowable costs prior to the termination, the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in ยง 600.361(b), including those related to property, apply to the termination of the award, and provision must be made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient after termination, as appropriate.
