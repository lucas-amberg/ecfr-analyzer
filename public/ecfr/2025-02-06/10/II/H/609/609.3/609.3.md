(iv) Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment Projects under section 1706 of Title XVII.


(2) A Project meeting the applicable eligibility requirements set forth herein constitutes an “Eligible Project” under Title XVII.


(b) An eligible Innovative Energy Project is a project that:


(1) Falls within a category set forth in section 1703(b) of Title XVII;


(2) Is located in the United States;


(3) Is at one location, except that the project may be located at two or more locations if the project is comprised of installations or facilities employing a single New or Significantly Improved Technology that is deployed pursuant to an integrated and comprehensive business plan.

(4) Deploys a New or Significantly Improved Technology; and


(5) Avoids, reduces, utilizes, or sequesters air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases.


(c) An eligible Innovative Supply Chain Project is a project that:


(1) Manufactures a product with an end-use set forth in section 1703(b) of Title XVII;


(2) Is located in the United States;


(3) Is at one location, except that the project may be located at two or more locations if the project is comprised of installations or facilities employing a single New or Significantly Improved Technology that is deployed pursuant to an integrated and comprehensive business plan. An Innovative Supply Chain Project located in more than one location is a single Eligible Project;


(4) Either:


(i) Deploys a New or Significantly Improved Technology in the manufacturing process; or


(ii) Manufactures a product that represents a New or Significantly Improved Technology; and


(5) Avoids, reduces, utilizes, or sequesters air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases through:


(i) The relevant manufacturing process of the relevant product; or


(ii) The end-use of the component on a full life-cycle basis.


(d) An eligible State Energy Financing Institution Project is a project that:


(1) Falls within a category set forth in section 1703(b) of Title XVII;

(e) An eligible Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment Project is a project that:


(1) Is located in the United States;


(2) Either:


(i) Enables operating Energy Infrastructure to avoid, reduce, utilize, or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases; or


(ii) Retools, repowers, repurposes, or replaces Energy Infrastructure that has ceased operations; provided that if such project involves electricity generation through the use of fossil fuels, such project shall be required to have controls or technologies to avoid, reduce, utilize, or sequester air pollutants and anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases; and


(3) May include the remediation of environmental damage associated with Energy Infrastructure.
