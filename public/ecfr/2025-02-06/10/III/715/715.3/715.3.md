# § 715.3   Definition of “Nonrecourse Project-Financed”.

*Nonrecourse project-financed* means when being financed by any debt, such debt is secured by the assets financed and the revenues received by the facility being financed including, but not limited to, part or all of the revenues received under one or more agreements for the sale of the electric output from the facility, and which neither an electric utility with a retail service territory, nor a public utility as defined by section 201(e) of the Federal Power Act, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 824(e), if any of its facilities are financed with general credit, is obligated to repay in whole or in part. A commitment to contribute equity or the contribution of equity to a facility by an electric utility shall not be considered an obligation of such utility to repay the debt of a facility. The existence of limited guarantees, commitments to pay for cost overruns, indemnity provisions, or other similar undertakings or assurances by the facility's owners or other project participants will not disqualify a facility from being “nonrecourse project-financed” as long as, at the time of the financing for the facility, the borrower is obligated to make repayment of the term debt from the revenues generated by the facility, rather than from other sources of funds. Projects that are 100 percent equity financed are also considered “nonrecourse project-financed” for purposes of section 416(a)(2)(B).
