# ยง 719.44   What categories of costs require advance approval?

(a) To be considered for reimbursement, costs incurred by retained legal counsel for the following require advance written approval from Department Counsel or the submission of subsequent specific justification to Department Counsel when circumstances out of the contractor's control make advance approval unobtainable:


(1) Computers or general application software, or non-routine computerized databases, if they are specifically created for a particular matter. For costs associated with the creation and use of computerized databases, contractors and retained legal counsel must ensure that the creation and use of computerized databases is necessary and cost-effective. Use of databases originally created by the Department or its contractors for other purposes, but that can be used to assist a contractor or retained legal counsel in connection with a particular matter, should be considered. Contractors and retained legal counsel must ensure that DOE is provided the discretion to obtain unlimited access to and dominion over any computers or general application software, or non-routine computerized databases specifically created for a particular matter;


(2) Secretarial and support services, word processing, or temporary support personnel;


(3) Attendance by more than one attorney at a deposition, court hearing or interview;


(4) Expert witnesses and consultants;


(5) Trade publications, books, treatises, background materials, and other similar documents;


(6) Professional or educational seminars and conferences;


(7) Preparation of bills or time spent responding to questions about bills from either the Department or the contractor;


(8) Food and beverages when the attorney or consultant is not on travel status and away from the home office;


(9) Pro hac vice admissions; and


(10) Time charged for law students' or interns' services.


(b) Requests for fee increases by retained legal counsel, other than those under contract directly with the Department, must be sent in writing to the contractor, who will review the request for reasonableness. If the contractor determines the request is reasonable, the contractor must seek approval for the increase from Department Counsel before it authorizes any increase. Contractors should attempt to lock in rates for partners, associates and paralegals for at least a two year period.
