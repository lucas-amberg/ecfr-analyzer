# ยง 780.47   Conditions and issuance of license.

(a) Upon receipt of the Board's decision and instruction to issue a patent license, the General Counsel shall issue a license which complies with the following: 


(1) The scope and durations of such use shall be limited to the purpose for which it was authorized; 


(2) Such use shall be non-exclusive; 


(3) Such use shall be non-assignable, except with that part of the enterprise or goodwill that enjoys such use; 


(4) Any such use shall be authorized predominantly for the supply of the U.S. market; and, 


(5) Authorization for such use shall be liable, subject to adequate protection of the legitimate interests of the persons so authorized, to be terminated if and when the circumstances that led to it cease to exist and are unlikely to recur. 


(b) The Board shall have the authority to review, on motivated request, the continued existence of these circumstances. The parties will propose and agree on a reasonable royalty fee within a reasonable time as determined by the General Counsel. A reasonable royalty shall provide adequate remuneration for the circumstances of each case, taking into account the economic value of the authorization. If a party does not agree with the terms and conditions of the license as determined by the General Counsel or if a royalty fee cannot be agreed upon within the reasonable time period established by the General Counsel, any party may, within 30 days after the expiration of such time period, initiate a proceeding before the Board, in accordance with subpart E of this part, for a reconsideration of the General Counsel's determination. After the proceeding under subpart E of this part is completed, the General Counsel shall modify the patent license in accordance with the Board's determination.
