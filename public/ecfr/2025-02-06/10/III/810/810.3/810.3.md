*Cooperative enrichment enterprise* means a multi-country or multi-company (where at least two of the companies are incorporated in different countries) joint development or production effort. The term includes a consortium of countries or companies or a multinational corporation.


*Country,* as well as government, nation, state, and similar entity, shall be read to include Taiwan, consistent with section 4 of the Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3303).


*Development* means any activity related to all phases before production such as: Design, design research, design analysis, design concepts, assembly and testing of prototypes, pilot production schemes, design data, process of transforming design data into a product, configuration design, integration design, and layouts.


*DOE* means the U.S. Department of Energy.


*Enrichment* means isotope separation of uranium or isotope separation of plutonium, regardless of the type of process or separation mechanism used.


*Fissile material* means isotopes that readily fission after absorbing a neutron of any energy, either fast or slow. Fissile materials are uranium-235, uranium-233, plutonium-239, and plutonium-241.


*Foreign national* means an individual who is not a citizen or national of the United States, but excludes U.S. lawful permanent residents and protected individuals under the Immigration and Naturalization Act (8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3)).


*Fundamental research* means basic and applied research in science and engineering, the results of which ordinarily are published and shared broadly within the scientific community, as distinguished from proprietary research and from industrial development, design, production, and product utilization, the results of which ordinarily are restricted for proprietary or national security reasons.


*General authorization* means an authorization granted by the Secretary under section 57 b.(2) of the Atomic Energy Act to provide assistance or technology to foreign atomic energy activities subject to this part and which does not require a request for, or the Secretary's issuance of, a specific authorization.


*IAEA* means the International Atomic Energy Agency.


*NNPA* means the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978, 22 U.S.C. 3201 *et seq.*

*NPT* means the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done on July 1, 1968.


*Nuclear reactor* means an apparatus, other than a nuclear explosive device, designed or used to sustain nuclear fission in a self-sustaining chain reaction.


*Operational safety* means the capability of a reactor to be operated in a manner that complies with national standards or requirements or widely-accepted international standards and recommendations to prevent uncontrolled or inadvertent criticality, prevent or mitigate uncontrolled release of radioactivity to the environment, monitor and limit staff exposure to radiation and radioactivity, and protect off-site population from exposure to radiation or radioactivity. Operational safety may be enhanced by providing expert advice, equipment, instrumentation, technology, software, services, analyses, procedures, training, or other assistance that improves the capability of the reactor to be operated in compliance with such standards, requirements or recommendations.


*Person* means:


(1) Any individual, corporation, partnership, firm, association, trust, estate, public or private institution;


(2) Any group, government agency other than DOE, or any State or political entity within a State; and


(3) Any legal successor, representative, agent, or agency of the foregoing.


*Production* means all production phases such as: Construction, production engineering, manufacture, integration, assembly or mounting, inspection, testing, and quality assurance.


*Production accelerator* means a particle accelerator especially designed, used, or intended for use with a production subcritical assembly.


*Production accelerator-driven subcritical assembly system* means a system comprised of a production subcritical assembly and a production accelerator and which is especially designed, used, or intended for the production of plutonium or uranium-233. In such a system, the production accelerator target provides a source of neutrons used to effect special nuclear material production in the production subcritical assembly.


*Production reactor* means a nuclear reactor especially designed or used primarily for the production of plutonium or uranium-233.


*Production subcritical assembly* means an apparatus that contains source material or special nuclear material to produce a nuclear fission chain reaction that is not self-sustaining and that is especially designed, used, or intended for the production of plutonium or uranium-233.


*Publicly available information* means information in any form that is generally accessible, without restriction, to the public.


*Publicly available technology* means technology that is already published or has been prepared for publication; arises during, or results from, fundamental research; or is included in an application filed with the U.S. Patent Office and eligible for foreign filing under 35 U.S.C. 184.


*Restricted Data* means all data concerning:


(1) Design, manufacture, or utilization of atomic weapons;


(2) The production of special nuclear material; or


(3) The use of special nuclear material in the production of energy, but shall not include data declassified or removed from the Restricted Data category pursuant to section 142 of the Atomic Energy Act.


*Secretary* means the Secretary of Energy.


*Sensitive nuclear technology* means any information (including information incorporated in a production or utilization facility or important component part thereof) which is not available to the public (see definition of “publicly available information”) and which is important to the design, construction, fabrication, operation, or maintenance of a uranium enrichment or nuclear fuel reprocessing facility or a facility for the production of heavy water, but shall not include Restricted Data controlled pursuant to chapter 12 of the Atomic Energy Act. The information may take a tangible form such as a model, prototype, blueprint, or operation manual or an intangible form such as assistance.


*Source material* means:


(1) Uranium or thorium, other than special nuclear material; or


(2) Ores that contain by weight 0.05 percent or more of uranium or thorium, or any combination of these materials.


*Special nuclear material* means:


(1) Plutonium,


(2) Uranium-233, or


(3) Uranium enriched above 0.711 percent by weight in the isotope uranium-235.


*Specific authorization* means an authorization granted by the Secretary under section 57b.(2) of the Atomic Energy Act, in response to an application filed under this part, to engage in specifically authorized nuclear activities subject to this part.


*Technical data* means data in such forms as blueprints, plans, diagrams, models, formulae, engineering designs, specifications, manuals, and instructions written or recorded on other media or devices such as disks, tapes, read-only memories, and computational methodologies, algorithms, and computer codes that can directly or indirectly affect the production of special nuclear material.


*Technology* means assistance or technical data required for the development, production or use of any plant, facility, or especially designed or prepared equipment for the activities described in § 810.2(b).


*Use* means operation, installation (including on-site installation), maintenance (checking), repair, overhaul, or refurbishing.
