# ยง 835.206   Limits for the embryo/fetus.

(a) The equivalent dose limit for the embryo/fetus from the period of conception to birth, as a result of occupational exposure of a declared pregnant worker, is 0.5 rem (0.005 Sv).


(b) Substantial variation above a uniform exposure rate that would satisfy the limits provided in ยง 835.206(a) shall be avoided.


(c) If the equivalent dose to the embryo/fetus is determined to have already exceeded 0.5 rem (0.005 Sv) by the time a worker declares her pregnancy, the declared pregnant worker shall not be assigned to tasks where additional occupational exposure is likely during the remaining gestation period.
