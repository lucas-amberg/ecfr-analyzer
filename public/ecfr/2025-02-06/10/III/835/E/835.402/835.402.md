# § 835.402   Individual monitoring.

(a) For the purpose of monitoring individual exposures to external radiation, personnel dosimeters shall be provided to and used by:


(1) Radiological workers who, under typical conditions, are likely to receive one or more of the following:


(i) An effective dose of 0.1 rem (0.001 Sv) or more in a year;


(ii) An equivalent dose to the skin or to any extremity of 5 rems (0.05 Sv) or more in a year;


(iii) An equivalent dose to the lens of the eye of 1.5 rems (0.015 Sv) or more in a year;


(2) Declared pregnant workers who are likely to receive from external sources an equivalent dose to the embryo/fetus in excess of 10 percent of the applicable limit at § 835.206(a); 


(3) Occupationally exposed minors likely to receive a dose in excess of 50 percent of the applicable limits at § 835.207 in a year from external sources;


(4) Members of the public entering a controlled area likely to receive a dose in excess of 50 percent of the limit at § 835.208 in a year from external sources; and


(5) Individuals entering a high or very high radiation area.


(b) External dose monitoring programs implemented to demonstrate compliance with § 835.402(a) shall be adequate to demonstrate compliance with the dose limits established in subpart C of this part and shall be:


(1) Accredited, or excepted from accreditation, in accordance with the DOE Laboratory Accreditation Program for Personnel Dosimetry; or


(2) Determined by the Secretarial Officer responsible for environment, safety and health matters to have performance substantially equivalent to that of programs accredited under the DOE Laboratory Accreditation Program for Personnel Dosimetry.


(c) For the purpose of monitoring individual exposures to internal radiation, internal dosimetry programs (including routine bioassay programs) shall be conducted for:


(1) Radiological workers who, under typical conditions, are likely to receive a committed effective dose of 0.1 rem (0.001 Sv) or more from all occupational radionuclide intakes in a year;


(2) Declared pregnant workers likely to receive an intake or intakes resulting in an equivalent dose to the embryo/fetus in excess of 10 percent of the limit stated at § 835.206(a);


(3) Occupationally exposed minors who are likely to receive a dose in excess of 50 percent of the applicable limit stated at § 835.207 from all radionuclide intakes in a year; or


(4) Members of the public entering a controlled area likely to receive a dose in excess of 50 percent of the limit stated at § 835.208 from all radionuclide intakes in a year.


(d) Internal dose monitoring programs implemented to demonstrate compliance with § 835.402(c) shall be adequate to demonstrate compliance with the dose limits established in subpart C of this part and shall be:


(1) Accredited, or excepted from accreditation, in accordance with the DOE Laboratory Accreditation Program for Radiobioassay; or,


(2) Determined by the Secretarial Officer responsible for environment, safety and health matters to have performance substantially equivalent to that of programs accredited under the DOE Laboratory Accreditation Program for Radiobioassy.
