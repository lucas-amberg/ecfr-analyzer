(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, material and equipment in contamination areas, high contamination areas, and airborne radioactivity areas shall not be released to a controlled area if:


(1) Removable surface contamination levels on accessible surfaces exceed the removable surface contamination values specified in appendix D of this part; or


(2) Prior use suggests that the removable surface contamination levels on inaccessible surfaces are likely to exceed the removable surface contamination values specified in appendix D of this part.


(b) Material and equipment exceeding the removable surface contamination values specified in appendix D of this part may be conditionally released for movement on-site from one radiological area for immediate placement in another radiological area only if appropriate monitoring is performed and appropriate controls for the movement are established and exercised.


(c) Material and equipment with fixed contamination levels that exceed the total contamination values specified in appendix D of this part may be released for use in controlled areas outside of radiological areas only under the following conditions:


(1) Removable surface contamination levels are below the removable surface contamination values specified in appendix D of this part; and


(2) The material or equipment is routinely monitored and clearly marked or labeled to alert personnel of the contaminated status.
