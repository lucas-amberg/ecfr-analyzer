# ยง 840.3   Determination of extraordinary nuclear occurrence.

If the DOE determines that both of the criteria set forth in ยง 840.4 and ยง 840.5 have been met, it will make the determination that there has been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence. If the DOE publishes a notice in the _Federal Register_ in accordance with ยง 840.2(a) and does not make a determination within 90 days thereafter that there has been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence, the alleged event will be deemed not to be an extraordinary nuclear occurrence. The time for the making of a determination may be extended by DOE by notice published in the _Federal Register._
