# ยง 850.25   Exposure reduction and minimization.

(a) The responsible employer must ensure that no worker is exposed above the exposure limit prescribed in ยง 850.22.


(b) The responsible employer must, in addition:


(1) Where exposure levels are at or above the action level, establish a formal exposure reduction and minimization program to reduce exposure levels to below the action level, if practicable. This program must be described in the responsible employer's CBDPP and must include:


(i) Annual goals for exposure reduction and minimization;


(ii) A rationale for and a strategy for meeting the goals;


(iii) Actions that will be taken to achieve the goals; and


(iv) A means of tracking progress towards meeting the goals or demonstrating that the goals have been met.


(2) Where exposure levels are below the action level, implement actions for reducing and minimizing exposures, if practicable. The responsible employer must include in the CBDPP a description of the steps to be taken for exposure reduction and minimization and a rationale for those steps.


(c) The responsible employer must implement exposure reduction and minimization actions using the conventional hierarchy of industrial hygiene controls (*i.e.,* engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment in that order).
