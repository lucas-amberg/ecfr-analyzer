(a) The responsible employer must provide protective clothing and equipment to beryllium workers and ensure its appropriate use and maintenance, where dispersible forms of beryllium may contact worker's skin, enter openings in workers' skin, or contact workers' eyes, including where:


(1) Exposure monitoring has established that airborne concentrations of beryllium are at or above the action level;


(2) Surface contamination levels measured or presumed prior to initiating work are above the level prescribed in ยง 850.30;


(3) Surface contamination levels results obtained to confirm housekeeping efforts are above the level prescribed in ยง 850.30; and


(4) Any beryllium-associated worker who requests the use of protective clothing and equipment for protection against airborne beryllium, regardless of measured exposure levels.


(b) The responsible employer must comply with 29 CFR 1910.132, Personal Protective Equipment General Requirements, when workers use personal protective clothing and equipment.


(c) The responsible employer must establish procedures for donning, doffing, handling, and storing protective clothing and equipment that:

(2) Include beryllium workers exchanging their personal clothing for full-body protective clothing and footwear before they begin work in regulated areas.

(1) Ensure that beryllium-contaminated protective clothing and equipment, when removed for laundering, cleaning, maintenance, or disposal, is placed in containers that prevent the dispersion of beryllium dust and that are labeled in accordance with ยง 850.38 of this part; and


(2) Inform organizations that launder or clean DOE beryllium-contaminated protective clothing or equipment that exposure to beryllium is potentially harmful, and that clothing and equipment should be laundered or cleaned in a manner prescribed by the responsible employer to prevent the release of airborne beryllium.
