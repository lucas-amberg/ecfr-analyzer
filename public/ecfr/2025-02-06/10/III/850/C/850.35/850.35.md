# § 850.35   Medical removal.

(a) *Medical removal protection.* The responsible employer must offer a beryllium-associated worker medical removal from exposure to beryllium if the SOMD determines in a written medical opinion that it is medically appropriate to remove the worker from such exposure. The SOMD's determination must be based on one or more positive Be-LPT results, chronic beryllium disease diagnosis, an examining physician's recommendation, or any other signs or symptoms that the SOMD deems medically sufficient to remove a worker.


(1) *Temporary removal pending final medical determination.* The responsible employer must offer a beryllium-associated worker temporary medical removal from exposure to beryllium on each occasion that the SOMD determines in a written medical opinion that the worker should be temporarily removed from such exposure pending a final medical determination of whether the worker should be removed permanently.


(i) In this section, “final medical determination” means the outcome of the multiple physician review process or the alternate medical determination process provided for in paragraphs (c) and (d) of § 850.34.


(ii) If a beryllium-associated worker is temporarily removed from beryllium exposure pursuant to this section, the responsible employer must transfer the worker to a comparable job for which the worker is qualified (or for which the worker can be trained in a short period) and where beryllium exposures are as low as possible, but in no event at or above the action level.


(iii) The responsible employer must maintain the beryllium-associated worker's total normal earnings, seniority, and other worker rights and benefits as if the worker had not been removed.


(iv) If there is no such job available, the responsible employer must provide to the beryllium-associated worker the medical removal protection benefits specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, until a job becomes available or for one year, whichever comes first.


(2) *Permanent medical removal.* (i) The responsible employer must offer a beryllium-associated worker permanent medical removal from exposure to beryllium if the SOMD determines in a written medical opinion that the worker should be permanently removed from exposure to beryllium.


(ii) If a beryllium-associated worker is removed permanently from beryllium exposure based on the SOMD's recommendation pursuant to this section, the responsible employer must provide the worker the medical removal protection benefits specified in paragraph (b) of this section.


(3) *Worker consultation before temporary or permanent medical removal.* If the SOMD determines that a beryllium-associated worker should be temporarily or permanently removed from exposure to beryllium, the SOMD must:


(i) Advise the beryllium-associated worker of the determination that medical removal is necessary to protect the worker's health;


(ii) Provide the beryllium-associated worker with a copy of this rule and its preamble, and any other information the SOMD deems necessary on the risks of continued exposure to beryllium and the benefits of removal;


(iii) Provide the beryllium-associated worker the opportunity to have any questions concerning medical removal answered; and


(iv) Obtain the beryllium-associated worker's signature acknowledging that the worker has been advised to accept medical removal from beryllium exposure as provided in this section, and has been provided with the information specified in this paragraph, on the benefits of removal and the risks of continued exposure to beryllium.


(4) *Return to work after medical removal.* (i) The responsible employer, subject to paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, must not return a beryllium-associated worker who has been permanently removed under this section to the worker's former job status unless the SOMD first determines in a written medical opinion that continued medical removal is no longer necessary to protect the worker's health.


(ii) Not withstanding paragraph (a)(4) (i) of this section, if, in the SOMD's opinion, continued exposure to beryllium will not pose an increased risk to the beryllium-associated worker's health, and medical removal is an inappropriate remedy in the circumstances, the SOMD must fully discuss these matters with the worker and then, in a written determination, may authorize the responsible employer to return the worker to his or her former job status. Thereafter, the returned beryllium-associated worker must continue to be provided with medical surveillance under § 850.34 of this part.


(b) *Medical removal protection benefits.* (1) If a beryllium-associated worker has been permanently removed from beryllium exposure pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the responsible employer must provide the beryllium-associated worker:


(i) The opportunity to transfer to another position which is available, or later becomes available, for which the beryllium-associated worker is qualified (or for which the worker can be trained in a short period) and where beryllium exposures are as low as possible, but in no event at or above the action level; or


(ii) If the beryllium-associated worker cannot be transferred to a comparable job where beryllium exposures are below the action level, a maximum of 2 years of permanent medical removal protection benefits (specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section).


(2) If required by this section to provide medical removal protection benefits, the responsible employer must maintain the removed worker's total normal earnings, seniority and other worker rights and benefits, as though the worker had not been removed.


(3) If a removed beryllium-associated worker files a claim for workers' compensation payments for a beryllium-related disability, then the responsible employer must continue to provide medical removal protection benefits pending disposition of the claim. The responsible employer must receive no credit for the workers' compensation payments received by the worker for treatment related expenses.


(4) The responsible employer's obligation to provide medical removal protection benefits to a removed beryllium-associated worker is reduced to the extent that the worker receives compensation for earnings lost during the period of removal either from a publicly- or employer-funded compensation program, or from employment with another employer made possible by virtue of the worker's removal.


(5) For the purposes of this section, the requirement that a responsible employer provide medical removal protection benefits is not intended to expand upon, restrict, or change any rights to a specific job classification or position under the terms of an applicable collective bargaining agreement.


(6) The responsible employer may condition the provision of medical removal protection benefits upon the beryllium-associated worker's participation in medical surveillance provided in accordance with § 850.34 of this part.
