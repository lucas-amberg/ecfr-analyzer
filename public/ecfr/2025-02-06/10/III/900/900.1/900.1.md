# ยง 900.1   Purpose and scope.

(a) Pursuant to section 216(h) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824p(h)), the Department of Energy (DOE) establishes the Coordinated Interagency Transmission Authorizations and Permits Program (CITAP Program) under this part to coordinate the review and processes related to Federal authorizations necessary to site a proposed electric transmission facility. Pursuant to section 216(h)(4)(A), this part establishes the mechanism by which DOE will set prompt and binding intermediate milestones and ultimate deadlines for the processes related to deciding whether to issue such authorizations. In addition, as the lead agency and in collaboration with any National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) joint lead agency and in consultation with the relevant Federal entities, as applicable, DOE will prepare a single environmental review document, which will be designed to serve the needs of all relevant Federal agencies and inform all Federal authorization decisions on the proposed electric transmission project.


(b) This part provides a process for the timely submission of information needed for Federal decisions related to authorizations for siting proposed electric transmission projects. This part seeks to ensure that these projects are developed consistent with the nation's environmental laws, including laws that address endangered and threatened species, critical habitats, and cultural and historic properties. This part provides a framework, called the Integrated Interagency Pre-Application (IIP) Process, by which DOE will coordinate submission of materials necessary for Federal authorizations and related environmental reviews required under Federal law to site proposed electric transmission facilities, and integrates the IIP Process into the CITAP Program.


(c) This part describes the timing and procedures for the IIP Process, which should be initiated prior to a project proponent's submission of any application for a required Federal authorization. The IIP Process provides for timely and focused pre-application meetings with relevant Federal and non-Federal entities. In addition, the IIP Process facilitates early identification of potential siting constraints and opportunities. The IIP Process promotes thorough and consistent stakeholder engagement by a project proponent. At the close-out of each IIP Process, DOE will establish the schedule for all Federal reviews and authorizations required to site a proposed electric transmission facility, in coordination with the relevant Federal entities.


(d) This part improves the Federal permitting process by facilitating the early submission, compilation, and documentation of information needed for coordinated review by relevant Federal entities under the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 *et seq.*). This part also facilitates expeditious action on necessary Federal authorizations by ensuring that relevant Federal entities coordinate their consideration of those applications and by providing non-Federal entities the opportunity to coordinate their non-Federal permitting and environmental reviews with the reviews of the relevant Federal entities.


(e) This part facilitates improved and earlier coordination of and consultation between relevant Federal entities, relevant non-Federal entities, and others pursuant to section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (54 U.S.C. 306108) (NHPA) and its implementing regulations found at 36 CFR part 800. Under this part, DOE may determine it has an undertaking with the potential to affect historic properties and may, at that time, authorize a project proponent, as a CITAP applicant, to initiate section 106 consultation for the undertaking consistent with 36 CFR 800.2(c)(4). Prior to that determination, this part requires project proponents to gather initial information and make recommendations relevant to the section 106 process to the extent possible. This part also establishes DOE as lead for the section 106 process, consistent with DOE's role as lead or joint lead agency for purposes of NEPA, in order to maximize opportunities for coordination between the NEPA and section 106 processes. Federal entities remain responsible for government-to-government consultation with Indian Tribes (and government-to-sovereign consultation in the context of Native Hawaiian relations) and for any findings and determinations required by and reserved to Federal agencies in 36 CFR part 800.


(f) This part applies only to qualifying projects as defined by ยง 900.2.


(g) Participation in the IIP Process does not alter any requirements to obtain necessary Federal authorizations for proposed electric transmission projects. Nor does this part alter any responsibilities of the relevant Federal entities for environmental review or consultation under applicable law.


(h) The Director may waive any requirement imposed on a project proponent under this part if, in the Director's discretion, the Director determines that the requirement is unnecessary, duplicative, or impracticable under the circumstances relevant to the proposed electric transmission project. Where the principal project developer is itself a Federal entity that would be otherwise expected to prepare an environmental review document for the project, the Director shall consider modifications to the requirements under this part as may be necessary under the circumstances.
