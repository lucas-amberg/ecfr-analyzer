(3) Existing data or studies relevant to the summary of the proposed project; and


(4) Citations identifying sources, data, and analyses used to develop the summary of the proposed project.


(d) *Project participation plan.* The project participation plan, which may not exceed 10, single-spaced pages, summarizes the outreach that the project proponent conducted prior to submission of the initiation request, and describes the project proponent's planned outreach to communities of interest going forward. A supplemental appendix may be submitted to provide sufficient detail in addition to the narrative elements. The project participation plan must include:


(1) A summary of prior outreach to communities of interest and stakeholders including:


(i) A description of what work already has been done, including stakeholder and community outreach and public engagement, as well as any entities and organizations interested in the proposed electric transmission project;

(vi) A summary of comments received during these previous engagement activities, issues identified by stakeholders, communities of interest (including various resource issues, differing project alternative study corridors or routes, and revisions to routes), and responses provided to commenters, if applicable; and


(2) A public engagement plan, which must:


(i) Describe the project proponent's outreach plan and status of those activities, including planned future activities corresponding to each of the items or issues identified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section, specifying the planned dates or frequency;


(ii) Describe the manner in which the project proponent will reach out to communities of interest about potential mitigation of concerns;


(iii) Describe planned outreach activities during the permitting process, including efforts to identify, and engage, individuals with limited English proficiency and linguistically isolated communities, and provide accommodations for individuals with accessibility needs; and


(iv) Discuss the specific tools and actions used by the project proponent to facilitate public communications and public information, including whether the project proponent will have a readily accessible, easily identifiable, single point of contact.


(e) *FAST-41 statement.* The FAST-41 statement required under paragraph (a) of this section must specify the status of the proposed electric transmission project pursuant to FAST-41 at the time of submission of the initiation request. The statement must either:


(1) State that the project proponent has sought FAST-41 coverage pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 4370m-2(a)(1); and state whether the Executive Director of the FPISC has created an entry on the Permitting Dashboard for the project as a covered project pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 4370m-2(b)(2)(A); or


(2) State that the project proponent elected not to apply to be a FAST-41 covered project at this time.


(f) *Initiation request determination.* Not later than 20 calendar days after the date that DOE receives an initiation request, DOE shall:


(1) Determine whether the initiation request meets the requirements of this section and, if not previously determined under § 900.3, whether the proposed electric transmission facility is a qualifying project;


(2) Identify the relevant Federal entities and relevant non-Federal entities and provide each with an electronic copy of the initiation request; and


(3) Give notice to the project proponent and relevant Federal and non-Federal entities of DOE's determinations under paragraph (f)(1) of this section.


(g) *Deficiencies.* If DOE determines under paragraph (f)(1) of this section that the initiation request does not meet the requirements of this section, DOE must provide the reasons for that finding and a description of how the project proponent may, if applicable, address any deficiencies in the initiation request so that DOE may reconsider its determination. If DOE determines under paragraph (f)(1) of this section that the proposed electric transmission facility is not a qualifying project, DOE must provide a justification for the determination and the project proponent may file a request for coordination with the Director as provided in § 900.3. A project to site a proposed electric transmission facility that is not a qualifying project is not eligible for participation in the IIP Process.


(h) *Initial meeting.* If a project proponent submits a valid initiation request, DOE, in consultation with the identified relevant Federal entities, shall convene the IIP Process initial meeting with the project proponent and all relevant Federal entities notified by DOE under paragraph (f) of this section as soon as practicable and no later than 15 calendar days after the date that DOE provides notice under paragraph (f) that the initiation request meets the requirements of this section. DOE shall also invite relevant non-Federal entities to participate in the initial meeting. During the initial meeting:


(1) DOE and the relevant Federal entities shall discuss with the project proponent the IIP Process, Federal authorization process, related environmental reviews, any arrangements for the project proponent to contribute funds to DOE to cover costs incurred by DOE and the relevant Federal entities in the IIP Process (in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 7278), any requirements for entering into cost recovery agreements, and paying for third-party contractors under DOE's supervision, where applicable;


(2) DOE will identify any Federal applications that must be submitted during the IIP Process, to enable relevant Federal entities to begin work on the review process, and those applications that will be submitted after the IIP Process. All application submittal timelines will be accounted for in the project-specific schedule described in § 900.7;


(3) DOE will establish all analysis areas necessary for the completion of resource reports required under § 900.6;


(4) The project proponent shall describe the proposed electric transmission project and the contents of the initiation request;


(5) DOE and the relevant Federal entities, along with any relevant non-Federal entities who choose to participate, will review the information provided by the project proponent and publicly available information, discuss the study corridors and potential routes identified by the project proponent, discuss the evaluation criteria and methods used to identify those corridors and routes and, to the extent possible and based on agency expertise and experience, identify any additional criteria for adding or modifying potential routes and study corridors;


(6) DOE and the relevant Federal entities will discuss, based on available information provided by the project proponent, any surveys and studies that may be required for potential routes and completion of the resource reports, including biological (including threatened and endangered species or avian, aquatic, and terrestrial species and aquatic habitats of concern), visual, cultural, economic, social, health, and historic surveys and studies.


(i) *Feedback to project proponent.* Feedback provided to the project proponent under paragraph (h) of this section does not constitute a commitment by any relevant Federal entity to approve or deny a Federal authorization request, nor does the IIP Process limit agency discretion regarding NEPA review.


(j) *Draft initial meeting summary.* Not later than 10 calendar days after the initial meeting, DOE shall:


(1) Prepare a draft initial meeting summary that includes a summary of the meeting discussion, a description of key issues and information gaps identified during the meeting, and any requests for more information from relevant Federal entities and relevant non-Federal entities; and


(2) Convey the draft summary to the project proponent, relevant Federal entities, and any relevant non-Federal entities that participated in the meeting.


(k) *Corrections.* The project proponent and entities that received the draft initial meeting summary under paragraph (j) of this section will have 10 calendar days following receipt of the draft initial meeting summary to review the draft and provide corrections to DOE.


(l) *Final summary.* Not later than 10 calendar days following the close of the 10-day review period under paragraph (k) of this section, DOE shall:


(1) Prepare a final initial meeting summary by incorporating received corrections, as appropriate;


(2) Add the final summary to the consolidated administrative docket described by § 900.10; and


(3) Provide an electronic copy of the summary to all relevant Federal entities, relevant non-Federal entities, and the project proponent.
