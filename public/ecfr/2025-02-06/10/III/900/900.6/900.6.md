# § 900.6   Project proponent resource reports.

(a) *Preparation and submission.* The project proponent shall prepare and submit to DOE the 13 project proponent resource reports described in this section. The project proponent may submit the resource reports at any time before requesting a review meeting under § 900.8 and shall, at the direction of DOE, revise resource reports in response to comments received from relevant Federal entities and relevant non-Federal entities during the Integrated Interagency Pre-Application (IIP) Process.


(b) *Content.* Each resource report must include concise descriptions, based on the best available scientific and commercial information, of the known existing environment and major site conditions. The detail of each resource report must be commensurate with the complexity of the proposal and its potential for environmental impacts. Each topic in each resource report must be addressed or its omission justified. If any resource report topic is not addressed at the time the applicable resource report is filed or its omission is not addressed, the report must explain why the topic is missing. If material required for one resource report is provided in another resource report or in another exhibit, it may be incorporated by reference. If outside material is reasonably available for review and comment, a resource report may incorporate that material by reference by including a citation to the material and a brief summary of the material. Consistent with §§ 900.1(h) and 900.4(g), the Director may modify the requirements of this section to reflect differences in onshore and offshore environments and uses.


(c) *Requirements for IIP Process progression.* Failure of the project proponent to provide at least the required initial or revised content will prevent progress through the IIP Process to the IIP Process review or close-out meetings, unless the Director determines that the project proponent has provided an acceptable reason for the item's absence and an acceptable timeline for filing it. Failure to file within the accepted timeline will prevent further progress in the IIP Process.


(d) *General requirements.* As appropriate, each resource report shall:


(1) Address conditions or resources that might be directly or indirectly affected by the proposed electric transmission project;


(2) Identify environmental effects expected to occur as a result of the proposed project;

(4) Identify measures proposed to enhance the environment or to avoid, minimize, or compensate for potential adverse effects of the proposed project; and


(5) Provide a list of publications, reports, and other literature or communications, including agency communications, that were cited or relied upon to prepare each report.


(e) *Federal responsibility.* The resource reports prepared by the project proponent under this section do not supplant the requirements under existing environmental laws related to the information required for Federal authorization or consultation processes. The relevant Federal entities shall independently evaluate the information submitted and shall be responsible for the accuracy, scope, and contents of all Federal authorization decision documents and related environmental reviews.

(6) Based on noise estimates, determine whether any wildlife-specific noise thresholds may have an impact on the proposed project, such as those thresholds specific to avian species that may be relevant in significant wildlife areas, if appropriate; and


(7) Describe measures, and manufacturer's specifications for equipment, proposed to mitigate noise effects and impacts to air quality, including emission control systems, installation of filters, mufflers, or insulation of piping and buildings, and orientation of equipment away from noise-sensitive areas.


(q) *Resource Report 12—Alternatives.* This report should describe the range of study corridors that were considered as alternatives during the planning, identification, and design of the proposed electric transmission project and compare the environmental impacts of such corridors and the routes contained in those corridors. This analysis may inform the relevant Federal entities' subsequent analysis of their alternatives during the NEPA process. Resource Report 12 must:


(1) Identify all study corridors and routes contained within those corridors. The report must identify the location of the corridors on maps of sufficient scale to depict their location and relationship to the proposed project, and the relationship of the proposed electric transmission facility to existing rights-of-way;


(2) Discuss the “no action” alternative and the potential for accomplishing the proponent's proposed objectives using alternative means;


(3) Discuss design and construction methods considered by the project proponent;


(4) Identify all the alternative study corridors and routes the project proponent considered in the initial screening for the proposed project but did not recommend for further study and the reasons why the proponent chose not to examine such alternatives.


(5) For alternative study corridors and routes recommended for more in-depth consideration, the report must:


(i) Describe the potential impacts to cultural and historic resources for each alternative;


(ii) Describe the environmental characteristics of each alternative, provide comparative tables showing the differences in environmental characteristics for the alternatives, and include an analysis of the potential relative environmental impacts for each alternative;


(iii) Provide an explanation of the costs to construct, operate, and maintain each alternative, the potential for each alternative to meet project deadlines, and technological and procedural constraints in developing the alternatives; and


(iv) Demonstrate whether and how environmental benefits and costs were weighed against economic benefits and costs to the public.


(r) *Resource Report 13—Reliability, resilience, and safety.* This report should describe the impacts that would result from a failure of the proposed electric transmission facility, the measures, procedures, and features that would reduce the risk of failure, and measures in place to reduce impacts and protect the public if a failure did occur. Resource Report 13 must:


(1) Discuss events that could result in a failure of the proposed facility, including accidents, intentional destructive acts, and natural catastrophes (accounting for the likelihood of relevant natural catastrophes resulting from climate change);


(2) Describe the reasonably foreseeable impacts that would result from a failure of the proposed electric transmission facility, including hazards to the public, environmental impacts, and service interruptions;


(3) Describe the operational measures, procedures, and design features of the proposed project that would reduce the risk of facility failure;


(4) Describe measures proposed to protect the public from failure of the proposed facility (including coordination with local agencies);


(5) Discuss contingency plans for maintaining service or reducing downtime;


(6) Describe measures used to exclude the public from hazardous areas, measures used to minimize problems arising from malfunctions and accidents (with estimates of probability of occurrence), and identify standard procedures for protecting services and public safety during maintenance and breakdowns; and


(7) Describe improvements to reliability likely to result from the proposed project.
