# § 900.8   IIP Process review meeting.

(a) An Integrated Interagency Pre-Application (IIP) Process review meeting is required for each proposed electric transmission project utilizing the IIP Process and may only be held after the project proponent submits a review meeting request to DOE. The project proponent may submit the request at any time following submission of the initial resource reports required under § 900.6. The review meeting request must include:


(1) A summary table of changes made to the proposed project since the IIP Process initial meeting, including potential environmental and community benefits from improved siting or design;


(2) Maps of potential routes and study corridors, including the proposed line, substations, and other infrastructure, as applicable, with at least as much detail as required for the initiation request described by § 900.5 and as modified in response to early stakeholder input and outreach and feedback from relevant Federal entities and relevant non-Federal entities;


(3) If known, a schedule for completing any upcoming field resource surveys, as appropriate;


(4) A conceptual plan for implementation and monitoring of proposed mitigation measures to avoid, minimize, or compensate for effects of the proposed project, consistent with 40 CFR 1508.1(s) or any successor regulation. This may include compensatory mitigation measures (offsite and onsite);


(5) An updated public engagement plan described in § 900.5(d)(2), reflecting actions undertaken since the project proponent submitted the initiation request and input received from relevant Federal entities and relevant non-Federal entities;


(6) A listing of:


(i) The dates on which the project proponent filed applications or requests for Federal authorizations and the dates on which the project proponent filed revisions to previously filed applications or requests; and


(ii) Estimated dates for filing remaining applications or requests for Federal authorization;


(7) Estimated dates that the project proponent will file requests for authorizations and consultations with relevant non-Federal entities; and


(8) A proposed duration for each Federal land use authorization expected to be required for the proposed project, commensurate with the anticipated use of the proposed electric transmission facility.


(b) Not later than 10 calendar days after the date that DOE receives the review meeting request, DOE shall provide relevant Federal entities and relevant non-Federal entities with materials included in the request and the initial resource reports submitted under § 900.6 via electronic means.


(c) Not later than 60 calendar days after the date that DOE receives the review meeting request, DOE shall:


(1) Determine whether the meeting request meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and whether the initial resource reports are sufficiently detailed; and


(2) Give notice to the project proponent and relevant Federal and non-Federal entities of DOE's determinations under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.


(d) If DOE determines under paragraph (c)(1) of this section that the meeting request does not meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section or that the initial resource reports are not sufficiently detailed, DOE must provide the reasons for that finding and a description of how the project proponent may address any deficiencies in the meeting request or resource reports so that DOE may reconsider its determination.


(e) Not later than 15 calendar days after the date that DOE provides notice to the project proponent under paragraph (c) of this section that the review meeting request and initial resource reports have been accepted, DOE shall convene the review meeting with the project proponent and the relevant Federal entities. All relevant non-Federal entities participating in the IIP Process shall also be invited.


(f) During the IIP Process review meeting:


(1) The relevant Federal entities shall discuss, and modify if needed, the analysis areas used in the initial resource reports;


(2) Relevant Federal entities shall identify any remaining issues of concern, known information gaps or data needs, and potential issues or conflicts that could impact the time it will take the relevant Federal entities to process applications for Federal authorizations for the proposed electric transmission project;


(3) Relevant non-Federal entities may identify remaining issues of concern, information needs, and potential issues or conflicts for the project;


(4) The participants shall discuss the project proponent's updates to the siting process to date, including stakeholder outreach activities, resultant stakeholder input, and project proponent response to stakeholder input;


(5) Led by DOE, all relevant Federal entities shall discuss statutory and regulatory standards that must be met to make decisions for Federal authorizations required for the proposed project;


(6) Led by DOE, all relevant Federal entities shall describe the process for, and estimated time to complete, required Federal authorizations and, where possible, the anticipated cost (*e.g.,* processing and monitoring fees and land use fees);


(7) Led by DOE, all relevant Federal entities shall describe their expectations for complete applications for Federal authorizations for the proposed project;


(8) Led by DOE, all relevant Federal entities shall identify necessary updates to the initial resource reports that must be made before conclusion of the IIP Process, or, as necessary, following conclusion of the IIP Process; and


(9) DOE shall present the proposed project-specific schedule developed under § 900.7.


(g) Not later than 10 calendar days after the review meeting, DOE shall:


(1) Prepare a draft review meeting summary that includes a summary of the meeting discussion, a description of key issues and information gaps identified during the meeting, and any requests for more information from relevant Federal entities and relevant non-Federal entities; and


(2) Convey the draft summary to the project proponent, relevant Federal entities, and any non-Federal entities that participated in the meeting.


(h) The project proponent and entities that received the draft review meeting summary under paragraph (g) of this section will have 10 calendar days following receipt of the draft to review the draft and provide corrections to DOE.


(i) Not later than 10 calendar days following the close of the 10-day review period under paragraph (h) of this section, DOE shall:


(1) Prepare a final review meeting summary incorporating received corrections, as appropriate;


(2) Add the final summary to the consolidated administrative docket described by § 900.10; and


(3) Provide an electronic copy of the summary to the relevant Federal entities, relevant non-Federal entities, and the project proponent.


(j) Not later than 10 calendar days following the close of the 10-day review period under paragraph (h) of this section, DOE shall:


(1) determine whether the project proponent has developed the scope of its proposed project and alternatives sufficiently for DOE to determine that there exists an undertaking for purposes of section 106 of the NHPA; and


(2) if the scope is sufficiently developed, initiate consultation with SHPOs, THPOs, and others consistent with 36 CFR 800.2(c)(4), which may include authorizing a project proponent, as a CITAP applicant, to initiate section 106 consultation and providing appropriate notifications.


(k) After the review meeting and before the IIP Process close-out meeting described by § 900.9 the project proponent shall revise resource reports submitted under § 900.6 based on feedback from relevant Federal entities and relevant non-Federal entities received during the review meeting and based on any updated surveys conducted since the initial meeting.
