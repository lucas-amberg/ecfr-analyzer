# ยง 904.11   Lay off of energy.

(a) If any Contractor determines that it is temporarily unable to utilize Firm Energy or Excess Energy, Western will, at the Contractor's request, attempt to lay off the Firm Energy or Excess Energy the Contractor declares to be available for lay off, pursuant to the provisions for lay off of energy specified in the Contract.


(b) If Western is unable to lay off such energy, or if the Contractor fails to request Western to attempt to lay off the energy, the Contractor will be billed for the Firm Energy or Excess Energy that was available to the Contractor but could not be delivered to the Contractor or sold to another customer. 


(c) In the event that Western must lay off the Firm Energy or Excess Energy at a rate lower than the effective Firm Energy rate, the Contractor will be billed for the difference between the amount that Western would have received at the then existing Firm Energy rate, including the appropriate Lower Basin Development Fund Contribution Charge, and the amount actually received.
