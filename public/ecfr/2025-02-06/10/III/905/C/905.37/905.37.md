# § 905.37   Process.

Modified contractual language shall be required to place resource extensions under contract. Resource extensions and allocations to new customers from the initial resource pool will take effect when existing contracts expire. These dates are December 31, 2000, for the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program—Eastern Division and September 30, 2004, for the Loveland Area Projects. For the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program—Eastern Division, Western will offer contracts to existing customers for resource extensions no sooner than the effective date of the final regulations. For the Loveland Area Projects, existing contracts provide for potential adjustments to marketable resources in 1999. No contracts will be offered to existing customers for post-2004 Loveland Area Projects resources until the analysis of potential resource adjustments in 1999 has been completed and any adjustments are implemented. Existing power sales contracts require that this analysis be completed by 1996.
