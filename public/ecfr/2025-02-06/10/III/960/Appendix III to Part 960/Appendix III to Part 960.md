# Appendix III to Part 960—Application of the System and Technical Guidelines During the Siting Process


1. This appendix presents a table that specifies how the guidelines of subparts C and D are to be applied at certain decision points of the siting process. The decision points, as referenced in the table, are defined as follows: 


“Potentially acceptable” means the decision point at which a site is identified as potentially acceptable.


“Nomination and recommendation” means the decision point at which a site is nominated as suitable for characterization or recommended as a candidate site for characterization. 


2. The findings resulting from the application of a disqualifying condition for any particular guideline at a given decision point are denoted in the table by the numeral 1 or 2. The numerals 1 and 2 signify the types of findings that are required and are defined as follows: 


“1” means *either* of the following: 


(a) The evidence does *not* support a finding that the site is disqualified.


(b) The evidence supports a finding that the site is disqualified. 


“2” means *either* of the following: 


(a) The evidence supports a finding that the site is *not* disqualified on the basis of that evidence and is *not* likely to be disqualified.


(b) The evidence supports a finding that the site is disqualified or is likely to be disqualified. 


3. The findings resulting from the application of a qualifying condition for any particular guideline at a given decision point are denoted in the table by the numeral 3 or 4. The numerals 3 and 4 signify the types of findings that are required and are defined as follows: 


“3” means *either* of the following: 


(a) The evidence does *not* support a finding that the site is *not* likely to meet the qualifying condition.


(b) The evidence supports a finding that the site is *not* likely to meet the qualifying condition, and therefore the site is disqualified. 


4. If performance assessments are used to substantiate any of the above findings, those assessments shall include estimates of the effects of uncertainties in data and modeling. 


5. For both the disqualifying and qualifying conditions of any guideline, a higher finding (e.g., a “2” finding rather than “1”) shall be made if there is sufficient evidence to support such a finding.
