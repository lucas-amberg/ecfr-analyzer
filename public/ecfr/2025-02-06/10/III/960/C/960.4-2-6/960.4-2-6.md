# § 960.4-2-6   Dissolution.

(a) *Qualifying condition.* The site shall be located such that any subsurface rock dissolution will not be likely to lead to radionuclide releases greater than those allowable under the requirements specified in § 960.4-1. In predicting the likelihood of dissolution within the geologic setting at a site, the DOE will consider the evidence of dissolution within that setting during the Quaternary Period, including the locations and characteristics of dissolution fronts or other dissolution features, if identified. 


(b) *Favorable condition.* No evidence that the host rock within the site was subject to significant dissolution during the Quaternary Period. 


(c) *Potentially adverse condition.* Evidence of dissolution within the geologic setting—such as breccia pipes, dissolution cavities, significant volumetric reduction of the host rock or surrounding strata, or any structural collapse—such that a hydraulic interconnection leading to a loss of waste isolation could occur. 


(d) *Disqualifying condition.* The site shall be *disqualified* if it is likely that, during the first 10,000 years after closure, active dissolution, as predicted on the basis of the geologic record, would result in a loss of waste isolation.
