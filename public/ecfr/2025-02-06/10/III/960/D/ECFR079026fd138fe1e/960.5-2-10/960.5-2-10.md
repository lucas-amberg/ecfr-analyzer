# ยง 960.5-2-10   Hydrology.

(a) *Qualifying condition.* The site shall be located such that the geohydrologic setting of the site will (1) be compatible with the activities required for repository construction, operation, and closure; (2) not compromise the intended functions of the shaft liners and seals; and (3) permit the requirements specified in ยง 960.5-1(a)(3) to be met. 


(b) *Favorable conditions.* (1) Absence of aquifers between the host rock and the land surface. 


(2) Absence of surface-water systems that could potentially cause flooding of the repository. 


(3) Availability of the water required for repository construction, operation, and closure. 


(c) *Potentially adverse condition.* Ground-water conditions that could require complex engineering measures that are beyond reasonably available technology for repository construction, operation, and closure.


(d) *Disqualifying condition.* A site shall be disqualified if, based on expected ground-water conditions, it is likely that engineering measures that are beyond reasonably available technology will be required for exploratory-shaft construction or for repository construction, operation, or closure.
