(a) The Privacy Act Officer must respond in writing to the requester for amendment of a record within 10 working days of receipt. This response shall inform the requester of the decision whenever possible. 


(b) If the decision cannot be reached within 10 working days, the requester shall be informed of the reason for delay and the date (within 20 working days) it is expected that the decision will be made. 


(c) The Privacy Act Officer, consistent with the recommendation of the System Manager or Managers, as concurred in by the appropriate General Counsel, if appropriate, shall do one of the following: 


(1) Instruct the System Manager to make the requested correction or amendment; and advise the individual in writing of such action, providing either a copy of the corrected or amended record, or a statement as to the means whereby the correction or amendment was accomplished in cases where a copy cannot be provided (for example, erasure of information from a record maintained only in an electronic data bank); or 


(2) Inform the individual in writing that his request is denied in whole or in part. Such denial shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and shall provide the following information: 


(i) The System Manager's name and title; 


(ii) The reasons for the denial; including citation to the appropriate sections of the Act and this part; and 


(iii) Notification of the individual's right to appeal the denial pursuant to ยง 1008.11 and to administrative and judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(B), as limited by 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(5). 


(iv) Notification of the right of the individual to submit a statement of disagreement consistent with ยง 1008.11(g). 


(d) Whenever an individual's record is amended pursuant to a request by that individual, the Privacy Act Officer or the System Manager, as appropriate, shall notify all persons and agencies to which the amended portion of the record had been disclosed prior to its amendment, if an accounting of such disclosure was required by the Act. The notification shall request a recipient agency maintaining the record to acknowledge receipt of the notification, to correct or amend the record and to apprise an agency or person to which it had disclosed the record of the substance of the amendment. 


(e) The following criteria will be taken into account by the DOE in reviewing a request for amendment: 


(1) The sufficiency of the evidence submitted by the individual; 


(2) The factual accuracy of the information; 


(3) The relevance and necessity of the information in relation to the purpose for which it was collected; 


(4) If such information is used in making any determination about the individual, whether the information is as accurate, relevant, timely, and complete as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in such determination; 


(5) The degree of possibility that denial of the request could unfairly result in a determination adverse to the individual; 


(6) The nature of the record sought to be corrected or amended; and 


(7) The propriety and feasibility of complying with the specific means of amendment requested by the individual. 


(f) The DOE will not undertake to gather evidence for the individual, but does reserve the right to verify the evidence that the individual submits. 


(g) Amendment of a record requested by an individual may be denied upon a determination that: 


(1) The individual has failed to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, the propriety of the amendment in relation to the criteria stated in paragraph (c) of this section; 


(2) The record sought to be amended was compiled in a terminated judicial, quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative proceeding to which the individual was a party or participant; 


(3) The record sought to be amended is the subject of a pending judicial, quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative proceeding to which the individual is a party or participant; 


(4) The amendment would violate a duly enacted statute or promulgated regulation; 


(5) The individual has unreasonably failed to comply with the procedural requirements of this part; or 


(6) The record has been properly exempted from the provisions of subsection (d) of the Act. 


(h) Nothing in this section shall restrict the DOE from granting in part or denying in part a request for amendment of records.
