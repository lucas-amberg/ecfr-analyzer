# § 1008.18   Accounting for disclosures.

(a) For each disclosure of information contained in a system of records under his control, except disclosures to authorized officers and employees of DOE and disclosures required by the Freedom of Information Act, the appropriate System Manager shall keep an accurate accounting of: 


(1) The date, nature, and purposes of each disclosure of a record made to any person or to another agency; and 


(2) The name and address of the person or agency to which the disclosure was made. 


(b) The accounting shall be retained for at least five years or the life of the record, whichever is longer, after the disclosure for which the accounting is made. 


(c) The accounting described in paragraph (a) of this section shall be made available to the individual named in the record upon written request to the Privacy Act Officer at the appropriate DOE location listed at § 1008.2(c) of this part. However, the accounting shall not be revealed with respect to disclosures made under § 1008.17(b)(7) of this part, pertaining to law enforcement activity; or with respect to disclosures involving system of records for which DOE had claimed an exemption from certain requirements of the Act, as provided in § 1008.12 of this part. 


(d) Whenever an amendment or correction of a record or a notation of dispute concerning the accuracy of records is made by the DOE in accordance with §§ 1008.10(a)(2)(iv) and 1008.11(g) of this part, DOE shall inform any person or other agency to whom the record was previously disclosed if an accounting of the disclosure was made pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, unless the disclosure was made pursuant to § 1008.17(b)(7) of this part; or the disclosure involved a system of records of which DOE has claimed an exemption from certain requirements of the Act, as provided in § 1008.12 of this part. 


(e) The System Manager shall make reasonable efforts to serve notice on an individual when any record containing information about such individual in a DOE system of records is disclosed to any person under compulsory legal process when such process becomes a matter of public record. 


(f) Prior to disclosing any record about an individual to any person other than an agency, unless the disclosure is pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the System Manager shall make reasonable efforts to assure that each record is accurate, complete, timely, and relevant for DOE's purposes.
