(a) When two or more debtors are jointly and severally liable, DOE will pursue collection activity against all debtors, as appropriate. DOE will not attempt to allocate the burden of payment between the debtors, but will proceed to liquidate the indebtedness as quickly as possible. 


(b) DOE will seek to ensure that a compromise agreement with one debtor does not release DOE's claim against the remaining debtors. The amount of a compromise with one debtor shall not be considered a precedent or binding in determining the amount that will be required from other debtors jointly and severally liable on the claim.
