# § 1016.3   Definitions.

(a) *Access authorization.* An administrative determination by DOE that an individual who is either a DOE employee, applicant for employment, consultant, assignee, other Federal department or agency employee (or other persons who may be designated by the Secretary of Energy), or a DOE contractor or subcontractor employee, or an access permittee is eligible for access to Restricted Data. Access authorizations granted by DOE are designated as “Q,” “Q(X),” “L,” or “L(X).”


(1) “Q” access authorizations are based upon single scope background investigations as set forth in applicable DOE and national-level directives. They permit an individual who has “need to know” access to Top Secret, Secret and Confidential Restricted Data, Formerly Restricted Data, National Security Information, or special nuclear material in Category I or II quantities as required in the performance of duties, subject to additional determination that permitting this access will not endanger the common defense or national security of the United States. There may be additional requirements for access to specific types of RD information.


(2) “Q(X)” access authorizations are based upon the same level of investigation required for a Q access authorization. When “Q” access authorizations are granted to access permittees they are identified as “Q(X)” access authorizations and, as need-to-know applies, authorize access only to the type of Secret Restricted Data as specified in the permit and consistent with appendix A, 10 CFR part 725, “Categories of Restricted Data Available.”


(3) “L” access authorizations are based upon a Tier III (formerly National Agency Check with Local Agency Checks and Credit Checks (NACLC)/Access National Agency Check with Inquiries (ANACI)) background investigation as set forth in applicable national-level directives. They permit an individual who has “need to know” access to Confidential Restricted Data, Secret and Confidential Formerly Restricted Data, or Secret and Confidential National Security Information, required in the performance of duties, provided such information is not designated “CRYPTO” (classified cryptographic information), “COMSEC” (communications security), or intelligence information and subject to additional determination that permitting this access will not endanger the common defense or national security of the United States. There may be additional requirements for access to specific types of RD information.


(4) “L(X)” access authorizations are based upon the same level of investigation required for an “L” access authorization. When “L” access authorizations are granted to access permittees, they are identified as “L(X)” access authorizations and, as need to know applies, authorize access only to the type of Confidential Restricted Data as specified in the permit and consistent with appendix A, 10 CFR part 725, “Categories of Restricted Data Available.”


(b) *Act.* The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (68 Stat. 919) as amended.


(c) *Classified mail address.* A mail address established for each access permittee and approved by the DOE to be used when sending Restricted Data to the permittee.


(d) *Classified matter.* Anything in physical form (including, but not limited to documents and material) that contains or reveals classified information.


(e) *Combination lock.* A built-in combination lock on a security container which is of tempered steel alloy hard plate, at least 
1/4″ in thickness and Rockwell hardness of C-63 to C-65, of sufficient size and so located as to sufficiently impede access to the locking mechanism by drilling of the lock or container.


(f) *DOE.* The United States Department of Energy or its duly authorized representatives.


(g) *Formerly Restricted Data.* Classified information jointly determined by the DOE and the Department of Defense to be related primarily to the military utilization of atomic weapons and removed by the DOE from the Restricted Data category pursuant to section 142(d) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.


(h) *Infraction.* An act or omission involving failure to comply with DOE safeguards and security orders, directives, or approvals and may include a violation of law.

(j) *National Security.* The national defense and foreign relations of the United States.


(k) *National Security Information.* Information that has been determined pursuant to Executive Order 13526, as amended “Classified National Security Information” or any predecessor order to require protection against unauthorized disclosure and is marked to indicate its classified status when in documentary form.


(l) *“Need to know.”* A determination by persons having responsibility for classified information or matter, that a proposed recipient's access to such classified information or matter is necessary in the performance of official, contractual, or access permit duties of employment under cognizance of the DOE.


(m) *Permittee.* The holder of an Access Permit issued pursuant to the regulations set forth in 10 CFR part 725, “Permits For Access to Restricted Data.”


(n) *Person.* Any individual, corporation, partnership, firm, association, trust, estate, public or private institution, group, Government agency other than DOE, any State or any political subdivision of, or any political entity within a State, or other entity; and any legal successor, representative, agency, or agency of the foregoing.


(o) *Protective personnel.* Guards or watchmen or other persons designated responsibility for the protection of classified matter.


(p) *Restricted Data.* All data concerning design, manufacture, or utilization of atomic weapons; the production of special nuclear material; or the use of special nuclear material in the production of energy, but shall not include data declassified or removed from the Restricted Data category pursuant to section 142 of the Act.


(q) *Security area.* A physically defined space containing classified matter and subject to physical protection and personnel access controls. 


(r) *Security clearance.* See access authorization.


(s) *Security facility.* Any facility, including an access permittee, which has been approved by the DOE for using, processing, storing, reproducing, transmitting, or handling classified matter.
