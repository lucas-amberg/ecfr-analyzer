# ยง 1016.27   Termination, suspension, or revocation of security facility approval.

(a) In accordance with ยง 1016.12, if the need to use, process, store, reproduce, transmit, or handle classified matter no longer exists, the security facility approval will be terminated.

In either case, the facility must submit a certification of non-possession of Restricted Data to the DOE.


(b) In any instance where security facility approval has been suspended or revoked based on a determination of the DOE that further possession of classified matter by the permittee would endanger the common defense and national security, the permittee shall, upon notice from the DOE, immediately deliver all Restricted Data to the DOE along with a certificate of non-possession of Restricted Data.
