*Document* means the physical medium on or in which information is recorded, regardless of its physical form or characteristics.


*DOE* means the United States Department of Energy, including the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).


*Essential technology-related information* means technical information whose unauthorized dissemination could significantly increase the likelihood of the illegal production of a nuclear weapon.


*Exploitable security-related information* means information whose unauthorized dissemination could significantly increase the likelihood of the theft, diversion, or sabotage of nuclear material, equipment, or facilities.


*Government* means the Executive Branch of the United States Government.


*Government information* means any fact or concept, regardless of its physical form or characteristics, that is owned by, produced by or for, or otherwise controlled by the United States Government, including such facts or concepts that are provided by the Government to any person, including persons who are not employees of the Government.


*Guidance* means detailed written instructions that describe decisions made by the Secretary or his/her designee issued under Subpart B of these regulations concerning what specific information is UCNI.

*In transit* means the physical movement of a nuclear weapon, a component of a nuclear weapon containing nuclear material, or nuclear material from one part to another part of a facility or from one facility to another facility. An item is considered “in transit” until it has been relinquished to the custody of the authorized recipient and is in storage at its ultimate destination. An item in temporary storage pending shipment to its ultimate destination is “in transit.”


*Limited access* means access to specific UCNI granted by the cognizant DOE Program Secretarial Officer or a Deputy or Associate Administrator of the NNSA to an individual not eligible for routine access (see § 1017.21).


*Material* means a product (*e.g.*, a part or a machine) or substance (e.g., a compound or an alloy), regardless of its physical form or characteristics.


*Need to know* means a determination made by an Authorized Individual that a person requires access to specific UCNI to perform official duties or other Government-authorized activities.


*Nuclear material* means special nuclear material, byproduct material, or source material as defined by sections 11.aa., 11.e., and 11.z., respectively, of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2014 aa., e., and z), or any other material used in the production, testing, utilization, or assembly of nuclear weapons or components of nuclear weapons that the Secretary determines to be nuclear material under § 1017.9(a).


*Nuclear weapon* means atomic weapon as defined in section 11.d. of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2014 d).


*Person* means any person as defined in section 11.s. of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2014 s) or any affiliate or parent corporation thereof.


*Production facility* means:


(1) Any equipment or device capable of producing special nuclear material in such quantity as to be of significance to the common defense and security or in such manner as to affect the health and safety of the public; or


(2) Any important component part especially designed for such equipment or device.


(3) For the purposes of this part, equipment and devices described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this definition include only:


(i) Government uranium isotope enrichment equipment or devices and any other uranium isotope enrichment equipment or devices that use related technology provided by the Government; or


(ii) Government plutonium production reactors, isotope enrichment equipment or devices, and separation and purification equipment or devices and other such equipment or devices that use related technology provided by the Government.


*Reviewing Official* means an individual authorized under § 1017.14(a) to make a determination, based on guidance, that a document or material contains UCNI.


*Routine access* means access to UCNI granted by an Authorized Individual to an individual eligible to receive UCNI under § 1017.20 in order to perform official duties or other Government-authorized activities.


*Secretary* means the Secretary of Energy.


*Special nuclear material* means:


(1) Plutonium, uranium enriched in the isotope 233 or in the isotope 235, and any other material which DOE or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, pursuant to the provisions of section 51 of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2071), determines to be special nuclear material, but does not include source material; or


(2) Any material artificially enriched by any of the foregoing, but does not include source material.


*Unauthorized dissemination* means the intentional or negligent transfer of UCNI to any person other than an Authorized Individual or a person granted limited access to UCNI under § 1017.21.
