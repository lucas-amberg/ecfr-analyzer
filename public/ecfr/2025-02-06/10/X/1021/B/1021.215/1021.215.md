# ยง 1021.215   Applicant process.

(a) This section applies to actions that involve application to DOE for a permit, license, exemption or allocation, or other similar actions, unless the action is categorically excluded from preparation of an EA or EIS under subpart D of this part.


(b) The applicant shall:


(1) Consult with DOE as early as possible in the planning process to obtain guidance with respect to the appropriate level and scope of any studies or environmental information that DOE may require to be submitted as part of, or in support of, the application;


(2) Conduct studies that DOE deems necessary and appropriate to determine the environmental impacts of the proposed action; 


(3) Consult with appropriate Federal, state, regional and local agencies, American Indian tribes and other potentially interested parties during the preliminary planning stages of the proposed action to identify environmental factors and permitting requirements;


(4) Notify DOE as early as possible of other Federal, state, regional, local or American Indian tribal actions required for project completion to allow DOE to coordinate the Federal environmental review, and fulfill the requirements of 40 CFR 1506.2 regarding elimination of duplication with state and local procedures, as appropriate;


(5) Notify DOE of private entities and organizations interested in the proposed undertaking, in order that DOE can consult, as appropriate, with these parties in accordance with 40 CFR 1501.2(d)(2); and


(6) Notify DOE if, before DOE completes the environmental review, the applicant plans to take an action that is within DOE's jurisdiction that may have an adverse environmental impact or limit the choice of alternatives. If DOE determines that the action would have an adverse environmental impact or would limit the choice of reasonable alternatives under 40 CFR 1506.1(a), DOE will promptly notify the applicant that DOE will take appropriate action to ensure that the objectives and procedures of NEPA are achieved in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.1(b).


(c) For major categories of DOE actions involving a large number of applicants, DOE may prepare and make available generic guidance describing the recommended level and scope of environmental information that applicants should provide.


(d) DOE shall begin its NEPA review (if otherwise required by this part) as soon as possible after receiving an application described in paragraph (a) of this section, and shall independently evaluate and verify the accuracy of information received from an applicant in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.5(a). At DOE's option, an applicant may prepare an EA in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.5(b). If an EIS is prepared, the EIS shall be prepared by DOE or by a contractor that is selected by DOE and that may be funded by the applicant, in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.5(c). The contractor shall provide a disclosure statement in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.5(c). DOE shall complete any NEPA documents (or evaluation of any EA prepared by the applicant) before rendering a final decision on the application and shall consider the NEPA document in reaching its decision, as provided in ยง 1021.210 of this part.
