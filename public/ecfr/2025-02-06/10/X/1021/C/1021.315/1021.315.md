# § 1021.315   Records of decision.

(a) No decision may be made on a proposal covered by an EIS during a 30-day “waiting period” following completion of the final EIS, except as provided at 40 CFR 1506.1 and 1506.10(b) and § 1021.211 of this part. The 30-day period starts when the EPA Notice of Availability for the final EIS is published in the _Federal Register._

(b) If DOE decides to take action on a proposal covered by an EIS, a ROD shall be prepared as provided at 40 CFR 1505.2 (except as provided at 40 CFR 1506.1 and § 1021.211 of this part). 


(c) DOE RODs shall be published in the _Federal Register_ and made available to the public as specified in 40 CFR 1506.6, except as provided in 40 CFR 1507.3(c) and § 1021.340 of this part.


(d) No action shall be taken until the decision has been made public. DOE may implement the decision before the ROD is published in the _Federal Register_ if the ROD has been signed and the decision and the availability of the ROD have been made public by other means (e.g., press release, announcement in local media). 


(e) DOE may revise a ROD at any time, so long as the revised decision is adequately supported by an existing EIS. A revised ROD is subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
