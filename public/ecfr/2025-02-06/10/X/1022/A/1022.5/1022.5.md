Maintenance is routine when it is needed to maintain and preserve the facility or structure for its designated purpose (*e.g.,* activities such as reroofing, plumbing repair, door and window replacement); 


(2) Site characterization, environmental monitoring, or environmental research activities (*e.g.,* sampling and surveying water and air quality, flora and fauna abundance, and soil properties) in a floodplain or wetland, unless these activities would involve building any structure; involve draining, dredging, channelizing, filling, diking, impounding, or related activities; or result in long-term change to the ecosystem; and 


(3) Minor modification (*e.g.,* upgrading lighting, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems; installing or improving alarm and surveillance systems; and adding environmental monitoring or control systems) of an existing facility or structure in a floodplain or wetland to improve safety or environmental conditions unless the modification would result in a significant change in the expected useful life of the facility or structure, or involve building any structure or involve draining, dredging, channelizing, filling, diking, impounding, or related activities. 


(e) Although the actions listed in paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3) of this section normally have very small or no adverse impact on a floodplain or wetland, where unusual circumstances indicate the possibility of adverse impact on a floodplain or wetland, DOE shall determine the need for a floodplain or wetland assessment.
