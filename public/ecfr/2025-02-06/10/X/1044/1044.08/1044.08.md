# ยง 1044.08   Do you have to submit the documents for classification review before you give them to someone?

Yes, you must submit each document with a classification or control marking and any unmarked document generated in a classified or controlled subject area to the Inspector General. The Inspector General forwards each document to the Office of Classification for a determination as to whether the information in the document is properly classified, controlled, or may be released to the public.
