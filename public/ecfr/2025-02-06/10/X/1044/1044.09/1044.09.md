# ยง 1044.09   What do you do if you plan to disclose classified or unclassified controlled nuclear information orally rather than by providing copies of documents?

You must describe in detail to the Inspector General what information you wish to disclose. The Inspector General may require that the information to be disclosed be put in writing in order to ensure the Inspector General obtains and provides accurate advice. The Inspector General will consult with the Office of Classification who will provide you with advice, through the Inspector General, as to whether the information is classified or controlled and any steps needed to protect the information.
