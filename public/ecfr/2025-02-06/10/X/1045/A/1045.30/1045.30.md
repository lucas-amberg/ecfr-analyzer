*Classification guidance* means any instruction or source approved by an appropriate authority that prescribes the classification of specific information (*e.g.,* classification guide, classification bulletins, portion-marked source documents).


*Classification guide* means a written record of detailed instructions, approved by an appropriate authority, that explicitly identifies whether specific information is classified, usually concerning a system, plan, project, or program. If classified, the level and category of classification assigned to such information is specified. For NSI, the classification duration is also specified.


*Classified information* means:


(1) Information determined to be RD, FRD, or TFNI under the AEA and this part, or


(2) Information that has been determined pursuant to E.O. 13526 or any predecessor order to require protection against unauthorized disclosure and is marked to indicate its classification status when in documentary form.


*Classification level* means one of the three following designators for RD, FRD, and TFNI:


(1) *Top Secret (TS)* is applied to RD, FRD, or TFNI that is vital to the national security and the unauthorized disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security that the appropriate official is able to identify or describe.

(3) *Confidential (C)* is applied to RD, FRD, or TFNI the unauthorized disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause undue risk to the common defense and security that the appropriate official is able to identify or describe.


*Classified matter* means anything in physical or electronic form that contains or reveals classified information.


*Contractor* means any industrial, educational, commercial, or other entity, grantee, or licensee at all tiers, including a person that has executed an agreement with the Federal Government for the purpose of performing under a contract, license, or other agreement.

(2) A joint decision by DOE and the Department of Defense (DoD) that FRD is classified at a lower level than currently identified in a DOE or joint classification guide; or


(3) A decision by an RD Derivative Classifier (or in the case of TFNI, a person trained to derivatively classify TFNI) based on classification guides and bulletins that matter containing RD, FRD, or TFNI is classified at a lower level than currently marked.


(4) A decision, based on a DOE or joint classification guide, by an authorized person that matter containing RD, FRD, or TFNI is classified at a less sensitive category (*e.g.,* RD to FRD, RD to NSI) than currently marked.


*Formerly Restricted Data (FRD)* means classified information removed from the RD category under the AEA (section 142(d)), after DOE and DoD jointly determine it is related primarily to the military utilization of nuclear weapons and that the information can be adequately protected in a manner similar to NSI.


*Government* means the executive branch of the Federal Government of the United States.
