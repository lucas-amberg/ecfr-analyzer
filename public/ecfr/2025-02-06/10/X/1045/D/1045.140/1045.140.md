# § 1045.140   How is matter containing RD, FRD, or TFNI marked?

(a) *Matter determined to contain RD, FRD, or TFNI.* Matter determined to contain RD, FRD, or TFNI must be clearly marked to convey to the holder of that matter that it contains such information.


(b) *Marking matter containing RD, FRD, or TFNI in the IC.* Matter generated by/for the IC containing RD, FRD, or TFNI must be marked in accordance with the requirements in this part as described in ICD 710 or successor directives, and the corresponding implementation directives and policy guidance issued or approved by the DNI concerning marking matter containing RD, FRD, and TFNI.


(c) *Working papers containing RD, FRD, or TFNI.* Prior to the determination that matter contains RD, FRD, or TFNI, it must be marked and protected as a working paper. Matter that has not been reviewed that potentially contains RD, FRD, or TFNI, or is expected to be revised prior to the preparation of a finished product that contains RD, FRD, or TFNI, must be dated when created or last changed, marked with the highest potential level and category of information (and caveats, when applicable) on the bottom and top of each page, and must be protected at the highest potential level and category of the information contained in the matter. The matter must also be marked “Draft” or “Working Paper” on the front cover. The RD/FRD admonishment is not required. RD Derivative Classifier authority is not required to mark working papers containing RD or FRD. However, working papers containing RD or FRD must be reviewed by an RD Derivative Classifier, and working papers containing TFNI must be reviewed by a person trained to mark matter containing TFNI, and the matter must be marked as a final document when it is:


(1) Released outside the originating activity;


(2) Retained more than 180 days from the date of origin or the date of the last change; or


(3) Filed permanently.


(d) *RD and FRD markings.* An RD Derivative Classifier applies or authorizes the application of the following markings on matter determined to contain RD or FRD:


(1) *Front page.* The front page of matter containing RD or FRD must have the page/banner markings at the top and bottom, the RD or FRD admonishment, subject/title marking, and the classification authority block.


(i) *Front page/banner markings.* The top and bottom of the front page must clearly indicate the overall classification level of the matter. The classification category may also be included. No other markings are required in the page/banner marking.


(ii) *Admonishments.* (A) If the matter contains RD or RD and FRD, use the following admonishment:


This document contains RESTRICTED DATA as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Unauthorized disclosure subject to administrative and criminal sanctions.


(B) If the document contains FRD and no RD, use the following admonishment:


Unauthorized disclosure subject to administrative and criminal sanctions. Handle as RESTRICTED DATA in foreign dissemination. Section 144b, Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.


(iii) *Subject/title marking.* The classification level and category of the text of the subject or title (*e.g.,* U, SRD, CFRD, S//RD, C//FRD) must be marked immediately preceding the text of the subject or title.


(iv) *Classification authority block.* The classification authority block for matter containing RD or FRD must identify the RD Derivative Classifier who classified the matter and the classification guidance used to classify the matter.


(A) *Identity of the RD Derivative Classifier.* The RD Derivative Classifier must be identified by name and position or title, and, if not otherwise evident, the agency and office of origin must be identified. An RD Derivative Classifier may also be identified by a unique identifier. For example:


Classified By: *Jane Doe, Nuclear Analyst, DOE, CTI-61*

(B) *Identity of classification guidance.* (*1*) If a classification guide is used to classify the matter, the “Derived From” line must include the short title of the guide, the issue date of the guide, the issuing agency and, when available, office of origin. For example:


Derived From: *CG-ABC-1, 10/16/2014, DOE OC*

(*2*) If a source document is used to classify the matter, it must be identified, including the office of origin and the date of the source document. If more than one classification guide or source document is used, the words “Multiple Sources” may be included. In the case of multiple sources, a source list identifying each guide or source document must be included with all copies of the matter.


(C) *Declassification instructions.* Matter containing RD or FRD are never automatically declassified and must either omit the “Declassify On” line, or indicate that the matter is exempt from automatic declassification (Not Applicable or N/A for RD/FRD, as appropriate).


(2) *Interior page/banner marking.* Each interior page of matter containing RD or FRD must be clearly marked at the top and bottom with the overall classification level and category of the matter or the overall classification level and category of the page, whichever is preferred. The abbreviations “RD” and “FRD” may be used in conjunction with the matter classification (*e.g.,* SECRET//RD, CONFIDENTIAL//FRD).


(3) *Back cover or back page marking.* The outside of the back cover or back page must be marked with the overall level of information in the matter.


(4) *Portion marking.* Other than the required subject/title marking, portion marking is permitted, but not required, for matter containing RD or FRD. Each agency that generates matter containing RD or FRD determines the policy for portion marking matter generated within the agency. If matter containing RD or FRD is portion marked, each portion containing RD or FRD must be marked with the level and category of the information in the portion (*e.g.,* SRD, CFRD, S//RD, C//FRD).


(e) *TFNI markings.* If matter contains RD or FRD commingled with TFNI, the RD or FRD markings take precedence. If matter contains TFNI and no RD or FRD, a person who is trained to classify matter containing TFNI applies or authorizes the application markings on matter determined to contain TFNI in accordance with 32 CFR part 2001.22, or successor regulations, and with this part.


(1) *Front page.* If the matter contains TFNI and no RD or FRD, no admonishment is required on the front page, but the top and bottom of the front page must be clearly marked with the overall classification level and the TFNI label (*e.g.,* SECRET//TFNI).


(2) *Subject/title marking.* The classification level and category of the subject or title must be marked immediately preceding the text of the subject or title.


(3) *Portion marking.* Matter containing TFNI and no RD or FRD must be portion marked. Each portion containing TFNI must be marked immediately preceding the portion to which it applies with the level and category of the information in the portion (*e.g.,* S//TFNI).


(4) *Classification authority block.* The classifier and guidance used to classify matter containing TFNI must be identified as described in § 1045.40(d)(1)(iv)(A) and (B). In addition, the “Declassify On” line must be annotated with the statement: “Not Applicable [or N/A] to TFNI portions.”


(5) *Interior pages.* If the matter contains TFNI and no RD or FRD, the top and bottom of each interior page must be clearly marked with the overall classification level and the TFNI label (*e.g.,* SECRET//TFNI) or the overall classification level for each page with the TFNI label included on only those pages that contain TFNI, whichever is preferred.


(6) *Back cover or back page marking.* If the matter contains TFNI and no RD or FRD, the top and bottom of the outside of the back cover or back page must be clearly marked with the overall classification level of information in the matter.


(f) *Commingled matter—NSI.* Matter that contains a mixture of RD, FRD, or TFNI and NSI, and is portion marked, must also comply with the following:


(1) *Declassification instructions.* If the matter is not portion marked, then no declassification instructions are included. If the matter is portion marked, declassification instructions for each portion must be included in a source list. See this paragraph (f)(2) and E.O. 13526 or successor orders for instructions on annotating the source list.


(2) *Source list.* The source list must include declassification instructions for all NSI sources used to classify the NSI portions. The declassification instructions for sources that are used to classify the RD, FRD, or TFNI portions must state “Not applicable [or N/A] to RD/FRD/TFNI (as appropriate).” The source list must not appear on the front page of the matter, unless the matter is a single page. If the matter is a single page, the source list may appear at the bottom of the page, and must be clearly separate from the classification authority block.


(g) *Commingled matter—CUI.* (1) If matter containing RD and/or FRD and CUI is not portion marked, CUI markings are not required.


(2) *Applicable CUI Decontrol instructions.* (i) If the matter contains RD or FRD and is not portion marked, then CUI decontrol instructions must not be included.


(ii) If the matter is portion marked and decontrol instructions are applied, the decontrol instructions for the CUI portions must not be on the front page. Where they appear, they must be clearly labeled as decontrol instructions for CUI.


(iii) If the matter contains TFNI, and decontrol instructions are applied, the decontrol instructions for the CUI portions must not be on the front page. Where they appear they must be clearly labeled as decontrol instructions for CUI.


(h) *Marking special format matter.* Standard RD, FRD, or TFNI markings must be applied to matter in special formats (*e.g.,* photographs, flash memory drives, compact discs, audio or video tapes) to the extent practicable. Regardless of the precise markings in such cases, any special format matter that contains RD, FRD, or TFNI must be marked so that both a person in physical possession of the matter and a person with access to the information in or on the matter are aware that it contains RD, FRD, or TFNI.
