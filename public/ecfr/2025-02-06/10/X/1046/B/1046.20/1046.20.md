These records must be kept in accordance with the appropriate DOE Privacy Act System of Records, available at *http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/maprod/documents/FinalPASORNCompilation.1.8.09.pdf.*

(b) Nothing in this part is intended to preclude access to these records according to the requirements of other parts of this or other titles. Medical records maintained under this section may not be released except as permitted or required by law.

(1) The individual completes the examination;


(2) It is determined that the individual cannot engage in physical training or testing and cannot perform the essential functions of the job; or


(3) It is determined that the individual poses a direct threat to self or others.
