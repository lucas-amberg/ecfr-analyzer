This part sets forth the policies and procedures of the U.S. Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board (Board) regarding public access to documents under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552.

This part gives the procedures the public may use to inspect and obtain copies of Board records under the FOIA, including administrative procedures which must be exhausted before a request invokes the jurisdiction of an appropriate United States District Court for the Board's failure to respond to a proper request within the statutory time limits, for a denial of Board records or challenges to the adequacy of a search, or for denial of fee waiver.
