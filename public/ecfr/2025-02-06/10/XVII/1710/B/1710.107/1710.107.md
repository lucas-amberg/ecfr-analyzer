(7) The employee's right to a hearing conducted by an official arranged for by the Board (an administrative law judge, or alternatively, a hearing official not under the control of the head of the agency) if a petition is filed as prescribed in § 1710.109;


(8) The methods and time period for petitioning for hearings;


(9) A statement that the timely filing of a petition for a hearing will stay the commencement of collection proceedings;


(10) A statement that a final decision on the hearing will be issued not later than 60 days after the filing of the petition requesting the hearing unless the employee requests and the hearing official grants a delay in the proceedings;

(12) A statement of other rights and remedies available to the employee under statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection is being made; and


(13) Unless there are contractual or statutory provisions to the contrary, a statement that amounts paid on or deducted for the debt which are later waived or found not owed to the United States will be promptly refunded to the employee.

(c) Exceptions to entitlement to notice, hearing, written responses, and final decisions:


(1) Any adjustment to pay arising out of any employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less;


(2) A routine intra-agency adjustment of pay that is made to correct an overpayment of pay attributable to clerical or administrative errors or delays in processing pay documents, if the overpayment occurred within the four pay periods preceding the adjustment, and, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the adjustment and point of contact for contesting such adjustment; or
