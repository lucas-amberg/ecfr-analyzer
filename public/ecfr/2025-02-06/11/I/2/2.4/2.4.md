# ยง 2.4   Exempted meetings.

(a) *Meetings required by statute to be closed.* Meetings concerning matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statutes which require public withholding in such a manner as to leave no discretion for the Commission on the issue, or which establish particular types of matters to be withheld, shall be closed to public observation in accordance with the procedures of 11 CFR 2.5.


(1) As required by 52 U.S.C. 30109(a)(12), all Commission meetings, or portions of meetings, pertaining to any notification or investigation that a violation of the Act has occurred, shall be closed to the public.


(2) For the purpose of this section, *any notification or investigation that a violation of the Act has occurred* includes, but is not limited to, determinations pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30109, the issuance of subpoenas, discussion of referrals to the Department of Justice, or consideration of any other matter related to the Commission's enforcement activity, as set forth in 11 CFR part 111.


(b) *Meetings closed by Commission determination.* Except as provided in 11 CFR 2.4(c), the requirement of open meetings will not apply where the Commission finds, in accordance with 11 CFR 2.5, that an open meeting or the release of information is likely to result in the disclosure of:


(1) Matters that relate solely to the Commission's internal personnel decisions, or internal rules and practices;


(i) This provision includes, but is not limited to, matters relating to Commission policies on working conditions, or materials prepared predominantly for internal use, the disclosure of which would risk circumvention of Commission regulations; but


(ii) This provision does not include discussions or materials regarding employees' dealings with the public, such as personnel manuals or Commission directives setting forth job functions or procedures;


(2) Financial or commercial information obtained from any person which is privileged or confidential;


(3) Matters which involve the consideration of a proceeding of a formal nature by the Commission against a specific person or the formal censure of any person;


(4) Information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;


(5) Investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, or information which if written would be contained in such records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or information would:


(i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings,


(ii) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication,


(iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,


(iv) Disclose the identity of a confidential source,


(v) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or


(vi) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel;


(6) Information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to have a considerable adverse effect on the implementation of a proposed Commission action, as long as the Commission has not already disclosed the content or nature of its proposed action, or is not required by law to disclose it prior to final action; or


(7) Matters that specifically concern the Commission's participation in a civil action or proceeding, or an arbitration, or involving a determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing.


(c) Nothwithstanding the applicability of any exemptions set forth in 11 CFR 2.4(b), the Commission may determine that the public interest requires a meeting to be open.
