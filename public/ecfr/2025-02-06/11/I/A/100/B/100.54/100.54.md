# ยง 100.54   Compensation for personal services.

The payment by any person of compensation for the personal services of another person if those services are rendered without charge to a political committee for any purpose, except for legal and accounting services provided under 11 CFR 100.85 and 100.86, is a contribution. No compensation is considered paid to any employee under any of the following conditions: 


(a) *Paid on an hourly or salaried basis.* If an employee is paid on an hourly or salaried basis and is expected to work a particular number of hours per period, no contribution results if the employee engages in political activity during what would otherwise be a regular work period, provided that the taken or released time is made up or completed by the employee within a reasonable time. 


(b) *Paid on commission or piecework basis.* No contribution results where an employee engages in political activity during what would otherwise be normal working hours if the employee is paid on a commission or piecework basis, or is paid only for work actually performed and the employee's time is considered his or her own to use as he or she sees fit. 


(c) *Vacation or earned leave time.* No contribution results where the time used by the employee to engage in political activity is bona fide, although compensable, vacation time or other earned leave time.
