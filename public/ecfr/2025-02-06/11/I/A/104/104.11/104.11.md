# ยง 104.11   Continuous reporting of debts and obligations.

(a) Debts and obligations owed by or to a political committee which remain outstanding shall be continuously reported until extinguished. See 11 CFR 104.3(d). These debts and obligations shall be reported on separate schedules together with a statement explaining the circumstances and conditions under which each debt and obligation was incurred or extinguished. Where such debts and obligations are settled for less than their reported amount or value, the reporting committee shall include a statement as to the circumstances and conditions under which the debt or obligation was extinguished and the amount paid.


(b) A debt or obligation, including a loan, written contract, written promise or written agreement to make an expenditure, the amount of which is $500 or less, shall be reported as of the time payment is made or not later than 60 days after such obligation is incurred, whichever comes first. A debt or obligation, including a loan, written contract, written promise or written agreement to make an expenditure, the amount of which is over $500 shall be reported as of the date on which the debt or obligation is incurred, except that any obligation incurred for rent, salary or other regularly reoccurring administrative expense shall not be reported as a debt before the payment due date. *See* 11 CFR 116.6. If the exact amount of a debt or obligation is not known, the report shall state that the amount reported is an estimate. Once the exact amount is determined, the political committee shall either amend the report(s) containing the estimate or indicate the correct amount on the report for the reporting period in which such amount is determined.
