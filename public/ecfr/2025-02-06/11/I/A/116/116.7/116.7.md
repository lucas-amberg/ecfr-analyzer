# § 116.7   Debt settlement plans filed by terminating committees; Commission review.

(a) *Procedures for filing debt settlement plans.* Every terminating committee as defined in 11 CFR 116.1(a) shall file at least one debt settlement plan with the Commission prior to filing its termination report under 11 CFR 102.3. The terminating committee shall file a debt settlement plan after the creditors included in the debt settlement plan have agreed to the settlement or forgiveness of the particular debt(s) owed to each of them. The terminating committee shall not make any payments to the creditors included in the debt settlement plan until completion of Commission review. The Commission encourages terminating committees to include as many debt settlement agreements as possible in a debt settlement plan. The terminating committee shall not file its termination report under 11 CFR 102.3 and shall not terminate until each debt or obligation owed either:


(1) Has been paid in full;


(2) Has been settled and the requirements of this section, including Commission review, have been satisfied;


(3) Has been forgiven by the creditor and the requirements of 11 CFR 116.8, including Commission review, have been satisfied;


(4) Has been determined not to be payable pursuant to 11 CFR 116.9; or


(5) Has been otherwise extinguished or discharged.


(b) *Debts subject to settlement.* Debts and obligations subject to the debt settlement and Commission review requirements and procedures set forth in this section include:


(1) Amounts owed to commercial vendors (*See* 11 CFR 116.3 and 116.4);


(2) Debts arising from advances by committee staff and other individuals (*See* 11 CFR 116.5);


(3) Salary owed to committee employees (*See* 11 CFR 116.6); and


(4) Debts arising from loans from political committees or individuals, including candidates, to the extent permitted under 11 CFR part 110.


(c) *Debts that shall not be settled; Disputed debts.* (1) Debts and obligations that shall not be forgiven or settled for less than the entire amount owed include repayment obligations pursuant to 11 CFR 9007.2, 9008.10, 9008.11, 9038.2 or 9038.3 of funds received from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund or the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account.


(2) Disputed debts are not subject to the debt settlement and Commission review requirements and procedures. (*See* CFR 116.10).


(d) *Reporting.* The terminating committee shall continue to report each outstanding debt or obligation included in a debt settlement plan in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(d) and 104.11 until the Commission has completed a review of the debt settlement plan pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section. The terminating committee shall continue to report all remaining debts and obligations not included in the debt settlement plan in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3 and 104.11.


(e) *Contents of debt settlement plans.* (1) The debt settlement plan shall provide the following information on each debt covered by the plan—


(i) The terms of the initial extension of credit and a description of the terms under which the creditor has extended credit to nonpolitical debtors of similar risk and size of obligation;


(ii) A description of the efforts made by the candidate or the terminating committee to satisfy the debt;


(iii) A description of the remedies pursued by the creditor to obtain payment of the debt and a comparison to the remedies customarily pursued by the creditor in similar circumstances involving nonpolitical debtors; and


(iv) The terms of the debt settlement and a comparison to the terms of the creditor's other debt settlements involving nonpolitical debtors in similar circumstances, if any.


(2) Each debt settlement plan filed under this section shall include a signed statement from each creditor covered indicating agreement to the terms of the settlement of the debt owed to that creditor.


(3) The debt settlement plan shall include a statement as to whether the terminating committee has sufficient cash on hand to pay the total amount indicated in the debt settlement plan, and if not, a statement as to what steps the terminating committee will take to obtain the funds needed to make the payments.


(4) If a debt settlement plan does not include settlements for all of the terminating committee's outstanding debts and obligations, the debt settlement plan shall include a separate list of all of the terminating committee's remaining debts and obligations, including debts that are not subject to debt settlement as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. The debt settlement plan shall indicate—


(i) Whether the terminating committee intends to pay the entire amount still owed on each remaining debt or obligation or to settle such debts and obligations, and if settlement is contemplated, the terms that were or will be offered to the creditor(s); and


(ii) Whether the terminating committee has sufficient cash on hand to pay such remaining debts and obligations, or to pay a lesser portion of such amounts, and if not, what steps the terminating committee will take to obtain the funds needed to make such payments.


(5) If the terminating committee expects to have residual funds or assets after disposing of all its outstanding debts and obligations, the debt settlement plan shall include a statement as to the purpose for which such residual funds or assets will be used. *See* 11 CFR 110.1(b)(3)(iii) regarding contributions received to pay net debts outstanding owed by authorized committees.


(6) The political committee filing the debt settlement plan shall demonstrate in the debt settlement plan that such political committee qualifies as a terminating committee under 11 CFR 116.1(a) and shall state when the political committee expects to file a termination report under 11 CFR 102.3.


(7) Upon the Commission's request, the candidate, the terminating committee or the creditor shall provide such additional information as the Commission may require to review the debt settlement plan.

(1) The information provided by the terminating committee and the creditors under this section;


(2) The amount of each debt that remains unpaid and the length of time each debt has been overdue;


(3) The amount and percentage of each debt that would be forgiven under the plan;


(4) The total amount of debts and obligations owed by the terminating committee to all creditors, compared to the total amount of cash on hand and other amounts available to pay those debts and obligations;


(5) The year to date expenditures and receipts of the terminating committee; and


(6) Whether the total percentage that was or will be repaid on any loans made by the candidate to the terminating committee is comparable to the total percentage that was or will be paid to other creditors.


(g) *Debts dischargeable in bankruptcy.* If a terminating committee is released from debts or obligations pursuant to a discharge under 11 U.S.C. chapter 7, the terminating committee's debt settlement plan shall include a copy of the order issued by the Bankruptcy Court of the United States so indicating, and a list of all debts and obligations from which the terminating committee is released, in lieu of the information specified in paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), and (e)(3) of this section.
