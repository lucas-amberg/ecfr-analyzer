(a) *Minor and new party candidates.* Eligible candidates of a minor party or of a new party who, as candidates, receive 5 percent or more of the total number of popular votes cast for the office of President in the election shall be entitled to payments under 11 CFR part 9005 equal, in the aggregate, to a proportionate share of the amount allowed for major party candidates under 11 CFR 9004.1. The amount to which a minor or new party candidate is entitled shall bear the same ratio to the amount received by the major party candidates as the number of popular votes received by the minor or new party candidate in the Presidential election bears to the average number of popular votes received by the major party candidates for President in that election.


(b) *Amount of entitlement.* The aggregate payments to which an eligible candidate shall be entitled shall not exceed an amount equal to the lower of:


(1) The amount of qualified campaign expenses incurred by such eligible candidate and his or her authorized committee(s), reduced by the amount of contributions which are received to defray qualified campaign expenses by such eligible candidate and such committee(s); or


(2) The aggregate payments to which the eligible candidates of a major party are entitled under 11 CFR 9004.1, reduced by the amount of contributions received by such eligible candidates and their authorized committees to defray qualified campaign expenses in the case of a deficiency in the Fund.


(c) *Amount of entitlement limited by pre-election payment.* If an eligible candidate is entitled to payment under 11 CFR 9004.2, the amount allowable to that candidate under this section shall also be limited to the amount, if any, by which the entitlement under 11 CFR 9004.3(a) exceeds the amount of the entitlement under 11 CFR 9004.2.
