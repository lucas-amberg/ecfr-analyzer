# ยง 101.5   Nonconforming subsidiaries, assets, and activities.

(a) *Divestiture, conformance, or discontinuation.* A covered savings association shall divest, conform, or discontinue a nonconforming subsidiary, asset, or activity at the earliest time that prudent judgment dictates but not later than two years after the effective date of the election. The OCC may require a covered savings association to submit a plan to divest, conform, or discontinue a nonconforming subsidiary, asset, or activity.


(b) *Extension.* The OCC may grant a covered savings association extensions of not more than two years each up to a maximum of eight years if the OCC determines that:


(1) The covered savings association has made a good faith effort to divest, conform, or discontinue the nonconforming subsidiary, asset, or activity;


(2) Divestiture, conformance, or discontinuation would have a material adverse financial effect on the covered savings association; and


(3) Retention or continuation of the nonconforming subsidiary, asset, or activity is consistent with the safe and sound operation of the covered savings association.


(c) *Applicable law.* Until a covered savings association divests, conforms, or discontinues a nonconforming subsidiary, asset, or activity, the nonconforming subsidiary, asset, or activity shall continue to be subject to the same provisions of law that applied to the nonconforming subsidiary, asset, or activity on the day before the effective date of the election, including any amendments to those provisions of law.
