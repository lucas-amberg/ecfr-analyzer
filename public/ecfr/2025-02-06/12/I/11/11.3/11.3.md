(ii) *Electronic filing exception.* If a national bank or Federal savings association experiences unanticipated technical difficulties preventing the timely preparation and submission of an electronic filing, other than the filings described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, the bank may, upon notice to the OCC's Law Department, file the subject filing in paper format no later than one business day after the date on which the filing was to be made.

(3) *Date of filing*—(i) *General.* The date of filing is the date the OCC receives the filing, provided the person, bank, or savings association submitting the filing has complied with all applicable requirements. An electronic filing that is submitted on a business day by direct transmission commencing on or before 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard or Daylight Savings Time, whichever is currently in effect, would be deemed received by the OCC on the same business day.
