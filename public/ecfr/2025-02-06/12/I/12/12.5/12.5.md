(b) *Trust transactions.* A national bank effecting a securities transaction for an account in which the bank exercises investment discretion other than in an agency capacity shall give or send written notification within a reasonable time if a person having the power to terminate the account, or, if there is no such person, any person holding a vested beneficial interest in the account, requests written notification pursuant to § 12.4 (a) or (b). Otherwise, notification is not required.
