(3) The request shall contain—


(i) The member's full name and address;


(ii) The nature and extent of the member's interest in the Federal savings association at the time the information is given;

(4) The Federal savings association shall reply to the request within either—


(i) Fourteen days;

(iii) Three days, if the communication is in connection with a special meeting;


(5) The reply shall provide either—


(i) The number of the Federal savings association's members and the estimated reasonable cost to the Federal savings association of mailing to them the proposed communication; or


(ii) Notification that the Federal savings association has determined not to mail the communication because it is “improper”, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section;


(6) After receiving the amount of the estimated costs of mailing and sufficient copies of the communication, the Federal savings association shall mail the communication to all members, by a class of mail specified by the requesting member, either—


(i) Within fourteen days;


(ii) Within seven days, if the communication is in connection with the annual meeting;


(iii) As soon as practicable before the meeting, if the communication is in connection with a special meeting; or


(iv) On a later date specified by the member;


(7) If the Federal savings association refuses to mail the proposed communication, it shall return the requesting member's materials together with a written statement of the specific reasons for refusal, and shall simultaneously send to the appropriate OCC licensing office two copies each of the requesting member's materials, the Federal savings association's written statement, and any other relevant material. The materials shall be sent within:


(i) Fourteen days,


(ii) Ten days if the communication is in connection with the annual meeting, or


(iii) Three days, if the communication is in connection with a special meeting, after the Federal savings association receives the request for communication.


(c) *Improper communication.* A communication is an “improper communication” if it contains material which:


(1) At the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it is made:


(i) Is false or misleading with respect to any material fact; or


(ii) Omits a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, or necessary to correct a statement in an earlier communication on the same subject which has become false or misleading;

(3) Relates to any matter, including a general economic, political, racial, religious, social, or similar cause, that is not significantly related to the business of the Federal savings association or is not within the control of the Federal savings association; or


(4) Directly or indirectly and without expressed factual foundation:


(i) Impugns character, integrity, or personal reputation,


(ii) Makes charges concerning improper, illegal, or immoral conduct, or


(iii) Makes statements impugning the stability and soundness of the Federal savings association.
