# § 19.28   Interlocutory review.

(a) *General rule.* The Comptroller may review a ruling of the ALJ prior to the certification of the record to the Comptroller only in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section and § 19.23.


(b) *Scope of review.* The Comptroller may exercise interlocutory review of a ruling of the ALJ if the Comptroller finds:


(1) The ruling involves a controlling question of law or policy as to which substantial grounds exist for a difference of opinion;


(2) Immediate review of the ruling may materially advance the ultimate termination of the proceeding;


(3) Subsequent modification of the ruling at the conclusion of the proceeding would be an inadequate remedy; or


(4) Subsequent modification of the ruling would cause unusual delay or expense.


(c) *Procedure.* Any request for interlocutory review must be filed by a party with the ALJ within ten days of the ruling and must otherwise comply with § 19.23. Any party may file a response to a request for interlocutory review in accordance with § 19.23(d). Upon the expiration of the time for filing all responses, the ALJ will refer the matter to the Comptroller for final disposition.


(d) *Suspension of proceeding.* Neither a request for interlocutory review nor any disposition of such a request by the Comptroller under this section suspends or stays the proceeding unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ or the Comptroller.
