# § 19.112   Informal hearing.

(a) *Issuance of hearing order.* After receipt of a request for hearing, the OCC Supervisory Office must notify the petitioner requesting the hearing and OCC Enforcement of the date, time, and place fixed for the hearing. The OCC will hold the hearing no later than 30 days from the date when the OCC receives the request for a hearing, unless the time is extended in response to a written request of the petitioner. The OCC Supervisory Office may extend the hearing date only for a specific period of time and must take appropriate action to ensure that the hearing is not unduly delayed.


(b) *Appointment of presiding officer.* The OCC Supervisory Office must appoint one or more OCC employees as the presiding officer to conduct the hearing. The presiding officer(s) may not have been involved in a prosecutorial or investigative role in the proceeding, a factually related proceeding, or the underlying enforcement action.


(c) *Waiver of oral hearing*—(1) *Petitioner.* When the petitioner requests a hearing, the petitioner may elect to have the matter determined by the presiding officer solely on the basis of written submissions by serving on the OCC Supervisory Office and all parties a signed document waiving the statutory right to appear and make oral argument. The petitioner must present the written submissions to the presiding officer and serve the other parties not later than ten days prior to the date fixed for the hearing or within a shorter time period as the presiding officer may permit.


(2) *OCC.* The OCC may respond to the petitioner's submissions by presenting the presiding officer with a written response and by serving the other parties in the manner prescribed by § 19.11(c) not later than the date fixed for the hearing or within such other time period as the presiding officer may require.


(d) *Hearing procedures*—(1) *Conduct of hearing.* Hearings under this subpart are not subject to the provisions of subpart A of this part or the adjudicative provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 554-557).


(2) *Powers of the presiding officer.* The presiding officer must determine all procedural issues that are governed by this subpart. The presiding officer also may permit witnesses, limit the number of witnesses, and impose time limitations as they deem reasonable. The informal hearing will not be governed by formal rules of evidence, including the Federal Rules of Evidence. The presiding officer must consider all oral presentations, when permitted, and all documents the presiding officer deems to be relevant and material to the proceeding and not unduly repetitious. The presiding officer may ask questions of any person participating in the hearing and may make any rulings reasonably necessary to facilitate the effective and efficient operation of the hearing.


(3) *Presentation.* (i) The OCC and the petitioner may present relevant written materials and oral argument at the hearing. The petitioner may appear at the hearing personally or through counsel. Except as permitted in paragraph (c) of this section, each party, including the OCC, must file a copy of any affidavit, memorandum, or other written material to be presented at the hearing with the presiding officer and must serve the other parties not later than ten days prior to the hearing or within such shorter time period as permitted by the presiding officer.


(ii) If the petitioner or the OCC desires to present oral testimony or witnesses at the hearing, they must file a written request with the presiding officer not later than ten days prior to the hearing, or within a shorter time period as required by the presiding officer. The written request must include the names of proposed witnesses, along with the general nature of the expected testimony, and the reasons why oral testimony is necessary. The presiding officer generally will not admit oral testimony or witnesses unless a specific and compelling need is demonstrated. Witnesses, if admitted, must be sworn. By stipulation of the parties or by order of the presiding officer, a court reporter or other person authorized to administer an oath may administer the oath remotely without being in the physical presence of the witness.


(iii) In deciding on any suspension or prohibition based on an indictment, information, or complaint, the presiding officer may not consider the ultimate question of the guilt or innocence of the individual with respect to the criminal charges that are outstanding. In deciding on any removal or prohibition with respect to a conviction or pre-trial diversion program, the presiding officer may not consider challenges to or efforts to impeach the validity of the conviction or the agreement to enter a pre-trial diversion program or other similar program. The presiding officer may consider facts in either situation, however, that show the nature of the events on which the criminal charges, conviction, or agreement to enter a pre-trial diversion program or other similar program was based.


(4) *Electronic presentation.* Based on the circumstances of each hearing, the presiding officer may direct the use of, or any party may elect to use, an electronic presentation during the hearing. If the presiding officer requires an electronic presentation during the hearing, each party will be responsible for their own presentation and related costs unless the parties agree to another manner by which to allocate presentation responsibilities and costs.


(5) *Record.* A transcript of the proceedings may be taken if the petitioner requests a transcript and agrees to pay all expenses or if the presiding officer determines that the nature of the case warrants a transcript. The presiding officer may order the record to be kept open for a reasonable period following the hearing, not to exceed five business days, to permit the petitioner or the OCC to submit additional documents for the record. Thereafter, no further submissions may be accepted except for good cause shown.
