# ยง 19.161   Hearing process.

(a) *Hearing request.* Pursuant to 12 CFR 5.50(f)(6), following receipt of a notice of disapproval of a proposed acquisition of control of a national bank or Federal savings association, a filer may request a hearing by the OCC on the proposed acquisition. A hearing request must:


(1) Be in writing; and


(2) Be filed with the Hearing Clerk of the OCC within ten days after service on the filer of the notice of disapproval. If a filer fails to request a hearing with a timely written request, the notice of disapproval constitutes a final and unappealable order.


(b) *Hearing order.* Following receipt of a hearing request, the Comptroller will issue, within 20 days, an order that sets forth:


(1) The legal authority for the proceeding and for the OCC's jurisdiction over the proceeding;


(2) The matters of fact or law upon which the disapproval is based; and


(3) The requirement for filing an answer to the hearing order with OFIA within 20 days after service of the hearing order.


(c) *Answer.* An answer to a hearing order must specifically deny those portions of the order that are disputed. Those portions of the order that the filer does not specifically deny are deemed admitted by the filer. Any hearing under this subpart is limited to those portions of the order that are specifically denied.


(d) *Effect of failure to answer.* Failure of a filer to file an answer within 20 days after service of the hearing order constitutes a waiver of the filer's right to appear and contest the allegations in the hearing order. If a filer does not file a timely answer, Enforcement Counsel may file a motion for entry of an order of default. Upon a finding that no good cause has been shown for the failure to file a timely answer, the ALJ will file with the Comptroller a recommended decision containing the findings and the relief sought in the hearing order. Any final order issued by the Comptroller based upon a filer's failure to answer is deemed to be an order issued upon consent and is a final and unappealable order.
