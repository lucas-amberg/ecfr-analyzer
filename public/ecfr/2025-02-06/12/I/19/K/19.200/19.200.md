(b) *Suspension.* If the final order against the respondent is for suspension, the individual may not practice before the OCC during the period of suspension.


(c) *Censure.* If the final order against the respondent is for censure, the individual may be permitted to practice before the OCC, but such individual's future representations may be subject to conditions designed to promote high standards of conduct.
