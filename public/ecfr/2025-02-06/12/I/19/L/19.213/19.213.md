# ยง 19.213   Settlement.

The applicant and Enforcement Counsel may agree on a proposed settlement of the award before final action on the application, either in connection with a settlement of the underlying proceeding or after the underlying proceeding has been concluded, in accordance with ยง 19.15. If a prevailing party and Enforcement Counsel agree on a proposed settlement of an award before an application has been filed, the application must be filed with the proposed settlement. If a proposed settlement of an underlying proceeding provides that each side must bear its own expenses and the settlement is accepted, no application may be filed. If, after an application is filed, Enforcement Counsel and the applicant believe that the issues in the application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement will extend, under ยง 19.211, the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, and further extensions may be granted by the presiding officer upon request by Enforcement Counsel and the applicant.
