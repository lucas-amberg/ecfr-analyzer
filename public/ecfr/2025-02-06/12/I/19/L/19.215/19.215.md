# § 19.215   Decision.

(a) *Basis for decision.* The presiding officer must determine whether the position of the OCC was substantially justified on the basis of the administrative record as a whole of the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses are sought.


(b) *Timing of decision.* The presiding officer in a proceeding under this subpart will issue a recommended decision, in writing, on the application within 90 days after the time for filing a reply or, when further proceedings are held, within 90 days after completion of proceedings.


(c) *Contents of decision.* The decision on the application must include written findings and conclusions on the applicant's eligibility and status as a prevailing party, and, if applicable, an explanation of the reasons for any difference between the amount requested and the amount awarded. The decision also must include, if applicable, findings on whether Enforcement Counsel's or the OCC's position was substantially justified, whether the applicant unduly and unreasonably protracted the adversary adjudication, or whether special circumstances make an award unjust.


(d) *Awards.*—(1) *In general.* Awards under this subpart may include the reasonable expenses of expert witnesses; the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, report, test, or project; and reasonable attorney or agent fees. The applicant must have incurred these expenses, costs, and fees after initiation of the adversary adjudication subject to the EAJA application. The presiding officer will base awards on prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the services furnished, even if the services were provided without charge or at reduced rate to the applicant, except that:


(i) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under this subpart may exceed the hourly rate specified in 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(A) except to account for inflation since the last update of the statute's maximum award upon the request of the applicant as documented in the application pursuant to § 19.209 or if a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys or agents for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee; and


(ii) No award to compensate an expert witness may exceed the highest rate at which the OCC pays expert witnesses.


(2) *Award for fees of an attorney, agent, or expert witness.* In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent, or expert witness the presiding officer should consider:


(i) If in private practice, the attorney's, agent's, or witness' customary fee for similar services;


(ii) If an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the attorney's, agent's, or witness' services;


(iii) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily perform services;


(iv) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;


(v) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and


(vi) Any other factors that may bear on the value of the services provided.


(3) *Awards for costs of a study, analysis, report, test, project, or similar matter.* The presiding officer may award the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, report, test, project, or similar matter prepared on behalf of the applicant to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services and the presiding officer finds that the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.


(4) *Reduction or denial of an award.* A presiding officer may reduce the amount to be awarded, or deny any award, to the extent that the party during the course of the proceedings engaged in conduct which unduly and unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the matter in controversy or if special circumstances make the award sought unjust.


(e) *Final agency decision.* The Comptroller will issue a final decision on the application or remand the application to the presiding officer for further proceedings in accordance with § 19.40.
