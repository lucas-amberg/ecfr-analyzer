# § 19.221   Reclassification of an insured depository institution based on unsafe or unsound condition or practice.

(a) *Issuance of notice of proposed reclassification*—(1) *Grounds for reclassification.* (i) Pursuant to § 6.4 of this chapter, the OCC may reclassify a well capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized or subject an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized insured depository institution to the supervisory actions applicable to the next lower capital category if:


(A) The OCC determines that the insured depository institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition; or


(B) The OCC deems the insured depository institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice and not to have corrected the deficiency.


(ii) Any action pursuant to this paragraph (a)(1) is referred to in this subpart as “reclassification.”


(2) *Prior notice to institution.* Prior to taking action pursuant to § 6.4 of this chapter, the OCC will issue and serve on the insured depository institution a written notice of the OCC's intention to reclassify the insured depository institution.


(b) *Contents of notice.* A notice of intention to reclassify an insured depository institution based on unsafe or unsound condition will include:


(1) A statement of the insured depository institution's capital measures and capital levels and the category to which the insured depository institution would be reclassified;


(2) The reasons for reclassification of the insured depository institution; and


(3) The date by which the insured depository institution subject to the notice of reclassification may file with the OCC a written response to the proposed reclassification and a request for a hearing, which must be at least 14 calendar days from the date of service of the notice unless the OCC determines that a shorter period is appropriate in light of the financial condition of the insured depository institution or other relevant circumstances.


(c) *Response to notice of proposed reclassification.* An insured depository institution may file a written response to a notice of proposed reclassification within the time period set by the OCC. The response should include:


(1) An explanation of why the insured depository institution is not in unsafe or unsound condition or otherwise should not be reclassified; and


(2) Any other relevant information, mitigating circumstances, documentation, or other evidence in support of the position of the insured depository institution or company regarding the reclassification.


(d) *Failure to file response.* Failure by an insured depository institution to file, within the specified time period, a written response with the OCC to a notice of proposed reclassification will constitute a waiver of the opportunity to respond and will constitute consent to the reclassification.


(e) *Request for hearing and presentation of oral testimony or witnesses.* The response may include a request for an informal hearing before the OCC under this section. If the insured depository institution desires to present oral testimony or witnesses at the hearing, the insured depository institution must include a request to do so with the request for an informal hearing. A request to present oral testimony or witnesses must specify the names of the witnesses and the general nature of their expected testimony. Failure to request a hearing will constitute a waiver of any right to a hearing, and failure to request the opportunity to present oral testimony or witnesses will constitute a waiver of any right to present oral testimony or witnesses.


(f) *Order for informal hearing.* Upon receipt of a timely written request that includes a request for a hearing, the OCC will issue an order directing an informal hearing to commence no later than 30 days after receipt of the request, unless the OCC allows further time at the request of the insured depository institution. The hearing will be held in Washington, DC or at such other place as may be designated by the OCC before a presiding officer(s) designated by the OCC to conduct the hearing.


(g) *Hearing procedures.* (1) The insured depository institution has the right to introduce relevant written materials and to present oral argument at the hearing. The insured depository institution may introduce oral testimony and present witnesses only if expressly authorized by the OCC or the presiding officer(s). Neither the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 554-557) governing adjudications required by statute to be determined on the record nor the Uniform Rules apply to an informal hearing under this section unless the OCC orders that such procedures will apply.


(2) The informal hearing will be recorded and a transcript furnished to the insured depository institution upon request and payment of the cost thereof. Witnesses need not be sworn unless specifically requested by a party or the presiding officer(s). If so requested, and by stipulation of the parties or by order of the presiding officer, a court reporter or other person authorized to administer an oath may administer the oath remotely without being in the physical presence of the witness. The presiding officer(s) may ask questions of any witness.


(3) Based on the circumstances of each hearing, the presiding officer may direct the use of, or any party may elect to use, an electronic presentation during the hearing. If the presiding officer requires an electronic presentation during the hearing, each party will be responsible for its own presentation and related costs unless the parties agree to another manner by which to allocate presentation responsibilities and costs.


(4) The presiding officer(s) may order that the hearing be continued for a reasonable period (normally five business days) following completion of oral testimony or argument to allow additional written submissions to the hearing record.


(h) *Recommendation of presiding officer(s).* Within 20 calendar days following the date the hearing and the record on the proceeding are closed, the presiding officer(s) will make a recommendation to the OCC on the reclassification.


(i) *Time for decision.* Not later than 60 calendar days after the date the record is closed or the date of the response in a case where no hearing was requested, the OCC will decide whether to reclassify the insured depository institution and notify the insured depository institution of the OCC's decision.
