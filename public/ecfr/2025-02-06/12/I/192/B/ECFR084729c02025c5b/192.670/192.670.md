# ยง 192.670   Approval of voluntary supervisory conversion application.

The appropriate Federal banking agency will generally approve a savings association's application to engage in a voluntary supervisory conversion unless it determines:


(a) The savings association does not meet the eligibility requirements for a voluntary supervisory conversion under ยง 192.625 or ยง 192.630 or because the proceeds from the sale of conversion stock, less the expenses of the conversion, would be insufficient to satisfy any applicable viability requirement;


(b) The transaction is detrimental to or would cause potential injury to the savings association or the Deposit Insurance Fund or is contrary to the public interest;


(c) The savings association or its acquiror, or the controlling parties or directors and officers of the savings association or its acquiror, have engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in connection with the voluntary supervisory conversion; or


(d) The savings association fails to justify an employment contract incidental to the conversion, or the employment contract will be an unsafe or unsound practice or represent a sale of control. In a voluntary supervisory conversion, the appropriate Federal banking agency generally will not approve employment contracts of more than one year for existing management.
