The bank or savings association may elect to be assessed as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section only if it collects and reports the data required for other banks or savings associations under § 25.42.


(4) *Strategic plan.* The appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates the performance of a bank or savings association under a strategic plan if the bank or savings association submits, and the appropriate Federal banking agency approves, a strategic plan as provided in § 25.27.


(b) *Performance context.* The appropriate Federal banking agency applies the tests and standards in paragraph (a) of this section and also considers whether to approve a proposed strategic plan in the context of:


(1) Demographic data on median income levels, distribution of household income, nature of housing stock, housing costs, and other relevant data pertaining to a bank's or savings association's assessment area(s);


(2) Any information about lending, investment, and service opportunities in the bank's or savings association's assessment area(s) maintained by the bank or savings association or obtained from community organizations, state, local, and tribal governments, economic development agencies, or other sources;


(3) The bank's or savings association's product offerings and business strategy as determined from data provided by the bank or savings association;


(4) Institutional capacity and constraints, including the size and financial condition of the bank or savings association, the economic climate (national, regional, and local), safety and soundness limitations, and any other factors that significantly affect the bank's or savings association's ability to provide lending, investments, or services in its assessment area(s);

(c) *Assigned ratings.* The appropriate Federal banking agency assigns to a bank or savings association one of the following four ratings pursuant to § 25.28 and appendix A of this part: “outstanding”; “satisfactory”; “needs to improve”; or “substantial noncompliance” as provided in 12 U.S.C. 2906(b)(2). The rating assigned by the appropriate Federal banking agency reflects the bank's or savings association's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank or savings association.


(d) *Safe and sound operations.* This part and the CRA do not require a bank or savings association to make loans or investments or to provide services that are inconsistent with safe and sound operations. To the contrary, the appropriate Federal banking agency anticipates banks and savings associations can meet the standards of this part with safe and sound loans, investments, and services on which the banks and savings associations expect to make a profit. Banks and savings associations are permitted and encouraged to develop and apply flexible underwriting standards for loans that benefit low- or moderate-income geographies or individuals, only if consistent with safe and sound operations.

For purposes of this paragraph, “low-cost education loans” means any education loan, as defined in section 140(a)(7) of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1650(a)(7)) (including a loan under a State or local education loan program), originated by the bank or savings association for a student at an “institution of higher education,” as that term is generally defined in sections 101 and 102 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001 and 1002) and the implementing regulations published by the U.S. Department of Education, with interest rates and fees no greater than those of comparable education loans offered directly by the U.S. Department of Education. Such rates and fees are specified in section 455 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087e).


(f) *Activities in cooperation with minority- or women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions.* In assessing and taking into account the record of a nonminority-owned and nonwomen-owned bank or savings association under this part, the appropriate Federal banking agency considers as a factor capital investment, loan participation, and other ventures undertaken by the bank or savings association in cooperation with minority- and women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions. Such activities must help meet the credit needs of local communities in which the minority- and women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions are chartered. To be considered, such activities need not also benefit the bank's or savings association's assessment area(s) or the broader statewide or regional area(s) that includes the bank's or savings association's assessment area(s).

§ 25.27 Strategic plan.

(a) *Alternative election.* The appropriate Federal banking agency will assess a bank's or savings association's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its assessment area(s) under a strategic plan if:


(1) The bank or savings association has submitted the plan to the appropriate Federal banking agency as provided for in this section;


(2) The appropriate Federal banking agency has approved the plan;


(3) The plan is in effect; and


(4) The bank or savings association has been operating under an approved plan for at least one year.


(b) *Data reporting.* The appropriate Federal banking agency's approval of a plan does not affect the bank's or savings association's obligation, if any, to report data as required by § 25.42.


(c) *Plans in general*—(1) *Term.* A plan may have a term of no more than five years, and any multi-year plan must include annual interim measurable goals under which the appropriate Federal banking agency will evaluate the bank's or savings association's performance.


(2) *Multiple assessment areas.* A bank or savings association with more than one assessment area may prepare a single plan for all of its assessment areas or one or more plans for one or more of its assessment areas.


(3) *Treatment of affiliates.* Affiliated institutions may prepare a joint plan if the plan provides measurable goals for each institution. Activities may be allocated among institutions at the institutions' option, provided that the same activities are not considered for more than one institution.


(d) *Public participation in plan development.* Before submitting a plan to the appropriate Federal banking agency for approval, a bank or savings association shall:


(1) Informally seek suggestions from members of the public in its assessment area(s) covered by the plan while developing the plan;


(2) Once the bank or savings association has developed a plan, formally solicit public comment on the plan for at least 30 days by publishing notice in at least one newspaper of general circulation in each assessment area covered by the plan; and


(3) During the period of formal public comment, make copies of the plan available for review by the public at no cost at all offices of the bank or savings association in any assessment area covered by the plan and provide copies of the plan upon request for a reasonable fee to cover copying and mailing, if applicable.


(e) *Submission of plan.* The bank or savings association shall submit its plan to the appropriate Federal banking agency at least three months prior to the proposed effective date of the plan. The bank or savings association shall also submit with its plan a description of its informal efforts to seek suggestions from members of the public, any written public comment received, and, if the plan was revised in light of the comment received, the initial plan as released for public comment.


(f) *Plan content*—(1) *Measurable goals.* (i) A bank or savings association shall specify in its plan measurable goals for helping to meet the credit needs of each assessment area covered by the plan, particularly the needs of low- and moderate-income geographies and low- and moderate-income individuals, through lending, investment, and services, as appropriate.


(ii) A bank or savings association shall address in its plan all three performance categories and, unless the bank or savings association has been designated as a wholesale or limited purpose bank or savings association, shall emphasize lending and lending-related activities. Nevertheless, a different emphasis, including a focus on one or more performance categories, may be appropriate if responsive to the characteristics and credit needs of its assessment area(s), considering public comment and the bank's or savings association's capacity and constraints, product offerings, and business strategy.


(2) *Confidential information.* A bank or savings association may submit additional information to the appropriate Federal banking agency on a confidential basis, but the goals stated in the plan must be sufficiently specific to enable the public and the appropriate Federal banking agency to judge the merits of the plan.


(3) *Satisfactory and outstanding goals.* A bank or savings association shall specify in its plan measurable goals that constitute “satisfactory” performance. A plan may specify measurable goals that constitute “outstanding” performance. If a bank or savings association submits, and the appropriate Federal banking agency approves, both “satisfactory” and “outstanding” performance goals, the appropriate Federal banking agency will consider the bank or savings association eligible for an “outstanding” performance rating.


(4) *Election if satisfactory goals not substantially met.* A bank or savings association may elect in its plan that, if the bank or savings association fails to meet substantially its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, the appropriate Federal banking agency will evaluate the bank's or savings association's performance under the lending, investment, and service tests, the community development test, or the small bank or savings association performance standards, as appropriate.


(g) *Plan approval*—(1) *Timing.* The appropriate Federal banking agency will act upon a plan within 60 calendar days after the appropriate Federal banking agency receives the complete plan and other material required under paragraph (e) of this section. If the appropriate Federal banking agency fails to act within this time period, the plan shall be deemed approved unless the appropriate Federal banking agency extends the review period for good cause.


(2) *Public participation.* In evaluating the plan's goals, the appropriate Federal banking agency considers the public's involvement in formulating the plan, written public comment on the plan, and any response by the bank or savings association to public comment on the plan.


(3) *Criteria for evaluating plan.* The appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates a plan's measurable goals using the following criteria, as appropriate:


(i) The extent and breadth of lending or lending-related activities, including, as appropriate, the distribution of loans among different geographies, businesses and farms of different sizes, and individuals of different income levels, the extent of community development lending, and the use of innovative or flexible lending practices to address credit needs;


(ii) The amount and innovativeness, complexity, and responsiveness of the bank's or savings association's qualified investments; and


(iii) The availability and effectiveness of the bank's or savings association's systems for delivering retail banking services and the extent and innovativeness of the bank's or savings association's community development services.


(h) *Plan amendment.* During the term of a plan, a bank or savings association may request the appropriate Federal banking agency to approve an amendment to the plan on grounds that there has been a material change in circumstances. The bank or savings association shall develop an amendment to a previously approved plan in accordance with the public participation requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.


(i) *Plan assessment.* The appropriate Federal banking agency approves the goals and assesses performance under a plan as provided for in appendix A of this part.






§ 25.28 Assigned ratings.

(a) *Ratings in general.* Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the appropriate Federal banking agency assigns to a bank or savings association a rating of “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve,” or “substantial noncompliance” based on the bank's or savings association's performance under the lending, investment and service tests, the community development test, the small bank or savings association performance standards, or an approved strategic plan, as applicable.


(b) *Lending, investment, and service tests.* The appropriate Federal banking agency assigns a rating for a bank or savings association assessed under the lending, investment, and service tests in accordance with the following principles:


(1) A bank or savings association that receives an “outstanding” rating on the lending test receives an assigned rating of at least “satisfactory”;


(2) A bank or savings association that receives an “outstanding” rating on both the service test and the investment test and a rating of at least “high satisfactory” on the lending test receives an assigned rating of “outstanding”; and


(3) No bank or savings association may receive an assigned rating of “satisfactory” or higher unless it receives a rating of at least “low satisfactory” on the lending test.


(c) *Effect of evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices.* (1) The appropriate Federal banking agency's evaluation of a bank's or savings association's CRA performance is adversely affected by evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices in any geography by the bank or savings association or in any assessment area by any affiliate whose loans have been considered as part of the bank's or savings association's lending performance. In connection with any type of lending activity described in § 25.22(a), evidence of discriminatory or other credit practices that violate an applicable law, rule, or regulation includes, but is not limited to:


(i) Discrimination against applicants on a prohibited basis in violation, for example, of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act or the Fair Housing Act;


(ii) Violations of the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act;


(iii) Violations of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act;


(iv) Violations of section 8 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act; and


(v) Violations of the Truth in Lending Act provisions regarding a consumer's right of rescission.


(2) In determining the effect of evidence of practices described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section on the bank's or savings association's assigned rating, the appropriate Federal banking agency considers the nature, extent, and strength of the evidence of the practices; the policies and procedures that the bank or savings association (or affiliate, as applicable) has in place to prevent the practices; any corrective action that the bank or savings association (or affiliate, as applicable) has taken or has committed to take, including voluntary corrective action resulting from self-assessment; and any other relevant information.






§ 25.29 Effect of CRA performance on applications.

(a) *CRA performance.* Among other factors, the appropriate Federal banking agency takes into account the record of performance under the CRA of each applicant bank or savings association, and for applications under 10(e) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1467a(e)), of each proposed subsidiary savings association, in considering an application for:


(1) The establishment of:


(i) A domestic branch for insured national banks; or


(ii) A domestic branch or other facility that would be authorized to take deposits for savings associations;


(2) The relocation of the main office or a branch;


(3) The merger or consolidation with or the acquisition of assets or assumption of liabilities of an insured depository institution requiring approval under the Bank Merger Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(c)); and


(4) The conversion of an insured depository institution to a national bank or Federal savings association charter; and


(5) Acquisitions subject to section 10(e) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1467a(e)).


(b) *Charter application.* (1) An applicant (other than an insured depository institution) for a national bank charter shall submit with its application a description of how it will meet its CRA objectives. The OCC takes the description into account in considering the application and may deny or condition approval on that basis.


(2) An applicant for a Federal savings association charter shall submit with its application a description of how it will meet its CRA objectives. The appropriate Federal banking agency takes the description into account in considering the application and may deny or condition approval on that basis.


(c) *Interested parties.* The appropriate Federal banking agency takes into account any views expressed by interested parties that are submitted in accordance with the applicable comment procedures in considering CRA performance in an application listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.


(d) *Denial or conditional approval of application.* A bank's or savings association's record of performance may be the basis for denying or conditioning approval of an application listed in paragraph (a) of this section.


(e) *Insured depository institution.* For purposes of this section, the term “insured depository institution” has the meaning given to that term in 12 U.S.C. 1813.




§ 25.41 Assessment area delineation.

(a) *In general.* A bank or savings association shall delineate one or more assessment areas within which the appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates the bank's or savings association's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its community. The appropriate Federal banking agency does not evaluate the bank's or savings association's delineation of its assessment area(s) as a separate performance criterion, but the appropriate Federal banking agency reviews the delineation for compliance with the requirements of this section.


(b) *Geographic area(s) for wholesale or limited purpose banks or savings associations.* The assessment area(s) for a wholesale or limited purpose bank or savings association must consist generally of one or more MSAs or metropolitan divisions (using the MSA or metropolitan division boundaries that were in effect as of January 1 of the calendar year in which the delineation is made) or one or more contiguous political subdivisions, such as counties, cities, or towns, in which the bank or savings association has its main office, branches, and deposit-taking ATMs.


(c) *Geographic area(s) for other banks and savings association.* The assessment area(s) for a bank or savings association other than a wholesale or limited purpose bank or savings association must:


(1) Consist generally of one or more MSAs or metropolitan divisions (using the MSA or metropolitan division boundaries that were in effect as of January 1 of the calendar year in which the delineation is made) or one or more contiguous political subdivisions, such as counties, cities, or towns; and


(2) Include the geographies in which the bank or savings association has its main office, its branches, and its deposit-taking ATMs, as well as the surrounding geographies in which the bank or savings association has originated or purchased a substantial portion of its loans (including home mortgage loans, small business and small farm loans, and any other loans the bank or savings association chooses, such as those consumer loans on which the bank or savings association elects to have its performance assessed).


(d) *Adjustments to geographic area(s).* A bank or savings association may adjust the boundaries of its assessment area(s) to include only the portion of a political subdivision that it reasonably can be expected to serve. An adjustment is particularly appropriate in the case of an assessment area that otherwise would be extremely large, of unusual configuration, or divided by significant geographic barriers.


(e) *Limitations on the delineation of an assessment area.* Each bank's or savings associations assessment area(s):


(1) Must consist only of whole geographies;


(2) May not reflect illegal discrimination;


(3) May not arbitrarily exclude low- or moderate-income geographies, taking into account the bank's or savings association's size and financial condition; and


(4) May not extend substantially beyond an MSA boundary or beyond a state boundary unless the assessment area is located in a multistate MSA. If a bank or savings association serves a geographic area that extends substantially beyond a state boundary, the bank or savings association shall delineate separate assessment areas for the areas in each state. If a bank or savings association serves a geographic area that extends substantially beyond an MSA boundary, the bank or savings association shall delineate separate assessment areas for the areas inside and outside the MSA.


(f) *Banks and savings association serving military personnel.* Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, a bank or savings association whose business predominantly consists of serving the needs of military personnel or their dependents who are not located within a defined geographic area may delineate its entire deposit customer base as its assessment area.


(g) *Use of assessment area(s).* The appropriate Federal banking agency uses the assessment area(s) delineated by a bank or savings association in its evaluation of the bank's or savings association's CRA performance unless the appropriate Federal banking agency determines that the assessment area(s) do not comply with the requirements of this section.

If the bank or savings association maintains data for loans in a certain category, it shall maintain data for all loans originated or purchased within that category. The bank or savings association shall maintain data separately for each category, including for each loan:


(i) A unique number or alpha-numeric symbol that can be used to identify the relevant loan file;


(ii) The loan amount at origination or purchase;


(iii) The loan location; and

(1) May order that a bank's covered interstate branch or branches be closed unless the bank provides reasonable assurances to the satisfaction of the OCC, after an opportunity for public comment, that the bank has an acceptable plan under which the bank will reasonably help to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank in the host state; and


(2) Will not permit the bank to open a new branch in the host state that would be considered to be a covered interstate branch unless the bank provides reasonable assurances to the satisfaction of the OCC, after an opportunity for public comment, that the bank will reasonably help to meet the credit needs of the community that the new branch will serve.


(b) *Notice prior to closure of a covered interstate branch.* Before exercising the OCC's authority to order the bank to close a covered interstate branch, the OCC will issue to the bank a notice of the OCC's intent to order the closure and will schedule a hearing within 60 days of issuing the notice.

(2) A bank's or savings association's performance need not fit each aspect of a particular rating profile in order to receive that rating, and exceptionally strong performance with respect to some aspects may compensate for weak performance in others.
