If an intermediate bank or savings association opts out of the Community Development Financing Test in § 25.24, the appropriate Federal banking agency reverts to evaluating the bank or savings association pursuant to the Intermediate Bank and Savings Association Community Development Test in § 25.30(a)(2), starting with the evaluation period preceding the bank's or savings association's next CRA examination.
