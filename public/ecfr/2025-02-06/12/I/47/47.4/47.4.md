# ยง 47.4   U.S. special resolution regimes.

(a) *Covered QFCs not required to be conformed.* (1) Notwithstanding ยง 47.3, a covered bank is not required to conform a covered QFC to the requirements of this section if:


(i) The covered QFC designates, in the manner described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the U.S. special resolution regimes as part of the law governing the QFC; and


(ii) Each party to the covered QFC, other than the covered bank, is:


(A) An individual that is domiciled in the United States, including any State;


(B) A company that is incorporated in or organized under the laws of the United States or any State;


(C) A company the principal place of business of which is located in the United States, including any State; or


(D) A U.S. branch or U.S. agency.


(2) A covered QFC designates the U.S. special resolution regimes as part of the law governing the QFC if the covered QFC:


(i) Explicitly provides that the covered QFC is governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States; and


(ii) Does not explicitly provide that one or both of the U.S. special resolution regimes, or a broader set of laws that includes a U.S. special resolution regime, is excluded from the laws governing the covered QFC.


(b) *Provisions required.* A covered QFC must explicitly provide that:


(1) In the event the covered bank becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. special resolution regime, the transfer of the covered QFC (and any interest and obligation in or under, and any property securing, the covered QFC) from the covered bank will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. special resolution regime if the covered QFC (and any interest and obligation in or under, and any property securing, the covered QFC) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States; and


(2) In the event the covered bank or an affiliate of the covered bank becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. special resolution regime, default rights with respect to the covered QFC that may be exercised against the covered bank are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than the default rights could be exercised under the U.S. special resolution regime if the covered QFC were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.


(c) *Relevance of creditor protection provisions.* The requirements of this section apply notwithstanding paragraphs (d), (f), and (h) of ยง 47.5.
