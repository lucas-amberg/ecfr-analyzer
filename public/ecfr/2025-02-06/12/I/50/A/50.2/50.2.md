(a) The OCC may require a national bank or Federal savings association to hold an amount of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) greater than otherwise required under this part, or to take any other measure to improve the national bank's or Federal savings association's liquidity risk profile, if the OCC determines that the national bank's or Federal savings association's liquidity requirements as calculated under this part are not commensurate with the national bank's or Federal savings association's liquidity risks. In making determinations under this section, the OCC will apply notice and response procedures as set forth in 12 CFR 3.404.


(b) The OCC may require a national bank or Federal savings association to maintain an amount of available stable funding greater than otherwise required under this part, or to take any other measure to improve the national bank's or Federal savings association's stable funding, if the OCC determines that the national bank's or Federal savings association's stable funding requirements as calculated under this part are not commensurate with the national bank's or Federal savings association's funding risks. In making determinations under this section, the OCC will apply notice and response procedures as set forth in 12 CFR 3.404.


(c) Nothing in this part limits the authority of the OCC under any other provision of law or regulation to take supervisory or enforcement action, including action to address unsafe or unsound practices or conditions, deficient liquidity levels, deficient stable funding levels, or violations of law.
