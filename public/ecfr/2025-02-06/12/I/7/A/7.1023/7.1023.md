# ยง 7.1023   Federal savings associations, prohibition on industrial or commercial metal dealing or investing.

(a) In this section, *industrial or commercial metal* means metal (including an alloy) in a physical form primarily suited to industrial or commercial use, for example, copper cathodes.


(b) Federal savings associations may not deal or invest in industrial or commercial metal.


(c) *Other authorities not affected.* This section may not be construed to preclude a Federal savings association from acquiring or selling metal in connection with its authority to foreclose on loan collateral, compromise doubtful claims, or avoid loss in connection with a debt previously contracted.


(d) *Nonconforming holdings.* Federal savings associations that hold industrial or commercial metal as a result of dealing or investing in that metal must dispose of such metal as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from April 1, 2018. The OCC may grant up to four separate one-year extensions to dispose of industrial or commercial metal if a Federal savings association makes a good faith effort to dispose of the metal and retention of the metal for an additional year is not inconsistent with safe and sound operation of the association.
