(b) *Definitions.* As used in this section:


(1) *Appropriate OCC supervisory office* means the OCC office that is responsible for the supervision of a national bank or Federal savings association, as described in subpart A of 12 CFR part 4;


(2) *Member* includes a national bank or Federal savings association designated as a “member,” or “participant,” or other similar role by a payment system, including by a payment system that requires the national bank or Federal savings association to share in operational losses or maintain a reserve with the payment system to offset potential liability for operational losses. This definition includes indirect members only if they agree to be bound by the rules of the payment system and the rules of the payment system indicate indirect members are covered;


(3) *Open-ended liability* refers to liability for operational losses that is not capped under the rules of the payment system and includes indemnifications of third parties provided as a condition of membership in the payment system;


(4) *Operational loss* means a charge resulting from sources other than defaults by other members of the payment system. Examples of operational losses include losses that are due to: Employee misconduct, fraud, misjudgment, or human error; management failure; information systems failures; disruptions from internal or external events that result in the degradation or failure of services provided by the payment system; security breaches or cybersecurity events; or payment or settlement delays, constrained liquidity, contagious disruptions, and resulting litigation; and


(5) *Payment system* means “financial market utility” as defined in 12 U.S.C. 5462(6), wherever operating, and includes both retail and wholesale payment systems. Payment system does not include a derivatives clearing organization registered under the Commodity Exchange Act, a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or foreign organization that would be considered a derivatives clearing organization or clearing agency were it operating in the United States.


(c) *Notice requirements*—(1) *Prior notice required.* A national bank or Federal savings association must provide written notice to its appropriate OCC supervisory office at least 30 days prior to joining a payment system that exposes it to open-ended liability.


(2) *After-the-fact notice.* A national bank or Federal savings association must provide written notice to its appropriate OCC supervisory office within 30 days of joining a payment system that does not expose it to open-ended liability.


(d) *Content of notice*—(1) *In general.* A notice required by paragraph (c) of this section must include representations that the national bank or Federal savings association:


(i) Has complied with the safety and soundness review requirements in paragraph (e)(1) of this section; and


(ii) Will comply with the safety and soundness review and notification requirements in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section.


(2) *Payment system with limits on liability or no liability.* A notice filed under paragraph (c)(2) of this section also must include a representation that either:


(i) The rules of the payment system do not impose liability for operational losses on members; or


(ii) The national bank's or Federal savings association's liability for operational losses is limited by the rules of the payment system to specific and appropriate limits that do not exceed the lower of:


(A) The legal lending limit under 12 CFR part 32; or


(B) The limit set for the bank or savings association by the OCC.


(e) *Safety and soundness procedures.* (1) Prior to joining a payment system, a national bank or Federal savings association must:


(i) Identify and evaluate the risks posed by membership in the payment system, taking into account whether the liability of the bank or savings association is limited; and


(ii) Ensure that it can measure, monitor, and control the risks identified pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.


(2) After joining a payment system, a national bank or Federal savings association must manage the risks of the payment system on an ongoing basis. This ongoing risk management must:


(i) Identify and evaluate the risks posed by membership in the payment system, taking into account whether the liability of the bank or savings association is limited; and


(ii) Measure, monitor, and control the risks identified pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section.


(3) If the national bank or Federal savings association identifies risks during the ongoing risk management required by paragraph (e)(2) of this section that raise safety and soundness concerns, such as a material change to the bank's or savings association's liability or indemnification responsibilities, the national bank or Federal savings association must:


(i) Notify the appropriate OCC supervisory office as soon as the safety and soundness concern is identified; and


(ii) Take appropriate actions to remediate the risk.


(4) A national bank or Federal savings association that believes its open-ended liability is otherwise limited (*e.g.,* by negotiated agreements or laws of an appropriate jurisdiction) may consider its liability to be limited for purposes of the reviews required by paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section so long as:


(i) Prior to joining the payment system, the bank or savings association obtains a written legal opinion that:


(A) Describes how the payment system allocates liability for operational losses; and


(B) Concludes the potential liability for operational losses for the national bank or Federal savings association is in fact limited to specific and appropriate limits that do not exceed the lower of:


(*1*) The legal lending limit under 12 CFR part 32; or


(*2*) The limit set for the bank or savings association by the OCC; and


(ii) There are no material changes to the liability or indemnification requirements applicable to the bank or savings association since the issuance of the written legal opinion.
