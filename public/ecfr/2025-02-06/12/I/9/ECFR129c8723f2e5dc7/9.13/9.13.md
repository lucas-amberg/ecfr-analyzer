# ยง 9.13   Custody of fiduciary assets.

(a) *Control of fiduciary assets.* A national bank shall place assets of fiduciary accounts in the joint custody or control of not fewer than two of the fiduciary officers or employees designated for that purpose by the board of directors. A national bank may maintain the investments of a fiduciary account off-premises, if consistent with applicable law and if the bank maintains adequate safeguards and controls. A bank that is deemed a fiduciary based solely on its capacity as investment advisor, as that capacity is defined in ยง 9.101(a), and has no other fiduciary capacity as enumerated in ยง 9.2(e) is not required to serve as custodian when offering those fiduciary services.


(b) *Separation of fiduciary assets.* A national bank shall keep the assets of fiduciary accounts separate from the assets of the bank. A national bank shall keep the assets of each fiduciary account separate from all other accounts or shall identify the investments as the property of a particular account, except as provided in ยง 9.18.
