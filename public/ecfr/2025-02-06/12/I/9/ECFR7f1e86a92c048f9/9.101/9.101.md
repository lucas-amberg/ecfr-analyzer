# § 9.101   Providing investment advice for a fee.

(a) *In general.* The term “fiduciary capacity” at § 9.2(e) is defined to include “investment adviser, if the bank receives a fee for its investment advice.” In other words, if a bank is providing investment advice for a fee, then it is acting in a fiduciary capacity. For purposes of that definition, “investment adviser” generally means a national bank that provides advice or recommendations concerning the purchase or sale of specific securities, such as a national bank engaged in portfolio advisory and management activities (including acting as investment adviser to a mutual fund). Additionally, the qualifying phrase “if the bank receives a fee for its investment advice” excludes those activities in which the investment advice is merely incidental to other services.


(b) *Specific activities*—(1) *Full-service brokerage.* Engaging in full-service brokerage may entail providing investment advice for a fee, depending upon the commission structure and specific facts. Full-service brokerage involves investment advice for a fee if a non-bank broker engaged in that activity is considered an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-1 *et seq.*).


(2) *Activities not involving investment advice for a fee.* The following activities generally do not entail providing investment advice for a fee:


(i) Financial advisory and counseling activities, including strategic planning of a financial nature, merger and acquisition advisory services, advisory and structuring services related to project finance transactions, and providing market economic information to customers in general;


(ii) Client-directed investment activities (*i.e.,* the bank has no investment discretion) where investment advice and research may be made available to the client, but the fee does not depend on the provision of investment advice;


(iii) Investment advisory activities incidental to acting as a municipal securities dealer;


(iv) Real estate management services provided to other financial institutions;


(v) Real estate consulting services, including acting as a finder in locating, analyzing, and making recommendations regarding the purchase of property, and making recommendations concerning the sale of property;


(vi) Advisory activities concerning bridge loans;


(vii) Advisory activities for homeowners' associations;


(viii) Advisory activities concerning tax planning and structuring; and


(ix) Investment advisory activities authorized by the OCC under 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) as incidental to the business of banking.
