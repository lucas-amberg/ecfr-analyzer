# ยง 201.3   Extensions of credit generally.

(a) *Advances to and discounts for a depository institution.* (1) A Federal Reserve Bank may lend to a depository institution either by making an advance secured by acceptable collateral under ยง 201.4 of this part or by discounting certain types of paper. A Federal Reserve Bank generally extends credit by making an advance. 


(2) An advance to a depository institution must be secured to the satisfaction of the Federal Reserve Bank that makes the advance. Satisfactory collateral generally includes United States government and federal-agency securities, and, if of acceptable quality, mortgage notes covering one-to four-family residences, state and local government securities, and business, consumer, and other customer notes. 


(3) If a Federal Reserve Bank concludes that a discount would meet the needs of a depository institution or an institution described in section 13A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 349) more effectively, the Reserve Bank may discount any paper indorsed by the institution, provided the paper meets the requirements specified in the Federal Reserve Act. 


(b) *No obligation to make advances or discounts.* This section does not entitle any person or entity to obtain any credit or any increase, renewal or extension of maturity of any credit from a Federal Reserve Bank.


(c) *Information requirements.* (1) Before extending credit to a depository institution, a Federal Reserve Bank should determine if the institution is an undercapitalized insured depository institution or a critically undercapitalized insured depository institution and, if so, follow the lending procedures specified in ยง 201.5. 


(2) Each Federal Reserve Bank shall require any information it believes appropriate or desirable to ensure that assets tendered as collateral for advances or for discount are acceptable and that the borrower uses the credit provided in a manner consistent with this part. 


(3) Each Federal Reserve Bank shall: 


(i) Keep itself informed of the general character and amount of the loans and investments of a depository institution as provided in section 4(8) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 301); and 


(ii) Consider such information in determining whether to extend credit. 


(d) *Indirect credit for others.* Except for depository institutions that receive primary credit as described in ยง 201.4(a), no depository institution shall act as the medium or agent of another depository institution in receiving Federal Reserve credit except with the permission of the Federal Reserve Bank extending credit.
