# § 204.127   Nondepository participation in “Federal funds” market.

(a) The Board has considered whether the use of *interdepository institution loan participations* (*IDLPs*) which involve participation by third parties other than depository institutions in Federal funds transactions, comes within the exemption from *deposit* classification for certain obligations owed by a depository institution to an institution exempt in § 204.2(a)(1)(vii)(A) of Regulation D. An IDLP transaction is one through which an institution that has sold Federal funds to a depository institution, subsequently *sells* or participates out that obligation to a nondepository third party without notifying the obligated institution. 


(b) The Board's interpretation regarding Federal funds transactions (12 CFR 204.126) clarified that a depository institutions's liability must be issued to an exempt institution described in § 204.2(a)(1)(vii)(A) of Regulation D for its own account in order to come within the nondeposit exemption for interdepository liabilities. The Board regards transactions which result in third parties gaining access to the Federal funds market as contrary to the exemption contained in § 204.2(a)(1)(vii)(A) of Regulation D regardless of whether the nondepository institution third party is a party to the initial transaction or thereafter becomes a participant in the transaction through purchase of all or part of the obligation held by the *selling* depository institution. 


(c) The Board regards the notice requirements set out in 12 CFR 204.126 as applicable to IDLP-type transactions as described herein so that a depository institution *selling* Federal funds must provide to the purchaser—


(1) Notice of its intention, at the time of the initial transaction, to sell or participate out its loan contract to a nondepository third party, and 


(2) Full and prompt notice whenever it (the *selling* depository institution) subsequently sells or participates out its loan contract to a non-depository third party.
