# § 205.12   Relation to other laws.

(a) *Relation to Truth in Lending.* (1) The Electronic Fund Transfer Act and this part govern—


(i) The addition to an accepted credit card as defined in Regulation Z (12 CFR 226.12, comment 12-2), of the capability to initiate electronic fund transfers;


(ii) The issuance of an access device that permits credit extensions (under a preexisting agreement between a consumer and a financial institution) only when the consumer's account is overdrawn or to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer's account, or under an overdraft service, as defined in § 205.17(a);


(iii) The addition of an overdraft service, as defined in § 205.17(a), to an accepted access device; and


(iv) A consumer's liability for an unauthorized electronic fund transfer and the investigation of errors involving an extension of credit that occurs under an agreement between the consumer and a financial institution to extend credit when the consumer's account is overdrawn or to maintain a specified minimum balance in the consumer's account, or under an overdraft service, as defined in § 205.17(a).


(2) The Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226), which prohibit the unsolicited issuance of credit cards, govern—


(i) The addition of a credit feature to an accepted access device; and


(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the issuance of a credit card that is also an access device.


(b) *Preemption of inconsistent state laws*—(1) *Inconsistent requirements.* The Board shall determine, upon its own motion or upon the request of a state, financial institution, or other interested party, whether the act and this part preempt state law relating to electronic fund transfers, or dormancy, inactivity, or service fees, or expiration dates in the case of gift certificates, store gift cards, or general-use prepaid cards.


(2) *Standards for determination.* State law is inconsistent with the requirements of the act and this part if it: 


(i) Requires or permits a practice or act prohibited by the federal law; 


(ii) Provides for consumer liability for unauthorized electronic fund transfers that exceeds the limits imposed by the federal law; 


(iii) Allows longer time periods than the federal law for investigating and correcting alleged errors, or does not require the financial institution to credit the consumer's account during an error investigation in accordance with § 205.11(c)(2)(i); or 


(iv) Requires initial disclosures, periodic statements, or receipts that are different in content from those required by the federal law except to the extent that the disclosures relate to consumer rights granted by the state law and not by the federal law. 


(c) *State exemptions*—(1) *General rule.* Any state may apply for an exemption from the requirements of the act or this part for any class of electronic fund transfers within the state. The Board shall grant an exemption if it determines that: 


(i) Under state law the class of electronic fund transfers is subject to requirements substantially similar to those imposed by the federal law; and 


(ii) There is adequate provision for state enforcement. 


(2) *Exception.* To assure that the federal and state courts continue to have concurrent jurisdiction, and to aid in implementing the act: 


(i) No exemption shall extend to the civil liability provisions of section 915 of the act; and 


(ii) When the Board grants an exemption, the state law requirements shall constitute the requirements of the federal law for purposes of section 915 of the act, except for state law requirements not imposed by the federal law.
