(3) The Board may assist any insured depository institution or affiliate that is a party to a covered agreement that is unenforceable by a NGEP by operation of section 48 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831y) in identifying a successor to assume the NGEP's responsibilities under the agreement. 


(b) *Diversion of funds.* If a court or other body of competent jurisdiction determines that funds or resources received under a covered agreement have been diverted contrary to the purposes of the covered agreement for an individual's personal financial gain, the Board may take either or both of the following actions—


(1) Order the individual to disgorge the diverted funds or resources received under the agreement; 


(2) Prohibit the individual from being a party to any covered agreement for a period not to exceed 10 years.
