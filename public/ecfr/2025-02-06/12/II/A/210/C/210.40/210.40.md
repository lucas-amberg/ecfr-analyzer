# § 210.40   Authority, purpose, and scope.

(a) *Authority and purpose.* This subpart provides rules to govern funds transfers through the FedNow Service, and has been issued pursuant to the Federal Reserve Act—section 13 (12 U.S.C. 342), paragraph (f) of section 19 (12 U.S.C. 464), paragraph 14 of section 16 (12 U.S.C. 248(o)), and paragraphs (i) and (j) of section 11 (12 U.S.C. 248(i) and (j))—and other laws and has the force and effect of Federal law. This subpart is not a funds-transfer system rule as defined in Section 4A-501(b) of Article 4A.


(b) *Scope.* (1) This subpart incorporates the provisions of Article 4A set forth in appendix A of this part. In the event of an inconsistency between the provisions of the sections of this subpart and appendix A of this part, the provisions of the sections of this subpart shall prevail.


(2) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section, this subpart, including Article 4A as incorporated herein and operating circulars of the Federal Reserve Banks issued in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, governs the rights and obligations of the following parties with respect to the FedNow Service:


(i) Federal Reserve Banks that send or receive payment orders;


(ii) Senders that send payment orders directly to a Federal Reserve Bank;


(iii) Receiving banks that receive payment orders directly from a Federal Reserve Bank;


(iv) Beneficiaries that receive payment for payment orders by means of credit to the beneficiary's settlement account; and


(v) Other parties to a funds transfer any part of which is carried out through the FedNow Service to the same extent as if this subpart were considered a funds-transfer system rule under Article 4A.


(3) A Federal Reserve Bank that is not the sender's Federal Reserve Bank, receiving bank's Federal Reserve Bank, or beneficiary's Federal Reserve Bank is not a party to the funds transfer for purposes of this subpart and Article 4A.


(4) This subpart governs a funds transfer that is sent through the FedNow Service, even if a portion of the funds transfer is governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, but in the event of an inconsistency between the provisions this subpart and the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.


(c) *Operating Circulars.* Each Federal Reserve Bank shall issue an Operating Circular consistent with this subpart that governs the details of its funds-transfer operations in connection with the FedNow Service and other matters it deems appropriate. Among other things, the Operating Circular may: set cut-off times and funds-transfer business days; address security procedures offered by the Federal Reserve Banks to verify the authenticity of a payment order; specify format and media requirements for payment orders; specify the time and method of receipt, execution, and acceptance of a payment order and settlement of a Federal Reserve Bank's payment obligation for purposes of Article 4A; prescribe time limits for the processing of payment orders; specify service terms governing ancillary features of the FedNow Service; provide for the acceptance of documents in electronic form to the extent any provision in Article 4A requires an agreement or other document to be in writing; identify messages that are not payment orders; and impose charges for funds-transfer services.


(d) *Government senders, receiving banks, and beneficiaries.* Except as otherwise expressly provided by the statutes of the United States, the parties specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) through (v) of this section include a department, agency, instrumentality, independent establishment, or office of the United States, or a wholly-owned or controlled government corporation.


(e) *Financial messaging standards.* Financial messaging standards (*e.g.,* ISO 20022), including the financial messaging components, elements, technical documentation, tags, and terminology used to implement those standards, do not confer or connote legal status or responsibilities. This subpart, including Article 4A as incorporated herein, and the operating circulars of the Federal Reserve Banks issued in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section govern the rights and obligations of parties to funds transfers sent through the FedNow Service as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. To the extent there is any inconsistency between a financial messaging standard adopted by the Federal Reserve Banks for the FedNow Service and this subpart, this subpart shall prevail.
