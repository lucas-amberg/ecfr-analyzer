# ยง 210.43   Agreement of sender.

(a) *Payment of sender's obligation to a Federal Reserve Bank.* A sender (other than a Federal Reserve Bank), by maintaining or using a settlement account with a Federal Reserve Bank, authorizes the sender's Federal Reserve Bank to obtain payment for the sender's payment orders by debiting, or causing any other Federal Reserve Bank on whose books the settlement account is maintained to debit, the amount of the payment order from the settlement account. The sender remains responsible for payment if the Federal Reserve Bank on whose books the settlement account is maintained does not, for any reason, obtain payment by debiting that account.


(b) *Overdrafts.* (1) A sender does not have the right to an overdraft in its settlement account. In the event an overdraft is created, the overdraft shall be due and payable immediately, without the need for a demand by the Federal Reserve Bank, at the earliest of the following times:


(i) At the end of the FedNow funds-transfer business day;


(ii) At the time the Federal Reserve Bank, in its sole discretion, deems itself insecure and gives notice thereof to the sender; or


(iii) At the time the sender suspends payments or is closed.


(2) The sender shall have in its settlement account, at the time the overdraft is due and payable, a balance of actually and finally collected funds sufficient to cover the aggregate amount of all its obligations to the Federal Reserve Bank, whether the obligations result from the acceptance of a payment order or otherwise.


(3) To secure any overdraft, as well as any other obligation due or to become due to its Federal Reserve Bank, a sender, by sending a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank that is accepted by the Federal Reserve Bank, grants to the Federal Reserve Bank a security interest in all of its assets in the possession or control of, or held for the account of, the Federal Reserve Bank. The security interest attaches when an overdraft, or any other obligation to the Federal Reserve Bank, becomes due and payable.


(4) A Federal Reserve Bank may take any action authorized by law to recover the amount of an overdraft that is due and payable, including, but not limited to, the exercise of rights of set off, the realization on any available collateral, and any other rights it may have as a creditor under applicable law.


(5) If a sender, other than a government sender described in ยง 210.40(d), incurs an overdraft in its settlement account as a result of a debit to the account by a Federal Reserve Bank under paragraph (a) of this section, the settlement account will be subject to any applicable overdraft charges, regardless of whether the overdraft has become due and payable. A Federal Reserve Bank may debit the settlement account under paragraph (a) of this section immediately on acceptance of the payment order.


(c) *Review of payment orders.* A sender, by sending a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank, agrees that for the purposes of sections 4A-204(a) and 4A-304 of Article 4A, a reasonable time to notify a Federal Reserve Bank of the relevant facts concerning an unauthorized or erroneously executed payment order is within 60 calendar days after the sender receives notice that the payment order was accepted or that the sender's settlement account was debited with respect to the payment order.
