# § 212.6   General exemption.

(a) *Exemption.* The Board may, by agency order, exempt an interlock from the prohibitions in § 212.3, if the Board finds that the interlock would not result in a monopoly or substantial lessening of competition, and would not present safety and soundness concerns.


(b) *Presumptions.* In reviewing an application for an exemption under this section, the Board will apply a rebuttable presumption that an interlock will not result in a monopoly or substantial lessening of competition if the depository organization seeking to add a management official:


(1) Primarily serves low- and moderate-income areas;


(2) Is controlled or managed by persons who are members of a minority group, or women;


(3) Is a depository institution that has been chartered for less than two years; or


(4) Is deemed to be in “troubled condition” as defined in 12 CFR 225.71.


(c) *Duration.* Unless a shorter expiration period is provided in the Board approval, an exemption permitted by paragraph (a) of this section may continue so long as it does not result in a monopoly or substantial lessening of competition, or is unsafe or unsound. If the Board grants an interlock exemption in reliance upon a presumption under paragraph (b) of this section, the interlock may continue for three years, unless otherwise provided by the Board in writing.
