(2) Identifying all building block parents as required under § 217.605(b)(3);


(3) Determining the available capital and capital requirement for each building block parent in accordance with its indicated capital framework;


(4) Determining the building block available capital and building block capital requirement for each building block, reflecting adjustments and scaling as set out in this subpart;


(5) Rolling up building block available capital and building block capital requirement amounts across all building blocks in the supervised insurance organization's enterprise to determine the same for any depository institution holding companies in the enterprise; and


(6) Determining the ratio of building block available capital to building block capital requirement for each depository institution holding company in the supervised insurance organization.


(b) *Determination of BBA ratio.* For a depository institution holding company in a supervised insurance organization, the BBA ratio is the ratio of the company's building block available capital to the company's building block capital requirement, each scaled to the common capital framework in accordance with § 217.606.


(c) *Minimum capital requirement.* A depository institution holding company in a supervised insurance organization must maintain a BBA ratio of at least 250 percent.


(d) *Capital adequacy.* (1) Notwithstanding the minimum requirement in this subpart, a depository institution holding company in a supervised insurance organization must maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of all risks to which it is exposed. The supervisory evaluation of the depository institution holding company's capital adequacy is based on an individual assessment of numerous factors, including the character and condition of the company's assets and its existing and prospective liabilities and other corporate responsibilities.


(2) A depository institution holding company in a supervised insurance organization must have a process for assessing its overall capital adequacy in relation to its risk profile and a comprehensive strategy for maintaining an appropriate level of capital.
