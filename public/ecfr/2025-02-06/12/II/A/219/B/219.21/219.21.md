# ยง 219.21   Authority, purpose and scope.

This subpart of Regulation S (12 CFR part 219, subpart B) is issued by the Board under the authority of section 21(b) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1829b), as amended by the Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-550, title XV; 106 Stat. 3672, 4044), which authorizes the Board and the Secretary of the Treasury jointly to prescribe recordkeeping and reporting requirements for domestic wire transfers by insured depository institutions; and which also requires the Board and the Treasury jointly to prescribe recordkeeping and reporting requirements for international wire transfers by insured depository institutions and by nonbank financial institutions. The definitions and recordkeeping and reporting requirements referenced in this subpart are promulgated and administered jointly by the Board and the Treasury and are codified in 31 CFR 1010.100, 1010.410(e), and 1020.410(a). This subpart does not apply to a particular person or class of persons or a particular transaction or class of transactions to the extent that the Treasury has determined that 31 CFR 1010.410(e) or 1020.410(a) do not apply to that person, transaction, or class of persons or transactions. These recordkeeping and reporting requirements will assist in the prosecution of money laundering activities and are determined to have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax or regulatory investigations or proceedings.
