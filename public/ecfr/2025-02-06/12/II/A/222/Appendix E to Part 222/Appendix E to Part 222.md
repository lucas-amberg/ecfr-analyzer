# Appendix E to Part 222— Interagency Guidelines Concerning the Accuracy and Integrity of Information Furnished to Consumer Reporting Agencies


The Board encourages voluntary furnishing of information to consumer reporting agencies. Section 222.42 of this part requires each furnisher to establish and implement reasonable written policies and procedures concerning the accuracy and integrity of the information it furnishes to consumer reporting agencies. Under § 222.42(b) of this part, a furnisher must consider the guidelines set forth below in developing its policies and procedures. In establishing these policies and procedures, a furnisher may include any of its existing policies and procedures that are relevant and appropriate. Section 222.42(c) requires each furnisher to review its policies and procedures periodically and update them as necessary to ensure their continued effectiveness.


(a) *Nature and Scope.* Section 222.42(a) of this part requires that a furnisher's policies and procedures be appropriate to the nature, size, complexity, and scope of the furnisher's activities. In developing its policies and procedures, a furnisher should consider, for example:


(1) The types of business activities in which the furnisher engages;


(2) The nature and frequency of the information the furnisher provides to consumer reporting agencies; and


(3) The technology used by the furnisher to furnish information to consumer reporting agencies.


(b) *Objectives.* A furnisher's policies and procedures should be reasonably designed to promote the following objectives:


(1) To furnish information about accounts or other relationships with a consumer that is accurate, such that the furnished information:


(i) Identifies the appropriate consumer;


(ii) Reflects the terms of and liability for those accounts or other relationships; and


(iii) Reflects the consumer's performance and other conduct with respect to the account or other relationship;


(2) To furnish information about accounts or other relationships with a consumer that has integrity, such that the furnished information:


(i) Is substantiated by the furnisher's records at the time it is furnished;


(ii) Is furnished in a form and manner that is designed to minimize the likelihood that the information may be incorrectly reflected in a consumer report; thus, the furnished information should:


(A) Include appropriate identifying information about the consumer to whom it pertains; and


(B) Be furnished in a standardized and clearly understandable form and manner and with a date specifying the time period to which the information pertains; and


(iii) Includes the credit limit, if applicable and in the furnisher's possession;


(3) To conduct reasonable investigations of consumer disputes and take appropriate actions based on the outcome of such investigations; and


(4) To update the information it furnishes as necessary to reflect the current status of the consumer's account or other relationship, including, for example:


(i) Any transfer of an account (*e.g.,* by sale or assignment for collection) to a third party; and


(ii) Any cure of the consumer's failure to abide by the terms of the account or other relationship.


In establishing and implementing its policies and procedures, a furnisher should:


(a) Identify practices or activities of the furnisher that can compromise the accuracy or integrity of information furnished to consumer reporting agencies, such as by:


(1) Reviewing its existing practices and activities, including the technological means and other methods it uses to furnish information to consumer reporting agencies and the frequency and timing of its furnishing of information;


(2) Reviewing its historical records relating to accuracy or integrity or to disputes; reviewing other information relating to the accuracy or integrity of information provided by the furnisher to consumer reporting agencies; and considering the types of errors, omissions, or other problems that may have affected the accuracy or integrity of information it has furnished about consumers to consumer reporting agencies;


(3) Considering any feedback received from consumer reporting agencies, consumers, or other appropriate parties;


(4) Obtaining feedback from the furnisher's staff; and


(5) Considering the potential impact of the furnisher's policies and procedures on consumers.


(b) Evaluate the effectiveness of existing policies and procedures of the furnisher regarding the accuracy and integrity of information furnished to consumer reporting agencies; consider whether new, additional, or different policies and procedures are necessary; and consider whether implementation of existing policies and procedures should be modified to enhance the accuracy and integrity of information about consumers furnished to consumer reporting agencies.


(c) Evaluate the effectiveness of specific methods (including technological means) the furnisher uses to provide information to consumer reporting agencies; how those methods may affect the accuracy and integrity of the information it provides to consumer reporting agencies; and whether new, additional, or different methods (including technological means) should be used to provide information to consumer reporting agencies to enhance the accuracy and integrity of that information.


In developing its policies and procedures, a furnisher should address the following, as appropriate:


(a) Establishing and implementing a system for furnishing information about consumers to consumer reporting agencies that is appropriate to the nature, size, complexity, and scope of the furnisher's business operations.


(b) Using standard data reporting formats and standard procedures for compiling and furnishing data, where feasible, such as the electronic transmission of information about consumers to consumer reporting agencies.


(c) Maintaining records for a reasonable period of time, not less than any applicable recordkeeping requirement, in order to substantiate the accuracy of any information about consumers it furnishes that is subject to a direct dispute.


(d) Establishing and implementing appropriate internal controls regarding the accuracy and integrity of information about consumers furnished to consumer reporting agencies, such as by implementing standard procedures and verifying random samples of information provided to consumer reporting agencies.


(e) Training staff that participates in activities related to the furnishing of information about consumers to consumer reporting agencies to implement the policies and procedures.


(f) Providing for appropriate and effective oversight of relevant service providers whose activities may affect the accuracy or integrity of information about consumers furnished to consumer reporting agencies to ensure compliance with the policies and procedures.


(g) Furnishing information about consumers to consumer reporting agencies following mergers, portfolio acquisitions or sales, or other acquisitions or transfers of accounts or other obligations in a manner that prevents re-aging of information, duplicative reporting, or other problems that may similarly affect the accuracy or integrity of the information furnished.


(h) Deleting, updating, and correcting information in the furnisher's records, as appropriate, to avoid furnishing inaccurate information.


(i) Conducting reasonable investigations of disputes.


(j) Designing technological and other means of communication with consumer reporting agencies to prevent duplicative reporting of accounts, erroneous association of information with the wrong consumer(s), and other occurrences that may compromise the accuracy or integrity of information provided to consumer reporting agencies.


(k) Providing consumer reporting agencies with sufficient identifying information in the furnisher's possession about each consumer about whom information is furnished to enable the consumer reporting agency properly to identify the consumer.


(l) Conducting a periodic evaluation of its own practices, consumer reporting agency practices of which the furnisher is aware, investigations of disputed information, corrections of inaccurate information, means of communication, and other factors that may affect the accuracy or integrity of information furnished to consumer reporting agencies.


(m) Complying with applicable requirements under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and its implementing regulations.
