# § 222.70   Scope.

(a) *Coverage*—(1) *In general.* This subpart applies to any person that both—


(i) Uses a consumer report in connection with an application for, or a grant, extension, or other provision of, credit to a consumer that is primarily for personal, family, or household purposes; and


(ii) Based in whole or in part on the consumer report, grants, extends, or otherwise provides credit to the consumer on material terms that are materially less favorable than the most favorable material terms available to a substantial proportion of consumers from or through that person.


(2) *Business credit excluded.* This subpart does not apply to an application for, or a grant, extension, or other provision of, credit to a consumer or to any other applicant primarily for a business purpose.


(b) *Relation to Federal Trade Commission rules.* These rules are substantively identical to the Federal Trade Commission's (Commission's) risk-based pricing rules in 16 CFR 640. Both rules apply to the covered person described in paragraph (a) of this section. Compliance with either the Board's rules or the Commission's rules satisfies the requirements of the statute (15 U.S.C. 1681m(h)).


(c) *Enforcement.* The provisions of this subpart will be enforced in accordance with the enforcement authority set forth in sections 621(a) and (b) of the FCRA.
