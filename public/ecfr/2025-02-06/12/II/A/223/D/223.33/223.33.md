# ยง 223.33   What rules apply to derivative transactions?

(a) *Market terms requirement.* Derivative transactions between a member bank and its affiliates (other than depository institutions) are subject to the market terms requirement of ยง 223.51. 


(b) *Policies and procedures.* A member bank must establish and maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage the credit exposure arising from its derivative transactions with affiliates in a safe and sound manner. The policies and procedures must at a minimum provide for: 


(1) Monitoring and controlling the credit exposure arising at any one time from the member bank's derivative transactions with each affiliate and all affiliates in the aggregate (through, among other things, imposing appropriate credit limits, mark-to-market requirements, and collateral requirements); and 


(2) Ensuring that the member bank's derivative transactions with affiliates comply with the market terms requirement of ยง 223.51. 


(c) *Credit derivatives.* A credit derivative between a member bank and a nonaffiliate in which the member bank provides credit protection to the nonaffiliate with respect to an obligation of an affiliate of the member bank is a guarantee by a member bank on behalf of an affiliate for purposes of this regulation. Such derivatives would include: 


(1) An agreement under which the member bank, in exchange for a fee, agrees to compensate the nonaffiliate for any default of the underlying obligation of the affiliate; and 


(2) An agreement under which the member bank, in exchange for payments based on the total return of the underlying obligation of the affiliate, agrees to pay the nonaffiliate a spread over funding costs plus any depreciation in the value of the underlying obligation of the affiliate.
