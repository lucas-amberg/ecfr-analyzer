# § 223.41   What covered transactions are exempt from the quantitative limits and collateral requirements?

The following transactions are not subject to the quantitative limits of §§ 223.11 and 223.12 or the collateral requirements of § 223.14.

(b) *Transactions between a member bank and a depository institution owned by the same holding company.* Transactions with a depository institution if the same company controls 80 percent or more of the voting securities of the member bank and the depository institution. 


(c) *Certain loan purchases from an affiliated depository institution.* Purchasing a loan on a nonrecourse basis from an affiliated depository institution. 


(d) *Internal corporate reorganization transactions.* Purchasing assets from an affiliate (including in connection with a transfer of securities issued by an affiliate to a member bank described in paragraph (a) of § 223.31), if: 


(1) The asset purchase is part of an internal corporate reorganization of a holding company and involves the transfer of all or substantially all of the shares or assets of an affiliate or of a division or department of an affiliate; 


(2) The member bank provides its appropriate Federal banking agency and the Board with written notice of the transaction before consummation, including a description of the primary business activities of the affiliate and an indication of the proposed date of the asset purchase; 


(3) The member bank's top-tier holding company commits to its appropriate Federal banking agency and the Board before consummation either: 


(i) To make quarterly cash contributions to the member bank, for a two-year period following the member bank's purchase, equal to the book value plus any write-downs taken by the member bank, of any transferred assets that have become low-quality assets during the quarter; or 


(ii) To repurchase, on a quarterly basis for a two-year period following the member bank's purchase, at a price equal to the book value plus any write-downs taken by the member bank, any transferred assets that have become low-quality assets during the quarter; 


(4) The member bank's top-tier holding company complies with the commitment made under paragraph (d)(3) of this section; 


(5) A majority of the member bank's directors reviews and approves the transaction before consummation; 


(6) The value of the covered transaction (as computed under this part), when aggregated with the value of any other covered transactions (as computed under this part) engaged in by the member bank under this exemption during the preceding 12 calendar months, represents less than 10 percent of the member bank's capital stock and surplus (or such higher amount, up to 25 percent of the member bank's capital stock and surplus, as may be permitted by the member bank's appropriate Federal banking agency after conducting a review of the member bank's financial condition and the quality of the assets transferred to the member bank); and 


(7) The holding company and all its subsidiary member banks and other subsidiary depository institutions are well capitalized and well managed and would remain well capitalized upon consummation of the transaction.
