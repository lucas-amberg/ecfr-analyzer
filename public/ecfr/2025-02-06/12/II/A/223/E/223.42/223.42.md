# § 223.42   What covered transactions are exempt from the quantitative limits, collateral requirements, and low-quality asset prohibition?

The following transactions are not subject to the quantitative limits of §§ 223.11 and 223.12, the collateral requirements of § 223.14, or the prohibition on the purchase of a low-quality asset of § 223.15. The transactions are, however, subject to the safety and soundness requirement of § 223.13. 


(a) *Making correspondent banking deposits.* Making a deposit in an affiliated depository institution (as defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813)) or affiliated foreign bank that represents an ongoing, working balance maintained in the ordinary course of correspondent business. 


(b) *Giving credit for uncollected items.* Giving immediate credit to an affiliate for uncollected items received in the ordinary course of business.

(i) Obligations of the United States or its agencies;

(iii) A segregated, earmarked deposit account with the member bank that is for the sole purpose of securing credit transactions between the member bank and its affiliates and is identified as such. 


(2) *Example.* A member bank makes a $100 non-amortizing term loan to an affiliate secured by U.S. Treasury securities with a market value of $50 and real estate with a market value of $75. The value of the covered transaction is $50. If the market value of the U.S. Treasury securities falls to $45 during the life of the loan, the value of the covered transaction would increase to $55.

(e) *Purchasing certain liquid assets.* Purchasing an asset having a readily identifiable and publicly available market quotation and purchased at or below the asset's current market quotation. An asset has a readily identifiable and publicly available market quotation if the asset's price is quoted routinely in a widely disseminated publication that is readily available to the general public.

(3) The security is not a low-quality asset; 


(4) The member bank does not purchase the security during an underwriting, or within 30 days of an underwriting, if an affiliate is an underwriter of the security, unless the security is purchased as part of an issue of obligations of, or obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States or its agencies; 


(5) The security's price is quoted routinely on an unaffiliated electronic service that provides indicative data from real-time financial networks, provided that: 


(i) The price paid by the member bank is at or below the current market quotation for the security; and 


(ii) The size of the transaction executed by the member bank does not cast material doubt on the appropriateness of relying on the current market quotation for the security; and 


(6) The member bank maintains, for a period of two years, records and supporting information that are sufficient to enable the appropriate Federal banking agency to ensure the member bank's compliance with the terms of this exemption. 


(g) *Purchasing municipal securities.* Purchasing a municipal security from a securities affiliate if: 


(1) The security is rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or is part of an issue of securities that does not exceed $25 million;

(B) The price paid is no higher than the average of the price quotes; or 


(iii) The price paid for the security can be verified by reference to the written summary provided by the syndicate manager to syndicate members that discloses the aggregate par values and prices of all bonds sold from the syndicate account, if the member bank: 


(A) Purchases the municipal security during the underwriting period at a price that is at or below that indicated in the summary; and 


(B) Obtains a copy of the summary from its securities affiliate and retains the summary for three years. 


(h) *Purchasing an extension of credit subject to a repurchase agreement.* Purchasing from an affiliate an extension of credit that was originated by the member bank and sold to the affiliate subject to a repurchase agreement or with recourse.

(l) *Intraday extensions of credit*—(1) *In general.* An intraday extension of credit to an affiliate, if the member bank:
