• Your interest rate will be based on [an index plus a margin] [a formula].


• Your payment will be based on the interest rate, loan balance, and loan term.


• Your interest rate can change (frequency).


• [Your interest rate cannot increase or decrease more than ______ percentage points at each adjustment.]


• Your interest rate cannot increase [or decrease] more than ______ percentage points over the term of the loan.

• [For example, on a $10,000 [term] loan with an initial interest rate of ________ [(the rate shown in the interest rate column below for the year 19 ________)] [(in effect (month) (year)], the maximum amount that the interest rate can rise under this program is ________ percentage points, to ________%, and the monthly payment can rise from a first-year payment of $________ to a maximum of $________ in the __________ year. To see what your payments would be, divide your mortgage amount by $10,000; then multiply the monthly payment by that amount.

The example below shows how your payments would have changed under this ARM program based on actual changes in the index from 1982 to 1996. This does not necessarily indicate how your index will change in the future.


The example is based on the following assumptions:

We must also return any money you have given to us or anyone else in connection with this new transaction.

You may use any written statement that is signed and dated by you and states your intention to cancel, or you may use this notice by dating and signing below. Keep one copy of this notice because it contains important information about your rights.

• Your interest rate will be based on an index rate plus a margin.


• Your payment will be based on the interest rate, loan balance, and loan term.


• Your interest rate will equal the index rate plus our margin unless your interest rate “caps” limit the amount of change in the interest rate.


• Your interest rate can change yearly.


• Your interest rate cannot increase or decrease more than 2 percentage points per year.


• Your interest rate cannot increase or decrease more than 5 percentage points over the term of the loan.


• Your monthly payment can increase or decrease substantially based on annual changes in the interest rate.


• [For example, on a $10,000, 30-year loan with an initial interest rate of 12.41 percent in effect in July 1996, the maximum amount that the interest rate can rise under this program is 5 percentage points, to 17.41 percent, and the monthly payment can rise from a first-year payment of $106.03 to a maximum of $145.34 in the fourth year. To see what your payment is, divide your mortgage amount by $10,000; then multiply the monthly payment by that amount. (For example, the monthly payment for a mortgage amount of $60,000 would be: $60,000 ÷ $10,000 = 6; 6 × 106.03 = $636.18 per month.)


• You will be notified in writing 25 days before the annual payment adjustment may be made. This notice will contain information about your interest rates, payment amount and loan balance.]

Please enroll me in the optional [insert name of program], and bill my account the fee of [insert charge for the initial term of coverage]. I understand that enrollment is not required to obtain credit.
