(3) *Advance notice exception.* A card issuer may increase an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under § 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) after complying with the applicable notice requirements in § 226.9(b), (c), or (g), provided that:


(i) If a card issuer discloses an increased annual percentage rate, fee, or charge pursuant to § 226.9(b), the card issuer must not apply that rate, fee, or charge to transactions that occurred prior to provision of the notice;

(i) The card issuer must disclose in a clear and conspicuous manner in the notice of the increase pursuant to § 226.9(c) or (g):


(A) A statement of the reason for the increase; and


(B) That the increased annual percentage rate, fee, or charge will cease to apply if the card issuer receives six consecutive required minimum periodic payments on or before the payment due date beginning with the first payment due following the effective date of the increase; and


(ii) If the card issuer receives six consecutive required minimum periodic payments on or before the payment due date beginning with the first payment due following the effective date of the increase, the card issuer must reduce any annual percentage rate, fee, or charge increased pursuant to this exception to the annual percentage rate, fee, or charge that applied prior to the increase with respect to transactions that occurred prior to or within 14 days after provision of the § 226.9(c) or (g) notice.


(5) *Workout and temporary hardship arrangement exception.* A card issuer may increase an annual percentage rate or a fee or charge required to be disclosed under § 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) due to the consumer's completion of a workout or temporary hardship arrangement or the consumer's failure to comply with the terms of such an arrangement, provided that:


(i) Prior to commencement of the arrangement (except as provided in § 226.9(c)(2)(v)(D)), the card issuer has provided the consumer with a clear and conspicuous written disclosure of the terms of the arrangement (including any increases due to the completion or failure of the arrangement); and


(ii) Upon the completion or failure of the arrangement, the card issuer must not apply to any transactions that occurred prior to commencement of the arrangement an annual percentage rate, fee, or charge that exceeds the annual percentage rate, fee, or charge that applied to those transactions prior to commencement of the arrangement.

(c) *Treatment of protected balances*—(1) *Definition of protected balance.* For purposes of this paragraph, “protected balance” means the amount owed for a category of transactions to which an increased annual percentage rate or an increased fee or charge required to be disclosed under § 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(xii) cannot be applied after the annual percentage rate, fee, or charge for that category of transactions has been increased pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section.


(2) *Repayment of protected balance.* The card issuer must not require repayment of the protected balance using a method that is less beneficial to the consumer than one of the following methods:


(i) The method of repayment for the account before the effective date of the increase;


(ii) An amortization period of not less than five years, beginning no earlier than the effective date of the increase; or


(iii) A required minimum periodic payment that includes a percentage of the balance that is equal to no more than twice the percentage required before the effective date of the increase.


(d) *Continuing application.* This section continues to apply to a balance on a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan after:


(1) The account is closed or acquired by another creditor; or


(2) The balance is transferred from a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan issued by a creditor to another credit account issued by the same creditor or its affiliate or subsidiary (unless the account to which the balance is transferred is subject to § 226.5b).


(e) *Promotional waivers or rebates of interest, fees, and other charges.* If a card issuer promotes the waiver or rebate of finance charges due to a periodic interest rate or fees or charges required to be disclosed under § 226.6(b)(2)(ii), (iii), or (xii) and applies the waiver or rebate to a credit card account under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan, any cessation of the waiver or rebate on that account constitutes an increase in an annual percentage rate, fee, or charge for purposes of this section.
