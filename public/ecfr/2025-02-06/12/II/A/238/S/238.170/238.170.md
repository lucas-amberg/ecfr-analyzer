# § 238.170   Capital planning and stress capital buffer requirement.

(a) *Purpose.* This section establishes capital planning and prior notice and approval requirements for capital distributions by certain savings and loan holding companies. This section also establishes the Board's process for determining the stress capital buffer requirement applicable to these savings and loan holding companies.


(b) *Scope and reservation of authority*—(1) *Applicability.* Except as provided in § 238.170(c), this section applies to:


(i) Any top-tier covered savings and loan holding company domiciled in the United States with average total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more ($100 billion asset threshold); and


(ii) Any other covered savings and loan holding company domiciled in the United States that is made subject to this section, in whole or in part, by order of the Board.


(2) *Average total consolidated assets.* For purposes of this section, average total consolidated assets means the average of the total consolidated assets as reported by a covered savings and loan holding company on its Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Companies (FR Y-9C) for the four most recent consecutive quarters. If the covered savings and loan holding company has not filed the FR Y-9C for each of the four most recent consecutive quarters, average total consolidated assets means the average of the company's total consolidated assets, as reported on the company's FR Y-9C, for the most recent quarter or consecutive quarters, as applicable. Average total consolidated assets are measured on the as-of date of the most recent FR Y-9C used in the calculation of the average.


(3) *Ongoing applicability.* A covered savings and loan holding company (including any successor covered savings and loan holding company) that is subject to any requirement in this section shall remain subject to such requirements unless and until its total consolidated assets fall below $100 billion for each of four consecutive quarters, as reported on the FR Y-9C and effective on the as-of date of the fourth consecutive FR Y-9C.


(4) *Reservation of authority.* Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Federal Reserve to issue or enforce a capital directive or take any other supervisory or enforcement action, including an action to address unsafe or unsound practices or conditions or violations of law.


(5) *Application of this section by order.* The Board may apply this section, in whole or in part, to a covered savings and loan holding company by order based on the institution's size, level of complexity, risk profile, scope of operations, or financial condition.


(c) *Transition periods for certain covered savings and loan holding companies.* (1) A covered savings and loan holding company that meets the $100 billion asset threshold (as measured under paragraph (b) of this section) on or before September 30 of a calendar year must comply with the requirements of this section beginning on January 1 of the next calendar year, unless that time is extended by the Board in writing. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Board will not provide a covered savings and loan holding company with notice of its stress capital buffer requirement until the first year in which the Board conducts an analysis of the covered savings and loan company pursuant to 12 CFR 238.132.


(2) A covered savings and loan holding company that meets the $100 billion asset threshold after September 30 of a calendar year must comply with the requirements of this section beginning on January 1 of the second calendar year after the covered savings and loan holding company meets the $100 billion asset threshold, unless that time is extended by the Board in writing. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Board will not provide a covered savings and loan holding company with notice of its stress capital buffer requirement until the first year in which the Board conducts an analysis of the covered savings and loan holding company pursuant to 12 CFR 238.132.


(3) The Board, or the appropriate Reserve Bank with the concurrence of the Board, may require a covered savings and loan holding company described in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section to comply with any or all of the requirements of this section if the Board, or appropriate Reserve Bank with concurrence of the Board, determines that the requirement is appropriate on a different date based on the company's risk profile, scope of operation, or financial condition and provides prior notice to the company of the determination.


(d) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:


(1) *Advanced approaches* means the risk-weighted assets calculation methodologies at 12 CFR part 217, subpart E, as applicable.


(2) *Average total nonbank assets* means the average of the total nonbank assets, calculated in accordance with the instructions to the FR Y-9LP, for the four most recent calendar quarters or, if the covered savings and loan holding company has not filed the FR Y-9LP for each of the four most recent calendar quarters, for the most recent quarter or quarters, as applicable.

(4) *Capital distribution* means a redemption or repurchase of any debt or equity capital instrument, a payment of common or preferred stock dividends, a payment that may be temporarily or permanently suspended by the issuer on any instrument that is eligible for inclusion in the numerator of any minimum regulatory capital ratio, and any similar transaction that the Federal Reserve determines to be in substance a distribution of capital.


(5) *Capital plan* means a written presentation of a covered savings and loan holding company's capital planning strategies and capital adequacy process that includes the mandatory elements set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.


(6) *Capital plan cycle* means the period beginning on January 1 of a calendar year and ending on December 31 of that year.

(B) Ensure that any deficiencies in the covered savings and loan holding company's process for assessing capital adequacy are appropriately remedied; and


(C) Approve the covered savings and loan holding company's capital plan.


(2) *Mandatory elements of capital plan.* A capital plan must contain at least the following elements:


(i) An assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital over the planning horizon that reflects the covered savings and loan holding company's size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations, assuming both expected and stressful conditions, including:


(A) Estimates of projected revenues, losses, reserves, and pro forma capital levels, including regulatory capital ratios, and any additional capital measures deemed relevant by the covered savings and loan holding company, over the planning horizon under a range of scenarios, including:


(*1*) If the covered savings and loan holding company is a Category IV savings and loan holding company, the Internal baseline scenario and at least one Internal stress scenario, as well as any additional scenarios, based on financial conditions or the macroeconomic outlook, or based on the covered savings and loan holding company's financial condition, size, complexity, risk profile, or activities, or risks to the U.S. economy, that the Federal Reserve may provide the covered savings and loan holding company after giving notice to the covered savings and loan holding company; or

(C) A description of all planned capital actions over the planning horizon. Planned capital actions must be consistent with effective capital distribution limitations, except as may be adjusted pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section. In determining whether a covered savings and loan holding company's planned capital distributions are consistent with effective capital distribution limitations, a covered savings and loan holding company must assume that any countercyclical capital buffer amount currently applicable to the covered savings and loan holding company remains at the same level, except that the covered savings and loan holding company must reflect any increases or decreases in the countercyclical capital buffer amount that have been announced by the Board at the times indicated by the Board's announcement for when such increases or decreases will take effect.


(ii) A detailed description of the covered savings and loan holding company's process for assessing capital adequacy, including:


(A) A discussion of how the covered savings and loan holding company will, under expected and stressful conditions, maintain capital commensurate with its risks, maintain capital above the regulatory capital ratios, and serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary depository institutions;


(B) A discussion of how the covered savings and loan holding company will, under expected and stressful conditions, maintain sufficient capital to continue its operations by maintaining ready access to funding, meeting its obligations to creditors and other counterparties, and continuing to serve as a credit intermediary;


(iii) The covered savings and loan holding company's capital policy; and


(iv) A discussion of any expected changes to the covered savings and loan holding company's business plan that are likely to have a material impact on the covered savings and loan holding company's capital adequacy or liquidity.


(3) *Data collection.* Upon the request of the Board or appropriate Reserve Bank, the covered savings and loan holding company shall provide the Federal Reserve with information regarding:


(i) The covered savings and loan holding company's financial condition, including its capital;


(ii) The covered savings and loan holding company's structure;


(iii) Amount and risk characteristics of the covered savings and loan holding company's on- and off-balance sheet exposures, including exposures within the covered savings and loan holding company's trading account, other trading-related exposures (such as counterparty-credit risk exposures) or other items sensitive to changes in market factors, including, as appropriate, information about the sensitivity of positions to changes in market rates and prices;


(iv) The covered savings and loan holding company's relevant policies and procedures, including risk management policies and procedures;


(v) The covered savings and loan holding company's liquidity profile and management;


(vi) The loss, revenue, and expense estimation models used by the covered savings and loan holding company for stress scenario analysis, including supporting documentation regarding each model's development and validation; and


(vii) Any other relevant qualitative or quantitative information requested by the Board or by the appropriate Reserve Bank to facilitate review of the covered savings and loan holding company's capital plan under this section.


(4) *Resubmission of a capital plan.* (i) A covered savings and loan holding company must update and resubmit its capital plan to the appropriate Reserve Bank within 30 calendar days of the occurrence of one of the following events:


(A) The covered savings and loan holding company determines there has been or will be a material change in the covered savings and loan holding company's risk profile, financial condition, or corporate structure since the covered savings and loan holding company last submitted the capital plan to the Board and the appropriate Reserve Bank under this section; or


(B) The Board, or the appropriate Reserve Bank with concurrence of the Board, directs the covered savings and loan holding company in writing to revise and resubmit its capital plan for any of the following reasons:


(*1*) The capital plan is incomplete or the capital plan, or the covered savings and loan holding company's internal capital adequacy process, contains material weaknesses;


(*2*) There has been, or will likely be, a material change in the covered savings and loan holding company's risk profile (including a material change in its business strategy or any risk exposure), financial condition, or corporate structure;


(*3*) The Internal stress scenario(s) are not appropriate for the covered savings and loan holding company's business model and portfolios, or changes in financial markets or the macro-economic outlook that could have a material impact on a covered savings and loan holding company's risk profile and financial condition require the use of updated scenarios; or


(ii) The Board, or the appropriate Reserve Bank with concurrence of the Board, may extend the 30-day period in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section for up to an additional 60 calendar days, or such longer period as the Board or the appropriate Reserve Bank, with concurrence of the Board, determines appropriate.


(iii) Any updated capital plan must satisfy all the requirements of this section; however, a covered savings and loan holding company may continue to rely on information submitted as part of a previously submitted capital plan to the extent that the information remains accurate and appropriate.


(5) *Confidential treatment of information submitted.* The confidentiality of information submitted to the Board under this section and related materials shall be determined in accordance with applicable exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)) and the Board's Rules Regarding Availability of Information (12 CFR part 261).


(f) *Calculation of the stress capital buffer requirement*—(1) *General.* The Board will determine the stress capital buffer requirement that applies under 12 CFR 217.11 pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section. For each covered savings and loan holding company that is not a Category IV savings and loan holding company, the Board will calculate the covered savings and loan holding company's stress capital buffer requirement annually. For each Category IV savings and loan holding company, the Board will calculate the covered savings and loan holding company's stress capital buffer requirement biennially, occurring in each calendar year ending in an even number, and will adjust the covered savings and loan holding company's stress capital buffer requirement biennially, occurring in each calendar year ending in an odd number. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Board will calculate the stress capital buffer requirement of a Category IV savings and loan holding company in a year ending in an odd number with respect to which that company makes an election pursuant to 12 CFR 238.132(c)(2)(ii).


(2) *Stress capital buffer requirement calculation.* A covered savings and loan holding company's stress capital buffer requirement is equal to the greater of:


(i) The following calculation:


(A) The ratio of a covered savings and loan holding company's common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, as calculated under 12 CFR part 217, subpart D, as of the final quarter of the previous capital plan cycle, unless otherwise determined by the Board; minus


(B) The lowest projected ratio of the covered savings and loan holding company's common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, as calculated under 12 CFR part 217, subpart D, in any quarter of the planning horizon under a supervisory stress test; plus


(C) The ratio of:


(*1*) The sum of the covered savings and loan holding company's planned common stock dividends (expressed as a dollar amount) for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon; to


(*2*) The risk-weighted assets of the covered savings and loan holding company in the quarter in which the covered savings and loan holding company had its lowest projected ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, as calculated under 12 CFR part 217, subpart D, in any quarter of the planning horizon under a supervisory stress test; and


(ii) 2.5 percent.


(3) *Recalculation of stress capital buffer requirement.* If a covered savings and loan holding company resubmits its capital plan pursuant to paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the Board may recalculate the covered savings and loan holding company's stress capital buffer requirement. The Board will provide notice of whether the covered savings and loan holding company's stress capital buffer requirement will be recalculated within 75 calendar days after the date on which the capital plan is resubmitted, unless the Board provides notice to the company that it is extending the time period.


(4) *Adjustment of stress capital buffer requirement.* In each calendar year in which the Board does not calculate a Category IV savings and loan holding company's stress capital buffer requirement pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the Board will adjust the Category IV savings and loan holding company's stress capital buffer requirement to be equal to the result of the calculation set forth in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, using the same values that were used to calculate the stress capital buffer requirement most recently provided to the covered savings and loan holding company, except that the value used in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(C)(*1*) of the calculation will be equal to the covered savings and loan holding company's planned common stock dividends (expressed as a dollar amount) for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon as set forth in the capital plan submitted by the covered savings and loan holding company in the calendar year in which the Board adjusts the covered savings and loan holding company's stress capital buffer requirement.


(g) *Review of capital plans by the Federal Reserve.* The Board, or the appropriate Reserve Bank with concurrence of the Board, will consider the following factors in reviewing a covered savings and loan holding company's capital plan:


(1) The comprehensiveness of the capital plan, including the extent to which the analysis underlying the capital plan captures and addresses potential risks stemming from activities across the covered savings and loan holding company and the covered savings and loan holding company's capital policy;


(2) The reasonableness of the covered savings and loan holding company's capital plan, the assumptions and analysis underlying the capital plan, and the robustness of its capital adequacy process;


(3) Relevant supervisory information about the covered savings and loan holding company and its subsidiaries;


(4) The covered savings and loan holding company's regulatory and financial reports, as well as supporting data that would allow for an analysis of the covered savings and loan holding company's loss, revenue, and reserve projections;


(5) The results of any stress tests conducted by the covered savings and loan holding company or the Federal Reserve; and


(6) Other information requested or required by the Board or the appropriate Reserve Bank, as well as any other information relevant, or related, to the savings and loan holding company's capital adequacy.


(h) *Federal Reserve notice of stress capital buffer requirement; final planned capital distributions*—(1) *Notice.* The Board will provide a covered savings and loan holding company with notice of its stress capital buffer requirement and an explanation of the results of the supervisory stress test. Unless otherwise determined by the Board, notice will be provided by June 30 of the calendar year in which the capital plan was submitted pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section or within 90 calendar days of receiving notice that the Board will recalculate the covered savings and loan holding company's stress capital buffer requirement pursuant to paragraph (f)(3) of this section.


(2) *Response to notice*—(i) *Request for reconsideration of stress capital buffer requirement.* A covered savings and loan holding company may request reconsideration of a stress capital buffer requirement provided under paragraph (h)(1) of this section. To request reconsideration of a stress capital buffer requirement, a covered savings and loan holding company must submit to the Board a request pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section.


(ii) *Adjustments to planned capital distributions.* Within two business days of receipt of notice of a stress capital buffer requirement under paragraph (h)(1) or (i)(5) of this section, as applicable, a covered savings and loan holding company must:


(A) Determine whether the planned capital distributions for the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon under the Internal baseline scenario would be consistent with effective capital distribution limitations assuming the stress capital buffer requirement provided by the Board under paragraph (h)(1) or (i)(5) of this section, as applicable, in place of any stress capital buffer requirement in effect; and


(*1*) If the planned capital distributions for the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon under the Internal baseline scenario would not be consistent with effective capital distribution limitations assuming the stress capital buffer requirement provided by the Board under paragraph (h)(1) or (i)(5) of this section, as applicable, in place of any stress capital buffer requirement in effect, the covered savings and loan holding company must adjust its planned capital distributions such that its planned capital distributions would be consistent with effective capital distribution limitations assuming the stress capital buffer requirement provided by the Board under paragraph (h)(1) or (i)(5) of this section, as applicable, in place of any stress capital buffer requirement in effect; or


(*2*) If the planned capital distributions for the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon under the Internal baseline scenario would be consistent with effective capital distribution limitations assuming the stress capital buffer requirement provided by the Board under paragraph (h)(1) or (i)(5) of this section, as applicable, in place of any stress capital buffer requirement in effect, the covered savings and loan holding company may adjust its planned capital distributions. A covered savings and loan holding company may not adjust its planned capital distributions to be inconsistent with the effective capital distribution limitations assuming the stress capital buffer requirement provided by the Board under paragraph (h)(1) or (i)(5) of this section, as applicable; and


(B) Notify the Board of any adjustments made to planned capital distributions for the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon under the Internal baseline scenario.


(3) *Final planned capital distributions.* The Board will consider the planned capital distributions, including any adjustments made pursuant to paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section, to be the covered savings and loan holding company's final planned capital distributions on the later of:


(i) The expiration of the time for requesting reconsideration under paragraph (i) of this section; and


(ii) The expiration of the time for adjusting planned capital distributions pursuant to paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section.


(4) *Effective date of final stress capital buffer requirement.* (i) The Board will provide a savings and loan holding company with its final stress capital buffer requirement and confirmation of the covered savings and loan holding company's final planned capital distributions by August 31 of the calendar year that a capital plan was submitted pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, unless otherwise determined by the Board. A stress capital buffer requirement will not be considered final so as to be agency action subject to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 704 during the pendency of a request for reconsideration made pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section or before the time for requesting reconsideration has expired.


(ii) Unless otherwise determined by the Board, a covered savings and loan holding company's final planned capital distributions and final stress capital buffer requirement shall:


(A) Be effective on October 1 of the calendar year in which a capital plan was submitted pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section; and


(B) Remain in effect until superseded.


(5) *Publication.* With respect to any covered savings and loan holding company subject to this section, the Board may disclose publicly any or all of the following:
