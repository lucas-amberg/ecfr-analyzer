# Appendix A to Part 239—Mutual Holding Company Model Charter


*Section 1: Corporate title.* The name of the mutual holding company is __(the “Mutual Holding Company”).


*Section 2: Duration.* The duration of the Mutual Holding Company is perpetual.


*Section 3: Purpose and powers.* The purpose of the Mutual Holding Company is to pursue any or all of the lawful objectives of a federal mutual savings and loan holding company chartered under section 10(o) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. 1467a(o), and to exercise all of the express, implied, and incidental powers conferred thereby and all acts amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto, subject to the Constitution and the laws of the United States as they are now in effect, or as they may hereafter be amended, and subject to all lawful and applicable rules, regulations, and orders of the Federal Reserve Board (“Board”).


*Section 4: Capital.* The Mutual Holding Company shall have no capital stock.


*Section 5: Members.* [The content of this section 5 shall be identical to the content of the parallel section in the charter of the reorganizing association, with the following exceptions: (A) Any provisions conferring membership rights upon borrowers of the reorganizing association shall be eliminated and replaced with provisions grandfathering those rights in accordance with 12 CFR 239.5; and (B) appropriate changes shall be made to indicate that membership rights in the mutual holding company derive from deposit accounts in and, to the extent of any grandfather provisions, borrowings from the resulting association. Set forth below is an example of how section 5 should appear in the charter of a mutual holding company formed by a reorganizing association whose charter conforms to the model charter prescribed for federal mutual savings associations for calendar year 1989. Additional changes to this section 5 may be required whenever a mutual holding company reorganization involves an acquiree association, or a mutual holding company makes a post-reorganization acquisition of a mutual savings association, so as to preserve the membership rights of the members of the acquired association consistent with 12 CFR 239.5.]


All holders of the savings, demand, or other authorized accounts of __[insert the name of the resulting association] (the “Association”) are members of the Mutual Holding Company. With respect to all questions requiring action by the members of the Mutual Holding Company, each holder of an account in the Association shall be permitted to cast one vote for each $100, or fraction thereof, of the withdrawal value of the member's account. In addition, borrowers from the Association as of __[insert the date of the reorganization or any earlier date as of which new borrowings ceased to result in membership rights] shall be entitled to one vote for the period of time during which such borrowings are in existence. [The foregoing sentence should be included only if the charter of the reorganizing association confers voting rights on any borrowers.] No member, however, shall cast more than one thousand votes. All accounts shall be nonassessable.


*Section 6. Directors.* The Mutual Holding Company shall be under the direction of a board of directors. The authorized number of directors shall not be fewer than five nor more than fifteen, as fixed in the Mutual Holding Company's bylaws, except that the number of directors may be decreased to a number less than five or increased to a number greater than fifteen with the prior approval of the Board.


*Section 7: Capital, surplus, and distribution of earnings.* [The content of this section 7 shall be identical to the content of the parallel section in the charter of the reorganizing association, except for changes made to indicate that distribution rights in the mutual holding company derive from deposit accounts in the resulting association, any changes required to provide that the Board shall be the approving authority in instances where the charter requires regulatory approval of distributions, and any other changes necessary to accommodate the mutual holding company format. Set forth below is an example of how section 7 should appear in the charter of a mutual holding company formed by a reorganizing association whose charter conforms to the model charter prescribed for federal mutual savings associations for calendar year 1989. Additional changes to this section 7 may be required whenever a mutual holding company reorganization involves an acquiree association, or a mutual holding company makes a post-reorganization acquisition of a mutual savings association, so as to preserve the membership rights of the members of the acquired association consistent with 12 CFR 239.5].


The Mutual Holding Company shall distribute net earnings to account holders of the Association on such basis and in accordance with such terms and conditions as may from time to time be authorized by the Board, provided that the Mutual Holding Company may establish minimum account balance requirements for account holders to be eligible for distributions of earnings.


All holders of accounts of the Association shall be entitled to equal distribution of the assets of the Mutual Holding Company, *pro rata* to the value of their accounts in the Association, in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Mutual Holding Company.


*Section 8. Amendment.* Adoption of any preapproved charter amendment shall be effective after such preapproved amendment has been approved by the members at a legal meeting. Any other amendment, addition, change, or repeal of this charter must be approved by the Board prior to approval by the members at a legal meeting and shall be effective upon filing with the Board in accordance with regulatory procedures.
