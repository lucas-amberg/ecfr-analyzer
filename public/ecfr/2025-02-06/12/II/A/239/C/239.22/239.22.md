# § 239.22   Charter amendments.

(a) *General.* In order to adopt a charter amendment, a subsidiary holding company must comply with the following requirements:


(1) *Board of directors approval.* The board of directors of the subsidiary holding company must adopt a resolution proposing the charter amendment that states the text of such amendment.


(2) *Form of filing*—(i) *Application requirement.* If the proposed charter amendment would render more difficult or discourage a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest, the assumption of control by a holder of a block of the subsidiary holding company's stock, the removal of incumbent management, or involve a significant issue of law or policy, the subsidiary holding company shall file the proposed amendment with and shall obtain the prior approval of the Board pursuant to § 238.14 of this chapter; and


(ii) *Notice requirement.* If the proposed charter amendment does not implicate paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section and such amendment is permissible under all applicable laws, rules or regulations, the subsidiary holding company shall submit the proposed amendments to the appropriate Reserve Bank, at least 30 days prior to the date the proposed charter amendment is to be mailed for consideration by the subsidiary holding company's shareholders.


(b) *Approval.* Any charter amendment filed pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section shall automatically be approved 30 days from the date of filing of such amendment, provided that the subsidiary holding company follows the requirements of its charter in adopting such amendment, unless the Board notifies the mutual holding company prior to the expiration of such 30-day period that such amendment is rejected or is deemed to be filed under the provisions of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. In addition, the following charter amendments, including the adoption of the charter as set forth in appendix B of this part, shall be approved at the time of adoption, if adopted without change and filed with the Board within 30 days after adoption, provided the subsidiary holding company follows the requirements of its charter in adopting such amendments.


(1) *Title change.* Prior to changing its corporate title, a subsidiary holding company must file with the appropriate Reserve Bank a written notice indicating the intended change. The Reserve Bank shall provide to the subsidiary holding company a timely written acknowledgment stating when the notice was received. If, within 30 days of receipt of notice, the Reserve Bank or the Board does not notify the subsidiary holding company of its objection on the grounds that the title misrepresents the nature of the institution or the services it offers, the subsidiary holding company may change its title by amending section 1 of its charter in accordance with this section and the amendment provisions of its charter.


(2) *Home office.* A subsidiary holding company may amend its charter by substituting a new domicile in section 2 of its charter.


(3) *Number of shares of stock and par value.* A subsidiary holding company may amend Section 5 of its charter to change the number of authorized shares of stock, the number of shares within each class of stock, and the par or stated value of such shares.


(4) *Capital stock.* A subsidiary holding company may amend its charter by revising Section 5 to read as follows:


(5) *Limitations on subsequent issuances.* A subsidiary holding company may amend its charter to require shareholder approval of the issuance or reservation of common stock or securities convertible into common stock under circumstances which would require shareholder approval under the rules of the New York or American Stock Exchange if the shares were then listed on the New York or American Stock Exchange.


(6) *Cumulative voting.* A subsidiary holding company may amend its charter by substituting the following sentence for the second sentence in the third paragraph of Section 5: “Each holder of shares of common stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share held by such holder and there shall be no right to cumulate votes in an election of directors.”


(7) [Reserved]


(8) *Anti-takeover provisions following mutual to stock conversion.* Notwithstanding the law of the state in which the subsidiary holding company is located, a subsidiary holding company may amend its charter by renumbering existing sections as appropriate and adding a new section 8 as follows:


(c) *Anti-takeover provisions.* The Board may grant approval to a charter amendment not listed in paragraph (b) of this section regarding the acquisition by any person or persons of its equity securities provided that the subsidiary holding company shall file as part of its application for approval an opinion, acceptable to the Board, of counsel independent from the subsidiary holding company that the proposed charter provision would be permitted to be adopted by a corporation chartered by the state in which the principal office of the subsidiary holding company is located. Any such provision must be consistent with applicable statutes, regulations, and Board policies. Further, any such provision that would have the effect of rendering more difficult a change in control of the subsidiary holding company and would require for any corporate action (other than the removal of directors) the affirmative vote of a larger percentage of shareholders than is required by this part, shall not be effective unless adopted by a percentage of shareholder vote at least equal to the highest percentage that would be required to take any action under such provision.


(d) *Reissuance of charter.* A subsidiary holding company that has amended its charter may apply to have its charter, including the amendments, reissued by the Board. Such requests for reissuance should be filed with the appropriate Reserve Bank, and contain signatures required by the charter in appendix B to this part, together with such supporting documents as needed to demonstrate that the amendments were properly adopted.
