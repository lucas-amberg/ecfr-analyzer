(1) The adjusted level 2 cap excess amount; *plus*

(2) The adjusted level 2B cap excess amount.


(h) *Calculation of the adjusted level 2 cap excess amount.* As of the calculation date, the adjusted level 2 cap excess amount equals the greater of:


(1) The adjusted level 2A liquid asset amount plus the adjusted level 2B liquid asset amount minus 0.6667 times the adjusted level 1 liquid asset amount; and


(2) 0.


(i) *Calculation of the adjusted level 2B excess amount.* As of the calculation date, the adjusted level 2B excess liquid asset amount equals the greater of:
