(2) Any amount in excess of the RSF amount of the consolidated subsidiary, as calculated by the Board-regulated institution for the Board-regulated institution's net stable funding ratio under this part, to the extent the consolidated subsidiary may transfer assets to the top-tier Board-regulated institution, taking into account statutory, regulatory, contractual, or supervisory restrictions, such as sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371c and 12 U.S.C. 371c-1) and Regulation W (12 CFR part 223).

These procedures must document which types of transactions the Board-regulated institution could use to transfer assets from a consolidated subsidiary to the Board-regulated institution and how these types of transactions comply with applicable statutory, regulatory, contractual, supervisory, or other restrictions.
