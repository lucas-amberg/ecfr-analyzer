# § 252.44   Analysis conducted by the Board.

(a) *In general.* (1) The Board will conduct an analysis of each covered company's capital, on a total consolidated basis, taking into account all relevant exposures and activities of that covered company, to evaluate the ability of the covered company to absorb losses in specified economic and financial conditions.


(2) The analysis will include an assessment of the projected losses, net income, and pro forma capital levels and regulatory capital ratios and other capital ratios for the covered company and use such analytical techniques that the Board determines are appropriate to identify, measure, and monitor risks of the covered company that may affect the financial stability of the United States.




(3) In conducting the analysis, the Board will not incorporate changes to a firm's business plan that are likely to have a material impact on the covered company's capital adequacy and funding profile in its projections of losses, net income, pro forma capital levels, and capital ratios.








(b) *Economic and financial scenarios related to the Board's analysis.* The Board will conduct its analysis using a minimum of two different scenarios, including a baseline scenario and a severely adverse scenario. The Board will notify covered companies of the scenarios that the Board will apply to conduct the analysis for each stress test cycle to which the covered company is subject by no later than February 15 of that year, except with respect to trading or any other components of the scenarios and any additional scenarios that the Board will apply to conduct the analysis, which will be communicated by no later than March 1 of that year.


(c) In conducting a stress test under this section, the Board will make the following assumptions regarding a covered company's capital actions over the planning horizon:


(1) The covered company will not pay any dividends on any instruments that qualify as common equity tier 1 capital;


(2) The covered company will make payments on instruments that qualify as additional tier 1 capital or tier 2 capital equal to the stated dividend, interest, or principal due on such instrument;


(3) The covered company will not make a redemption or repurchase of any capital instrument that is eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory capital ratio; and


(4) The covered company will not make any issuances of common stock or preferred stock.


(d) *Frequency of analysis conducted by the Board*—(1) *General.* Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Board will conduct its analysis of a covered company according to the frequency in Table 1 to § 252.44(d)(1).


(2) *Change in frequency.* (i) The Board may conduct a stress test of a covered company on a more or less frequent basis than would be required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section based on the company's financial condition, size, complexity, risk profile, scope of operations, or activities, or risks to the U.S. economy.


(ii) A Category IV bank holding company or Category IV U.S. intermediate holding company may elect to have the Board conduct a stress test with respect to the company in a year ending in an odd number by providing notice to the Board and the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank by January 15 of that year. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, such a company may elect to have the Board conduct a stress test with respect to the company in the year 2021 by providing notice to the Board and the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank by April 5, 2021.


(3) *Notice and response*—(i) *Notification of change in frequency.* If the Board determines to change the frequency of the stress test under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the Board will notify the company in writing and provide a discussion of the basis for its determination.


(ii) *Request for reconsideration and Board response.* Within 14 calendar days of receipt of a notification under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, a covered company may request in writing that the Board reconsider the requirement to conduct a stress test on a more or less frequent basis than would be required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. A covered company's request for reconsideration must include an explanation as to why the request for reconsideration should be granted. The Board will respond in writing within 14 calendar days of receipt of the company's request.
