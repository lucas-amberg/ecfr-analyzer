(D) Any amounts due from the home office, other offices and affiliates, including income accrued but uncollected on such amounts;


(E) The balance from time to time of any other asset or asset category disallowed at the preceding examination or by direction of the Board for any other reason until the underlying reasons for the disallowance have been removed;

(B) An asset classified doubtful or substandard at the preceding examination by a regulatory agency, outside accountant, or the bank's internal loan review staff, is valued at 50 percent and 80 percent, respectively;


(C) With respect to an asset classified value impaired, the amount representing the allocated transfer risk reserve that would be required for such exposure at a domestically chartered bank is valued at 0 and the residual exposure is valued at 80 percent; and


(D) Real estate located in the United States and carried on the accounting records as an asset are valued at net book value or appraised value, whichever is less.


(2) *Liabilities of all U.S. branches and agencies of a foreign banking organization* means all liabilities of all U.S. branches and agencies of the foreign banking organization, including acceptances and any other liabilities (including contingent liabilities), but excluding:


(i) Amounts due to and other liabilities to other offices, agencies, branches and affiliates of such foreign banking organization, including its head office, including unremitted profits; and


(ii) Reserves for possible loan losses and other contingencies.


(3) *Pre-provision net revenue* means revenue less expenses before adjusting for total loan loss provisions.


(4) *Stress test cycle* has the same meaning as in subpart F of this part.


(5) *Total loan loss provisions* means the amount needed to make reserves adequate to absorb estimated credit losses, based upon management's evaluation of the loans and leases that the company has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff, as determined under applicable accounting standards.


(b) *In general.* (1) A foreign banking organization subject to this subpart and that has a U.S. branch or U.S. agency must:

(iii) Provide to the Board the information required under paragraph (c) of this section.


(2) The capital stress testing regime of a foreign banking organization's home-country supervisor must include:


(i) A supervisory capital stress test conducted by the foreign banking organization's home-country supervisor or an evaluation and review by the foreign banking organization's home-country supervisor of an internal capital adequacy stress test conducted by the foreign banking organization, according to the frequency specified in paragraph (b)(2)(A) or (B):


(A) If the foreign banking organization is not a Category IV foreign banking organization, at least annually; or
