# § 253.3   Applicability.

(a) *General requirement.* On and after the LIBOR replacement date, the applicable Board-selected benchmark replacement shall be the benchmark replacement for the following LIBOR contracts, except to the extent that an exception in paragraph (b) of this section applies:


(1) A LIBOR contract with one of the following characteristics as of the LIBOR replacement date, after giving effect to paragraph (a)(2) of this section:


(i) The LIBOR contract contains no fallback provisions;


(ii) The LIBOR contract contains fallback provisions that identify neither—


(A) A specific benchmark replacement; nor


(B) A determining person; or


(iii) The LIBOR contract contains fallback provisions that identify a determining person, but the determining person has not selected a benchmark replacement by the earlier of the LIBOR replacement date and the latest date for selecting a benchmark replacement according to the terms of the LIBOR contract, for any reason.


(2) For purposes of this part, on the LIBOR replacement date, any reference in any fallback provisions of a LIBOR contract to the following shall be disregarded as if not included in the fallback provisions of such LIBOR contract and shall be deemed null and void and without any force or effect:


(i) A benchmark replacement that is based in any way on any LIBOR value, except to account for the difference between LIBOR and the benchmark replacement; or


(ii) A requirement that a person (other than a benchmark administrator) conduct a poll, survey, or inquiries for quotes or information concerning interbank lending or deposit rates (including, but not limited to, Eurodollar deposit or lending rates).


(b) *Exceptions.* Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, this part shall not apply to—


(1) Any LIBOR contract that the parties have agreed in writing shall not be subject to the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act;


(2) Any LIBOR contract that contains fallback provisions that identify a benchmark replacement that is not based in any way on any LIBOR value (including the prime rate or the effective Federal Funds rate) after application of paragraph (a)(2) of this section; or


(3) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(1)(iii) of this section, any LIBOR contract subject to paragraph (c) of this section as to which a determining person does not elect to use a Board-selected benchmark replacement pursuant to paragraph (c).


(c) *Selection of Board-selected benchmark replacement by determining person.* Except for any LIBOR contract described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a determining person may select the Board-selected benchmark replacement specified in § 253.4 as the benchmark replacement for a LIBOR contract. Any such selection shall be—


(1) Irrevocable;


(2) Made by the earlier of the LIBOR replacement date and the latest date for selecting a benchmark replacement according to the terms of the LIBOR contract; and


(3) Used in any determinations of the benchmark under or with respect to the LIBOR contract occurring on and after the LIBOR replacement date.


(d) *Other provisions of LIBOR contracts unchanged.* Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and in § 253.5, where the applicable Board-selected benchmark replacement becomes the benchmark replacement for a LIBOR contract on and after the LIBOR replacement date pursuant to paragraph (a) or (c) of this section, all other provisions of such contract shall not be altered or impaired and shall apply to such contract using the Board-selected benchmark replacement, including but not limited to:


(1) Any provision specifying the date for determining a benchmark, except in the case of derivative transactions, which are subject to § 253.4(a)(2), and Federal Home Loan Bank advances, which are subject to § 253.4(b)(3)(ii)(B);


(2) Any provision specifying rounding conventions for a benchmark;


(3) Any provision referencing LIBOR or any LIBOR value prior to the LIBOR replacement date (including any provision requiring a person to look back to a LIBOR value as of a date preceding the LIBOR replacement date);


(4) Any provision applying any cap, floor, modifier, or spread adjustment to which LIBOR had been subject pursuant to the terms of a LIBOR contract;


(5) Any provision of Federal consumer financial law that—


(i) Requires creditors to notify borrowers regarding a change-in-terms; or


(ii) Governs the reevaluation of rate increases on credit card accounts under open-ended (not home-secured) consumer credit plans; or


(6) Except as provided in 12 U.S.C. 5804(c), the rights or obligations of any person, or the authorities of any agency, under Federal consumer financial law, as defined in 12 U.S.C. 5481.
