# § 253.4   Board-selected benchmark replacements.

(a) *Derivative transactions.* (1) A LIBOR contract subject to the requirements of this part that is a derivative transaction shall use the benchmark replacement identified as the “Fallback Rate (SOFR)” in the ISDA protocol (*see* appendix A to this part) for each day on which LIBOR would ordinarily be observed occurring on or after the LIBOR replacement date. For clarity, the reference to “spread relating to U.S. dollar LIBOR” in the definition of “Fallback Rate (SOFR)” in the ISDA protocol is equal to the applicable tenor spread adjustment identified in paragraph (c) of this section.


(2) The benchmark replacement used to calculate the payment due for the relevant calculation period shall be determined on the derivative transaction fallback observation day in respect of the day that, under the LIBOR contract, would have been used to determine the LIBOR-based rate that is being replaced or, if the Board-selected benchmark replacement in respect of that day is not available on the derivative transaction fallback observation day, the most recently available publication on the derivative transaction fallback observation day shall be used.


(b) *All other transactions.* On the LIBOR replacement date, a LIBOR contract subject to the requirements of this part that is not a derivative transaction shall use the following benchmark replacements:


(1) For a LIBOR contract that is not a consumer loan, an FHFA-regulated-entity contract, or a FFELP ABS—


(i) In place of overnight LIBOR, the benchmark replacement shall be SOFR plus the tenor spread adjustment identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and


(ii) In place of one-, three-, six-, or 12-month tenors of LIBOR, the benchmark replacement shall be the corresponding one-, three-, six-, or 12-month CME Term SOFR plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment identified in paragraph (c) of this section.


(2) For a LIBOR contract that is a consumer loan—


(i) During the one-year period beginning on the LIBOR replacement date:


(A) In place of overnight LIBOR, the benchmark replacement shall be SOFR plus an amount that transitions linearly for each business day during that period from:


(*1*) The difference between SOFR and overnight LIBOR determined as of the day immediately before the LIBOR replacement date; to


(*2*) The tenor spread adjustment identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section; or


(B) In place of the one-, three-, six-, or 12-month tenors of LIBOR, the benchmark replacement shall be the corresponding one-, three-, six-, or 12-month CME Term SOFR plus an amount that transitions linearly for each business day during that period from:


(*1*) The difference between the relevant CME Term SOFR and the relevant LIBOR tenor determined as of the day immediately before the LIBOR replacement date; to


(*2*) The applicable tenor spread adjustment identified in paragraph (c) of this section.


(ii) On the date one year after the LIBOR replacement date and thereafter:


(A) In place of overnight LIBOR, the benchmark replacement shall be SOFR plus the tenor spread adjustment identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and


(B) In place of one-, three-, six-, or 12-month tenors of LIBOR, the benchmark replacement shall be the corresponding one-, three-, six-, or 12-month CME Term SOFR plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment identified in paragraph (c) of this section.


(iii) The rates published or provided by Refinitiv Limited as “USD IBOR Cash Fallbacks” for “Consumer” products shall be deemed equal to the rates identified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.


(3) For a LIBOR contract that is an FHFA-regulated-entity contract—


(i) For an FHFA-regulated-entity contract that is not a Federal Home Loan Bank advance—


(A) In place of overnight LIBOR, the benchmark replacement shall be SOFR plus the tenor spread adjustment identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and


(B) In place of one-, three-, six-, or 12-month tenors of LIBOR, the benchmark replacement shall be the 30-day Average SOFR plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment identified in paragraph (c) of this section.


(ii) For an FHFA-regulated-entity contract that is a Federal Home Loan Bank advance—


(A) The benchmark replacement shall be the “Fallback Rate (SOFR)” in the ISDA protocol (*see* appendix A to this part) for each day on which LIBOR would ordinarily be observed occurring on or after the LIBOR replacement date. For clarity, the reference to “spread relating to U.S. dollar LIBOR” in the definition of “Fallback Rate (SOFR)” in the ISDA protocol is equal to the applicable tenor spread adjustment identified in paragraph (c) of this section.


(B) The benchmark replacement used to calculate the payment due for the relevant calculation period shall be determined on the derivative transaction fallback observation day in respect of the day that, under the LIBOR contract, would have been used to determine the LIBOR-based rate that is being replaced or, if the Board-selected benchmark replacement in respect of that day is not available on the derivative transaction fallback observation day, the most recently available publication on the derivative transaction fallback observation day shall be used.


(4) For a LIBOR contract that is a FFELP ABS—


(i) In place of one-month LIBOR, the benchmark replacement shall be 30-day Average SOFR plus the tenor spread adjustment identified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section;


(ii) In place of three-month LIBOR, the benchmark shall be 90-day Average SOFR plus the tenor spread adjustment identified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and


(iii) In place of six- or 12-month tenors of LIBOR, the benchmark replacement shall be 30-day Average SOFR plus the tenor spread adjustment identified in paragraph (c)(4) or (5) of this section, as applicable.


(c) *Tenor spread adjustments.* The following tenor spread adjustments shall be included as part of the Board-selected benchmark replacements as indicated in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:


(1) 0.00644 percent for overnight LIBOR;


(2) 0.11448 percent for one-month LIBOR;


(3) 0.26161 percent for three-month LIBOR;


(4) 0.42826 percent for six-month LIBOR; and


(5) 0.71513 percent for 12-month LIBOR.
