# § 253.5   Benchmark replacement conforming changes.

(a) *Benchmark replacement conforming changes generally.* (1) If the Board-selected benchmark replacement becomes the benchmark replacement for a LIBOR contract pursuant to § 253.3(a) or (c), all applicable benchmark replacement conforming changes shall become an integral part of the LIBOR contract.


(2) Paragraph (b) of this section establishes specific benchmark replacement conforming changes. The Board may, in its discretion, publish additional benchmark replacement conforming changes by regulation or order.


(3) Solely with respect to any LIBOR contract that is not a consumer loan, a calculating person may make any additional technical, administrative, or operational changes, alterations, or modifications that, in that person's reasonable judgment, would be necessary or appropriate to permit the implementation, administration, and calculation of the Board-selected benchmark replacement under or with respect to a LIBOR contract after giving due consideration to any changes, alterations, or modifications otherwise required by the Board, without any requirement to obtain consent from any other person prior to the adoption of such benchmark replacement conforming changes.


(b) *Specified benchmark replacement conforming changes.* (1) Any reference to a specified source for LIBOR (such as a particular newspaper, website, or screen) shall be replaced with the publication of the applicable Board-selected benchmark replacement (inclusive or exclusive of the relevant tenor spread adjustment identified in § 253.4(c)) by either the relevant benchmark administrator for the applicable Board-selected benchmark replacement or any third party authorized by the relevant benchmark administrator to publish the applicable Board-selected benchmark replacement.


(2) Any reference to a particular time of day for determining LIBOR (such as 11:00 a.m. London time) shall be replaced with the standard publication time for the applicable Board-selected benchmark replacement (inclusive or exclusive of the relevant tenor spread adjustment identified in § 253.4(c)), as established by the relevant benchmark administrator.


(3) Any provision of a LIBOR contract requiring use of a combination (such as an average) of LIBOR values over a period of time that spans the LIBOR replacement date shall be modified to provide that the combination shall be calculated consistent with that contractual provision using:


(i) The applicable LIBOR for any date prior to the LIBOR replacement date; and


(ii) The applicable Board-selected benchmark replacement rate for any date on or following the LIBOR replacement date, respectively.


(4) Subject to § 253.4(a) and (b)(3)(ii), to the extent a Board-selected benchmark replacement is not available or published on a particular day indicated in the LIBOR contract as the determination date, the most recently available publication of the Board-selected benchmark replacement will apply.
