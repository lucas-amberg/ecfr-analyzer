# Appendix A to Part 253—ISDA Protocol


For ease of reference, the Board is republishing, with permission, the full text of the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (ISDA protocol), published on October 23, 2020, by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. The full text of the ISDA protocol follows:


The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) has published this ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (this Protocol) to enable parties to Protocol Covered Documents to amend the terms of each such Protocol Covered Document to (i) in respect of a Protocol Covered Document which incorporates, or references a rate as defined in, a Covered ISDA Definitions Booklet, include in the terms of such Protocol Covered Document either the terms of, or a particular defined term included in, the Supplement to the 2006 ISDA Definitions, finalized on October 23, 2020 and to be published by ISDA and effective on January 25, 2021 (the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement) and (ii) in respect of a Protocol Covered Document which otherwise references a Relevant IBOR, include in the terms of such Protocol Covered Document new fallbacks for that Relevant IBOR.


Accordingly, a party may adhere to this Protocol and be bound by its terms by completing and delivering a letter substantially in the form of Exhibit 1 to this Protocol (an Adherence Letter) to ISDA, as agent, as described below (each such party, an Adhering Party).


(a) By adhering to this Protocol in the manner set forth in this paragraph 1, each Adhering Party agrees, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, that the terms of each Protocol Covered Document between such Adhering Party and any other Adhering Party will be amended in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Attachment hereto.


(b) Adherence to this Protocol will be evidenced by the execution and online delivery, in accordance with this paragraph, to ISDA, as agent, of an Adherence Letter (in accordance with subparagraphs 1(b)(i) to 1(b)(iii) below). ISDA shall have the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, upon at least thirty calendar days' notice on the “ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol” section of its website at *www.isda.org* (or by other suitable means), to designate a closing date of this Protocol (such closing date, the Cut-off Date). After the Cut-off Date, ISDA will not accept any further Adherence Letters to this Protocol.


(i) Each Adhering Party will access the “Protocols” section of the ISDA website at *www.isda.org* to enter information online that is required to generate its form of Adherence Letter and will submit payment of any applicable fee. Either by directly downloading the populated Adherence Letter from the Protocol system or upon receipt via email of the populated Adherence Letter, each Adhering Party will sign and upload the signed Adherence Letter as a PDF (portable document format) attachment into the Protocol system. Once the signed Adherence Letter has been approved and accepted by ISDA, such Adhering Party will receive an email confirmation of the Adhering Party's adherence to this Protocol.


(ii) A conformed copy of each Adherence Letter containing, in place of each signature, the printed or typewritten name of each signatory will be published by ISDA so that it may be viewed by all Adhering Parties. Each Adhering Party agrees that, for evidentiary purposes, a conformed copy of an Adherence Letter certified by the General Counsel (or other appropriate officer) of ISDA will be deemed to be an original.


(iii) Each Adhering Party agrees that the determination of the date and time of acceptance of any Adherence Letter will be determined by ISDA in its absolute discretion. Any Adherence Letter which is dated and delivered to ISDA before the date on which this Protocol is published will be deemed to have been delivered on the date on which this Protocol is published.


(c) As between two Adhering Parties, the agreement to make the amendments contemplated by this Protocol, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Protocol, will be effective on the Implementation Date and that agreement will form part of each Protocol Covered Document from the later of the Implementation Date and the related Protocol Covered Document Date. The amendments contemplated by this Protocol shall be made on the later of (i) the Implementation Date and (ii) the Protocol Effective Date.


(A) The Protocol Effective Date with respect to a Protocol Covered Document shall be January 25, 2021.


(B) The Implementation Date with respect to any two Adhering Parties shall be the date of acceptance by ISDA, as agent, of an Adherence Letter (in accordance with paragraph 1(b) above) from the later of such two Adhering Parties to adhere except that:


(I) In respect of any Protocol Covered Document into which an Agent has entered on behalf of a Client, subject to paragraph 3(m) below, the Implementation Date shall be the date specified in subparagraph 3(g)(i)(A), subparagraph 3(g)(i)(B), subparagraph 3(g)(i)(C), paragraph 3(h), paragraph 3(i) or paragraph 3(j) below, as applicable; and


(II) In respect of any Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Document, subject to paragraph 3(m) below, the Implementation Date shall be the day specified in paragraph 3(l) below.


Acceptance by ISDA of a subsequent or revised Adherence Letter from either such Adhering Party will not have the effect of changing such Implementation Date.


(d) This Protocol is intended for use without negotiation, but without prejudice to any amendment, modification or waiver in respect of a Protocol Covered Document that the parties may otherwise effect in accordance with the terms of that Protocol Covered Document.


(i) In adhering to this Protocol, an Adhering Party may not specify additional provisions, conditions or limitations in its Adherence Letter.


(ii) Any purported adherence that ISDA, as agent, determines in good faith is not in compliance with this Protocol will be void and ISDA will inform the relevant party of such fact as soon as reasonably possible after making such determination.


(e) Each Adhering Party acknowledges and agrees that adherence to this Protocol is irrevocable, except that an Adhering Party may, after the Protocol Effective Date, deliver to ISDA, as agent, a notice substantially in the form of Exhibit 2 to this Protocol that is effective (determined pursuant to paragraph 3(f) below) on any Protocol Business Day (a Revocation Notice) to designate the next Revocation Date as the last date on which an Implementation Date can occur in respect of any Protocol Covered Document between the counterparty and such Adhering Party. Following the effective delivery of a Revocation Notice by an Adhering Party, this Protocol will not amend any Protocol Covered Document between that Adhering Party and another Adhering Party for which the Implementation Date would occur after the related Revocation Date.


(i) If an Agent adheres to this Protocol on behalf of a Client, then, if the Client effectively delivers a Revocation Notice in accordance with this paragraph 1(e), this Protocol will not amend any Protocol Covered Document between another Adhering Party and that Client entered into by that Client itself or by the Agent on behalf of that Client or any Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Document (if applicable), in each case, for which the Implementation Date would occur after the Revocation Date designated as the last date on which an Implementation Date can occur in the Client's Revocation Notice.


(ii) If an Agent delivers a Revocation Notice in accordance with this paragraph 1(e) on behalf of a Client and the Client separately adheres to this Protocol directly rather than through the agency of an Agent, then the Revocation Notice delivered by the Agent will not prevent an Implementation Date from occurring after the Revocation Date in respect of any Protocol Covered Document into which the Client has entered with another Adhering Party (including through the Agent).


(iii) Subparagraph 1(e)(i), subparagraph 1(e)(ii) and subparagraph 1(e)(iii) are without prejudice to any amendment effected pursuant to this Protocol to any Protocol Covered Document between two Adhering Parties for which the Implementation Date occurred on or before the day on which that Revocation Date occurs or is deemed to occur, regardless of the date on which such Protocol Covered Document is entered into, and any such amendment shall be effective notwithstanding the occurrence or deemed occurrence of such Revocation Date.


(iv) Each Revocation Notice must be delivered by the means specified in paragraph 3(f) below.


(v) Each Adhering Party agrees that, for evidentiary purposes, a conformed copy of a Revocation Notice certified by the General Counsel or an appropriate officer of ISDA will be deemed to be an original.


(vi) Any purported revocation that ISDA, as agent, determines in good faith is not in compliance with this paragraph 1(e) will be void and ISDA will inform the relevant party of such fact as soon as reasonably possible after making such determination.


(a) As of the later of (i) the date on which an Adhering Party adheres to this Protocol in accordance with paragraph 1 above (which will be the date of acceptance by ISDA of an Adherence Letter from that Adhering Party (in accordance with paragraph 1(b) above)) and (ii) the Protocol Covered Document Date, such Adhering Party represents to each other Adhering Party with which it has entered into a Protocol Covered Document (which representations will be deemed to be repeated on the Protocol Effective Date and the Implementation Date if one or both such dates are later than the date on which such Adhering Party adheres to this Protocol) each of the following matters:


(A) *Status.* It is, if relevant, duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation and, if relevant under such laws, in good standing or, if it otherwise represents its status in or pursuant to the Protocol Covered Document, has such status.


(B) *Powers.* It has the power to execute and deliver the Adherence Letter and to perform its obligations under the Adherence Letter and the Protocol Covered Document as amended by the Adherence Letter and this Protocol (including the Attachment hereto), and has taken all necessary action to authorize such execution, delivery and performance.


(C) *No Violation or Conflict.* Such execution, delivery and performance do not violate or conflict with any law applicable to it, any provision of its constitutional documents, any order or judgment of any court or other agency of government applicable to it or any of its assets or any contractual restriction binding on or affecting it or any of its assets.


(D) *Consents.* All governmental and other consents that are required to have been obtained by it with respect to the Adherence Letter and the Protocol Covered Document, as amended by the Adherence Letter and this Protocol (including the Attachment hereto), have been obtained and are in full force and effect and all conditions of any such consents have been complied with.


(E) *Obligations Binding.* Its obligations under the Adherence Letter and the Protocol Covered Document, as amended by the Adherence Letter and this Protocol (including the Attachment hereto), constitute its legal, valid and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to equitable principles of general application (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law)).


(F) *Credit Support.* Its adherence to this Protocol and any amendment contemplated by this Protocol (including the Attachment hereto) will not, in and of itself, adversely affect the enforceability, effectiveness or validity of any obligations owed, whether by it or by any third party, under any Credit Support Document or Third Party Credit Support Document in respect of its obligations relating to any Protocol Covered Document as amended by the Adherence Letter and this Protocol (including the Attachment hereto).


(b) Each Adhering Party agrees with each other Adhering Party with which it has entered into a Protocol Covered Document that each of the foregoing representations will be deemed, in the case of a Protocol Covered Document that is an ISDA Master Agreement, to be a representation for purposes of Section 5(a)(iv) and in the case of any other Protocol Covered Document, to be a representation for purposes of any analogous provisions of each such Protocol Covered Document, that is made by each Adhering Party as of the later of (i) the date on which such Adhering Party adheres to this Protocol in accordance with paragraph 1 above and (ii) the Protocol Covered Document Date and which is deemed repeated on the Protocol Effective Date and the Implementation Date if one or both such dates are later than the date on which such Adhering Party adheres to this Protocol.


(c) *Undertakings in respect of Protocol Covered Documents with Third Party Credit Support Documents.* With respect to Protocol Covered Documents with Third Party Credit Support Documents that expressly require the consent, approval, agreement, authorization or other action of a Third Party to be obtained, each Adhering Party whose obligations under such arrangements are secured, guaranteed or otherwise supported by such Third Party undertakes to each other Adhering Party with which it has entered into such arrangements that it has obtained the consent (including by way of paragraph 2(d) below), approval, agreement, authorization or other action of such Third Party and that it will, upon demand, deliver evidence of such consent, approval, agreement, authorization or other action to such other Adhering Party.


(d) *Deemed Third Party Consent.* Each Adhering Party which is also a Third Party in relation to a Third Party Credit Support Document is hereby deemed to have consented to the amendments imposed by this Protocol on the Protocol Covered Document supported by such Third Party Credit Support Document.


(a) *Entire Agreement; Restatement; Survival.*

(i) This Protocol constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the Adhering Parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all oral communication and prior writings (except as otherwise provided herein) with respect thereto. Each Adhering Party acknowledges that in adhering to this Protocol it has not relied on any oral or written representation, warranty or other assurance (except as provided for or referred to elsewhere in this Protocol or in the Attachment) and waives all rights and remedies which might otherwise be available to it in respect thereof, except that nothing in this Protocol will limit or exclude any liability of an Adhering Party for fraud.


(ii) Except for any amendment deemed to be made pursuant to this Protocol in respect of any Protocol Covered Document, all terms and conditions of each Protocol Covered Document will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its provisions as in effect immediately prior to the date on which it first becomes subject to this Protocol. Except as explicitly stated in this Protocol, nothing herein shall constitute a waiver or release of any rights of any Adhering Party under any Protocol Covered Document to which such Adhering Party is a party or a provider or recipient of credit support. This Protocol will, with respect to its subject matter, survive, and any amendments made or deemed to be made pursuant to this Protocol will form a part of each Protocol Covered Document between the Adhering Parties, notwithstanding any statements in a Protocol Covered Document to the effect that such Protocol Covered Document constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the parties to such Protocol Covered Document with respect to the subject of such Protocol Covered Document.


(b) *Exclusion of Agreements.* Notwithstanding anything in paragraph 1(a) above, with respect to any agreement between Adhering Parties, if the parties to such agreement have expressly stated in such agreement or otherwise agreed in writing that this Protocol shall not apply, then such agreement shall not be a Protocol Covered Document.


(c) *Amendments.* An amendment, modification or waiver in respect of the matters contemplated by this Protocol (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any amendment, modification or waiver relating to the alignment of a Protocol Covered Document with an instrument for which such Protocol Covered Document is intended to serve as a hedge (or *vice versa*)) will only be effective in respect of a Protocol Covered Document if made in accordance with the terms of the Protocol Covered Document and then only with effect between the parties to that Protocol Covered Document.


(d) *Headings.* The headings used in this Protocol and any Adherence Letter are for convenience of reference only and are not to affect the construction of or to be taken into consideration in interpreting this Protocol or any Adherence Letter.


(e) *Governing Law.* This Protocol and each Adherence Letter will, as between two Adhering Parties and in respect of each Protocol Covered Document between them, be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, without reference to choice of law doctrine, *provided* that the amendments to each Protocol Covered Document shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law specified to govern that Protocol Covered Document and otherwise in accordance with the applicable choice of law doctrine.


(f) *Notices.* Any Revocation Notice must be in writing and delivered as a locked PDF (portable document format) attachment to an email to ISDA at *isda@isda.org* and will be deemed effectively delivered on the date it is delivered unless, on the date of that delivery, ISDA's London office is closed or that communication is delivered after 5:00 p.m., London time, in which case that communication will be deemed effectively delivered on the next day ISDA's London office is open.


(g) *Ability of an Agent to Adhere to the Protocol on Behalf of a Client.*

(i) An Agent may adhere to this Protocol:


(A) On behalf of all Clients represented by such Agent (in which case, such Agent need not identify each Client through an online platform available generally to the industry, including, for example, the ISDA Amend platform provided by IHS Markit (a Platform) and, in respect of any Protocol Covered Document into which the Agent has entered on behalf of those Clients, the Implementation Date shall be the date of acceptance by ISDA of an Adherence Letter (in accordance with paragraph 1(b) above) from the later of the two Adhering Parties to adhere);


(B) On behalf of only those Clients represented by such Agent that such Agent specifically names or identifies through a Platform and, in respect of any Protocol Covered Document into which the Agent has entered on behalf of any such Client, the Implementation Date shall be the date shown on the Platform as the date on which the Agent communicates the name or identity of that Client to the other Adhering Party (or, if later, the date of acceptance by ISDA, as agent, of an Adherence Letter from the other Adhering Party); or


(C) On behalf of all Clients represented by such Agent, excluding any Clients whose name or identity the Agent communicates to the other Adhering Party through a Platform as a Client excluded from adherence, subject to subparagraph 3(h)(i) below, on or before the date of acceptance by ISDA of an Adherence Letter (in accordance with paragraph 1(b) above) from the later of the two Adhering Parties to adhere (in which case, such Agent need not identify each Client on whose behalf it adheres through a Platform). In respect of any Protocol Covered Document into which the Agent has entered on behalf of any Client whose name or identity has not been communicated to the other Adhering Party through a Platform as a Client excluded from adherence, the Implementation Date shall (subject to subparagraph 3(h)(i) below) be the date of acceptance by ISDA of an Adherence Letter (in accordance with paragraph 1(b) above) from the later of the two Adhering Parties to adhere. If the Agent has not communicated the name or identity of any Clients excluded from adherence to the other Adhering Party through a Platform on or before the date of acceptance by ISDA of an Adherence Letter (in accordance with paragraph 1(b) above) from the later of the two Adhering Parties to adhere, then (subject to subparagraph 3(h)(i) below) in respect of any Protocol Covered Document into which the Agent has entered on behalf of any Client, the Implementation Date shall be the date of acceptance by ISDA of an Adherence Letter (in accordance with paragraph 1(b) above) from the later of the two Adhering Parties to adhere, and, in each case, if the Agent elects for Option 2 in its Adherence Letter, on behalf of those Clients whose name or identity the Agent communicates to the other Adhering Party through a Platform as being a Client in respect of which subparagraph 3(g)(ii)(B)(II) below applies (in which case, the Implementation Date in respect of any Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Document shall be as specified in subparagraph 3(l) below).


(ii) In each case, the Agent can elect to apply the amendments in this Protocol to either:


(A) In respect of all those Clients on whose behalf the Agent adheres pursuant to subparagraph 3(g)(i)(A), subparagraph 3(g)(i)(B) or subparagraph 3(g)(i)(C) above, each Protocol Covered Document into which the Agent has entered on behalf of those Clients (Option 1); or


(B) In respect of all those Clients on whose behalf the Agent adheres pursuant to subparagraph 3(g)(i)(A), subparagraph 3(g)(i)(B) or subparagraph 3(g)(i)(C) above, each Protocol Covered Document into which the Agent has entered on behalf of those Clients and (II) in respect of those Clients on whose behalf the Agent adheres whose name or identity the Agent communicates to the other Adhering Party through a Platform as being a Client in respect of which this subparagraph 3(g)(ii)(B)(II) applies, each Protocol Covered Document into which the Agent did not enter on behalf of those Clients but which the Agent has the authority from the relevant Client to amend (for the purpose of this Protocol, documents described in this subparagraph 3(g)(ii)(B)(II) being *Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Documents* and the date shown on the Platform as the date on which the Agent communicates the name or identity of the Client to the other Adhering Party for the purposes of this subparagraph 3(g)(ii)(B)(II) being the *Identification Date*) (Option 2). If an Agent adheres to this Protocol and elects for Option 2, in respect of any Client on whose behalf the Agent adheres pursuant to subparagraph 3(g)(i)(A), subparagraph 3(g)(i)(B) or subparagraph 3(g)(i)(C) above whose name or identity is communicated to the other Adhering Party as being a Client in respect of which subparagraph 3(g)(ii)(B)(II) above applies, Protocol Covered Documents referred to in both subparagraph 3(g)(ii)(B)(I) and subparagraph 3(g)(ii)(B)(II) above will be amended in accordance with the terms of this Protocol. For the avoidance of doubt, any Protocol Covered Document into which the Agent did not enter on behalf of a Client and which the Agent does not have the authority from the relevant Client to amend will not constitute a Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Document.


(iii) The election for Option 1 or Option 2 shall be made in the Adherence Letter. Adherence by the Agent shall only be effective with respect to those Protocol Covered Documents described in Option 1 or Option 2, as applicable, and as elected in the Adherence Letter (subject to, if the Agent elects for Option 2 and with respect to Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Documents,


(A) Subparagraph 3(g)(iv) and paragraph 3(l) below and (B) the Agent communicating the name or identity of those Clients on behalf of which it is amending Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Documents to the other Adhering Party, in accordance with subparagraph 3(g)(ii)(B)(II) above (regardless of whether the Agent adheres to this Protocol using the approach described in subparagraph 3(g)(i)(A), subparagraph 3(g)(i)(B) or subparagraph 3(g)(i)(C) above)).


(iv) If an Agent adheres to this Protocol and elects for Option 2 in its Adherence Letter, then, in respect of any Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Document only, the Agent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following a written request (including by email) from the other Adhering Party, and in any event by no later than the end of the fifteenth calendar day following such request, provide reasonable evidence satisfactory to the other Adhering Party in its sole discretion supporting the Agent's authority to amend such documents, provided that:


(A) If, prior to the date of acceptance by ISDA of an Adherence Letter (in accordance with paragraph 1(b) above) from the later of the Agent and the other Adhering Party to adhere, the Agent has delivered to the other Adhering Party a copy, or relevant extracts, of the agreement (such as an investment management agreement) pursuant to which the relevant Client appoints the Agent to act on its behalf and authorizes the Agent to make the amendments contemplated by this Protocol to the Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Document (whether or not such authority expressly refers to this Protocol), then, subject to the other Adhering Party's right to request (which request must be in writing (which includes by email)) an additional copy of that agreement or those relevant extracts (which request shall be made no later than the end of the fifteenth calendar day following the later of the Identification Date and the date of acceptance by ISDA, as agent, of an Adherence Letter from that other Adhering Party), the Agent need not provide any further evidence supporting its authority to amend that Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Document on behalf of that Client for the purposes of this Protocol and, in respect of that Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Document, shall be deemed to have provided reasonable evidence satisfactory to the other Adhering Party on (I) if the other Adhering Party does not request an additional copy of that agreement or those relevant extracts, the end of the fifteenth calendar day following the later of the Identification Date and the date of acceptance by ISDA, as agent, of an Adherence Letter from that other Adhering Party or


(II) If the other Adhering Party does request an additional copy of that agreement or those relevant extracts, the day on which that additional copy is delivered to the other Adhering Party;


(B) If the other Adhering Party does not request such evidence by the end of the fifteenth calendar day following the later of the Identification Date and the date of acceptance by ISDA, as agent, of an Adherence Letter from that other Adhering Party, then the Agent shall be deemed to have provided reasonable evidence satisfactory to the other Adhering Party at the end of that fifteenth calendar day;


(C) Subject to subparagraph 3(g)(iv)(A) above, following the delivery of any such evidence by the Agent to the other Adhering Party, unless the other Adhering Party notifies the Agent to the contrary by the end of the fifteenth calendar day following the day on which such evidence is delivered, the Agent shall be deemed to have provided reasonable evidence satisfactory to the other Adhering Party at the end of that fifteenth calendar day;


(D) If: (I)


(I) following written request from the other Adhering Party, the Agent does not provide the other Adhering Party with any evidence supporting its authority to amend such documents or, if subparagraph 3(g)(iv)(A) above applies, with an additional copy of the relevant agreement or extracts, by the end of the fifteenth calendar day following such written request; or


(II) subject to subparagraph 3(g)(iv)(A) above, the other Adhering Party determines that the evidence provided by the Agent is not satisfactory and notifies the Agent accordingly by the end of the fifteenth calendar day following the day on which such evidence is delivered,


Then request for evidence and the Agent's right to provide such evidence and, in respect of any such evidence, subject to subparagraph 3(g)(iv)(C) above, the Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Document shall not be amended by this Protocol; and


(E) Any failure by the Agent to provide the other Adhering Party with such evidence shall not give rise to a Potential Event of Default or an Event of Default (each as defined in the ISDA Master Agreement), or any similar event, under that Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Document or other contractual right of action under this Protocol or that Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Document.


(v) If an Agent adheres to this Protocol and specifically names or identifies one or more Clients


(A) On whose behalf it is adhering (as contemplated in subparagraph 3(g)(i)(B) above), (B) which are excluded from adherence (as contemplated in subparagraph 3(g)(i)(C) above), and/or (C) on whose behalf it is amending Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Documents (as contemplated in subparagraph 3(g)(ii)(B)(II) above), as applicable, through a Platform, that Agent shall provide the legal entity identifier (LEI) of each such Client through such Platform.


(vi) If an Agent adheres to this Protocol on behalf of a Client by executing and delivering an Adherence Letter on behalf of such Client in accordance with paragraph 1 above and this paragraph 3(g), references to the Adhering Party for purposes of this Protocol (including the Attachment hereto) and the Adherence Letter shall be interpreted to refer to such Client. If, in respect of a Client, more than one Adherence Letter is accepted by ISDA in accordance with paragraph 1(b) above (by virtue of the Client adhering on its own behalf and one or more Agents adhering on behalf of that Client), then:


(A) If ISDA accepts an Adherence Letter from an Agent on behalf of a Client after it accepts an Adherence Letter from that Client, any document entered into by:


(I) That Agent acting on behalf of that Client; or


(II) If the Agent elects for Option 2 in its Adherence Letter, that Client on its own behalf but which the Agent has the authority from the relevant Client to amend, in each case, which has a Protocol Covered Document Date prior to:


(1) The Protocol Effective Date; or


(2) If later, the date of acceptance by ISDA, as agent, of an Adherence Letter from that Agent (or, if later, the date of acceptance by ISDA, as agent, of an Adherence Letter from the other Adhering Party), will be deemed to have “a Protocol Covered Document Date prior to the Protocol Effective Date (or, if later, the date of acceptance by ISDA, as agent, of an Adherence Letter (in accordance with paragraph 1(b) above) from the later of the two Adhering Parties to adhere)” for the purposes of the definitions of Protocol Covered Confirmation, Protocol Covered Credit Support Document and Protocol Covered Master Agreement below; and


(B) If ISDA accepts an Adherence Letter from a Client after it accepts an Adherence Letter from an Agent on behalf of that Client, any document entered into by the Client, whether directly or through the agency of an Agent, which has a Protocol Covered Document Date prior to:


(I) The Protocol Effective Date; or if later, the date of acceptance by ISDA, as agent, of an Adherence Letter from that Client (or, if later, the date of acceptance by ISDA, as agent, of an Adherence Letter from the other Adhering Party), will be deemed to have “a Protocol Covered Document Date prior to the Protocol Effective Date (or, if later, the date of acceptance by ISDA, as agent, of an Adherence Letter (in accordance with paragraph 1(b) above) from the later of the two Adhering Parties to adhere)” for the purposes of the definitions of Protocol Covered Confirmation, Protocol Covered Credit Support Document and Protocol Covered Master Agreement below.


(vii) If an Agent adheres to this Protocol on behalf of a Client, then as of the later of (A) the date on which such Agent adheres to this Protocol in accordance with paragraph 1 above and (B) the Protocol Covered Document Date, such Agent represents to each Adhering Party (I) with which it has entered into a Protocol Covered Document on behalf of such Client or (II) which is a party to any Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Document (which representation will be deemed to be repeated on the Protocol Effective Date and on the Implementation Date if one or both such dates are later than the date on which such Agent adheres to this Protocol) that it has, as at the relevant Implementation Date, all necessary authority to enter into the Adherence Letter on behalf of such Client. In respect of any Client referred to in paragraph 3(h), paragraph 3(i), paragraph 3(j) or paragraph 3(k) below, the Agent represents that it has, as at the relevant Implementation Date, all necessary authority to apply the terms of the Adherence Letter to such Client.


(h) *Clients Added to an Agent Protocol Covered Document after the date of acceptance by ISDA of an Adherence Letter from the later of the Agent and the other Adhering Party to adhere.*

(i) Subject to subparagraph 3(h)(ii) below, in respect of any Client added to an Agent Protocol Covered Document between an Agent and an Adhering Party after the date of acceptance by ISDA of an Adherence Letter (in accordance with paragraph 1(b) above) from the later of the Agent and the other Adhering Party to adhere (a New Client), the Agent and such Adhering Party agree that the terms of such Agent Protocol Covered Document as between such Adhering Party and any New Client will be subject to the amendments effected by this Protocol and as between the Adhering Party and the New Client the Implementation Date shall be the date on which the New Client is added to the Agent Protocol Covered Document, unless otherwise agreed between such Agent and such Adhering Party (which agreement may, if the Agent adheres to this Protocol using the approach in subparagraph 3(g)(i)(C) above, be reached by the Agent communicating to the other Adhering Party through a Platform, at the time the New Client is added to the Agent Protocol Covered Document, that the New Client is excluded from adherence).

This letter constitutes, as between each other Adhering Party and us, an Adherence Letter as referred to in the Protocol. The definitions and provisions contained in the Protocol are incorporated into this Adherence Letter, which will supplement and form part of each Protocol Covered Document between us and each other Adhering Party.


As between each Adhering Party and us, we acknowledge and agree that the amendments in the Attachment to the Protocol shall apply to each Protocol Covered Document to which we are a party in accordance with the terms of the Protocol and this Adherence Letter.


We hereby appoint ISDA as our agent for the limited purposes of the Protocol and accordingly we waive any rights and hereby release ISDA from any claims, actions or causes of action whatsoever (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or in any way relating to this Adherence Letter or our adherence to the Protocol or any actions contemplated as being required by ISDA.


By adhering to the Protocol, we agree that all claims or disputes arising out of or in connection with adherence to the Protocol shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the Rules) by three arbitrators, and hereby waive any right to assert any such claims or disputes against ISDA as a representative or member in any class or representative action. The claimant(s) (as defined in the Rules) shall nominate one arbitrator in the `Request for Arbitration'. The respondent(s) (as defined in the Rules) shall nominate one arbitrator in the `Answer to the Request'. The two party-nominated arbitrators shall then have 30 days to agree, in consultation with the parties to the arbitration, upon the nomination of a third arbitrator to act as president of the tribunal, barring which the International Chamber of Commerce Court shall select the third arbitrator (or any arbitrator that claimant(s) or respondent(s) shall fail to nominate in accordance with the foregoing). This agreement to arbitrate shall not be affected by the Revocation Notice as described in the Protocol.

Note 2: Specify legal name of Adhering Party.


If you are an Agent, you may sign the Adherence Letter using one of the options below. Please note that, if you would like to adhere on behalf of yourself, as principal, and also on behalf of your Clients, as Agent, you must submit one adherence letter for yourself, as principal, and a second adherence letter on behalf of your Clients, as Agent, in the latter case, in accordance with one of the options set out below.


First, if you have the authority to adhere to this Protocol as Agent on behalf of all Clients, you may indicate the following in the signature block: “acting on behalf of [(a)] each fund, account or other principal (each, a “Client”) on whose behalf we have entered, or will enter, into a Protocol Covered Document and any New Clients added to an Agent Protocol Covered Document in the future [and (b) in respect of any Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Documents, each Client which we name or identify through a Platform as being a Client in respect of which subparagraph 3(g)(ii)(B)(II) of the Protocol applies]”. If such a signature block is used, a separate Adherence Letter for each Client does not need to be submitted to ISDA and no specific names of Clients must be identified through a Platform (except if you elect for Option 2 in this Adherence Letter, in which case the Clients on whose behalf you are amending Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Documents should be identified through such Platform; you will be responsible for identifying such Clients and providing their LEIs. If you cannot or do not wish to name such Clients, then provided that you can identify the Clients by way of LEIs, you may identify such Clients using LEIs and without including any names). If you do not elect for Option 2 in this Adherence Letter, you should delete the wording in square brackets in the signature block.


Second, if you adhere to this Protocol as an agent on behalf of certain Clients only by specifically identifying such Clients, you may indicate the following in the signature block: “acting on behalf of [(a)] each fund, account or other principal (each a “Client”) which we name or identify through a Platform as being a Client on whose behalf we have entered, or will enter, into a Protocol Covered Document and any New Clients added to an Agent Protocol Covered Document and identified through a Platform as a New Client [and (b) in respect of any Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Documents, each Client which we name or identify through a Platform as being a Client in respect of which subparagraph 3(g)(ii)(B)(II) of the Protocol applies]”. You will be responsible for identifying any Clients on whose behalf you have entered into, or will enter into, a Protocol Covered Document, any New Clients and any Clients on whose behalf you amend Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Documents and, in each case, providing their LEIs. If you cannot or do not wish to name such Clients, then provided that you can identify the Clients by way of LEIs, you may identify such Clients using LEIs and without including any names. If you do not elect for Option 2 in this Adherence Letter, you should delete the wording in square brackets in the signature block.


Third, if you adhere to this Protocol as an agent on behalf of certain Clients only by excluding certain Clients, you may indicate the following in the signature block: “acting on behalf of [(a)] each fund, account or other principal (each, a “Client”) on whose behalf we have entered, or will enter, into a Protocol Covered Document (except for those Clients which we identify through a Platform as excluded from adherence) and any New Clients added to an Agent Protocol Covered Document (except for any New Clients which we identify through a Platform as excluded from adherence) [and (b) in respect of any Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Documents, each Client which we name or identify through a Platform as being a Client in respect of which subparagraph 3(g)(ii)(B)(II) of the Protocol applies]”. You will be responsible for identifying any excluded Clients and any Clients on whose behalf you amend Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Documents and, in each case, for providing their LEIs. If you cannot or do not wish to name those excluded Clients or those Clients on whose behalf you are amending Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Documents, then provided that you can identify them by way of LEIs, you may identify those Clients using LEIs and without including any names. If you do not elect for Option 2 in this Adherence Letter, you should delete the wording in square brackets in the signature block.


Fourth, if you adhere to this Protocol as an agent on behalf of no current Clients, you may indicate the following in the signature block: “acting to amend each Protocol Covered Document (or other agreement which deems a Protocol Covered Document to have been created) between it (as agent) and each Adhering Party, with respect to New Clients.”


*The election for Option 1 or Option 2 below should only be made by an Agent. Any entity which adheres to the Protocol and which is not acting as an Agent should not complete the election below.*

As between each Adhering Party and us, we acknowledge and agree that the amendments in the Attachment to the Protocol shall apply to each:


□ Protocol Covered Document into which we have entered on behalf of one or more Clients covered in accordance with the terms of the Protocol and this Adherence Letter (as contemplated by Option 1 in the Protocol); or


□ Protocol Covered Document into (i) which we have entered on behalf of one or more Clients covered in accordance with the terms of the Protocol and this Adherence Letter and (ii) which we did not enter on behalf of one or more Clients but which we otherwise have the authority from the relevant Client to amend in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Protocol and this Adherence Letter (as contemplated by Option 2 in the Protocol).


We agree, in our capacity as Agent for the relevant Client(s), to provide each other Adhering Party, as soon as reasonably practicable following such other Adhering Party's written request (including by email), and in any event by no later than the end of the fifteenth calendar day following such request (and as required by and in accordance with subparagraph 3(g)(iv) of the Protocol), with reasonable evidence satisfactory to such other Adhering Party in its sole discretion supporting our authority to amend any Protocol Covered Document into which we did not enter on behalf of one or more Clients (whose name or identity we communicate to the other Adhering Party through a Platform as being a Client in respect of which subparagraph 3(g)(ii)(B)(II) of the Protocol applies).


Failure to provide an Adhering Party with such evidence shall (unless the Agent is deemed to have provided such evidence, pursuant to subparagraph 3(g)(iv) of the Protocol), only in respect of those Non-Agent Executed Protocol Covered Documents between the relevant Client(s) and such Adhering Party, result in this Adherence Letter being ineffective unless and until we, in our capacity as Agent for the relevant Client(s), are deemed to have provided that Adhering Party with such evidence pursuant to subparagraph 3(g)(iv) of the Protocol. Failure to provide an Adhering Party with such evidence shall not give rise to a Potential Event of Default or an Event of Default (each as defined in the ISDA Master Agreement), or any similar event, under those Protocol Covered Documents or other contractual right of action under this Protocol or those Protocol Covered Documents.


Note 3: The descriptions of Option 1 and Option 2 in this Adherence Letter and of related provisions within the Protocol are intended for convenience of reference only. Adhering Parties should read the provisions of the Protocol before submitting an Adherence Letter. In the event of any inconsistency between the descriptions of Option 1 and Option 2 and related provisions in this Adherence Letter and the provisions of the Protocol, the provisions of the Protocol shall take precedence.


The purpose of this letter is to notify you that we wish to designate a Revocation Date as the last date on which an Implementation Date can occur pursuant to the terms of the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) on October 23, 2020 (the Protocol) in respect of any Protocol Covered Document between us and any other Adhering Party.


This letter constitutes a Revocation Notice as referred to in the Protocol.


We consent to the publication of the conformed copy of this notice by ISDA on and after the Revocation Date and to the disclosure by ISDA of the contents of this letter.


Note 4: Specify legal name of Adhering Party.


If you are an Agent and act on behalf of multiple Clients, you may sign a Revocation Notice using one of the methods below. Alternatively, you may submit one Revocation Notice per Client.


First, if you have the authority to deliver a Revocation Notice for this Protocol as Agent on behalf of all Clients, you may indicate the following in the signature block: “acting on behalf of each fund, account or other principal (each, a “Client”) represented by us (as agent)” or such other language which indicates the Clients to which this letter is applicable. If such a signature block is used, a separate Revocation Notice for each Client does not need to be submitted to ISDA and no specific names of Clients must be identified in the Revocation Notice.


Second, if you have the authority to deliver a Revocation Notice for this Protocol as Agent on behalf of certain Clients only, you may indicate the following in the signature block: “acting on behalf of each fund, account or other principal (each, a “Client”) represented by us (as agent) identified in the Revocation Notice or an appendix thereto”. If you cannot or do not wish to name such Clients, then provided that you can identify the revoking Clients by way of specific identifiers which will be known and recognized by allAdhering Parties with which the relevant Clients have entered into Confirmations, Master Agreements and/or credit support documents, you may identify such revoking Clients using specific identifiers and without including any names.

A Protocol Covered Document of the type described in subparagraph (b) of, respectively, the definition of Protocol Covered Confirmation, Protocol Covered Credit Support Document or Protocol Covered Master Agreement shall be amended so that the reference to the Relevant IBOR “as defined in”, or the reference to the Relevant IBOR as having the meaning given in, the Covered ISDA Definitions Booklet will instead be a reference to the relevant Rate Option in the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement (or, if there is more than one relevant Rate Option, the first relevant Rate Option in the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement) for the Relevant IBOR “as defined in the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement” (and, if that Protocol Covered Document is a Protocol Covered Master Agreement, any reference to the Relevant IBOR (as defined in that Protocol Covered Master Agreement) in a Confirmation which supplements, forms part of and is subject to that Protocol Covered Master Agreement will be a reference to the relevant Rate Option in the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement (or, if there is more than one relevant Rate Option, the first relevant Rate Option in the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement) for the Relevant IBOR “as defined in the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement”), provided that:


(a) If the Relevant IBOR is:


(i) “EUR-EURIBOR-Telerate”, it will be deemed to be a reference to “EUR-EURIBOR- Reuters”;


(ii) “AUD-BBR-ISDC”, it will be deemed to be a reference to “AUD-BBR-AUBBSW”;


(iii) “XEU-LIBOR-BBA”, it will be deemed to be a reference to “EUR-LIBOR-BBA”; and


(iv) “SGD-SOR-Telerate”, it will be deemed to be a reference to “SGD-SOR-VWAP”, in each case, as defined in the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement; and


(b) If the Relevant IBOR is “THB-THBFIX-Reuters” and the Covered ISDA Definitions Booklet is the 2000 ISDA Definitions, the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement shall be deemed amended in accordance with subparagraph 2(e) of this Attachment.


If a Protocol Covered Document is of the type described in subparagraph (c) of, respectively, the definition of Protocol Covered Confirmation, Protocol Covered Credit Support Document or Protocol Covered Master Agreement and, in each case, includes a reference to a Relevant IBOR pursuant to which the Relevant IBOR is required for any determination, and:


(a) (i) the Relevant IBOR which is required for that determination is neither the Singapore dollar swap offer rate nor the Thai baht interest rate fixing, (ii) the Relevant IBOR which is required for that determination has not been published by the source that is specified or otherwise ordinarily used to determine the level of the Relevant IBOR on the day on which it is required, and (iii) an Index Cessation Effective Date with respect to the Relevant IBOR has not occurred, then the reference to the Relevant IBOR will be deemed to be a reference to the rate as provided by the administrator of the Relevant IBOR and published by an authorized distributor of the Relevant IBOR or the administrator of the Relevant IBOR itself in respect of the day on which it is required. If neither an authorized distributor nor the administrator has published or provided the Relevant IBOR in respect of that day and an Index Cessation Effective Date with respect to the Relevant IBOR has not occurred, then, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the reference to the Relevant IBOR will be deemed to be a reference to:


(A) A rate formally recommended for use by the administrator of the Relevant IBOR; or


(B) A rate formally recommended for use by:


(I) If the Relevant IBOR which is required for that determination is Swiss franc LIBOR, the competent authority responsible for supervising that rate or the administrator of that rate;


(II) If the Relevant IBOR which is required for that determination is sterling LIBOR, euro LIBOR or the euro interbank offered rate, the supervisor which is responsible for supervising the Relevant IBOR or the administrator of the Relevant IBOR;


(III) If the Relevant IBOR which is required for that determination is Japanese yen LIBOR, the Japanese yen Tokyo interbank offered rate or the euroyen Tokyo interbank offered rate, a committee officially endorsed or convened by the Bank of Japan for the purposes of recommending an alternative rate for that Relevant IBOR (which rate may be produced by the Bank of Japan or another administrator) or any other supervisor which is responsible for supervising the Relevant IBOR or the administrator of the Relevant IBOR;


(IV) If the Relevant IBOR which is required for that determination is U.S. dollar LIBOR, the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or any other supervisor which is responsible for supervising the Relevant IBOR or the administrator of the Relevant IBOR; and


(V) If the Relevant IBOR which is required for that determination is the bank bill swap rate, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (or any successor to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in its role as supervisor of the bank bill swap rate),


In each case, during the period of non-publication of the Relevant IBOR and for so long as an Index Cessation Effective Date has not occurred. If a rate described in subparagraph (A) above is available, that rate shall apply. If no such rate is available but, in respect of the Relevant IBOR, a rate described in subparagraph (B) above, if applicable, is available, that rate shall apply. If neither a rate described in subparagraph (A) above is available nor a rate described in subparagraph (B) above, if applicable, is available, then the Calculation Agent shall determine a commercially reasonable alternative for the Relevant IBOR, taking into account any rate implemented by central counterparties and/or futures exchanges, in each case with trading volumes in derivatives or futures referencing the Relevant IBOR that the Calculation Agent considers sufficient for that rate to be a representative alternative rate.


If the Relevant IBOR is the Hong Kong interbank offered rate and the Protocol Covered Document provides that the Hong Kong Association of Banks' (or any successor's) typhoon and rainstorm arrangements (as published on the Hong Kong Association of Banks' website or on any successor website) apply, then those typhoon and rainstorm arrangements shall continue to apply and shall take precedence over the provisions of this paragraph 6(a);


(b) (i) The Relevant IBOR which is required for that determination is the Singapore dollar swap offer rate, (ii) the Singapore dollar swap offer rate has not been published by the source that is specified or otherwise ordinarily used to determine the level of the Singapore dollar swap offer rate on the day on which it is required and (iii) an Index Cessation Effective Date with respect to U.S. dollar LIBOR has not occurred, then the reference to the Singapore dollar swap offer rate will be deemed to be a reference to the substitute rate announced by ABS Benchmarks Administration Co Pte. Ltd. (or its successor as administrator or sponsor of that rate) in respect of the Singapore dollar swap offer rate.


If ABS Benchmarks Administration Co Pte. Ltd. (or its successor as administrator or sponsor of that rate) has not announced a substitute rate by 9:00 p.m., Singapore time, on the Relevant Original Fixing Date and an Index Cessation Effective Date with respect to U.S. dollar LIBOR has not occurred, then, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the reference to the Singapore dollar swap offer rate will be deemed to be a reference to:


(A) A rate formally recommended for use by the administrator of the Singapore dollar swap offer rate; or


(B) A rate formally recommended for use by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (or any other supervisor which is responsible for supervising the Singapore dollar swap offer rate or the administrator of the Singapore dollar swap offer rate) or a committee officially endorsed or convened by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (or any other supervisor which is responsible for supervising the Singapore dollar swap offer rate or the administrator of the Singapore dollar swap offer rate), in each case, during the period of non-publication of the Singapore dollar swap offer rate and for so long as an Index Cessation Effective Date with respect to U.S. dollar LIBOR has not occurred. If a rate described in subparagraph (A) above is available, that rate shall apply. If no such rate is available but a rate described in subparagraph (B) above is available, that rate shall apply. If neither a rate described in subparagraph (A) above nor a rate described in subparagraph (B) above is available, then the Calculation Agent shall determine a commercially reasonable alternative for the Singapore dollar swap offer rate, taking into account any rate implemented by central counterparties and/or futures exchanges, in each case with trading volumes in derivatives or futures referencing the Singapore dollar swap offer rate that the Calculation Agent considers sufficient for that rate to be a representative alternative rate;


(c) (i) the Relevant IBOR which is required for that determination is the Thai baht interest rate fixing, (ii) the Thai baht interest rate fixing has not been published by the source that is specified or otherwise ordinarily used to determine the level of the Thai baht interest rate fixing on the day on which it is required and (iii) an Index Cessation Effective Date with respect to U.S. dollar LIBOR has not occurred, then the reference to the Thai baht interest rate fixing will be deemed to be a reference to “THB-THBFIX-Reference Banks” (as defined in the 2006 ISDA Definitions) but with the references to (A) “Reset Date” being replaced by “the day on which the rate is required”; (B) “Designated Maturity” being replaced by “the period of time in respect of which the Thai baht interest rate fixing is to be determined”; (C) “Calculation Period” being replaced by “period”; and (D) “Representative Amount” being replaced by “an amount that is representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time”. If the rate cannot be determined pursuant to “THB-THBFIX-Reference Banks” (as defined in the 2006 ISDA Definitions) andan Index Cessation Effective Date with respect to U.S. dollar LIBOR has not occurred, the rate will be determined by the Calculation Agent taking into consideration all available information that in good faith it deems relevant;


(d) Subject to paragraphs 6(e), (f) and (g) below, an Index Cessation Event has occurred with respect to the Relevant IBOR (or, if the Relevant IBOR is either the Singapore dollar swap offer rate or the Thai baht interest rate fixing, with respect to U.S. dollar LIBOR), then the reference to the Relevant IBOR will be deemed to be a reference to the Applicable Fallback Rate from and including either the Index Cessation Effective Date or, if the Relevant IBOR is observed on a day that is a period of time prior to the date for which the Relevant IBOR is set, such period of time following the Index Cessation Effective Date, provided that:


(i) If the Applicable Fallback Rate is Fallback Rate (SONIA), Fallback Rate (SARON), Fallback Rate (SOFR), Fallback Rate (EuroSTR), Fallback Rate (TONA), Fallback Rate (AONIA), Fallback Rate (CORRA), Fallback Rate (HONIA), Fallback Rate (SOR) or Fallback Rate (THBFIX), then the rate for the Relevant Original Fixing Date will be the Applicable Fallback Rate for the `Original IBOR Rate Record Day' (or, if Fallback Rate (SOR) or Fallback Rate (THBFIX) is the Applicable Fallback Rate, for the `Original SOR Rate Record Day' or `Original THBFIX Rate Record Day', as applicable) that corresponds to the Relevant Original Fixing Date, as most recently provided or published as at the Applicable Cut-off Time. If neither the provider of the Applicable Fallback Rate (or a successor provider, which, if the Applicable Fallback Rate is Fallback Rate (SONIA), Fallback Rate (SARON), Fallback Rate (SOFR), Fallback Rate (EuroSTR), Fallback Rate (TONA), Fallback Rate (AONIA), Fallback Rate (CORRA) or Fallback Rate (HONIA), is approved and/or appointed by ISDA from time to time) provides, nor any authorized distributors publish, the Applicable Fallback Rate for that `Original IBOR Rate Record Day' (or that `Original SOR Rate Record Day' or `Original THBFIX Rate Record Day', as applicable) at, or prior to, the Applicable Cut-off Time and a Fallback Index Cessation Effective Date with respect to that Applicable Fallback Rate has not occurred, then the rate for the Relevant Original Fixing Date will be the Applicable Fallback Rate as most recently provided or published at the Applicable Cut-off Time for the most recent `Original IBOR Rate Record Day' (or `Original SOR Rate Record Day' or `Original THBFIX Rate Record Day', as applicable), notwithstanding that such day does not correspond to the Relevant Original Fixing Date;


(ii) If (A) the Applicable Fallback Rate is SONIA, the GBP Recommended Rate, SARON, the NWG Recommended Rate, the Modified SNB Policy Rate, SOFR, the Fed Recommended Rate, OBFR, the FOMC Target Rate, EuroSTR, the ECB Recommended Rate, Modified EDFR, TONA, the JPY Recommended Rate, AONIA, the RBA Recommended Rate, CORRA, the CAD Recommended Rate, the BOC Target Rate, HONIA, the HKD Recommended Rate, the MAS Recommended Rate, SORA, the BOT Recommended Rate or THOR, (B) neither the administrator provides nor authorized distributors publish that Applicable Fallback Rate (or if the Applicable Fallback Rate is the Modified SNB Policy Rate or Modified EDFR, the index, benchmark or other price source that is referred to in the definition thereof) and (C) a Fallback Index Cessation Effective Date with respect to that Applicable Fallback Rate has not occurred, then, in respect of any day for which that Applicable Fallback Rate is required, references to that Applicable Fallback Rate will be deemed to be references to the last provided or published Applicable Fallback Rate. If the Applicable Fallback Rate is the Modified SNB Policy Rate or Modified EDFR, references to that Applicable Fallback Rate in subparagraph 6(d)(ii)(C) above shall be deemed to be references to the index, benchmark or other price source that is referred to in the definition of Modified SNB Policy Rate or Modified EDFR, as applicable; and


(iii) If the Applicable Fallback Rate is UK Bank Rate, in respect of any day for which the UK Bank Rate is required, references to the UK Bank Rate will be deemed to be references to the last provided or published UK Bank Rate as at close of business in London on that day.


If the Relevant IBOR is the Singapore dollar swap offer rate or the Thai baht interest rate fixing, an Index Cessation Event with respect to U.S. dollar LIBOR will also occur if the Relevant IBOR in the relevant tenor (which under the 2006 ISDA Definitions would be equivalent to the “Designated Maturity”) has not been published by the source that is specified or otherwise ordinarily used to determine the level of the Relevant IBOR and, as of the Relevant Original Fixing Date, U.S. dollar LIBOR in the relevant tenor (which under the 2006 ISDA Definitions would be equivalent to the “Designated Maturity”) has been permanently discontinued or is Non-Representative and there is either no U.S. dollar LIBOR which has not been permanently discontinued and which is not Non-Representative for a period which is longer than that relevant tenor or no U.S. dollar LIBOR which has not been permanently discontinued and which is not Non-Representative for a period which is shorter than that relevant tenor. The related Index Cessation Effective Date shall be the first date on which there is no such longer or shorter rate or, if later, the first date on which U.S. dollar LIBOR in the relevant tenor (which under the 2006 ISDA Definitions would be equivalent to the “Designated Maturity”) is permanently unavailable or Non-Representative.


For the purposes of this paragraph 6(d), references to an “Original IBOR Rate Record Day”, “Original SOR Rate Record Day” and “Original THBFIX Rate Record Day” are to that term as used on the Fallback Rate Screen. For the purposes of the immediately preceding paragraph above, (A) references to a rate being “permanently discontinued” or “permanently unavailable” shall be deemed to be references to such rate being permanently discontinued or permanently unavailable following a public statement or publication of information which would constitute an Index Cessation Event in accordance with subparagraphs (a) and (b) of the definition thereof in respect of that rate in the relevant tenor and (B) references to “U.S. dollar LIBOR” in the definition of “Non-Representative” shall be deemed to be references to the relevant tenor of U.S. dollar LIBOR;
