(a) *Advice by person served.* Any person (including any officer, employee, or agent of the Board or any Reserve Bank) who is served with a subpoena, order, or other judicial or administrative process requiring the production of confidential supervisory information or other nonpublic information of the Board or requiring the person's testimony regarding such Board information in any proceeding, shall:


(1) Promptly inform the Board's General Counsel of the service and all relevant facts, including the documents, information or testimony demanded, and any facts relevant to the Board in determining whether the material requested should be made available;


(2) Inform the entity issuing the process of the substance of these rules and, in particular, of the obligation to follow the request procedures in ยง 261.23(b); and


(3) At the appropriate time inform the court or tribunal that issued the process of the substance of these rules.


(b) *Appearance by person served.* Unless authorized by the Board or as ordered by a Federal court in a judicial proceeding in which the Board has had the opportunity to appear and oppose discovery, any person who is required to respond to a subpoena or other legal process concerning Board confidential supervisory information or other nonpublic Board information shall attend at the time and place required and respectfully decline to disclose or to give any testimony with respect to the information, basing such refusal upon the provisions of this regulation. If the court or other body orders the disclosure of the information or the giving of testimony, the person having the information shall continue to decline to disclose the information and shall promptly report the facts to the Board for such action as the Board may deem appropriate.


(c) *Civil requests for production.* A litigant or non-party who is served with a civil request for production of documents calling for production of confidential supervisory information should proceed under ยง 261.23 rather than this section.
