(1) The ruling involves a controlling question of law or policy as to which substantial grounds exist for a difference of opinion;


(2) Immediate review of the ruling may materially advance the ultimate termination of the proceeding;


(3) Subsequent modification of the ruling at the conclusion of the proceeding would be an inadequate remedy; or

Upon the expiration of the time for filing all responses, the ALJ will refer the matter to the Board for final disposition.


(d) *Suspension of proceeding.* Neither a request for interlocutory review nor any disposition of such a request by the Board under this section suspends or stays the proceeding unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ or the Board.
