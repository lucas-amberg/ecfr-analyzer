(a) *Form of petition.* Unless otherwise ordered by the Board, a petition for reinstatement by an independent public accountant, an accounting firm, or an office of a firm that was removed, suspended, or debarred under ยง 263.402 may be made in writing at any time. The request shall contain a concise statement of the action requested. The Board may require the petitioner to submit additional information.

The accountant or firm shall bear the burden of going forward with a petition and proving the grounds asserted in support of the petition.
