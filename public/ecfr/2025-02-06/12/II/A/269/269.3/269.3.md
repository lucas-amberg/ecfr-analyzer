# ยง 269.3   Recognition of a labor organization and its relationship to a Federal Reserve Bank.

(a) Any labor organization shall be recognized as the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees in an appropriate unit of a Bank when that organization has been selected by the employees in said unit pursuant to the procedure set forth in ยง 269.5. A unit may be established in a Bank on any basis which will ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees concerned, and will promote effective relationships and the efficiency of the Bank's operations, but no unit shall be established solely on the basis of the extent to which a labor organization or employees in the proposed unit may have sought organization.


(b) When a labor organization has been recognized as the exclusive representative of employees in an appropriate unit, it shall be entitled to act for and to negotiate agreements in good faith covering all employees in the unit, and it shall be responsible for representing the interests of all such employees without discrimination and without regard to whether they are members of that labor organization or not, provided that nothing in this Policy shall prevent an employee from adjusting his or her grievance without the intervention of the recognized labor organization. The labor organization shall be given notice of the adjustment and a reasonable opportunity to object on the sole ground that it is in conflict with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.


(c) A Bank, through appropriate officials, shall have the obligation to meet at reasonable times with representatives of a recognized labor organization to negotiate, in good faith, with respect to personnel policies and practices affecting working conditions for employees, provided that they do not involve matters in any of the following areas:


(1) The purposes and functions of the Bank; the compensation of and hours worked by employees; any classification system used to evaluate positions; the budget of the Bank; the retirement system; any insurance or other benefit plans; internal security operations; maintenance of the efficiency of Bank operations including the determination of work methods; the right to contract out; the determination as to manpower requirements; use of technology and organization of work; and action to meet emergency situations;


(2) Management rights as to the direction of employees, including hiring, promotion, transfer, classification, assignment, layoffs, retention, suspension, demotion, discipline and discharge, provided that on matters involving the procedures to be followed by a Bank for the exercise of its rights under this subparagraph, a Bank shall, upon request, discuss such procedures with a recognized labor organization, but shall not be required to negotiate for an agreement as to them;


(3) All Bank matters specifically governed by applicable laws or regulations.


(d) At the time it requests an election to be held, any labor organization seeking recognition shall submit to a Bank a roster of its officers and representatives, a copy of its constitution and bylaws, and a statement of its objectives.


(e) Subject to the provisions of ยง 269.8, the exclusive recognition of a labor organization shall not preclude any employee, regardless of labor organization membership, from bringing matters of personal concern not governed by a collective bargaining agreement to the attention of appropriate officers, managers or supervisory personnel in accordance with applicable law, rule, regulation, or established Bank policy, or from choosing his or her own representative in such matters.
