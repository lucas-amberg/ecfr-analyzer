# § 269b.220   Priority; acceleration of proceedings.

(a) A charge of “refusal to bargain” or a charge that, if sustained, would require the setting aside of an election or the conduct of a new election shall be given priority. 


(b) The parties, individually or jointly, may petition the panel at any time to invoke immediately the formal hearing procedures set forth in § 269b.410. They may also petition the panel to entertain the matter itself without prior investigation and/or without the formal hearing procedure set forth in § 269b.410. The panel is empowered also on its own motion to so accelerate disposition of the case. 


(c) Before accelerating a case the panel may utilize whatever proceedings it may deem appropriate and timely to allow parties in interest to comment on the proposed course of action.
