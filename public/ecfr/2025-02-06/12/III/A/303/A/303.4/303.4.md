# ยง 303.4   Computation of time.

For purposes of this part, and except as otherwise specifically provided, the FDIC begins computing the relevant period on the day after an event occurs (e.g., the day after a substantially complete filing is received by the FDIC or the day after publication begins) through the last day of the relevant period. When the last day is a Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday, the period runs until the end of the next business day.
