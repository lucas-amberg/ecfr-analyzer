(b) *Content of filing.* Applications shall describe the proposal, state the date the institution's capital restoration plan was accepted by its primary Federal regulator, describe the institution's status in implementing the plan, and explain how the proposed action is consistent with and will further the achievement of the plan or otherwise further the purposes of section 38 of the FDI Act.
