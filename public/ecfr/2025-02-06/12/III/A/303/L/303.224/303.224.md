# ยง 303.224   What constitutes a pretrial diversion or similar program under section 19?

(a) The term *pretrial diversion or similar program* (program entry) means a program characterized by a suspension or eventual dismissal or reversal of charges or criminal prosecution upon agreement by the accused to restitution, drug or alcohol rehabilitation, anger management, or community service. Whether the outcome of a case constitutes a program entry is determined by relevant Federal, State, or local law, and, if not so designated under applicable law, then the determination of whether a disposition is a program entry will be made by the FDIC on a case-by-case basis. Program entries prior to November 29, 1990, are not covered by section 19.


(b) When a Covered Offense either is reduced by a program entry to an offense that would otherwise not be covered by section 19 or is dismissed upon successful completion of a program entry, the offense remains a Covered Offense for purposes of section 19. The Covered Offense will require an application unless it is *de minimis* as provided by ยง 303.227.


(c) Expungements, dismissals, or sealings of program entries will be treated the same as those for convictions.
