# § 303.231   Waiting time for a subsequent application if an application is denied.

(a) An application under section 19 must be made in writing and may not be made less than one year following the issuance of a decision denying an application under section 19. If the original denial is subject to a request for a hearing or written submissions in lieu of a hearing, then the subsequent application may be filed at any time more than one year after the decision of the FDIC Board of Directors, or its designee, denying the application. Unless with the passage of time the individual is no longer subject to section 19, the prohibition against participating in the affairs of an IDI under section 19 will continue until the individual has been granted consent in writing to participate in the affairs of an IDI by the Board of Directors or its designee.


(b) An institution-sponsored application is not subject to the one-year waiting period if the application—


(1) Follows the denial of an individual application; or


(2) Follows the denial of an institution-sponsored application and the subsequent application is sponsored by a different institution or is for a different position.
