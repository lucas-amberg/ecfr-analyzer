(a) Any application to the ALJ for an order or ruling must be by motion. Motions must state the relief sought, the authority relied upon, and the facts alleged, and must be filed with the ALJ and served on all other parties. Motions may include, without limitation, motions for summary judgment. 


(b) Except for motions made during a prehearing conference or at the hearing, all motions must be in writing. The ALJ may require that oral motions be reduced to writing. 


(c) Within 15 days after a written motion is served, or any other time as may be fixed by the ALJ, any party may file a response to such motion. 


(d) The ALJ may not grant a written motion before the time for filing responses thereto has expired, except upon consent of the parties or following a hearing on the motion, but may overrule or deny such motion without awaiting a response. 


(e) The ALJ will make a reasonable effort to dispose of all outstanding motions prior to the beginning of the hearing.
