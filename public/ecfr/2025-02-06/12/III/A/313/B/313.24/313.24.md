# ยง 313.24   Omission of procedures.

The FDIC shall not be required to follow the procedures described in ยง 313.25 where:


(a) The offset is in the nature of a recoupment (*i.e.,* the FDIC may offset a payment due to the debtor when both the payment due to the debtor and the debt owed to the FDIC arose from the same transaction); or


(b) The debt arises under a contract as set forth in *Cecile Industries, Inc.* v. *Cheney,* 995 F.2d 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1993), which provides that procedural protections under administrative offset do not supplant or restrict established procedures for contractual offsets accommodated by the Contracts Disputes Act; or


(c) In the case of non-centralized administrative offsets, the FDIC first learns of the existence of a debt due when there would be insufficient time to afford the debtor due process under these procedures before the paying agency makes payment to the debtor; in such cases, the Director shall give the debtor notice and an opportunity for review as soon as practical and shall refund any money ultimately found not to be due to the U.S. Government.
