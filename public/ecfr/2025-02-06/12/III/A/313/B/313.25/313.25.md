# ยง 313.25   Debtor's rights.

Unless the procedures described in ยง 313.23 are used, prior to collecting any claim by administrative offset or referring such claim to another agency for collection through administrative offset, the Director shall provide the debtor with the following:


(a) Written notification of the nature and amount of the claim, the intention of the Director to collect the claim through administrative offset, and a statement of the rights of the debtor under this paragraph;


(b) An opportunity to inspect and copy the records of the FDIC with respect to the claim, unless such records are exempt from disclosure;


(c) An opportunity to have the FDIC's determination of indebtedness reviewed by the Director:


(1) Any request by the debtor for such review shall be in writing and shall be submitted to the FDIC within 30 calendar days of the date of the notice of the offset. The Director may waive the time limit for requesting review for good cause shown by the debtor;


(2) Upon acceptance of a request for review by the debtor, the FDIC shall provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the determination turns on an issue of credibility or veracity, or the Director determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence alone. Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing under this section is not required to be a formal evidentiary hearing, although the Director shall document all significant matters discussed at the hearing. In cases where an oral hearing is not required by this section, the Director shall make his determination based on a documentary hearing consisting of a review of the written record; and


(d) An opportunity to enter into a written agreement for the voluntary repayment of the amount of the claim at the discretion of the Director.
