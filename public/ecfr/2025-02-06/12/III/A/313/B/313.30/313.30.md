# ยง 313.30   Requests for offset from other federal agencies.

Any federal agency may request that funds due and payable to its debtor by the FDIC be administratively offset by the FDIC in order to collect a debt owed to such agency by the debtor. The FDIC shall initiate the requested offset only upon: 


(a) Receipt of written certification from the creditor agency stating: 


(1) That the debtor owes the debt; 


(2) The amount and basis of the debt; and 


(3) That the agency has complied with its own administrative offset regulations and with the applicable provisions of 31 CFR 901.3, including providing any required hearing or review. 


(b) A determination by the creditor agency that collection by offset against funds payable by the FDIC would be in the best interest of the United States and that such offset would not otherwise be contrary to law.
