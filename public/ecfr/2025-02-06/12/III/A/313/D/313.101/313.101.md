# § 313.101   Right of action.

The FDIC may sue any employer for any amount that the employer fails to withhold from wages owed and payable to its employee in accordance with this subpart. However, a suit will not be filed before the termination of the collection action involving a particular debtor, unless earlier filing is necessary to avoid expiration of any applicable statute of limitations. For purposes of this subpart, “termination of the collection action” occurs when the agency has terminated collection action in accordance with the FCCS (31 CFR 903.1 through 903.5) or other applicable standards. In any event, termination of the collection action will have been deemed to occur if the FDIC has not received any payments to satisfy the debt from the particular debtor whose wages were subject to garnishment, in whole or in part, for a period of one (1) year.
