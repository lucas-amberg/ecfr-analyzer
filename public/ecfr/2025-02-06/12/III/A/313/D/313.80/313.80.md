# ยง 313.80   Scope and purpose.

(a) These administrative wage garnishment regulations are issued in compliance with 31 U.S.C. 3720D and 31 CFR 285.11(f). The subpart provides procedures for the FDIC to collect money from a debtor's disposable pay by means of administrative wage garnishment. The receipt of payments pursuant to this subpart does not preclude the FDIC from pursuing other debt collection remedies, including the offset of federal payments. The FDIC may pursue such debt collection remedies separately or in conjunction with administrative wage garnishment. This subpart does not apply to the collection of delinquent debts from the wages of federal employees from their federal employment. Federal pay is subject to the federal salary offset procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and other applicable laws.
