(a) Upon receipt of the garnishment order issued under this section, the employer shall deduct from all disposable pay paid to the debtor during each pay period the amount of garnishment described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. 


(b) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the amount of garnishment shall be the lesser of: 


(1) The amount indicated on the garnishment order up to 15% of the debtor's disposable pay; or 


(2) The amount set forth in 15 U.S.C. 1673(a)(2). The amount set forth at 15 U.S.C. 1673(a)(2) is the amount by which the debtor's disposable pay exceeds an amount equivalent to thirty times the minimum wage. See 29 CFR 870.10. 


(c) When a debtor's pay is subject to withholding orders with priority, the following shall apply: 


(1) Unless otherwise provided by federal law, withholding orders issued under this section shall be paid in the amounts set forth under paragraph (b) of this section and shall have priority over other withholding orders which are served later in time. However, withholding orders for family support shall have priority over withholding orders issued under this section. 


(2) If amounts are being withheld from a debtor's pay pursuant to a withholding order served on an employer before a withholding order issued pursuant to this section, or if a withholding order for family support is served on an employer at any time, the amounts withheld pursuant to the withholding order issued under this section shall be the lesser of: 


(i) The amount calculated under paragraph (b) of this section; or 


(ii) An amount equal to 25% of the debtor's disposable pay less the amount(s) withheld under the withholding order(s) with priority. 


(3) If a debtor owes more than one debt to the FDIC, the FDIC may issue multiple withholding orders. The total amount garnished from the debtor's pay for such orders will not exceed the amount set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. 


(d) An amount greater than that set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section may be withheld upon the written consent of the debtor. 


(e) The employer shall promptly pay to the FDIC all amounts withheld in accordance with the withholding order issued pursuant to this section. 


(f) An employer shall not be required to vary its normal pay and disbursement cycles in order to comply with the withholding order. 


(g) Any assignment or allotment by the employee of the employee's earnings shall be void to the extent it interferes with or prohibits execution of the withholding order under this section, except for any assignment or allotment made pursuant to a family support judgment or order. 


(h) The employer shall withhold the appropriate amount from the debtor's wages for each pay period until the employer receives notification from the FDIC to discontinue wage withholding. The garnishment order shall indicate a reasonable period of time within which the employer is required to commence wage withholding.
