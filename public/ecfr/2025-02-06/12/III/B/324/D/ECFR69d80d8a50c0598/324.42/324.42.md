# § 324.42   Risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures.

(a) *Securitization risk weight approaches.* Except as provided elsewhere in this section or in § 324.41:


(1) An FDIC-supervised institution must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from a securitization and apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to the portion of a CEIO that does not constitute after-tax gain-on-sale.


(2) If a securitization exposure does not require deduction under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an FDIC-supervised institution may assign a risk weight to the securitization exposure using the simplified supervisory formula approach (SSFA) in accordance with §§ 324.43(a) through 324.43(d) and subject to the limitation under paragraph (e) of this section. Alternatively, an FDIC-supervised institution that is not subject to subpart F of this part may assign a risk weight to the securitization exposure using the gross-up approach in accordance with § 324.43(e), provided, however, that such FDIC-supervised institution must apply either the SSFA or the gross-up approach consistently across all of its securitization exposures, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(3), and (a)(4) of this section.


(3) If a securitization exposure does not require deduction under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the FDIC-supervised institution cannot, or chooses not to apply the SSFA or the gross-up approach to the exposure, the FDIC-supervised institution must assign a risk weight to the exposure as described in § 324.44.


(4) If a securitization exposure is a derivative contract (other than protection provided by an FDIC-supervised institution in the form of a credit derivative) that has a first priority claim on the cash flows from the underlying exposures (notwithstanding amounts due under interest rate or currency derivative contracts, fees due, or other similar payments), an FDIC-supervised institution may choose to set the risk-weighted asset amount of the exposure equal to the amount of the exposure as determined in paragraph (c) of this section.


(b) *Total risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures.* An FDIC-supervised institution's total risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures equals the sum of the risk-weighted asset amount for securitization exposures that the FDIC-supervised institution risk weights under §§ 324.41(c), 324.42(a)(1), and 324.43, 324.44, or 324.45, and paragraphs (e) through (j) of this section, as applicable.


(c) *Exposure amount of a securitization exposure*—(1) *On-balance sheet securitization exposures.* The exposure amount of an on-balance sheet securitization exposure (excluding an available-for-sale or held-to-maturity security where the FDIC-supervised institution has made an AOCI opt-out election under § 324.22(b)(2), a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, OTC derivative contract, or cleared transaction) is equal to the carrying value of the exposure.


(2) *On-balance sheet securitization exposures held by an FDIC-supervised institution that has made an AOCI opt-out election.* The exposure amount of an on-balance sheet securitization exposure that is an available-for-sale or held-to-maturity security held by an FDIC-supervised institution that has made an AOCI opt-out election under § 324.22(b)(2) is the FDIC-supervised institution's carrying value (including net accrued but unpaid interest and fees), less any net unrealized gains on the exposure and plus any net unrealized losses on the exposure.


(3) *Off-balance sheet securitization exposures.* (i) Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, the exposure amount of an off-balance sheet securitization exposure that is not a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, cleared transaction (other than a credit derivative), or an OTC derivative contract (other than a credit derivative) is the notional amount of the exposure. For an off-balance sheet securitization exposure to an ABCP program, such as an eligible ABCP liquidity facility, the notional amount may be reduced to the maximum potential amount that the FDIC-supervised institution could be required to fund given the ABCP program's current underlying assets (calculated without regard to the current credit quality of those assets).


(ii) An FDIC-supervised institution must determine the exposure amount of an eligible ABCP liquidity facility for which the SSFA does not apply by multiplying the notional amount of the exposure by a CCF of 50 percent.


(iii) An FDIC-supervised institution must determine the exposure amount of an eligible ABCP liquidity facility for which the SSFA applies by multiplying the notional amount of the exposure by a CCF of 100 percent.


(4) *Repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, and derivative contracts.* The exposure amount of a securitization exposure that is a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, or derivative contract (other than a credit derivative) is the exposure amount of the transaction as calculated under § 324.34 or § 324.37, as applicable.


(d) *Overlapping exposures.* If an FDIC-supervised institution has multiple securitization exposures that provide duplicative coverage to the underlying exposures of a securitization (such as when an FDIC-supervised institution provides a program-wide credit enhancement and multiple pool-specific liquidity facilities to an ABCP program), the FDIC-supervised institution is not required to hold duplicative risk-based capital against the overlapping position. Instead, the FDIC-supervised institution may apply to the overlapping position the applicable risk-based capital treatment that results in the highest risk-based capital requirement.


(e) *Implicit support.* If an FDIC-supervised institution provides support to a securitization in excess of the FDIC-supervised institution's contractual obligation to provide credit support to the securitization (implicit support):


(1) The FDIC-supervised institution must include in risk-weighted assets all of the underlying exposures associated with the securitization as if the exposures had not been securitized and must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the securitization; and


(2) The FDIC-supervised institution must disclose publicly:


(i) That it has provided implicit support to the securitization; and


(ii) The risk-based capital impact to the FDIC-supervised institution of providing such implicit support.


(f) *Undrawn portion of a servicer cash advance facility.* (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, an FDIC-supervised institution that is a servicer under an eligible servicer cash advance facility is not required to hold risk-based capital against potential future cash advance payments that it may be required to provide under the contract governing the facility.


(2) For an FDIC-supervised institution that acts as a servicer, the exposure amount for a servicer cash advance facility that is not an eligible servicer cash advance facility is equal to the amount of all potential future cash advance payments that the FDIC-supervised institution may be contractually required to provide during the subsequent 12 month period under the contract governing the facility.


(g) *Interest-only mortgage-backed securities.* Regardless of any other provisions in this subpart, the risk weight for a non-credit-enhancing interest-only mortgage-backed security may not be less than 100 percent.


(h) *Small-business loans and leases on personal property transferred with retained contractual exposure.* (1) Regardless of any other provision of this subpart, an FDIC-supervised institution that has transferred small-business loans and leases on personal property (small-business obligations) with recourse must include in risk-weighted assets only its contractual exposure to the small-business obligations if all the following conditions are met:


(i) The transaction must be treated as a sale under GAAP.


(ii) The FDIC-supervised institution establishes and maintains, pursuant to GAAP, a non-capital reserve sufficient to meet the FDIC-supervised institution's reasonably estimated liability under the contractual obligation.


(iii) The small-business obligations are to businesses that meet the criteria for a small-business concern established by the Small Business Administration under section 3(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632 et seq.).


(iv) The FDIC-supervised institution is well capitalized, as defined in subpart H of this part. For purposes of determining whether an FDIC-supervised institution is well capitalized for purposes of this paragraph (h), the FDIC-supervised institution's capital ratios must be calculated without regard to the capital treatment for transfers of small-business obligations under this paragraph (h).


(2) The total outstanding amount of contractual exposure retained by an FDIC-supervised institution on transfers of small-business obligations receiving the capital treatment specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section cannot exceed 15 percent of the FDIC-supervised institution's total capital.


(3) If an FDIC-supervised institution ceases to be well capitalized under subpart H of this part or exceeds the 15 percent capital limitation provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, the capital treatment under paragraph (h)(1) of this section will continue to apply to any transfers of small-business obligations with retained contractual exposure that occurred during the time that the FDIC-supervised institution was well capitalized and did not exceed the capital limit.


(4) The risk-based capital ratios of the FDIC-supervised institution must be calculated without regard to the capital treatment for transfers of small-business obligations specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section for purposes of:


(i) Determining whether an FDIC-supervised institution is adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized under subpart H of this part; and


(ii) Reclassifying a well-capitalized FDIC-supervised institution to adequately capitalized and requiring an adequately capitalized FDIC-supervised institution to comply with certain mandatory or discretionary supervisory actions as if the FDIC-supervised institution were in the next lower prompt-corrective-action category.


(i) *Nth-to-default credit derivatives*—(1) *Protection provider.* An FDIC-supervised institution may assign a risk weight using the SSFA in § 324.43 to an n
th-to-default credit derivative in accordance with this paragraph (i). An FDIC-supervised institution must determine its exposure in the nth-to-default credit derivative as the largest notional amount of all the underlying exposures.


(2) For purposes of determining the risk weight for an nth-to-default credit derivative using the SSFA, the FDIC-supervised institution must calculate the attachment point and detachment point of its exposure as follows:


(i) The attachment point (parameter A) is the ratio of the sum of the notional amounts of all underlying exposures that are subordinated to the FDIC-supervised institution's exposure to the total notional amount of all underlying exposures. The ratio is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. In the case of a first-to-default credit derivative, there are no underlying exposures that are subordinated to the FDIC-supervised institution's exposure. In the case of a second-or-subsequent-to-default credit derivative, the smallest (n-1) notional amounts of the underlying exposure(s) are subordinated to the FDIC-supervised institution's exposure.


(ii) The detachment point (parameter D) equals the sum of parameter A plus the ratio of the notional amount of the FDIC-supervised institution's exposure in the nth-to-default credit derivative to the total notional amount of all underlying exposures. The ratio is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.


(3) An FDIC-supervised institution that does not use the SSFA to determine a risk weight for its nth-to-default credit derivative must assign a risk weight of 1,250 percent to the exposure.


(4) *Protection purchaser*—(i) *First-to-default credit derivatives.* An FDIC-supervised institution that obtains credit protection on a group of underlying exposures through a first-to-default credit derivative that meets the rules of recognition of § 324.36(b) must determine its risk-based capital requirement for the underlying exposures as if the FDIC-supervised institution synthetically securitized the underlying exposure with the smallest risk-weighted asset amount and had obtained no credit risk mitigant on the other underlying exposures. An FDIC-supervised institution must calculate a risk-based capital requirement for counterparty credit risk according to § 324.34 for a first-to-default credit derivative that does not meet the rules of recognition of § 324.36(b).


(ii) *Second-or-subsequent-to-default credit derivatives.* (A) An FDIC-supervised institution that obtains credit protection on a group of underlying exposures through a nth-to-default credit derivative that meets the rules of recognition of § 324.36(b) (other than a first-to-default credit derivative) may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of the derivative only if:


(*1*) The FDIC-supervised institution also has obtained credit protection on the same underlying exposures in the form of first-through-(n-1)-to-default credit derivatives; or


(*2*) If n-1 of the underlying exposures have already defaulted.


(B) If an FDIC-supervised institution satisfies the requirements of paragraph (i)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, the FDIC-supervised institution must determine its risk-based capital requirement for the underlying exposures as if the FDIC-supervised institution had only synthetically securitized the underlying exposure with the nth smallest risk-weighted asset amount and had obtained no credit risk mitigant on the other underlying exposures.


(C) An FDIC-supervised institution must calculate a risk-based capital requirement for counterparty credit risk according to § 324.34 for a nth-to-default credit derivative that does not meet the rules of recognition of § 324.36(b).


(j) *Guarantees and credit derivatives other than nth-to-default credit derivatives*—(1) *Protection provider.* For a guarantee or credit derivative (other than an nth-to-default credit derivative) provided by an FDIC-supervised institution that covers the full amount or a pro rata share of a securitization exposure's principal and interest, the FDIC-supervised institution must risk weight the guarantee or credit derivative as if it holds the portion of the reference exposure covered by the guarantee or credit derivative.


(2) *Protection purchaser.* (i) An FDIC-supervised institution that purchases a guarantee or OTC credit derivative (other than an nth-to-default credit derivative) that is recognized under § 324.45 as a credit risk mitigant (including via collateral recognized under § 324.37) is not required to compute a separate counterparty credit risk capital requirement under § 324.31, in accordance with § 324.34(c).


(ii) If an FDIC-supervised institution cannot, or chooses not to, recognize a purchased credit derivative as a credit risk mitigant under § 324.45, the FDIC-supervised institution must determine the exposure amount of the credit derivative under § 324.34.


(A) If the FDIC-supervised institution purchases credit protection from a counterparty that is not a securitization SPE, the FDIC-supervised institution must determine the risk weight for the exposure according to this subpart D.


(B) If the FDIC-supervised institution purchases the credit protection from a counterparty that is a securitization SPE, the FDIC-supervised institution must determine the risk weight for the exposure according to section § 324.42, including § 324.42(a)(4) for a credit derivative that has a first priority claim on the cash flows from the underlying exposures of the securitization SPE (notwithstanding amounts due under interest rate or currency derivative contracts, fees due, or other similar payments).
