(a) If an FDIC-supervised institution does not qualify to use or does not have qualifying operational risk mitigants, the FDIC-supervised institution's dollar risk-based capital requirement for operational risk is its operational risk exposure minus eligible operational risk offsets (if any).


(b) If an FDIC-supervised institution qualifies to use operational risk mitigants and has qualifying operational risk mitigants, the FDIC-supervised institution's dollar risk-based capital requirement for operational risk is the greater of:


(1) The FDIC-supervised institution's operational risk exposure adjusted for qualifying operational risk mitigants minus eligible operational risk offsets (if any); or


(2) 0.8 multiplied by the difference between:


(i) The FDIC-supervised institution's operational risk exposure; and


(ii) Eligible operational risk offsets (if any).


(c) The FDIC-supervised institution's risk-weighted asset amount for operational risk equals the FDIC-supervised institution's dollar risk-based capital requirement for operational risk determined under sections 162(a) or (b) multiplied by 12.5.
