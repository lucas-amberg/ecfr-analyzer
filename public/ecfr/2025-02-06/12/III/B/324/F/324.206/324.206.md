# ยง 324.206   Stressed VaR-based measure.

(a) *General requirement.* At least weekly, an FDIC-supervised institution must use the same internal model(s) used to calculate its VaR-based measure to calculate a stressed VaR-based measure.


(b) *Quantitative requirements for stressed VaR-based measure.* (1) An FDIC-supervised institution must calculate a stressed VaR-based measure for its covered positions using the same model(s) used to calculate the VaR-based measure, subject to the same confidence level and holding period applicable to the VaR-based measure under ยง 324.205, but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a continuous 12-month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the FDIC-supervised institution's current portfolio.


(2) The stressed VaR-based measure must be calculated at least weekly and be no less than the FDIC-supervised institution's VaR-based measure.


(3) An FDIC-supervised institution must have policies and procedures that describe how it determines the period of significant financial stress used to calculate the FDIC-supervised institution's stressed VaR-based measure under this section and must be able to provide empirical support for the period used. The FDIC-supervised institution must obtain the prior approval of the FDIC for, and notify the FDIC if the FDIC-supervised institution makes any material changes to, these policies and procedures. The policies and procedures must address:


(i) How the FDIC-supervised institution links the period of significant financial stress used to calculate the stressed VaR-based measure to the composition and directional bias of its current portfolio; and


(ii) The FDIC-supervised institution's process for selecting, reviewing, and updating the period of significant financial stress used to calculate the stressed VaR-based measure and for monitoring the appropriateness of the period to the FDIC-supervised institution's current portfolio.


(4) Nothing in this section prevents the FDIC from requiring an FDIC-supervised institution to use a different period of significant financial stress in the calculation of the stressed VaR-based measure.
