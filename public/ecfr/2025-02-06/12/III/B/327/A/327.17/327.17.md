To the extent that an institution's outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program exceeds its borrowings from the Federal Reserve Banks under the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility, the FDIC will add the amount of outstanding loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program in excess of borrowings under the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility to cash.


(c) *Mitigating the effects of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program and assets purchased under the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility on the unsecured adjustment, depository institution debt adjustment, and the brokered deposit adjustment to an insured depository institution's assessment rate.* As described in appendix E to this subpart, when calculating an insured depository institution's unsecured debt adjustment, depository institution debt adjustment, or the brokered deposit adjustment described in § 327.16(e), as applicable, the FDIC will exclude the outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program and the quarterly average amount of assets purchased under the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, both as reported on the Consolidated Report of Condition and Income.

(1) *Calculation of offset amount.* (i) To determine the offset amount, the FDIC will take the sum of the outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program and the quarterly average amount of assets purchased under the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, both as reported on the Consolidated Report of Condition and Income, and multiply the sum by an institution's total base assessment rate, as calculated under § 327.16, including any adjustments under § 327.16(e).


(ii) To the extent that an institution does not report the outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program, such as in an insured branch's Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks, the FDIC will take the sum of either the quarterly average amount of loans pledged to the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility as reported in the Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks, or the outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program, as such certified data is provided to the FDIC, and the quarterly average amount of assets purchased under the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, as reported in the Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks, and multiply the sum by an institution's total base assessment rate, as calculated under § 327.16.


(2) *Calculation of assessment amount due.* The FDIC will subtract the offset amount described in § 327.17(d)(1) from an insured depository institution's total assessment amount, consistent with § 327.3(b)(1).


(e) *Mitigating the effects of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program and assets purchased under the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility on the classification of insured depository institutions as small, large, or highly complex for deposit insurance purposes.* When classifying an insured depository institution as small, large, or complex for assessment purposes under § 327.8, the FDIC will exclude from an institution's total assets the outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program and the balance of assets purchased under the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility outstanding, both as reported on the Consolidated Report of Condition and Income.
