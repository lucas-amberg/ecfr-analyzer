# § 327.2   Certified statements.

(a) *Required.* (1) The certified statement shall also be known as the quarterly certified statement invoice. Each insured depository institution shall file and certify its quarterly certified statement invoice in the manner and form set forth in this section.


(2) The quarterly certified statement invoice shall reflect the institution's risk assignment, assessment base, assessment computation, and assessment amount, for each quarterly assessment period.


(b) *Availability and access.* (1) The Corporation shall make available to each insured depository institution via the FDIC's e-business Web site FDIC*connect* a quarterly certified statement invoice each assessment period.


(2) Insured depository institutions shall access their quarterly certified statement invoices via FDIC*connect*, unless the FDIC provides notice to insured depository institutions of a successor system. In the event of a contingency, the FDIC may employ an alternative means of delivering the quarterly certified statement invoices. A quarterly certified statement invoice delivered by any alternative means will be treated as if it had been downloaded from FDIC*connect.*

(3) Institutions that do not have Internet access may request a renewable one-year exemption from the requirement that quarterly certified statement invoices be accessed through FDIC*connect.* Any exemption request must be submitted in writing to the Manager of the Assessments Section.


(4) Each assessment period, the FDIC will provide courtesy e-mail notification to insured depository institutions indicating that new quarterly certified statement invoices are available and may be accessed on FDIC*connect.* E-mail notification will be sent to all individuals with FDIC*connect* access to quarterly certified statement invoices.


(5) E-mail notification may be used by the FDIC to communicate with insured depository institutions regarding quarterly certified statement invoices and other assessment-related matters.


(c) *Review by institution.* The president of each insured depository institution, or such other officer as the institution's president or board of directors or trustees may designate, shall review the information shown on each quarterly certified statement invoice.


(d) *Retention by institution.* If the appropriate officer of the insured depository institution agrees that, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, the information shown on the quarterly certified statement invoice is true, correct, and complete and in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the regulations issued under it, the institution shall pay the amount specified on the quarterly certified statement invoice and shall retain it in the institution's files for three years as specified in section 7(b)(4) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.


(e) *Amendment by institution.* If the appropriate officer of the insured depository institution determines that, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, the information shown on the quarterly certified statement invoice is not true, correct, and complete and in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the regulations issued under it, the institution shall pay the amount specified on the quarterly certified statement invoice, and may:


(1) Amend its report of condition, or other similar report, to correct any data believed to be inaccurate on the quarterly certified statement invoice; amendments to such reports timely filed under section 7(g) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act but not permitted to be made by an institution's primary federal regulator may be filed with the FDIC for consideration in determining deposit insurance assessments; or


(2) Amend and sign its quarterly certified statement invoice to correct a calculation believed to be inaccurate and return it to the FDIC by the applicable payment date specified in § 327.3(b)(2).


(f) *Certification.* Data used by the Corporation to complete the quarterly certified statement invoice has been previously attested to by the institution in its reports of condition, or other similar reports, filed with the institution's primary federal regulator. When an insured institution pays the amount shown on the quarterly certified statement invoice and does not correct that invoice as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the information on that invoice shall be deemed true, correct, complete, and certified for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section and section 7(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.


(g) *Requests for revision of assessment computation.* (1) The timely filing of an amended report of condition or other similar report under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, or the timely filing of an amended quarterly certified statement invoice under paragraph (e)(2), that will result in a change to deposit insurance assessments owed or paid by an insured depository institution, shall be treated as a timely filed request for revision of computation of quarterly assessment payment under § 327.3(f).


(2) The assessment rate on the quarterly certified statement invoice shall be amended only if it is inconsistent with the assessment risk assignment(s) provided to the institution by the Corporation for the assessment period in question pursuant to § 327.4(a). Agreement with the assessment rate shall not be deemed to constitute agreement with the assessment risk assignment. An institution may request review of an assessment risk assignment it believes to be incorrect pursuant to § 327.4(c).
