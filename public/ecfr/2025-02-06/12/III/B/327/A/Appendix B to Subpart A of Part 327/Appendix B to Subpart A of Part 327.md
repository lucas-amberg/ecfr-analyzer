# Appendix B to Subpart A of Part 327—Conversion of Scorecard Measures into Score


Weighted average CAMELS ratings between 1 and 3.5 are assigned a score between 25 and 100 according to the following equation:


For certain scorecard measures, a lower ratio implies lower risk and a higher ratio implies higher risk. These measures include:


• Concentration measure;


• Credit quality measure;


• Market risk measure;


• Average short-term funding to average total assets ratio; and


• Potential losses to total domestic deposits ratio (loss severity measure).


For those measures, a value between the minimum and maximum cutoff values is converted linearly to a score between 0 and 100, according to the following formula:


For other scorecard measures, a lower value represents higher risk and a higher value represents lower risk. These measures include:


• Leverage ratio;


• Core earnings to average quarter-end total assets ratio;


• Core deposits to total liabilities ratio; and


• Balance sheet liquidity ratio.


For those measures, a value between the minimum and maximum cutoff values is converted linearly to a score between 0 and 100, according to the following formula:
