# ยง 327.33   Determination of eligible institution's credit amount.

(a) Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, allocation of the one-time credit shall be based on each eligible insured depository institution's 1996 assessment base ratio.


(b) Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, an eligible insured depository institution's 1996 assessment base ratio shall consist of:


(1) Its assessment base as of December 31, 1996 (adjusted as appropriate to reflect the assessment base of December 31, 1996, of all institutions for which it is the successor), as the numerator; and


(2) The combined aggregate assessment bases of all eligible insured depository institutions, including any successor institutions, as of December 31, 1996, as the denominator.


(c) If an insured depository institution is a successor to an eligible insured depository institution under the *de facto* rule, as defined in paragraph 327.31(c) of this subpart, the successor and the eligible insured depository institution will divide the eligible insured depository institution's 1996 assessment base ratio pro rata, based on the deposit liabilities assumed in the transaction. In any subsequent transaction involving an insured depository institution that previously engaged in a transaction to which the *de facto* rule applied, the insured depository institution may not be deemed to have transferred more than its remaining 1996 assessment base ratio. If the transferring institution is no longer an insured depository institution after the transfer, the last successor will acquire the transferring institution's remaining 1996 assessment base ratio.
