# ยง 327.35   Application of credits.

(a) Subject to the limitations in paragraph (b) of this section, the amount of an eligible insured depository institution's one-time credit shall be applied to the maximum extent allowable by law against that institution's quarterly assessment payment under subpart A of this part, after applying assessment credits awarded under ยง 327.11(c), until the institution's credit is exhausted.


(b) The following limitations shall apply to the application of the credit against assessment payments.


(1) For assessments that become due for assessment periods beginning in calendar years 2008, 2009, and 2010, the credit may not be applied to more than 90 percent of the quarterly assessment.


(2) For an insured depository institution that exhibits financial, operational, or compliance weaknesses ranging from moderately severe to unsatisfactory, or is not at least adequately capitalized (as defined pursuant to section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act) at the beginning of an assessment period, the amount of the credit that may be applied against the institution's quarterly assessment for that period shall not exceed the amount that the institution would have been assessed if it had been assessed at the average assessment rate for all insured institutions for that period. The FDIC shall determine the average assessment rate for an assessment period based upon its best estimate of the average rate for the period. The estimate shall be made using the best information available, but shall be made no earlier than 30 days and no later than 20 days prior to the payment due date for the period.


(3) If the FDIC has established a restoration plan pursuant to section 7(b)(3)(E) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC may elect to restrict the application of credit amounts, in any assessment period, up to the lesser of:


(i) The amount of an insured depository institution's assessment for that period; or


(ii) The amount equal to 3 basis points of the institution's assessment base.


(c) *Remittance of credits.* Subject to the limitations in paragraph (b) of this section, in the same assessment period that the FDIC remits the full nominal value of small bank assessment credits pursuant to ยง 327.11(c)(13), the FDIC shall remit the full nominal value of an institution's remaining one-time assessment credits provided under this subpart B in a single lump-sum payment to such institution.
