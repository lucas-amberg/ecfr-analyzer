(b) Property securing any loan with an original principal balance of $5,000 or less and a repayment term of one year or less; or


(c) Any structure that is a part of any residential property but is detached from the primary residential structure of such property and does not serve as a residence. For purposes of this paragraph (c):


(1) “A structure that is a part of a residential property” is a structure used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and not used primarily for agricultural, commercial, industrial, or other business purposes;


(2) A structure is “detached” from the primary residential structure if it is not joined by any structural connection to that structure; and


(3) “Serve as a residence” shall be based upon the good faith determination of the FDIC-supervised institution that the structure is intended for use or actually used as a residence, which generally includes sleeping, bathroom, or kitchen facilities.
