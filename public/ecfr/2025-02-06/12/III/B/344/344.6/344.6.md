# § 344.6   Notification by agreement; alternative forms and times of notification.

An FDIC-supervised institution may elect to use the following alternative notification procedures if the transaction is effected for:


(a) *Notification by agreement.* Accounts (except periodic plans) where the FDIC-supervised institution does not exercise investment discretion and the FDIC-supervised institution and the customer agree in writing to a different arrangement as to the time and content of the written notification; provided however, that such agreement makes clear the customer's right to receive the written notification pursuant to § 344.5(a) or (b) at no additional cost to the customer.


(b) *Trust accounts.* Accounts (except collective investment funds) where the FDIC-supervised institution exercises investment discretion in other than in an agency capacity, in which instance it shall, upon request of the person having the power to terminate the account or, if there is no such person, upon the request of any person holding a vested beneficial interest in such account, give or send to such person the written notification within a reasonable time. The FDIC-supervised institution may charge such person a reasonable fee for providing this information.


(c) *Agency accounts.* Accounts where the FDIC-supervised institution exercises investment discretion in an agency capacity, in which instance:


(1) The FDIC-supervised institution shall give or send to each customer not less frequently than once every three months an itemized statement which shall specify the funds and securities in the custody or possession of the FDIC-supervised institution at the end of such period and all debits, credits and transactions in the customer's accounts during such period; and


(2) If requested by the customer, the FDIC-supervised institution shall give or send to each customer within a reasonable time the written notification described in § 344.5. The FDIC-supervised institution may charge a reasonable fee for providing the information described in § 344.5.


(d) *Cash management sweep accounts.* An FDIC-supervised institution effecting a securities transaction for a cash management sweep account shall give or send its customer a written statement, in the same form as required under paragraph (f) of this section, for each month in which a purchase or sale of a security takes place in the account and not less than once every three months if there are no securities transactions in the account. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), FDIC-supervised institutions that retain custody of government securities that are the subject of a hold-in-custody repurchase agreement are subject to the requirements of 17 CFR 403.5(d).


(e) *Collective investment fund accounts.* The FDIC-supervised institution shall at least annually give or send to the customer a copy of a financial report of the fund, or provide notice that a copy of such report is available and will be furnished upon request to each person to whom a regular periodic accounting would ordinarily be rendered with respect to each participating account. This report shall be based upon an audit made by independent public accountants or internal auditors responsible only to the board of directors of the FDIC-supervised institution.


(f) *Periodic plan accounts.* The FDIC-supervised institution shall give or send to the customer not less than once every three months a written statement showing:


(1) The funds and securities in the custody or possession of the FDIC-supervised institution;


(2) All service charges and commissions paid by the customer in connection with the transaction; and


(3) All other debits and credits of the customer's account involved in the transaction; provided that upon written request of the customer, the FDIC-supervised institution shall give or send the information described in § 344.5, except that any such information relating to remuneration paid in connection with the transaction need not be provided to the customer when the remuneration is paid by a source other than the customer. The FDIC-supervised institution may charge a reasonable fee for providing information described in § 344.5.
