(a) *Officers and employees subject to reporting.* FDIC-supervised institution officers and employees who:


(1) Make investment recommendations or decisions for the accounts of customers;


(2) Participate in the determination of such recommendations or decisions; or


(3) In connection with their duties, obtain information concerning which securities are being purchased or sold or recommend such action, must report to the FDIC-supervised institution, within 30-calendar days after the end of the calendar quarter, all transactions in securities made by them or on their behalf, either at the FDIC-supervised institution or elsewhere in which they have a beneficial interest. The report shall identify the securities purchased or sold and indicate the dates of the transactions and whether the transactions were purchases or sales.


(b) *Exempt transactions.* Excluded from this reporting requirement are:


(1) Transactions for the benefit of the officer or employee over which the officer or employee has no direct or indirect influence or control;


(2) Transactions in registered investment company shares;


(3) Transactions in government securities; and


(4) All transactions involving in the aggregate $10,000 or less during the calendar quarter.


(c) *Alternative report.* Where an FDIC-supervised institution acts as an investment adviser to an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the FDIC-supervised institution's officers and employees may fulfill their reporting requirement under paragraph (a) of this section by filing with the FDIC-supervised institution the “access persons” personal securities trading report required by SEC Rule 17j-1, 17 CFR 270.17j-1.
