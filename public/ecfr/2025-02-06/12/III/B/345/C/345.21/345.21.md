# § 345.21   Evaluation of CRA performance in general.

(a) *Application of performance tests and strategic plans*—(1) *Large banks.* To evaluate the performance of a large bank, the FDIC applies the Retail Lending Test in § 345.22, the Retail Services and Products Test in § 345.23, the Community Development Financing Test in § 345.24, and the Community Development Services Test in § 345.25.


(2) *Intermediate banks*—(i) *In general.* To evaluate the performance of an intermediate bank, the FDIC applies the Retail Lending Test in § 345.22 and either the Intermediate Bank Community Development Test in § 345.30(a)(2) or, at the bank's option, the Community Development Financing Test in § 345.24.


(ii) *Intermediate banks evaluated under § 345.24.* If an intermediate bank opts to be evaluated pursuant to the Community Development Financing Test in § 345.24, the FDIC evaluates the intermediate bank for the evaluation period preceding the bank's next CRA examination pursuant to the Community Development Financing Test in § 345.24 and continues evaluations pursuant to this performance test for subsequent evaluation periods until the bank opts out. If an intermediate bank opts out of the Community Development Financing Test in § 345.24, the FDIC reverts to evaluating the bank pursuant to the Intermediate Bank Community Development Test in § 345.30(a)(2), starting with the evaluation period preceding the bank's next CRA examination.


(iii) *Additional consideration.* An intermediate bank may request additional consideration pursuant to § 345.30(b).


(3) *Small banks*—(i) *In general.* To evaluate the performance of a small bank, the FDIC applies the Small Bank Lending Test in § 345.29(a)(2), unless the bank opts to be evaluated pursuant to the Retail Lending Test in § 345.22.


(ii) *Small banks evaluated under the Retail Lending Test.* If a small bank opts to be evaluated pursuant to the Retail Lending Test in § 345.22, the following applies:


(A) The FDIC evaluates the small bank using the same provisions used to evaluate intermediate banks pursuant to the Retail Lending Test in § 345.22.


(B) The FDIC evaluates the small bank for the evaluation period preceding the bank's next CRA examination pursuant to the Retail Lending Test in § 345.22 and continues evaluations under this performance test for subsequent evaluation periods until the bank opts out. If a small bank opts out of the Retail Lending Test in § 345.22, the FDIC reverts to evaluating the bank pursuant to the Small Bank Lending Test in § 345.29(a)(2), starting with the evaluation period preceding the bank's next CRA examination.


(iii) *Additional consideration.* A small bank may request additional consideration pursuant to § 345.29(b).


(4) *Limited purpose banks*—(i) *In general.* The FDIC evaluates a limited purpose bank pursuant to the Community Development Financing Test for Limited Purpose Banks in § 345.26.

(ii) *Evaluation approach for military banks operating under § 345.16(d).* If a military bank delineates the entire United States and its territories as its sole facility-based assessment area pursuant to § 345.16(d), the FDIC evaluates the bank exclusively at the institution level based on its performance in its sole facility-based assessment area.


(6) *Banks operating under a strategic plan.* The FDIC evaluates the performance of a bank that has an approved strategic plan pursuant to § 345.27.


(b) *Loans, investments, services, and products of operating subsidiaries and other affiliates*—(1) *In general.* In the performance evaluation of a bank, the FDIC considers the loans, investments, services, and products of a bank's operating subsidiaries and other affiliates, as applicable, as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, so long as no other depository institution claims the loan, investment, service, or product for purposes of this part or 12 CFR part 25 or 228.


(2) *Loans, investments, services, and products of operating subsidiaries.* The FDIC considers the loans, investment, services, and products of a bank's operating subsidiaries under this part, unless an operating subsidiary is independently subject to the CRA. The bank must collect, maintain, and report data on the loans, investments, services, and products of its operating subsidiaries as provided in § 345.42(c).


(3) *Loans, investments, services, and products of other affiliates.* The FDIC considers the loans, investments, services, and products of affiliates of a bank that are not operating subsidiaries, at the bank's option, subject to the following:


(i) The affiliate is not independently subject to the CRA.


(ii) The bank collects, maintains, and reports data on the loans, investments, services, or products of the affiliate as provided in § 345.42(d).


(iii) Pursuant to the Retail Lending Test in § 345.22, if a bank opts to have the FDIC consider the closed-end home mortgage loans, small business loans, small farm loans, or automobile loans that are originated or purchased by one or more of the bank's affiliates in a particular Retail Lending Test Area, the FDIC will consider, subject to paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, all of the loans in that product line originated or purchased by all of the bank's affiliates in the particular Retail Lending Test Area.

(c) *Community development lending and community development investment by a consortium or a third party.* If a bank invests in or participates in a consortium that originates, purchases, refinances, or renews community development loans or community development investments, or if a bank invests in a third party that originates, purchases, refinances, or renews community development loans or community development investments, the FDIC may consider, at the bank's option, either those loans or investments, subject to the limitations in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, or the investment in the consortium or third party.


(1) The bank must collect, maintain, and report the data pertaining to the community development loans and community development investments as provided in § 345.42(e), as applicable;


(2) If the participants or investors choose to allocate community development loans or community development investments among themselves for consideration under this section, no participant or investor may claim a loan origination, loan purchase, or investment for community development consideration if another participant or investor claims the same loan origination, loan purchase, or investment; and


(3) The bank may not claim community development loans or community development investments accounting for more than its percentage share (based on the level of its participation or investment) of the total loans or investments made by the consortium or third party.
