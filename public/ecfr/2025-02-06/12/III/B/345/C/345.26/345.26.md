(2) *Additional consideration*—(i) *Community development services.* The FDIC may adjust a limited purpose bank's institution rating from “Satisfactory” to “Outstanding” where a bank requests and receives additional consideration for services that would qualify under the Community Development Services Test in § 345.25.


(ii) *Additional consideration for low-cost education loans.* A limited purpose bank may request and receive additional consideration at the institution level for providing low-cost education loans to low-income borrowers pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 2903(d), regardless of the limited purpose bank's overall institution rating.

(d) *Facility-based assessment area evaluation.* The FDIC evaluates a limited purpose bank's community development financing performance in a facility-based assessment area and assigns a conclusion in the facility-based assessment area based on the FDIC's:

(2) *Component two—State or multistate MSA performance.* The dollar volume of the limited purpose bank's community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve the State or multistate MSA and a review of the impact and responsiveness of those loans and investments, as provided in § 345.15.

(i) *Limited Purpose Bank Community Development Financing Metric.* The Limited Purpose Bank Community Development Financing Metric measures the dollar volume of a bank's community development loans and community development investments that benefit or serve all or part of the nationwide area compared to the bank's assets calculated pursuant to paragraph III.a of appendix B to this part.

(iii) *Limited Purpose Bank Community Development Investment Metric.* For a limited purpose bank that had assets greater than $10 billion as of December 31 in both of the prior two calendar years, the Limited Purpose Bank Community Development Investment Metric measures the dollar volume of the bank's community development investments that benefit or serve all or part of the nationwide area, excluding mortgage-backed securities, compared to the bank's assets, calculated pursuant to paragraph III.d of appendix B to this part.


(iv) *Nationwide Asset-Based Community Development Investment Benchmark.* (A) For a limited purpose bank that had assets greater than $10 billion as of December 31 in both of the prior two calendar years, the FDIC compares the Limited Purpose Bank Community Development Investment Metric to the Nationwide Asset-Based Community Development Investment Benchmark. This comparison may only contribute positively to the bank's Community Development Financing Test for Limited Purpose Banks conclusion for the institution.


(B) The Nationwide Asset-Based Community Development Investment Benchmark measures the dollar volume of community development investments that benefit or serve all or part of the nationwide area, excluding mortgage-backed securities, of all depository institutions that had assets greater than $10 billion as of December 31 in both of the prior two calendar years, compared to assets for those depository institutions, calculated pursuant to paragraph III.e of appendix B to this part.
