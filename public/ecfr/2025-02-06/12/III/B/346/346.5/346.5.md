# § 346.5   Related agreements considered a single agreement.

The following rules must be applied in determining whether an agreement is a covered agreement under § 346.2.


(a) *Agreements entered into by same parties.* All written agreements to which an insured depository institution or an affiliate of the insured depository institution is a party shall be considered to be a single agreement if the agreements—


(1) Are entered into with the same NGEP;


(2) Were entered into within the same 12-month period; and


(3) Are each in fulfillment of the CRA.


(b) *Substantively related contracts.* All written contracts to which an insured depository institution or an affiliate of the insured depository institution is a party shall be considered to be a single agreement, without regard to whether the other parties to the contracts are the same or whether each such contract is in fulfillment of the CRA, if the contracts were negotiated in a coordinated fashion and a NGEP is a party to each contract.
