# ยง 354.4   Required commitments and provisions of written agreement.

(a) The commitments required to be made in the written agreements referenced in ยง 354.3 are set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section. In addition, with respect to an industrial bank subject to this part, the FDIC will condition each grant of deposit insurance, each issuance of a non-objection to a change in control, and each approval of a merger on compliance with paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section by the parties to the written agreement. As required, each Covered Company must:


(1) Submit to the FDIC an initial listing of all of the Covered Company's subsidiaries and update such list annually;


(2) Consent to the examination by the FDIC of the Covered Company and each of its subsidiaries to permit the FDIC to assess compliance with the provisions of any written agreement, commitment, or condition imposed; the FDI Act; or any other Federal law for which the FDIC has specific enforcement jurisdiction against such Covered Company or subsidiary, and all relevant laws and regulations;


(3) Submit to the FDIC an annual report describing the Covered Company's operations and activities, in the form and manner prescribed by the FDIC, and such other reports as may be requested by the FDIC to inform the FDIC as to the Covered Company's:


(i) Financial condition;


(ii) Systems for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling financial and operational risks;


(iii) Transactions with depository institution subsidiaries of the Covered Company;


(iv) Systems for protecting the security, confidentiality, and integrity of consumer and nonpublic personal information; and


(v) Compliance with applicable provisions of the FDI Act and any other law or regulation;


(4) Maintain such records as the FDIC may deem necessary to assess the risks to the subsidiary industrial bank or to the Deposit Insurance Fund;


(5) Cause an independent audit of each subsidiary industrial bank to be performed annually;


(6) Limit the Covered Company's direct and indirect representation on the board of directors or board of managers, as the case may be, of each subsidiary industrial bank to less than 50 percent of the members of such board of directors or board of managers, in the aggregate, and, in the case of a subsidiary industrial bank that is organized as a member-managed limited liability company, limit the Covered Company's direct and indirect representation as a managing member to less than 50 percent of the managing member interests of the subsidiary industrial bank, in the aggregate;


(7) Maintain the capital and liquidity of the subsidiary industrial bank at such levels as the FDIC deems appropriate, and take such other actions as the FDIC deems appropriate to provide the subsidiary industrial bank with a resource for additional capital and liquidity including, for example, pledging assets, obtaining and maintaining a letter of credit from a third-party institution acceptable to the FDIC, and providing indemnification of the subsidiary industrial bank; and


(8) Execute a tax allocation agreement with its subsidiary industrial bank that expressly states that an agency relationship exists between the Covered Company and the subsidiary industrial bank with respect to tax assets generated by such industrial bank, and that further states that all such tax assets are held in trust by the Covered Company for the benefit of the subsidiary industrial bank and will be promptly remitted to such industrial bank. The tax allocation agreement also must provide that the amount and timing of any payments or refunds to the subsidiary industrial bank by the Covered Company should be no less favorable than if the subsidiary industrial bank were a separate taxpayer.


(b) The FDIC may require such Covered Company and industrial bank to commit to provide to the FDIC, and, thereafter, implement and adhere to, a contingency plan subject to the FDIC's approval that sets forth, at a minimum, recovery actions to address significant financial or operational stress that could threaten the safe and sound operation of the industrial bank and one or more strategies for the orderly disposition of such industrial bank without the need for the appointment of a receiver or conservator.
