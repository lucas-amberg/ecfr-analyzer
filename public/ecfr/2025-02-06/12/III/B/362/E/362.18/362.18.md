(1) The insured state nonmember bank is well-managed; 


(2) The insured state nonmember bank and all of its insured depository institution affiliates are well-capitalized as defined in the appropriate capital regulation and guidance of each institution's primary federal regulator; and 


(3) The insured state nonmember bank will deduct the aggregate amount of its outstanding equity investment, including retained earnings, in all financial subsidiaries that engage in activities as principal pursuant to section 46(a) of the Federal Deposit Act (12 U.S.C. 1831w(a)), from the bank's total assets and tangible equity and deduct such investment from its total risk-based capital (this deduction shall be made equally from tier 1 and tier 2 capital) or from common equity tier 1 capital in accordance with 12 CFR part 324, subpart C, as applicable.

(c) *Other requirements.* An insured state nonmember bank controlling or holding an interest in a financial subsidiary under section 46(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831w) must meet and continue to meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section as long as the insured state nonmember bank holds the financial subsidiary and:

(d) *Securities underwriting.* If the financial subsidiary of the insured state nonmember bank will engage in the public sale, distribution or underwriting of stocks, bonds, debentures, notes, or other securities activity of a type permissible for a national bank only through a financial subsidiary, then the state nonmember bank and the financial subsidiary also must comply and continue to comply with the following additional requirements: 


(1) The securities business of the financial subsidiary must be physically separate and distinct in its operations from the operations of the bank, provided that this requirement shall not be construed to prohibit the bank and its financial subsidiary from sharing the same facility if the area where the financial subsidiary conducts securities business with the public is physically distinct from the routine deposit taking area of the bank; 


(2) The financial subsidiary must conduct its securities business pursuant to independent policies and procedures designed to inform customers and prospective customers of the financial subsidiary that the financial subsidiary is a separate organization from the insured state nonmember bank and that the insured state nonmember bank is not responsible for and does not guarantee the obligations of the financial subsidiary; 


(3) The bank must adopt policies and procedures, including appropriate limits on exposure, to govern its participation in financing transactions underwritten by its financial subsidiary; and 


(4) The bank must not express an opinion on the value or the advisability of the purchase or sale of securities underwritten or dealt in by its financial subsidiary unless the bank notifies the customer that the entity underwriting, making a market, distributing or dealing in the securities is a financial subsidiary of the bank. 


(e) *Applications for exceptions to certain requirements.* Any insured state nonmember bank that is unable to comply with the well-managed requirement of § 362.18(a)(1) and (c)(1), any state nonmember bank that has appropriate reasons for not meeting the financial and operational standards applicable to a financial subsidiary of a national bank conducting the same activities as provided in § 362.18(c)(3) or any state nonmember bank and its financial subsidiary subject to the securities underwriting activities requirements in § 362.18(d) that is unable to meet such requirements may submit an application in compliance with § 303.121 of this chapter to seek a waiver or modification of such requirements under the procedure in § 303.122(b) of this chapter.

(i) The FDIC finds that an insured state nonmember bank or any of its insured depository institution affiliates is not in compliance with the CRA requirement of § 362.18(b) at the time any new activity is commenced or control of the financial subsidiary is acquired; 


(ii) The FDIC finds that the facts to which an insured state nonmember bank certified under § 362.18(a) are not accurate in whole or in part; or 


(iii) The FDIC finds that the insured state nonmember bank or any of its insured depository institution affiliates or the financial subsidiary fails to meet or continue to comply with the requirements of § 362.18(c) and (d), if applicable, and the FDIC has not granted an exception under the procedures set forth in § 362.18(e) and in § 303.122(b) of this chapter.
