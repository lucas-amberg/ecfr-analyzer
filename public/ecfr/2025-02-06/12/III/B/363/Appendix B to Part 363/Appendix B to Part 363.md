# Appendix B to Part 363—Illustrative Management Reports


1. *General.* The reporting scenarios, illustrative management reports, and the cover letter (when complying at the holding company level) in Appendix B to part 363 are intended to assist managements of insured depository institutions in complying with the annual reporting requirements of § 363.2 and guideline 3, *Compliance by Holding Company Subsidiaries,* of Appendix A to part 363. However, use of the illustrative management reports and cover letter is not required. The managements of insured depository institutions are encouraged to tailor the wording of their management reports and cover letters to fit their particular circumstances, especially when reporting on material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting or noncompliance with designated laws and regulations. Terms that are not explained in Appendix B have the meanings given them in part 363, the FDI Act, or professional accounting and auditing literature. Instructions to the preparer of the management reports are shown in brackets within the illustrative reports.


2. *Reporting Scenarios for Institutions that are Holding Company Subsidiaries.* (a) Subject to the criteria specified in § 363.1(b), an insured depository institution that is a subsidiary of a holding company has flexibility in satisfying the reporting requirements of part 363. When reporting at the holding company level, the management report, or the individual components thereof, should identify those subsidiary institutions that are subject to part 363 and the extent to which they are included in the scope of the management report or a component of the report. The following reporting scenarios reflect how an insured depository institution that meets the criteria set forth in § 363.1(b) could satisfy the annual reporting requirements of § 363.2. Other reporting scenarios are possible.


(i) An institution that is a subsidiary of a holding company may satisfy the requirements for audited financial statements; management's statement of responsibilities; management's assessment of the institution's compliance with the Federal laws and regulations pertaining to insider loans and the Federal and, if applicable, State laws and regulations pertaining to dividend restrictions; management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, if applicable; and the independent public accountant's attestation on management's assertion as to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, if applicable, at the insured depository institution level.


(ii) An institution that is a subsidiary of a holding company may satisfy the requirements for audited financial statements; management's statement of responsibilities; management's assessment of the institution's compliance with the Federal laws and regulations pertaining to insider loans and the Federal and, if applicable, State laws and regulations pertaining to dividend restrictions; management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, if applicable; and the independent public accountant's attestation on management's assertion as to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, if applicable, at the holding company level.


(iii) An institution that is a subsidiary of a holding company may satisfy the requirement for audited financial statements at the holding company level and may satisfy the requirements for management's statement of responsibilities; management's assessment of the institution's compliance with the Federal laws and regulations pertaining to insider loans and the Federal and, if applicable, State laws and regulations pertaining to dividend restrictions; management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, if applicable; and the independent public accountant's attestation on management's assertion as to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, if applicable, at the insured depository institution level.


(iv) An institution that is a subsidiary of a holding company may satisfy the requirements for audited financial statements; management's statement of responsibilities; and management's assessment of the institution's compliance with the Federal laws and regulations pertaining to insider loans and the Federal and, if applicable, State laws and regulations pertaining to dividend restrictions at the insured depository institution level and may satisfy the requirements for the assessment by management of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, if applicable; and the independent public accountant's attestation on management's assertion as to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, if applicable, at the holding company level.


(b) For an institution with total assets of $1 billion or more as of the beginning of its fiscal year, the assessment by management of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the independent public accountant's attestation on management's assertion as to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, if applicable, must both be performed at the same level, *i.e.,* either at the insured depository institution level or at the holding company level.


(c) Financial statements prepared for regulatory reporting purposes encompass the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements in an institution's appropriate regulatory report, *e.g.,* the bank Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report) and the Thrift Financial Report (TFR). Guideline 4A in Appendix A to part 363 identifies the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements in the Call Report and TFR. When internal control assessments and attestations are performed at the holding company level, the FDIC believes that holding companies have flexibility in interpreting “financial reporting” as it relates to “regulatory reporting” and has not objected to several reporting approaches employed by holding companies to cover “regulatory reporting.” Certain holding companies have had management's assessment and the accountant's attestation cover the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements that are included in the appropriate regulatory report, *e.g.,* Call Report and the TFR, of each subsidiary institution subject to part 363. Other holding companies have had management's assessment and the accountant's attestation cover the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements that are included in the holding company's year-end regulatory report (FR Y-9C report) to the Federal Reserve Board.
