# ยง 366.7   Will the FDIC waive the prohibitions under ยง 366.3?

We may waive the prohibitions for entities other than individuals for good cause shown at our discretion when our need to contract for your services outweighs all relevant factors. The statute does not allow us to waive the prohibitions for individuals.
