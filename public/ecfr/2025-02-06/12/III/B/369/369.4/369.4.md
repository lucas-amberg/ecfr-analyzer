# ยง 369.4   Credit needs determination.

(a) *In general.* The FDIC will review the loan portfolio of the bank and determine whether the bank is reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities in the host state that are served by the bank. 


(b) *Guidelines.* The FDIC will use the following considerations as guidelines when making the determination pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section: 


(1) Whether covered interstate branches were formerly part of a failed or failing depository institution; 


(2) Whether covered interstate branches were acquired under circumstances where there was a low loan-to-deposit ratio because of the nature of the acquired institution's business or loan portfolio; 


(3) Whether covered interstate branches have a high concentration of commercial or credit card lending, trust services, or other specialized activities, including the extent to which the covered interstate branches accept deposits in the host state; 


(4) The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) ratings received by the bank, if any, under 12 U.S.C. 2901 *et seq.;*

(5) Economic conditions, including the level of loan demand, within the communities served by the covered interstate branches; 


(6) The safe and sound operation and condition of the bank; and 


(7) The FDIC's Community Reinvestment regulations (12 CFR Part 345) and interpretations of those regulations.
