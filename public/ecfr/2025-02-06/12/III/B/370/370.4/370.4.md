# § 370.4   Recordkeeping requirements.

(a) *General recordkeeping requirements.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, a covered institution must maintain in its deposit account records for each account the information necessary for its information technology system to meet the requirements set forth in § 370.3. The information must include:


(1) The unique identifier of each:


(i) Account holder;


(ii) Beneficial owner of a deposit, if the account holder is not the beneficial owner; and


(iii) Grantor and each beneficiary, if the deposit account is held in connection with an informal revocable trust that is insured pursuant to 12 CFR 330.10 (*e.g.,* payable-on-death accounts, in-trust-for accounts, and *Totten* Trust accounts).


(2) The applicable ownership right and capacity code listed and described in appendix A to this part.


(b) *Alternative recordkeeping requirements.* As permitted under this paragraph, a covered institution may maintain in its deposit account records less information than is required under paragraph (a) of this section.


(1) For each deposit account for which a covered institution's deposit account records disclose the existence of a relationship which might provide a basis for additional deposit insurance in accordance with 12 CFR 330.5 or 330.7 and for which the covered institution does not maintain information that would be needed for its information technology system to meet the requirements set forth in § 370.3, the covered institution must maintain, at a minimum, the following in its deposit account records:


(i) The unique identifier of the account holder; and


(ii) The corresponding “pending reason” code listed in data field 2 of the pending file format set forth in appendix B to this part (and need not maintain a “right and capacity” code).


(2) For each formal revocable trust account that is insured as described in 12 CFR 330.10 and for each irrevocable trust account that is insured as described in either 12 CFR 330.12 or 12 CFR 330.13, and for which the covered institution does not maintain the information that would be needed for its information technology system to meet the requirements set forth in § 370.3, the covered institution must, at a minimum, maintain in its deposit account records:


(i) The unique identifier of the account holder;


(ii) The unique identifier of a grantor if the deposit account has transactional features (unless the account is insured as described in 12 CFR 330.12, in which case the unique identifier of a grantor need not be maintained for purposes of this part); and


(iii) The corresponding “right and capacity” code listed in data field 4 of the pending file format set forth in appendix B to this part if it can be identified, otherwise the corresponding “pending reason” code from data field 2 of the pending file format set forth in appendix B.


(c) *Recordkeeping requirements for official items.* A covered institution must maintain in its deposit account records the information needed for its information technology system to meet the requirements set forth in § 370.3 with respect to accounts held in the name of the covered institution from which withdrawals are made to honor a payment instrument issued by the covered institution, such as a certified check, loan disbursement check, interest check, traveler's check, expense check, official check, cashier's check, money order, or similar payment instrument. To the extent that the covered institution does not have such information, it need only maintain in its deposit account records for those accounts the corresponding “pending reason” code listed in data field 2 of the pending file format set forth in appendix B to this part (and need not maintain a “right and capacity” code).


(d) *Recordkeeping requirements for deposits resulting from credit balances on an account for debt owed to the covered institution.* A covered institution is not required to meet the recordkeeping requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section with respect to deposit liabilities reflected as credit balances on an account for debt owed to the covered institution if its information technology system is capable of:


(1) Immediately upon failure, restricting access to all of the deposits in every borrower's deposit account(s) at the covered institution in accordance with § 370.3(b)(3); and


(2) Producing a file in the format provided in appendix C to this part for:


(i) Credit balances on open-end credit accounts (revolving credit lines) such as credit card accounts and home equity lines of credit within a time frame that will allow the covered institution's information technology system to meet the requirements set forth in § 370.3(b)(1), (2), and (4) within 24 hours after failure; and


(ii) Credit balances on closed-end loan accounts that can be used by the covered institution's information technology system to meet the requirements set forth in § 370.3(b)(1), (2) and (4).
