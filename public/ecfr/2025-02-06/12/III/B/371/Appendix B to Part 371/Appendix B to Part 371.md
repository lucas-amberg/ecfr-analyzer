# Appendix B to Part 371—File Structure for Qualified Financial Contract Records for Full Scope Entities


Pursuant to § 371.4(b), the records entity is required to provide the information required by this appendix B for itself and each of its reportable subsidiaries in a manner that can be disaggregated by legal entity. Accordingly, the reference to “records entity” in the tables of appendix B should be read as referring to each of the separate legal entities (*i.e.,* the records entity and each reportable subsidiary).
