(c) *Covered QFCs.* For purposes of this part, a covered QFC is:


(1) With respect to a covered FSI that is a covered FSI on January 1, 2018, an in-scope QFC that the covered FSI:


(i) Enters, executes, or otherwise becomes a party to on or after January 1, 2019; or


(ii) Entered, executed, or otherwise became a party to before January 1, 2019, if the covered FSI or any affiliate that is a covered entity, covered bank, or covered FSI also enters, executes, or otherwise becomes a party to a QFC with the same person or a consolidated affiliate of the same person on or after January 1, 2019.


(2) With respect to a covered FSI that becomes a covered FSI after January 1, 2018, an in-scope QFC that the covered FSI:


(i) Enters, executes, or otherwise becomes a party to on or after the later of the date the covered FSI first becomes a covered FSI and January 1, 2019; or

(2) Provides one or more default rights with respect to a QFC that may be exercised against a covered FSI.


(e) *Rules of construction.* For purposes of this part,


(1) A covered FSI does not become a party to a QFC solely by acting as agent with respect to the QFC; and
