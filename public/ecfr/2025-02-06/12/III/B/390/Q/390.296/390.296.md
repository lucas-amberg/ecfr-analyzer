(a) *Money Market Deposit Accounts* (*MMDAs*) offered by State savings associations in accordance with applicable state law are savings accounts on which interest may be paid if issued subject to the following limitations:


(1) The State savings association shall reserve the right to require at least seven days' notice prior to withdrawal or transfer of any funds in the account; and


(2)(i) The depositor is authorized by the State savings association to make no more than six transfers per calendar month or statement cycle (or similar period) of at least four weeks by means of preauthorized, automatic, telephonic, or data transmission agreement, order, or instruction to another account of the depositor at the same State savings association to the State savings association itself, or to a third party.


(ii) State savings associations may permit holders of MMDAs to make unlimited transfers for the purpose of repaying loans (except overdraft loans on the depositor's demand account) and associated expenses at the same State savings association (as originator or servicer), to make unlimited transfers of funds from this account to another account of the same depositor at the same State savings association or to make unlimited payments directly to the depositor from the account when such transfers or payments are made by mail, messenger, automated teller machine, or in person, or when such payments are made by telephone (via check mailed to the depositor).


(3) In order to ensure that no more than the number of transfers specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section are made, a State savings association must either:


(i) Prevent transfers of funds in excess of the limitations; or


(ii) Adopt procedures to monitor those transfers on an after-the-fact basis and contact customers who exceed the limits on more than an occasional basis. For customers who continue to violate those limits after being contacted by the depository State savings association the depository State savings association must either place funds in another account that the depositor is eligible to maintain or take away the account's transfer and draft capacities.


(iii) Insured State savings associations at their option, may use on a consistent basis either the date on a check or the date it is paid in determining whether the transfer limitations within the specified interval are exceeded.


(b) State savings associations may offer MMDAs to any depositor not inconsistent with applicable state law.
