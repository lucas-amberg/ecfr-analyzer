# ยง 607.3   Assessment of banks, associations, and designated other System entities.

(a) Banks, associations, and other System entities designated in paragraph (c) of this section will be assessed annually pursuant to this section for funds to cover a portion of the FCA's administrative expenses and for such funds as may be required to maintain a necessary reserve. The total amount of the annual assessment of banks, associations, and designated other System entities shall be based on the FCA budget for each fiscal year plus such amount as may be required to maintain a necessary reserve, excluding amounts to be assessed against other System entities and reimbursements received from non-System entities. 


(b) The assessment shall be apportioned among the banks, associations, and designated other System entities as follows: 


(1) Thirty (30) percent of the assessment under this section shall be apportioned to each bank, association, and designated other System entity on the basis of each institution's pro rata share of the total average risk-adjusted asset base. 


(2) Seventy (70) percent of the assessment under this section shall be apportioned to each bank, association, and designated other System entity based upon the amounts of the institution's average risk-adjusted assets that fall within the graduated risk-adjusted asset tiers contained in the following table. An institution's total assessment under this paragraph is the sum of the amounts assessed for risk-adjusted assets falling into each applicable tier, subject to adjustment for its FIRS rating as required in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section. The same assessment rate (designated as X_1_ or a declining percentage of X_1_ in the following table) will be applied to each dollar value of risk-adjusted assets falling within each tier, increased where applicable, by the amounts prescribed in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section. The actual assessment rate under this paragraph shall be determined annually based on relative average risk-adjusted asset bases, the FIRS ratings of individual institutions, and the FCA budget as adjusted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, but the relationship between the rates applied to each tier shall remain constant as set forth in the following table. 


(i) If the FCA assigns a bank, association, or designated other System entity a composite FIRS rating of 3 following its most recent examination of the institution prior to the date of assessment, the assessment provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be increased by 20 percent. 


(ii) If the FCA assigns a bank, association, or designated other System entity a composite FIRS rating of 4 or 5 following its most recent examination of the institution prior to the date of assessment, the assessment provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be increased by 40 percent. 


(iii) Banks, associations, and designated other System entities that were formed through mergers or consolidations and have not been examined before their initial assessment under this section shall be deemed to have a composite FIRS rating equivalent to the best composite FIRS rating assigned to the merged or consolidated institutions in the FCA's most recent examination of the individual institutions prior to the date of merger or consolidation. Newly chartered institutions not formed through mergers or consolidations that have not been examined before their initial assessment under this section shall be deemed to have a composite FIRS rating of 2. 


(3) Each bank, association, and designated other System entity shall pay a minimum assessment of $20,000 regardless of the result of the application of the assessment formula established by paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. If such a minimum assessment is apportioned to an institution, that institution's average risk-adjusted asset base shall be deducted from the total average risk-adjusted asset base, and $20,000 shall be deducted from the total assessment amount for purposes of determining the assessments of banks, associations, and designated other System entities paying more than the $20,000 minimum assessment. 


(c) Other System entities designated to be assessed in accordance with this section are: 


The Farm Credit Services Leasing Corporation. 


(d) Assessments may be adjusted periodically to reflect: 


(1) Changes in the FCA budget and necessary reserve; and 


(2) Any overpayment or underpayment by a bank, association, or designated other System entity in the prior fiscal year.
