(b) The Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative [or Salary] Offset shall be delivered to the debtor by hand or by mail and shall provide the following information: 


(1) The amount of the debt, the date it was incurred, and the facts upon which the determination of indebtedness was made; 


(2) In the case of an administrative offset, the payment due date, which shall be 30 calendar days from the date of mailing or hand delivery of the Notice;

(ii) The amount, frequency, proposed beginning date, and duration of the intended deductions;

(5) The right of the debtor to obtain a review of, and to request a hearing, on the FCA's determination of indebtedness, the propriety of collecting the debt by offset, and, in the case of salary offset, the propriety of the proposed repayment schedule (i.e., the percentage of disposable pay to be deducted each pay period). The debtor shall be informed that to obtain a review, the debtor shall deliver a written request for a review to the FCA official named in the Notice, within 15 calendar days after the debtor's receipt of the Notice.

(10) The amount of accrued interest and the amount of any other penalties or administrative costs which may have been added to the principal debt; 


(11) That if the debtor has not entered into an agreement with the FCA to pay the debt, has not requested the FCA to review the debt, or has not paid the debt prior to the date on which the offset is to be imposed, the FCA intends to collect the debt by administrative [or salary] offset or by requesting other Federal agencies for assistance in collecting the debt by offset. The debtor shall be informed that the offset shall be imposed against any funds that might become available to the debtor, until the principal debt and all accumulated interest and other charges are paid in full; 


(12) The date on which the offset will be imposed, which shall be 31 calendar days from the date of mailing or hand delivery of the Notice. The debtor shall be informed that the FCA reserves the right to impose an offset prior to this date if the FCA determines that immediate action is necessary;

(17) Other information, as may be appropriate. 


(c) When the procedural requirements of this section have been provided to the debtor in connection with the same debt or under some other statutory or regulatory authority, the FCA is not required to duplicate those requirements before effecting offset.
