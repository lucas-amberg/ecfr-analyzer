# ยง 608.824   Waiver of procedural requirements.

(a) The FCA may impose offset against a payment to be made to a debtor prior to the completion of the procedures required by this part, if: 


(1) Failure to impose the offset would substantially prejudice the Government's ability to collect the debt; and 


(2) The timing of the payment against which the offset will be imposed does not reasonably permit the completion of those procedures. 


(b) The procedures required by this part shall be complied with promptly after the offset is imposed. Amounts recovered by offset, which are later found not to be owed to the Government, shall be promptly refunded to the debtor.
