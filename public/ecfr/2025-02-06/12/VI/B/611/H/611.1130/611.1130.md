# § 611.1130   Inter-System transfer of funds and equities.

(a) Section 5.17(a)(6) of the Act authorizes the FCA to regulate the borrowing, repayment, and transfer of funds and equities between institutions of the System, including banks, associations, and service corporations chartered under the Act. This section sets forth the circumstances and procedures under which the FCA may direct such a transfer of funds and equities based on its determination with respect to the financial condition of one or more institutions of the System. For purposes of this section, the term “bond” refers to long-term notes, bonds, debentures, or other similar obligations, or short-term discount notes issued by one or more banks pursuant to section 4.2 of the Act.


(b) The FCA may direct a transfer of funds or equities by one or more banks of the System to another bank of the System where it determines that:


(1) The receiving institution will not be able to make payments of principal or interest on bonds for which it is primarily liable within the meaning of section 4.4(a) of the Act; or 


(2) The common or preferred stock, participation certificates, or allocated equities of the receiving institution have a book value less than their par or stated values; or 


(3) The total bonds outstanding for which the receiving institution is primarily liable exceed 20 times the combined capital and surplus accounts of the bank; or 


(4) Based on application to it of one or more of the following ratios, the receiving institution is not financially viable in that it will not be able to continue to extend new or additional credit or financial assistance to its eligible borrowers:


(i) The ratio of stock to earned net worth (including legal reserve, unallocated and reserved surplus, undistributed earnings, and allowance for credit losses) exceeds 2 to 1;


(ii) The ratio of the outstanding bonds to capital and surplus exceeds 15 to 1;


(iii) Nonearning assets (any noninterest-bearing assets, including but not limited to cash, noninterest-earning loans, net fixed assets, other property owned, accrued interest receivable, and accounts receivable) exceed 15 percent of total assets;


(iv) Lendable net worth (interest-earning assets less interest-bearing liabilities) is zero or less.


(c) The FCA may direct a transfer of funds or equities between two or more Federal land bank associations or two or more production credit associations in district where it determines that such transfer:


(1) Is necessary to provide financial support to the district bank in which those associations are stockholders based on application of the criteria to the bank as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section; or 


(2) Is necessary to provide financial support to one or more other like associations in the district based on application of the criteria set forth in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(4) of this section to the associations, provided that in applying paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section the ratio of outstanding indebtedness to capital and surplus of the receiving association(s) shall not exceed 9 to 1; or 


(3) Is an integral part of a plan that has been adopted by other institutions of the System, and approved by the FCA, under which those institutions will extend financial assistance to the district bank in which those associations are stockholders.


(d) A direction by the FCA for a transfer of funds or equities pursuant to this section shall be signed by the Chairman and shall establish the amount, timing, duration, repayment, and other terms of assessments necessary to accomplish such transfer, taking into consideration the financial condition of each institution to be assessed. Where the FCA directs a transfer of funds or equities between associations under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section, it may authorize the district bank in which such associations are stockholders to accomplish the necessary assessments through debits and credits to the accounts of the bank.
