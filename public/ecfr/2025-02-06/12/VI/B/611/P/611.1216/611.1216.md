(1) Results of any special assessments, analyses, studies, and rulings required under ยง 611.1211;


(2) Documents you submit to us or file with us under ยง 611.1215; and


(3) Documents you submit to us under section 7.11 of the Act that are related directly or indirectly to the proposed termination, including but not limited to contracts entered into in connection with or relating to the proposed termination and any related transactions.

(c) You may request that we treat specific information as confidential under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552 (*see* 12 CFR part, 602 subpart B).

On our own initiative, we may determine that certain information should be treated as confidential and, if so, we will not make that information public.
