This part prescribes procedures for referring those violations to the proper Federal authorities and the Farm Credit Administration. No specific procedural requirements apply to the referral of violations of State or local laws. 


(c) Nothing in this part should be construed as reducing in any way an institution's ability to report known or suspected criminal activities to the appropriate investigatory or prosecuting authorities, whether Federal, State, or local, even when the circumstances in which a report is required under ยง 612.2301 are not present. 


(d) It shall be the responsibility of each System institution to determine whether there appears to be a reasonable basis to conclude that a criminal violation has been committed and, if so, to report the matter to the proper law enforcement authorities for consideration of prosecution. 


(e) Each referral required by ยง 612.2301(a) shall be made on the FCA Referral Form in accordance with the FCA Referral Form instructions relating to its filing and distribution.
