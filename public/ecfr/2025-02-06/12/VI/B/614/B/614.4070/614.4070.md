(a) A bank or association chartered under title I or II of the Act may finance eligible borrower operations conducted wholly within its chartered territory regardless of the residence of the applicant.


(b) A bank or association operating under title I or II of the Act may finance the operations of a borrower headquartered and operating in its territory even though the operation financed is conducted partially outside its territory, provided notice is given to all Farm Credit institutions providing similar credit in the territory(ies) in which the operations being financed are conducted. A bank or association operating under title I or II of the Act may lend to a borrower headquartered outside its territory to finance eligible borrower operations that are conducted partially within its territory and partially outside its territory only if the concurrence of Farm Credit institutions providing similar credit for the territories in which the operations are conducted is obtained.


(c) A bank or association chartered under title I or II of the Act may finance eligible borrower operations conducted wholly outside its chartered territory, provided such loans are authorized by the policies of the bank and/or association involved, do not constitute a significant shift in loan volume away from the bank or association's assigned territory, and are made and administered in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.


(1) If a loan is made to an eligible borrower whose operations are conducted wholly outside the chartered territory of the lending bank or association, the lending institution shall obtain concurrence of all Farm Credit institutions providing similar credit in the territory(ies) in which the operation being financed is conducted.


(2) Loans to finance eligible borrower operations conducted wholly outside a bank's or association's territory shall be appropriately designated by the bank or association to provide adequate identification of the number and volume of such loans, which shall be monitored by the bank or association.


(d) A bank or association chartered under title I or II of the Act may finance eligible borrower operations conducted wholly or partially outside its chartered territory through the purchase of loans from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in compliance with § 614.4325(b)(3), provided:


(1) Notice is given to the Farm Credit System institution(s) chartered to serve the territory where the headquarters of the borrower's operation being financed is located; and
