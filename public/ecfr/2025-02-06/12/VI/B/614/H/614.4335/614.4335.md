# § 614.4335   Borrower stock requirements.

(a) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a borrower shall meet the minimum borrower stock purchase requirements as a condition of obtaining a loan.


(b) *Loans designated for sale into a secondary market.* (1) An institution's bylaws may provide that the institution's minimum borrower stock purchase requirements do not apply if a loan is designated, at the time it is made, for sale into a secondary market.


(2) If a loan designated for sale under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not sold into a secondary market during the 180-day period that begins on the date of designation, the institution's minimum borrower stock purchase requirements shall apply.


(c) *Retirement of borrower stock*—(1) *In general.* Borrower stock may be retired only if the institution meets the minimum permanent capital requirements imposed by the FCA pursuant to the Act or regulations and, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, in accordance with the following:


(i) Borrower stock may be retired if the entire loan is sold without recourse, provided that when the loan is sold without recourse to another Farm Credit System institution, the borrower may elect to hold stock in either the selling or purchasing institution.


(ii) Borrower stock may not be retired when the entire loan is sold with recourse.


(iii) When an interest in a loan is sold without recourse, a proportionate amount of borrower stock may be retired, but in no event may stock be retired below the institution's minimum stock purchase requirements for the interest retained.


(iv) If an institution repurchases a loan on which the stock has been retired, the borrower shall be required to repurchase stock in the amount of the minimum stock purchase requirement.


(2) *Loans sold into a secondary market.* An institution's bylaws may provide that all outstanding voting stock held by a borrower with respect to a loan shall be retired when the loan is sold into a secondary market.


(d) *Applicability.* In the case of a loan sold into a secondary market under title VIII of the Act, paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(2) of this section apply regardless of whether the institution retains a subordinated participation interest in a loan or pool of loans or contributes to a cash reserve.
