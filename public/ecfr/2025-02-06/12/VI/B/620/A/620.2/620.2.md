(f) No disclosure required by subparts B and E of this part shall be deemed to violate any regulation of the Farm Credit Administration.


(g) Each Farm Credit institution shall present its reports in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and in a manner that provides the most meaningful disclosure to shareholders.

The combined bank and association financial information may either be in the footnotes of the bank's annual report or located in a supplement to the report. All combined information provided through either a footnote or a supplement will be considered part of the bank's annual report, subject to the same annual report preparation, distribution, and accuracy requirements of part 620.

(2) Each association must state, in a prominent location within each report: 


(i) That the shareholders' investment in the association may be materially affected by the financial condition and results of operations of the related bank; 


(ii) That (if not otherwise provided) a copy of the bank's financial reports to shareholders will be made available free of charge on request; and 


(iii) The telephone numbers and addresses (including information on any other distribution method the association makes available) where shareholders can request or obtain copies of the related bank's financial reports. 


(3) Each institution shall, after receiving a request for a report, provide the report to the requestor. The first copy of the requested report shall be provided to the requestor free of charge.


(i) Any events that have affected one or more related organizations of the reporting institution that are likely to have a material effect on the financial condition, results of operations, cost of funds, or reliability of sources of funds of the reporting institution shall be considered significant events for the reporting institution and shall be disclosed in the reports. Any significant event affecting the reporting institution that occurred during the preceding fiscal quarters that continues to have a material effect on the reporting institution shall be considered significant events of the current fiscal quarter and shall be disclosed in the reports.
