(a) Each institution of the Farm Credit System must:


(1) Prepare and send to the Farm Credit Administration an electronic copy of its quarterly report within 40 calendar days after the end of each fiscal quarter, except that no report need be prepared for the fiscal quarter that coincides with the end of the fiscal year of the institution;


(2) Publish a copy of its quarterly report on its Web site when it electronically sends the report to the Farm Credit Administration; and


(3) Ensure the report complies with the applicable provisions of §§ 620.2 and 620.3.


(b) The report shall contain, at a minimum, the information specified in § 620.11 and, in addition, such other material information (including significant events) as is necessary to make the required disclosures, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.


(c) Institutions may use the quarterly report to deliver any notice required under § 620.15. Notices required under § 620.17 must be issued separately from the quarterly report, unless otherwise authorized by the Farm Credit Administration.
