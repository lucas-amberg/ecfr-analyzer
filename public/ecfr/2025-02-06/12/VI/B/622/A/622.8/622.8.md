# ยง 622.8   Rules of evidence.

(a) *Evidence.* Every party shall have the right to present a case or defense by oral and documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. Irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded. 


(b) *Objections.* Objections to the admission or exclusion of evidence shall be in short form, stating the grounds of objection relied upon but no argument thereon shall be permitted, except as ordered, allowed, or requested by the presiding officer. Rulings on such objections and all other matters shall be part of the transcript. Failure to object timely to the admission or exclusion of evidence or to any ruling constitutes a waiver of such objection. 


(c) *Stipulations.* Independently of the orders or rulings issued as provided by ยง 622.7(b), the parties may stipulate as to any relevant matters of fact or the authenticity of any relevant documents. Such stipulations may be received in evidence at the hearing, and when so received shall be binding on the parties with respect to the matters therein stipulated. 


(d) *Official notice.* All matters officially noticed by the presiding officer shall appear on the record.
