# Appendix A to Part 628—Loan-to-Value Limits for High Volatility Commercial Real Estate Exposures


Table A sets forth the loan-to-value limits specified in paragraph (2)(iv)(A) of the definition of high volatility commercial real estate exposure in § 628.2.


The loan-to-value limits should be applied to the underlying property that collateralizes the loan. For loans that fund multiple phases of the same real estate project (*e.g.,* a loan for both land development and construction of an office building), the appropriate loan-to-value limit is the limit applicable to the final phase of the project funded by the loan; however, loan disbursements should not exceed actual development or construction outlays. In situations where a loan is fully cross-collateralized by two or more properties or is secured by a collateral pool of two or more properties, the appropriate maximum loan amount under loan-to-value limits is the sum of the value of each property, less senior liens, multiplied by the appropriate loan-to-value limit for each property. To ensure that collateral margins remain within the limits, System institutions should redetermine conformity whenever collateral substitutions are made to the collateral pool.
