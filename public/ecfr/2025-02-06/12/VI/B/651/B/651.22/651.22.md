# ยง 651.22   Conflict-of-interest policy.

The Corporation shall establish and administer a conflict-of-interest policy that will provide reasonable assurance that the directors, officers, employees, and agents of the Corporation discharge their official responsibilities in an objective and impartial manner in furtherance of the interests and statutory purposes of the Corporation. The policy shall, at a minimum:


(a) Define the types of transactions, relationships, or activities that could reasonably be expected to give rise to potential conflicts of interest. For the purpose of determining whether a potential conflict of interest exists, the following interests shall be imputed to a person subject to this regulation as if they were that person's own interests:


(1) Interests of any individual residing in that person's household;


(2) Interests of any individual identified as a legal dependent of that person;


(3) Interests of that person's general business partner;


(4) Interests of an organization or entity that the person serves as officer, director, trustee, general partner or employee; and


(5) Interests of a person, organization, or entity with which that person is negotiating for or has an arrangement concerning current or prospective employment.


(b) Require each director, officer, and employee to report in writing, annually, and at such other times as conflicts may arise, sufficient information about financial interests, transactions, relationships, and activities to inform the Corporation of potential conflicts of interest;


(c) Require each director, officer, and employee who had no transaction, relationship, or activity required to be reported under paragraph (b) of this section at any time during the year to file a signed statement to that effect;


(d) Establish guidelines for determining when a potential conflict is material in accordance with this subpart;


(e) Establish procedures for resolving or disclosing material conflicts of interest.


(f) Provide internal controls to ensure that reports are filed as required and that conflicts are resolved or disclosed in accordance with this subpart.


(g) Notify directors, officers, and employees of the conflict-of-interest policy and any subsequent changes thereto and allow them a reasonable period of time to conform to the policy.
