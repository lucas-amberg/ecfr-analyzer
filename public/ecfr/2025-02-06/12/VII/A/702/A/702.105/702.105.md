# § 702.105   Derivative contracts.

(a) *OTC interest rate derivative contracts*—(1) *Exposure amount*—(i) *Single OTC interest rate derivative contract.* Except as modified by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the exposure amount for a single OTC interest rate derivative contract that is not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement is equal to the sum of the credit union's current credit exposure and potential future credit exposure (PFE) on the OTC interest rate derivative contract.


(A) *Current credit exposure.* The current credit exposure for a single OTC interest rate derivative contract is the greater of the fair value of the OTC interest rate derivative contract or zero.


(B) *PFE.* (*1*) The PFE for a single OTC interest rate derivative contract, including an OTC interest rate derivative contract with a negative fair value, is calculated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the OTC interest rate derivative contract by the appropriate conversion factor in Table 1 of this section.


(*2)* A credit union must use an OTC interest rate derivative contract's effective notional principal amount (that is, the apparent or stated notional principal amount multiplied by any multiplier in the OTC interest rate derivative contract) rather than the apparent or stated notional principal amount in calculating PFE.


(ii) *Multiple OTC interest rate derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement.* Except as modified by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the exposure amount for multiple OTC interest rate derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement is equal to the sum of the net current credit exposure and the adjusted sum of the PFE amounts for all OTC interest rate derivative contracts subject to the qualifying master netting agreement.


(A) *Net current credit exposure.* The net current credit exposure is the greater of the net sum of all positive and negative fair value of the individual OTC interest rate derivative contracts subject to the qualifying master netting agreement or zero.


(B) *Adjusted sum of the PFE amounts (Anet).* The adjusted sum of the PFE amounts is calculated as Anet = (0.4 × Agross) + (0.6 × NGR × Agross), where:


(*1*) Agross equals the gross PFE (that is, the sum of the PFE amounts as determined under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section for each individual derivative contract subject to the qualifying master netting agreement); and


(*2*) Net-to-gross Ratio (NGR) equals the ratio of the net current credit exposure to the gross current credit exposure. In calculating the NGR, the gross current credit exposure equals the sum of the positive current credit exposures (as determined under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section) of all individual derivative contracts subject to the qualifying master netting agreement.


(2) *Recognition of credit risk mitigation of collateralized OTC derivative contracts.* A credit union may recognize credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures an OTC derivative contract or multiple OTC derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement (netting set) by following the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.


(b) *Cleared transactions for interest rate derivatives*—(1) *General requirements.* A credit union must use the methodologies described in paragraph (b) of this section to calculate risk-weighted assets for a cleared transaction.


(2) *Risk-weighted assets for cleared transactions.* (i) To determine the risk weighted asset amount for a cleared transaction, a credit union must multiply the trade exposure amount for the cleared transaction, calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, by the risk weight appropriate for the cleared transaction, determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.


(ii) A credit union's total risk-weighted assets for cleared transactions is the sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts for all its cleared transactions.


(3) *Trade exposure amount.* For a cleared transaction the trade exposure amount equals:


(i) The exposure amount for the derivative contract or netting set of derivative contracts, calculated using the methodology used to calculate exposure amount for OTC interest rate derivative contracts under paragraph (a) of this section; plus


(ii) The fair value of the collateral posted by the credit union and held by the, clearing member, or custodian.


(4) *Cleared transaction risk weights.* A credit union must apply a risk weight of:


(i) Two percent if the collateral posted by the credit union to the DCO or clearing member is subject to an arrangement that prevents any losses to the credit union due to the joint default or a concurrent insolvency, liquidation, or receivership proceeding of the clearing member and any other clearing member clients of the clearing member; and the clearing member credit union has conducted sufficient legal review to conclude with a well-founded basis (and maintains sufficient written documentation of that legal review) that in the event of a legal challenge (including one resulting from an event of default or from liquidation, insolvency, or receivership proceedings) the relevant court and administrative authorities would find the arrangements to be legal, valid, binding and enforceable under the law of the relevant jurisdictions; or


(ii) Four percent if the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(i) are not met.


(5) *Recognition of credit risk mitigation of collateralized OTC derivative contracts.* A credit union may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures a cleared derivative contract by following the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.


(c) *Recognition of credit risk mitigation of collateralized interest rate derivative contracts.* (1) A credit union may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures an OTC interest rate derivative contract or multiple interest rate derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement (netting set) or clearing arrangement by using the simple approach in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.


(2) As an alternative to the simple approach, a credit union may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures such a contract or netting set if the financial collateral is marked-to-fair value on a daily basis and subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement by applying a risk weight to the exposure as if it were uncollateralized and adjusting the exposure amount calculated under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section using the collateral approach in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The credit union must substitute the exposure amount calculated under paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section in the equation in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.


(3) *Collateralized transactions*—(i) *General.* A credit union may use the approach in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section to recognize the risk-mitigating effects of financial collateral.


(ii) *Simple collateralized derivatives approach.* To qualify for the simple approach, the financial collateral must meet the following requirements:


(A) The collateral must be subject to a collateral agreement for at least the life of the exposure;


(B) The collateral must be revalued at least every six months; and


(C) The collateral and the exposure must be denominated in the same currency.


(iii) *Risk weight substitution.* (A) A credit union may apply a risk weight to the portion of an exposure that is secured by the fair value of financial collateral (that meets the requirements for the simple collateralized approach of this section) based on the risk weight assigned to the collateral as established under § 702.104(c).


(B) A credit union must apply a risk weight to the unsecured portion of the exposure based on the risk weight applicable to the exposure under this subpart.


(iv) *Exceptions to the 20 percent risk weight floor and other requirements.* Notwithstanding the simple collateralized derivatives approach in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section:


(A) A credit union may assign a zero percent risk weight to an exposure to a derivatives contract that is marked-to-market on a daily basis and subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement, to the extent the contract is collateralized by cash on deposit.


(B) A credit union may assign a 10 percent risk weight to an exposure to a derivatives contract that is marked-to-market daily and subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement, to the extent that the contract is collateralized by an exposure that qualifies for a zero percent risk weight under § 702.104(c)(2)(i).


(v) A credit union may assign a zero percent risk weight to the collateralized portion of an exposure where:


(A) The financial collateral is cash on deposit; or


(B) The financial collateral is an exposure that qualifies for a zero percent risk weight under § 702.104(c)(2)(i), and the credit union has discounted the fair value of the collateral by 20 percent.


(4) *Collateral haircut approach.* (i) A credit union may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures a collateralized derivative contract by using the standard supervisory haircuts in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.


(ii) The collateral haircut approach applies to both OTC and cleared interest rate derivatives contracts discussed in this section.


(iii) A credit union must determine the exposure amount for a collateralized derivative contracts by setting the exposure amount equal to the max {0,[(exposure amount − value of collateral) + (sum of current fair value of collateral instruments * market price volatility haircut of the collateral instruments)]}, where:


(A) The value of the exposure equals the exposure amount for OTC interest rate derivative contracts (or netting set) calculated under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.


(B) The value of the exposure equals the exposure amount for cleared interest rate derivative contracts (or netting set) calculated under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.


(C) The value of the collateral is the sum of cash and all instruments under the transaction (or netting set).


(D) The sum of current fair value of collateral instruments as of the measurement date.


(E) A credit union must use the standard supervisory haircuts for market price volatility in Table 2 to this section.


(d) *All other derivative contracts and transactions.* Credit unions must follow the requirements of the applicable provisions of 12 CFR part 324, when assigning risk weights to exposure amounts for derivatives contracts not addressed in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section.
