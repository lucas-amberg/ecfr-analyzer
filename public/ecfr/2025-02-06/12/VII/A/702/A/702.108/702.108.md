(b) *Discretionary supervisory actions by NCUA.* Subject to the applicable procedures for issuing, reviewing and enforcing directives set forth in subpart L of part 747 of this chapter, the NCUA Board may, by directive, take one or more of the following actions with respect to any significantly undercapitalized credit union, or a director, officer or employee of such credit union, if it determines that those actions are necessary to carry out the purpose of this part:


(1) *Requiring prior approval for acquisitions, branching, new lines of business.* Prohibit a credit union from, directly or indirectly, acquiring any interest in any business entity or financial institution, establishing or acquiring any additional branch office, or engaging in any new line of business, except as provided in § 702.107(b)(1);


(2) *Restricting transactions with and ownership of CUSO.* Restrict the credit union's transactions with a CUSO, or require the credit union to divest or reduce its ownership interest in a CUSO;

(6) *Prohibiting nonmember deposits.* Prohibit the credit union from accepting all or certain nonmember deposits;


(7) *New election of directors.* Order a new election of the credit union's board of directors;


(8) *Dismissing director or senior executive officer.* Require the credit union to dismiss from office any director or senior executive officer, *provided however,* that a dismissal under this clause shall not be construed to be a formal administrative action for removal under 12 U.S.C. 1786(g);


(9) *Employing qualified senior executive officer.* Require the credit union to employ qualified senior executive officers (who, if the NCUA Board so specifies, shall be subject to its approval);


(10) *Restricting senior executive officers' compensation.* Except with the prior written approval of the NCUA Board, limit compensation to any senior executive officer to that officer's average rate of compensation (excluding bonuses and profit sharing) during the four (4) calendar quarters preceding the effective date of classification of the credit union as significantly undercapitalized, and prohibit payment of a bonus or profit share to such officer;


(11) *Other actions to carry out prompt corrective action.* Restrict or require such other action by the credit union as the NCUA Board determines will carry out the purpose of this part better than any of the actions prescribed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (10) of this section; and


(12) *Requiring merger.* Require the credit union to merge with another financial institution if one or more grounds exist for placing the credit union into conservatorship pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1786(h)(1)(F), or into liquidation pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1787(a)(3)(A)(i).


(c) *Discretionary conservatorship or liquidation if no prospect of becoming adequately capitalized.* Notwithstanding any other actions required or permitted to be taken under this section, when a credit union becomes significantly undercapitalized (including by reclassification under § 702.102(b)), the NCUA Board may place the credit union into conservatorship pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1786(h)(1)(F), or into liquidation pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1787(a)(3)(A)(i), provided that the credit union has no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized.
