(b) *Payment of dividends and interest refunds.* The board of directors must not pay a dividend or interest refund that will cause the credit union's capital classification to fall below adequately capitalized under this subpart unless the appropriate Regional Director and, if state-chartered, the appropriate state official, have given prior written approval (in an NWRP or otherwise). The request for written approval must include the plan for eliminating any negative retained earnings balance.
