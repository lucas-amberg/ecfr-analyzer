# § 702.205   Prompt corrective action for uncapitalized new credit unions.

(a) *Mandatory supervisory actions by new credit union.* Beginning on the effective date of classification as uncapitalized, a new credit union must—


(1) *Earnings retention.* Increase the dollar amount of its net worth by the amount reflected in the credit union's approved initial or revised business plan;


(2) *Submit revised business plan.* Submit a revised business plan within the time provided by § 702.206, providing for alternative means of funding the credit union's earnings deficit, if the credit union either:


(i) Has not increased its net worth ratio consistent with its then-present approved business plan;


(ii) Has no then-present approved business plan; or


(iii) Has failed to comply with paragraph (a)(3) of this section; and


(3) *Restrict member business loans.* Not increase the total dollar amount of member business loans as provided in § 702.204(a)(3).


(b) *Discretionary supervisory actions by NCUA.* Subject to the procedures set forth in subpart L of part 747 of this chapter for issuing, reviewing and enforcing directives, the NCUA Board may, by directive, take one or more of the actions prescribed in § 702.109(b) if the credit union's net worth ratio has not increased consistent with its then-present business plan, or the credit union has failed to undertake any mandatory supervisory action prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section.


(c) *Mandatory liquidation or conservatorship.* Notwithstanding any other actions required or permitted to be taken under this section, the NCUA Board—


(1) *Plan not submitted.* May place into liquidation pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1787(a)(3)(A)(ii), or conservatorship pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1786(h)(1)(F), an uncapitalized new credit union which fails to submit a revised business plan within the time provided under paragraph (a)(2) of this section; or


(2) *Plan rejected, approved, implemented.* Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, must place into liquidation pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1787(a)(3)(A)(ii), or conservatorship pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1786(h)(1)(F), an uncapitalized new credit union that remains uncapitalized one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after the later of:


(i) The effective date of classification as uncapitalized; or


(ii) The last day of the calendar month following expiration of the time period provided in the credit union's initial business plan (approved at the time its charter was granted) to remain uncapitalized, regardless whether a revised business plan was rejected, approved or implemented.


(3) *Exception.* The NCUA Board may decline to place a new credit union into liquidation or conservatorship as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section if the credit union documents to the NCUA Board why it is viable and has a reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized.


(d) *Discretionary liquidation of an uncapitalized new credit union.* In lieu of paragraph (c) of this section, an uncapitalized new credit union may be placed into liquidation on grounds of insolvency pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1787(a)(1)(A).
