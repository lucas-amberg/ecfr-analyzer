# § 702.306   Annual supervisory stress testing.

(a) *General requirements.* Only tier II and tier III credit unions are required to conduct supervisory stress tests. The supervisory stress tests consist of a baseline scenario, and stress scenarios, which NCUA will provide by February 28 of each year. The tests will be based on the credit union's financial data as of December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or such other date as directed by NCUA. The tests will take into account all relevant exposures and activities of the credit union to evaluate its ability to absorb losses in specified scenarios over a planning horizon.


(b) *Credit union-run supervisory stress tests*—(1) *General.* All supervisory stress tests must be conducted according to NCUA's instructions.


(2) *Tier III credit unions.* When conducting its stress test, a tier III credit union must apply the minimum stress test capital ratio to all time periods in the planning horizon. The minimum stress test capital ratio is 5 percent.


(3) *NCUA tests.* NCUA reserves the right to conduct the tests described in this section on any covered credit union at any time. Where both NCUA and a covered credit union have conducted the tests, the results of NCUA's tests will determine whether the covered credit union has met the requirements of this subpart.


(c) *Potential impact on capital.* In conducting stress tests under this subpart, the credit union, or the NCUA if it elects to conduct the stress test under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, will estimate the following for each scenario during each quarter of the planning horizon:


(1) Losses, pre-provision net revenues, loan and lease loss provisions, and net income; and


(2) The potential impact on the stress test capital ratio, incorporating the effects of any capital action over the planning horizon and maintenance of an allowance for loan losses appropriate for credit exposures throughout the horizon. The credit union, or the NCUA if it elects to conduct the stress test under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, will conduct the stress tests without assuming any risk mitigation actions on the part of the credit union, except those existing and identified as part of the credit union's balance sheet, or off-balance sheet positions, such as derivative positions, on the date of the stress test.




(d) *Information collection.* Upon request, the covered credit union must provide NCUA with any relevant qualitative or quantitative information requested by NCUA pertinent to the capital plans or stress tests under this part.








(e) *Stress test results.* A credit union required to conduct stress tests under this section must incorporate the results of its tests in its capital plan. A credit union required to conduct stress tests must submit its stress test results to NCUA by May 31 of each year.


(f) *Supervisory actions.* (1) If a credit union-run stress test shows a tier III credit union does not have the ability to maintain a stress test capital ratio of 5 percent or more under expected and stressed conditions in each quarter of the planning horizon, the credit union must incorporate, into its capital plan, a stress test capital enhancement plan that shows how it will meet that target.


(2) If an NCUA-run stress test shows that a tier III credit union does not have the ability to maintain a stress test capital ratio of 5 percent or more under expected and stressed conditions in each quarter of the planning horizon, the credit union must provide NCUA, by November 30 of the calendar year in which NCUA conducted the tests, a stress test capital enhancement plan showing how it will meet that target.


(3) A tier III credit union operating without an NCUA approved stress test capital enhancement plan required under this section may be subject to supervisory actions.


(g) *Consultation on proposed action.* Before taking any action under this section against a federally insured, state-chartered credit union, NCUA will consult and work cooperatively with the appropriate State official.
