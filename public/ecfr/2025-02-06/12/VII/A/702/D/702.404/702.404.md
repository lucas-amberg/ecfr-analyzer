(1) Be in the form of a written, unconditional promise to pay on a specified date a sum certain in money in return for adequate consideration in money;




(2) Have, at the time of issuance, a fixed stated maturity of at least five years. The stated maturity of the Subordinated Debt Note may not reset and may not contain an option to extend the maturity. A credit union seeking to issue Subordinated Debt Notes with maturities longer than 20 years from the date of issuance must provide the information required in § 702.408(b)(14) as part of its application for preapproval to issue Subordinated Debt;






(3) Be subordinate to all other claims in liquidation under § 709.5(b) of this chapter, and have the same payout priority as all other outstanding Subordinated Debt and Grandfathered Secondary Capital;


(4) Be properly characterized as debt in accordance with U.S. GAAP;


(5) Be unsecured, including, without limitation, prohibiting the establishment of any legally enforceable claim against funds earmarked for payment of the Subordinated Debt through:


(i) A compensating balance or any other funds or assets subject to a legal right of offset, as defined by applicable state law; or


(ii) A sinking fund, such as a fund formed by periodically setting aside money for the gradual repayment of the Subordinated Debt;


(6) Be applied by the Issuing Credit Union at the end of each of its fiscal years (or more frequently as determined by the Issuing Credit Union) in which the Subordinated Debt remains outstanding to cover any deficit in Retained Earnings on a pro rata basis among all holders of the Subordinated Debt and Grandfathered Secondary Capital of the Issuing Credit Union; it being understood that any amounts applied to cover a deficit in Retained Earnings shall no longer be considered due and payable to the holder(s) of the Subordinated Debt or Grandfathered Secondary Capital;


(7) Except as provided in §§ 702.411 and 702.412(c), be payable in full by the Issuing Credit Union or its successor or assignee only at maturity;


(8) Disclose any prepayment penalties or restrictions on prepayment;


(9) Be offered, issued, and sold only to Entity Accredited Investors or Natural Person Accredited Investors, in accordance § 702.406; and


(10) Be re-offered, reissued, and resold only to an Entity Accredited Investor (if the initial offering, issuance, and sale was solely made to Entity Accredited Investors) or any Accredited Investor (if the initial offering, issuance, and sale involved one or more Natural Person Accredited Investors).


(b) *Restrictions.* The Subordinated Debt or the Subordinated Debt Note, as applicable, must not:


(1) Be structured or identified as a share, share account, or any other instrument in the Issuing Credit Union that is insured by the National Credit Union Administration;


(2) Include any express or implied terms that make it senior to any other Subordinated Debt issued under this subpart or Grandfathered Secondary Capital;


(3) Cause the Issuing Credit Union to exceed the borrowing limit in § 741.2 of this chapter or, for federally insured, state-chartered credit unions, any more restrictive state borrowing limit;


(4) Provide the holder thereof with any management or voting rights in the Issuing Credit Union;


(5) Be eligible to be pledged or provided by the investor as security for a loan from, or other obligation owing to, the Issuing Credit Union;


(6) Include any express or implied term, condition, or agreement that would require the Issuing Credit Union to prepay or accelerate payment of principal of or interest on the Subordinated Debt prior to maturity, including investor put options;


(7) Include an express or implied term, condition, or agreement that would trigger an event of default based on the Issuing Credit Union's default on other debts;


(8) Include any condition, restriction, or requirement based on the Issuing Credit Union's credit quality or other credit-sensitive feature; or


(9) Require the Issuing Credit Union to make any form of payment other than in cash.


(c) *Negative covenants.* A Subordinated Debt Note must not include any provision or covenant that unduly restricts or otherwise acts to unduly limit the authority of the Issuing Credit Union or interferes with the NCUA's supervision of the Issuing Credit Union. This includes, but is not limited to, a provision or covenant that:


(1) Requires the Issuing Credit Union to maintain a minimum amount of Retained Earnings or other metric, such as a minimum net worth ratio or minimum asset, liquidity, or loan ratios;


(2) Unreasonably restricts the Issuing Credit Union's ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional Subordinated Debt;


(3) Provides for default of the Subordinated Debt as a result of the Issuing Credit Union's compliance with any law, regulation, or supervisory directive from the NCUA or, if applicable, the state supervisory authority;


(4) Provides for default of the Subordinated Debt as the result of a change in the ownership, management, or organizational structure or charter of the Issuing Credit Union; provided that, following such change, the Issuing Credit Union or the resulting institution, as applicable:


(i) Agrees to perform all of the obligations, terms, and conditions of the Subordinated Debt; and


(ii) At the time of such change, is not in material default of any provision of the Subordinated Debt Note, after giving effect to the applicable cure period described in paragraph (d) of this section; and


(5) Provides for default of the Subordinated Debt as the result of an act or omission of any third party, including but not limited to a credit union service organization, as defined in § 712.1(d) of this chapter.


(d) *Default covenants.* A Subordinated Debt Note that includes default covenants must provide the Issuing Credit Union with a reasonable cure period of not less than 30 calendar days.


(e) *Minimum denominations of issuances to Natural Person Accredited Investors.* An Issuing Credit Union may only issue Subordinated Debt Notes to Natural Person Accredited Investors in minimum denominations of $100,000, and cannot exchange any such Subordinated Debt Notes after the initial issuance or any subsequent resale for Subordinated Debt Notes of the Issuing Credit Union in denominations less than $10,000. Each such Subordinated Debt Note, if issued in certificate form, must include a legend disclosing that it cannot be exchanged for Subordinated Debt Notes of the Issuing Credit Union in denominations less than $100,000, and Subordinated Debt Notes issued in book-entry or other uncertificated form shall include appropriate instructions prohibiting the exchange of such Subordinated Debt Notes for Subordinated Debt Notes of the Issuing Credit Union in denominations that would violate the foregoing restrictions.
