All approvals under this section are subject to the expiration limits specified in paragraph (k) of this section.


(b) *Initial application to issue Subordinated Debt.* A credit union requesting approval to issue Subordinated Debt must first submit an application to the Appropriate Supervision Office that, at a minimum, includes:


(1) A statement indicating how the credit union qualifies to issue Subordinated Debt given the eligibility requirements of § 702.403 with additional supporting analysis if anticipating to meet the requirements of a LICU or complex credit union within 24 months after issuance of the Subordinated Debt;


(2) The maximum aggregate principal amount of Subordinated Debt Notes and the maximum number of discrete issuances of Subordinated Debt Notes that the credit union is proposing to issue within the period allowed under paragraph (k) of this section;

(i) Compliance with all applicable Federal and state securities laws and regulations;

The schedule must include, as applicable, fees and expenses of counsel, auditors, any trustee or issuing and paying agent or any transfer agent, and printing and engraving expenses. If the amounts of any items are not known at the time of filing of the initial application, the credit union must provide estimates, clearly identified as such;


(12) In the case of a new credit union, a statement that it is subject to either an approved initial business plan or revised business plan, as required by this part, and how the proposed Subordinated Debt would conform with the approved plan. Unless the new credit union has a LICU designation pursuant to § 701.34 of this chapter, it must also include a plan for replacing the Subordinated Debt with Retained Earnings before the credit union ceases to meet the definition of new credit union in § 702.2;


(13) A statement describing any investments the credit union has in the Subordinated Debt of any other credit union, and the manner in which the credit union acquired such Subordinated Debt, including through a merger or other consolidation;

The NCUA will make any such requests in writing.


(ii) *Written determination.* Within 60 calendar days (which may be extended by the NCUA) after the date of receipt of each of the initial filing and each filing of additional information, clarifications, or amendments requested by the NCUA under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, the NCUA will provide the Issuing Credit Union with a written determination on the applicable filing. The written determination will include any requests for additional information, clarifications, or amendments, or a statement that the Offering Document is “approved for use.”


(2) *Filing of a final Offering Document.* At such time as the NCUA declares an Offering Document “approved for use” in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, the Issuing Credit Union may then use that Offering Document in the offer and sale of the Subordinated Debt Notes.

As described in this section, however, the Issuing Credit Union must file a copy of each of its Offering Documents with the NCUA within two business days after their respective first use.


(h) *Material changes to any initial application or Offering Document*—(1) *Reapproval of initial application.* If any material event arises or material change in fact occurs after the approval of the initial application by the NCUA, but prior to the completion of the offer and sale of the related Subordinated Debt Notes, then no person shall offer or sell Subordinated Debt Notes to any other person until an amendment to the Offering Document reflecting the event or change has been filed with and approved by the NCUA.


(2) *Reapproval of Offering Document.* If an Offering Document must be approved for use under paragraph (f) of this section, and any event arises or change in fact occurs after the approval for use of any Offering Document, and that event or change in fact, individually or in the aggregate, results in the Offering Document containing any untrue statement of material fact, or omitting to state a material fact necessary in order to make statements made in the Offering Document not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made, then no person shall offer or sell Subordinated Debt Notes to any other person until an amendment reflecting the event or change has been filed with and “approved for use” by the NCUA.


(3) *Failure to request reapproval.* If an Issuing Credit Union fails to comply with paragraph (h)(1) or (2) of this section, the NCUA may, at its discretion, exercise the full range of administrative remedies available under the FCU Act, including:


(i) Prohibiting the Issuing Credit Union from issuing any additional Subordinated Debt for a specified period; and/or


(ii) Determining not to treat the Subordinated Debt as Regulatory Capital.


(i) *Notification.* Not later than 10 business days after the closing of a Subordinated Debt Note issuance and sale, the Issuing Credit Union must submit to the Appropriate Supervision Office:

This paragraph (j) does not prohibit an Issuing Credit Union from appealing an Appropriate Supervision Office's decision under subpart A of part 746 of this chapter.


(k) *Expiration of authority to issue Subordinated Debt.* (1) Any approvals to issue Subordinated Debt Notes under this section expire two years from the later of the date the Issuing Credit Union receives:


(i) Approval of its initial application, if the Issuing Credit Union is offering Subordinated Notes exclusively to Entity Accredited Investors; or


(ii) The initial approval for use of its Offering Document, if the Issuing Credit Union is offering Subordinated Debt Notes to any Natural Person Accredited Investors.


(2) Failure to issue all or part of the maximum aggregate principal amount of Subordinated Debt Notes approved in the initial application process within the applicable period specified in paragraph (k) of this section will result in the expiration of the NCUA's approval. An Issuing Credit Union may file a written extension request with the Appropriate Supervision Office. The Issuing Credit Union must demonstrate good cause for any extension(s), and must file the request at least 30 calendar days before the expiration of the applicable period specified in paragraph (k) of this section or any extensions granted under paragraph (k) of this section. In any such written application, the Issuing Credit Union must address whether any such extension poses any material securities law implications.




(l) *Filing requirements.* (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, all initial applications, Offering Documents, amendments, notices, or other documents must be filed electronically with the Appropriate Supervision Office. Documents may be signed electronically using the signature provision in 17 CFR 230.402 (Rule 402 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended).








(2) Provided the Issuing Credit Union filing the document has complied with all requirements regarding the filing in this section, the date of filing of the document is the date the NCUA receives the filing. An electronic filing that is submitted on a business day by direct transmission commencing on or before 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard or Daylight Savings Time, whichever is then currently in effect, would be deemed received by the NCUA on the same business day. An electronic filing that is submitted by direct transmission commencing after 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard or Daylight Savings Time, whichever is then currently in effect, or on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, would be deemed received by the NCUA on the next business day. If an electronic filer in good faith attempts to file a document with the NCUA in a timely manner, but the filing is delayed due to technical difficulties beyond the electronic filer's control, the electronic filer may request that the NCUA adjust the filing date of such document. The NCUA may grant the request if it appears that such adjustment is appropriate and consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.


(3) If an Issuing Credit Union experiences unanticipated technical difficulties preventing the timely preparation and submission of an electronic filing, the Issuing Credit Union may, upon notice to the Appropriate Supervision Office, file the subject filing in paper format no later than one business day after the date on which the filing was to be made.


(4) Any filing of amendments or supplements to an Offering Document must include two copies, one of which must be marked to indicate clearly and precisely, by underlining or in some other conspicuous manner, the changes made from the previously filed Offering Document.


(m) *Filing fees.* (1) The NCUA may require filing fees to accompany certain filings made under this subpart before it will accept those filings. If the NCUA requires the aforementioned filing fee, the NCUA will publish an applicable fee schedule on its website at *http://www.NCUA.gov.*

(2) Filing fees must be paid to the NCUA by electronic transfer.
