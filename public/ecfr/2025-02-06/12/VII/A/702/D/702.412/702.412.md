# ยง 702.412   Effect of a merger or dissolution on the treatment of Subordinated Debt as Regulatory Capital.

(a) In the event of a merger of an Issuing Credit Union into or the assumption of its Subordinated Debt by another federally insured credit union, the Subordinated Debt will be treated as Regulatory Capital only to the extent that the resulting credit union is either a LICU, a complex credit union, and/or a new credit union.


(b) In the event the resulting credit union is not a LICU, a complex credit union, or a new credit union, the Subordinated Debt of the merging credit union can either be:


(1) If permitted by the terms of the Subordinated Debt Note, repaid by the resulting credit union upon approval by the NCUA under ยง 702.411; or


(2) Continue to be held by the resulting credit union as Subordinated Debt, but will not be classified as Regulatory Capital under this subpart, unless the resulting credit union meets the eligibility requirements of ยง 702.403.


(c) In the event of a voluntary dissolution of an Issuing Credit Union that has outstanding Subordinated Debt, the Subordinated Debt may be repaid in full according to 12 CFR part 710, subject to the requirements in ยง 702.411.
