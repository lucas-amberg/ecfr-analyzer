# § 704.17   State-chartered corporate credit unions.

(a) This part does not expand the powers and authorities of any state-chartered corporate credit union, beyond those powers and authorities provided under the laws of the state in which it was chartered. 


(b) A state-chartered corporate credit union that is not insured by the NCUSIF, but that receives funds from federally insured credit unions, is considered an “institution-affiliated party” within the meaning of Section 206(r) of the Federal Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. 1786(r). 


(c) NCUA will notify, consult with, and provide explanation to the appropriate state supervisory authority before taking administrative action against a state-chartered corporate credit union.
