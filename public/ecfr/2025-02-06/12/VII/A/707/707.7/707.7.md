# § 707.7   Payment of dividends.

(a) *Permissible methods*—(1) *Balance on which dividends are calculated.* Credit unions shall calculate dividends on the full amount of principal in an account for each day by use of either the daily balance method or the average daily balance method. Credit unions shall calculate dividends by use of a daily rate of at least 
1/365 of the dividend rate. In a leap year a daily rate of 
1/366 of the dividend rate may be used.


(2) *Determination of minimum balance to earn dividends.* A credit union shall use the same method to determine any minimum balance required to earn dividends as it uses to determine the balance on which dividends are calculated. A credit union may use an additional method that is unequivocally beneficial to the member.


(b) *Compounding and crediting policies.* This section does not require credit unions to compound or credit dividends at any particular frequency.


(c) *Date dividends begin to accrue.* Dividends shall begin to accrue not later than the day specified in section 606 of the Expedited Funds Availability Act (12 U.S.C. 4005) and implementing Regulation CC (12 CFR part 229). Dividends shall accrue on funds until the day funds are withdrawn.
