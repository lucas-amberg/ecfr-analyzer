(1) A statement of the purpose of the meeting and the time and place;

(3) A Ballot for Merger Proposal.


(d) *Member information.* Within 30 calendar days of receiving the notice provided to members pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, members may jointly or individually submit a comment about the merger to the NCUA. The NCUA will post these comments on a website accessible to credit union members.


(e) *Posting member comments.* The NCUA reserves the right to not post comments that it reasonably believes:


(1) Are false or misleading with respect to any material fact;


(2) Omit a material fact necessary to make the statement in the material not false or misleading;


(3) Relate to a personal claim or personal grievance, or solicit personal gain or business advantage by or on behalf of any party;


(4) Address any matter, including a general economic, political, racial, religious, social, or similar cause that is not related to the proposed merger;


(5) Directly or indirectly and without expressed factual foundation impugn a person's character, integrity, or reputation;


(6) Directly or indirectly and without expressed factual foundation make charges concerning improper, illegal, or immoral conduct; or

(g) *Approval of a proposal to merge.* Approval of a proposal to merge a federally insured credit union into a federally insured credit union requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the merging credit union who vote on the proposal. Members must be members as of the record date to vote. If the continuing credit union is not federally insured, the requirements of subpart B of this part also apply, and the merging credit union must use the appropriate form ballot and notice in subpart C of this part unless the Regional Director approves the use of different forms. If the continuing credit union is federally insured, use of the sample form notice, ballot, and certification of vote forms in subpart C of this part will satisfy the requirements of this subpart.
