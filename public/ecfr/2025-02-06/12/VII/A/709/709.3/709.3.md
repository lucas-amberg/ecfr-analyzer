# ยง 709.3   Challenge to revocation of charter and involuntary liquidation.

If a Federal credit union is determined to be insolvent and placed into liquidation pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1787, the Federal credit union may, not later than 10 days after the date on which the Board closes the credit union for liquidation, apply to the United States District Court for the Judicial district in which the principal office of the credit union is located or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for an order requiring the Board to show cause why it should not be prohibited from continuing such liquidation. Notwithstanding other provisions of this part, the board of directors of the credit union may meet following the placing of the institution into liquidation for the sole purpose of considering and authorizing the filing of this action in the name of the credit union. No such action in the name of the credit union may be instituted without the authorization of the board of directors of the institution pursuant to a valid board of directors resolution. No credit union funds shall be available to pay expenses incurred in bringing a legal action to challenge the Board's liquidation action.
