# § 714.10   What other laws must you comply with when engaged in leasing?

You must comply with the Consumer Leasing Act, 15 U.S.C. 1667-67f, and its implementing regulation, Regulation M, 12 CFR part 1013. You must comply with state laws on consumer leasing, but only to the extent that the state leasing laws are consistent with the Consumer Leasing Act, 15 U.S.C. 1667e, or provide the member with greater protections or benefits than the Consumer Leasing Act. You are also subject to the lending rules set forth in § 701.21 of this chapter, except as provided in §§ 714.8 and 714.9 of this part. The lending rules in § 701.21 address the preemption of other state and federal laws that impact on credit transactions.
