# § 745.13   Notification to members/shareholders.

Each insured credit union shall provide notice to its members concerning NCUA insurance coverage of member accounts. This may be accomplished by placing either a copy of part 745 of these rules, the appendix, or one or more copies of the NCUA brochure “Your Insured Funds” in each branch office and main office of the credit union. Copies of these materials shall also be made available to members upon request. For purposes of this section, an automated teller machine or point of sale terminal is not a branch office.
