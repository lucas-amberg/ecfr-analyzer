# § 746.105   Procedures for reconsideration from the appropriate program office.

(a) *Reconsideration.* An insured credit union must make a written request for reconsideration from the appropriate program office prior to requesting review by the Director of the Office of Examination and Insurance pursuant to § 746.106 or filing an appeal with the Committee pursuant to § 746.107. Such a request must be made within 30 calendar days after receiving an examination report containing a material supervisory determination or other official written communication of a material supervisory determination. A request for reconsideration must be in writing and filed with the appropriate program office.


(b) *Content of request.* Any request for reconsideration must include:


(1) A statement of the facts on which the request for reconsideration is based;


(2) A statement of the basis for the material supervisory determination to which the insured credit union objects and the alleged error in such determination; and


(3) Any other evidence relied upon by the insured credit union that was not previously provided to the appropriate program office making the material supervisory determination.


(c) *Decision.* Within 30 calendar days after receiving a request for reconsideration, the appropriate program office shall issue a written decision, stating the reasons for the decision, and provide written notice of the right to file a request for review by the Director of the Office of Examination and Insurance pursuant to § 746.106 or file an appeal with the Committee pursuant to § 746.107. If a written decision is not issued within 30 calendar days, the request for reconsideration will be deemed to have been denied.


(d) *Subsequent requests for reconsideration.* Any subsequent request for reconsideration following an initial request made pursuant to this section will be treated as a request for review by the Director of the Office of Examination and Insurance pursuant to § 746.106 or an appeal to the Committee pursuant to § 746.107 as determined by the Secretary of the Board after consultation with the insured credit union.
