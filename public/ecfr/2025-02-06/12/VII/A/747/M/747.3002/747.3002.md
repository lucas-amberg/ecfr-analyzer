# § 747.3002   Review of orders imposing discretionary supervisory action.

(a) *Notice of intent to issue directive*—(1) *Generally.* Whenever the NCUA intends to issue a directive imposing a discretionary supervisory action under §§ 704.4(k)(2)(v) and 704.4(k)(3) of this chapter on a corporate credit union classified “undercapitalized” or lower, the NCUA will give the corporate credit union prior notice of the proposed action and an opportunity to respond.


(2) *Immediate issuance of directive without notice.* The NCUA may issue a directive to take effect immediately under paragraph (a)(1) of this section without notice to the corporate credit union if the NCUA finds it necessary in order to carry out the purposes of § 704.4 of this chapter. A corporate credit union that is subject to a directive which takes effect immediately may appeal the directive in writing to the NCUA Board (Board). Such an appeal must be received by the Board within 14 calendar days after the directive was issued, unless the Board permits a longer period. Unless ordered by the NCUA, the directive will remain in effect pending a decision on the appeal. The Board will consider any such appeal, if timely filed, within 60 calendar days of receiving it.


(b) *Contents of notice.* The NCUA's notice to a corporate credit union of its intention to issue a directive imposing a discretionary supervisory action will state:


(1) The corporate credit union's capital measures and capital category classification;


(2) The specific restrictions or requirements that the Board intends to impose, and the reasons therefore;


(3) The proposed date when the discretionary supervisory action would take effect and the proposed date for completing the required action or terminating the action; and


(4) That a corporate credit union must file a written response to a notice within 14 calendar days from the date of the notice, or within such shorter period as the Board determines is appropriate in light of the financial condition of the corporate credit union or other relevant circumstances.


(c) *Contents of response to notice.* A corporate credit union's response to a notice under paragraph (b) of this section must:


(1) Explain why it contends that the proposed discretionary supervisory action is not an appropriate exercise of discretion under this section;


(2) Request the Board to modify or to not issue the proposed directive; and


(3) Include other relevant information, mitigating circumstances, documentation, or other evidence in support of the corporate credit union's position regarding the proposed directive.


(d) *NCUA Board consideration of response.* The Board, or an independent person designated by the Board to act on the Board's behalf, after considering a response under paragraph (c) of this section, may:


(1) Issue the directive as originally proposed or as modified;


(2) Determine not to issue the directive and to so notify the corporate credit union; or


(3) Seek additional information or clarification from the corporate credit union or any other relevant source.


(e) *Failure to file response.* A corporate credit union which fails to file a written response to a notice of the Board's intention to issue a directive imposing a discretionary supervisory action, within the specified time period, will be deemed to have waived the opportunity to respond, and to have consented to the issuance of the directive.


(f) *Request to modify or rescind directive.* A corporate credit union that is subject to an existing directive imposing a discretionary supervisory action may request in writing that the Board reconsider the terms of the directive, or rescind or modify it, due to changed circumstances. Unless otherwise ordered by the Board, the directive will remain in effect while such request is pending. A request under this paragraph which remains pending 60 days following receipt by the Board is deemed granted.
