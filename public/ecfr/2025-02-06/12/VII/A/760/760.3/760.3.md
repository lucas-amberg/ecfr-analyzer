# § 760.3   Requirement to purchase flood insurance where available.

(a) *In general.* A credit union shall not make, increase, extend, or renew any designated loan unless the building or mobile home and any personal property securing the loan is covered by flood insurance for the term of the loan. The amount of insurance must be at least equal to the lesser of the outstanding principal balance of the designated loan or the maximum limit of coverage available for the particular type of property under the Act. Flood insurance coverage under the Act is limited to the building or mobile home and any personal property that secures a loan and not the land itself.


(b) *Table funded loan.* A credit union that acquires a loan from a mortgage broker or other entity through table funding shall be considered to be making a loan for the purposes of this part.


(c) *Private flood insurance*—(1) *Mandatory acceptance.* A credit union must accept private flood insurance, as defined in § 760.2, in satisfaction of the flood insurance purchase requirement in paragraph (a) of this section if the policy meets the requirements for coverage in paragraph (a) of this section.


(2) *Compliance aid for mandatory acceptance.* A credit union may determine that a policy meets the definition of private flood insurance in § 760.2, without further review of the policy, if the following statement is included within the policy or as an endorsement to the policy: “This policy meets the definition of private flood insurance contained in 42 U.S.C. 4012a(b)(7) and the corresponding regulation.”


(3) *Discretionary acceptance.* A credit union may accept a flood insurance policy issued by a private insurer that is not issued under the NFIP and that does not meet the definition of private flood insurance in § 760.2 in satisfaction of the flood insurance purchase requirement in paragraph (a) of this section if the policy:


(i) Provides coverage in the amount required by paragraph (a) of this section;


(ii) Is issued by an insurer that is licensed, admitted, or otherwise approved to engage in the business of insurance by the insurance regulator of the State or jurisdiction in which the property to be insured is located; or in the case of a policy of difference in conditions, multiple peril, all risk, or other blanket coverage insuring nonresidential commercial property, is issued by a surplus lines insurer recognized, or not disapproved, by the insurance regulator of the State or jurisdiction where the property to be insured is located;


(iii) Covers both the mortgagor(s) and the mortgagee(s) as loss payees, except in the case of a policy that is provided by a condominium association, cooperative, homeowners association, or other applicable group and for which the premium is paid by the condominium association, cooperative, homeowners association, or other applicable group as a common expense; and


(iv) Provides sufficient protection of the designated loan, consistent with general safety and soundness principles, and the credit union documents its conclusion regarding sufficiency of the protection of the loan in writing.


(4) *Mutual aid societies.* Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a credit union may accept a plan issued by a mutual aid society, as defined in § 760.2, in satisfaction of the flood insurance purchase requirement in paragraph (a) of this section if:


(i) The NCUA has determined that such plans qualify as flood insurance for purposes of the Act;


(ii) The plan provides coverage in the amount required by paragraph (a) of this section;


(iii) The plan covers both the mortgagor(s) and the mortgagee(s) as loss payees; and


(iv) The plan provides sufficient protection of the designated loan, consistent with general safety and soundness principles, and the credit union documents its conclusion regarding sufficiency of the protection of the loan in writing.
