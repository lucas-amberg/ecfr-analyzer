# ยง 792.26   Will I be asked to pay fees in advance?

NCUA will require you to give an assurance of payment or an advance payment only when:


(a) NCUA estimates or determines that allowable charges that you may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250. NCUA will notify you of the likely cost and obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment where you have a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees, or require an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated charges in the case where you have no history of payment; or


(b) You have previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timely fashion. NCUA may require you to pay the full amount owed, plus any applicable interest, or demonstrate that you have, in fact, paid the fee, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before we begin to process a new request or a pending request from you.


(c) If you are required to make an advance payment of fees, then the administrative time limits prescribed in ยง 792.16 will begin only after NCUA has received the fee payments described.
