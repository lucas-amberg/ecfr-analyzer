# ยง 792.02   What records does NCUA make available to the public for inspection and copying?

Except for records that are exempt from public disclosure under FOIA as amended (5 U.S.C. 552) or are promptly published and copies are available for purchase, NCUA routinely makes the following five types of records available for you to inspect and copy and in an electronic format:


(a) Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, and orders made in the adjudication of cases;


(b) Statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted by the agency but not published in the _Federal Register_;


(c) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public;


(d) Copies of all records, regardless of form or format, which have been released after March 31, 1997, in response to a FOIA request and which, because of the nature of their subject matter, NCUA determines have been or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests; or records that have been requested three (3) or more times; and


(e) Indices of the documents referred to in this paragraph.
