If an application is for other than individual unsecured credit, a creditor may inquire about the applicant's marital status, but shall use only the terms *married, unmarried,* and *separated.* A creditor may explain that the category unmarried includes single, divorced, and widowed persons.


(2) *Disclosure about income from alimony, child support, or separate maintenance.* A creditor shall not inquire whether income stated in an application is derived from alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments unless the creditor discloses to the applicant that such income need not be revealed if the applicant does not want the creditor to consider it in determining the applicant's creditworthiness.


(3) *Childbearing, childrearing.* A creditor shall not inquire about birth control practices, intentions concerning the bearing or rearing of children, or capability to bear children.
