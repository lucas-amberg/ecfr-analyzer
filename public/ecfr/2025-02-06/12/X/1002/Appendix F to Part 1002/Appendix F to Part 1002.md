# Appendix F to Part 1002—Tolerances for Bona Fide Errors in Data Reported Under Subpart B


As set out in § 1002.112(b) and in comment 112(b)-1, a financial institution is presumed to maintain procedures reasonably adapted to avoid errors with respect to a given data field if the number of errors found in a random sample of a financial institution's data submission for a given data field do not equal or exceed the threshold in column C of the following table (Table 1, Tolerance Thresholds for Bona Fide Errors):


The size of the random sample, under column B, shall depend on the size of the financial institution's small business lending application register, as shown in column A of the Threshold Table.


The thresholds in column C of the Threshold Table reflect the number of unintentional errors a financial institution may make within a particular data field (*e.g.,* the credit product data field within the credit type data point or the ethnicity data field for a particular principal owner within the ethnicity, race, and sex of principal owners data point) in a small business lending application register that would be deemed bona fide errors for purposes of § 1002.112(b).


For instance, a financial institution that submitted a small business lending application register containing 105 applications would be subject to a threshold of three errors per data field. If the financial institution had made two errors in reporting loan amount and two errors reporting gross annual income, all of these errors would be covered by the bona fide error provision of § 1002.112(b) and would not constitute a violation of the Act or this part. If the same financial institution had made four errors in reporting loan amount and two errors reporting gross annual income, the bona fide error provision of § 1002.112(b) would not apply to the four loan amount errors but would still apply to the two gross annual income errors.


Even when the number of errors in a particular data field do not equal or exceed the threshold in column C, if either there is a reasonable basis to believe that errors in that field were intentional or there is evidence that the financial institution did not maintain procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such errors, then the errors are not bona fide errors under § 1002.112(b).


For purposes of determining bona fide errors under § 1002.112(b), the term “data field” generally refers to individual fields. Some data fields may allow for more than one response. For example, with respect to information on the ethnicity or race of an applicant's principal owners, a data field may identify more than one race or more than one ethnicity for a given person. If one or more of the ethnicities or races identified in a data field are erroneous, they count as one (and only one) error for that data field.
