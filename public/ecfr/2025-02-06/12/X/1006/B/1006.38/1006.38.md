# § 1006.38   Disputes and requests for original-creditor information.

(a) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:


(1) *Duplicative dispute* means a dispute submitted by the consumer in writing within the validation period that:


(i) Is substantially the same as a dispute previously submitted by the consumer in writing within the validation period for which the debt collector already has satisfied the requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section; and


(ii) Does not include new and material information to support the dispute.


(2) *Validation period* has the same meaning given to it in § 1006.34(b)(5).


(b) *Overshadowing of rights to dispute or request original-creditor information*—(1) *Prohibition.* During the validation period, a debt collector must not engage in any collection activities or communications that overshadow or are inconsistent with the disclosure of the consumer's rights to dispute the debt and to request the name and address of the original creditor.


(2) *Safe harbor.* A debt collector who uses Model Form B-1 in appendix B to this part in a manner described in § 1006.34(d)(2) has not thereby violated paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(c) *Requests for original-creditor information.* Upon receipt of a request for the name and address of the original creditor submitted by the consumer in writing within the validation period, a debt collector must cease collection of the debt until the debt collector:


(1) *In general.* Sends the name and address of the original creditor to the consumer in writing or electronically in the manner required by § 1006.42; or


(2) *Special rule if the current creditor and the original creditor are the same.* In lieu of taking the actions described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, reasonably determines that the original creditor is the same as the current creditor, notifies the consumer of that fact in writing or electronically in the manner required by § 1006.42, and refers the consumer to the validation information previously provided pursuant to § 1006.34(a)(1).


(d) *Disputes*—(1) *Failure to dispute.* The failure of a consumer to dispute the validity of a debt does not constitute a legal admission of liability by the consumer.


(2) *Response to disputes.* Upon receipt of a dispute submitted by the consumer in writing within the validation period, a debt collector must cease collection of the debt, or any disputed portion of the debt, until the debt collector:


(i) Sends a copy either of verification of the debt or of a judgment to the consumer in writing or electronically in the manner required by § 1006.42; or


(ii) In the case of a dispute that the debt collector reasonably determines is a duplicative dispute, either:


(A) Notifies the consumer in writing or electronically in the manner required by § 1006.42(a)(1) that the dispute is duplicative, provides a brief statement of the reasons for the determination, and refers the consumer to the debt collector's response to the earlier dispute; or


(B) Satisfies paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.
