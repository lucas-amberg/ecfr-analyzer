# Appendix A to Part 1010—Standard and Model Forms and Clauses






I hereby affirm that all of the requirements of the MSA exemption as set forth in 15 U.S.C. 1702(b)(8) and 12 CFR 1010.13 have been met in the sale or lease of the lot(s) described above.


I also affirm that I submit to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act with regard to the sale or lease cited above.


You have the option to cancel your contract or agreement of sale by notice to the seller until midnight of the seventh day following the date of signing of the contract or agreement.


If you did not receive a Lot Information Statement prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection in advance of your signing the contract or agreement, the contract or agreement of sale may be cancelled at your option for two years from the date of signing.


(Use of the following headings and first paragraph are mandatory.)


The developer has obtained a regulatory exemption from registration under the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act. One requirement of that exemption is that you must receive this Statement prior to the time you sign an agreement (contract) to purchase a lot.


(Under this heading the developer is to state the specific rescission rights provided for in the contract pursuant to 1010.15(b)(5)(i)).


(Under this heading the developer is to list the following information:)


There are certain risks in purchasing real estate that you should be aware of. The following are some of those risks:


The future value of land is uncertain and dependent upon many factors. Do not expect all land to automatically increase in value.


Any value which your lot may have will be affected if roads, utilities and/or amenities cannot be completed or maintained.


Any development will likely have some impact on the surrounding environment. Development which adversely affects the environment may cause governmental agencies to impose restriction on the use of the land.


In the purchase of real estate, many technical requirements must be met to assure that you receive proper title and that you will be able to use the land for its intended purpose. Since this purchase involves a major expenditure of money, it is recommended that you seek professional advice before you obligate yourself.


If adequate provisions have not been made for maintenance of the roads or if the land is not served by publicly maintained roads, you may have to maintain the roads at your expense.


If the land is not served by a central sewage system and/or water system, you should contact the local authorities to determine whether a permit will be given for an on-site sewage disposal system and/or well and whether there is an adequate supply of water. You should also become familiar with the requirements for, and the cost of, obtaining electrical service to the lot.


(Under this heading the developer is to list the following information:)


(Under this heading the developer is to list the following information:)


(Enter a statement disclosing all liens, reservations, taxes, assessments, easements and restrictions applicable to the lot. A copy of the restrictions may be attached in lieu of recitation.)


(Under this heading the developer is to list the name, address and phone number of the appropriate governmental agency or agencies, if any, that will provide information on permits or other requirements for water, sewer and electrical installations. The information will also contain the name, address and telephone number of the suppliers of such utilities which can provide information to the purchaser on costs and availability of such services. A chart similar to the one below may be used to supply this information).


Listed below are contact points for determining permit requirements, if any, and to obtain information on approximate costs and availability for the listed services:


If misrepresentations are made in the sale of this lot to you, you may have rights under the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act. If you have evidence of any scheme, artifice or device used to defraud you, you may wish to contact: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Interstate Land Sales Registration Program, 1700 G Street NW., Washington DC 20552.

Here we discuss the roads that lead to the subdivision, those within the subdivision and the location of nearby communities.


ACCESS TO THE SUBDIVISION.


County road #43 leads to the subdivision. It has two lanes and the width of the wearing surface is 22 feet. It's paved with a macadam surface.


This road is maintained by Bottineau County with County funds. No improvements are planned at this time.


ACCESS WITHIN THE SUBDIVISION.


The roads within the subdivision will be located on rights of way dedicated to the public.


We are responsible for constructing the interior roads. There will be no additional cost to you for this construction.


WE HAVE NOT SET ASIDE ANY FUNDS IN AN ESCROW OR TRUST ACCOUNT OR MADE ANY OTHER FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS TO ASSURE COMPLETION OF THE ROADS, SO THERE IS NO ASSURANCE WE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE ROADS.


At present, the roads are under construction and do not provide access to the lots in Units 2 and 3 during wet weather. The succeeding chart describes their present condition and estimated completion dates.


This Report is prepared and issued by the developer of this subdivision. It is *not* prepared or issued by the Federal Government.


Federal law requires that you receive this Report prior to your signing a contract or agreement to buy or lease a lot in this subdivision. However, NO FEDERAL AGENCY HAS JUDGED THE MERITS OR VALUE, IF ANY, OF THIS PROPERTY.


If you received this Report prior to signing a contract or agreement, you may cancel your contract or agreement by giving notice to the seller any time before midnight of the seventh day following the signing of the contract or agreement.


If you did not receive this Report before you signed a contract or agreement, you may cancel the contract or agreement any time within two years from the date of signing.

(1) The future value of any land is uncertain and dependent upon many factors. DO NOT expect all land to increase in value.


(2) Any value which your lot may have will be affected if the roads, utilities and all proposed improvements are not completed. This paragraph may be omitted if all improvements have been completed or if no improvements are proposed.


(3) Resale of your lot may be difficult or impossible, since you may face the competition of our own sales program and local real estate brokers may not be interested in listing your lot.


(4) Any subdivision will have an impact on the surrounding environment. Whether or not the impact is adverse and the degree of impact, will depend on the location, size, planning and extent of development. Subdivisions which adversely affect the environment may cause governmental agencies to impose restrictions on the use of the land. Changes in plant and animal life, air and water quality and noise levels may affect your use and enjoyment of your lot and your ability to sell it.


(5) In the purchase of real estate, many technical requirements must be met to assure that you receive proper title. Since this purchase involves a major expenditure of money, it is recommended that you seek professional advice before you obligate yourself.


“This Report covers ____ lots located in ____________ County, (*State*). See Page ____ for a listing of these lots. It is estimated that this subdivision will eventually contain ____ lots.”


“The developer of this subdivision is:


“Answers to questions and information about this subdivision may be obtained by telephoning the developer at the number listed above.”


“A person with legal title to property generally has the right to own, use and enjoy the property. A contract to buy a lot may give you possession but doesn't give you legal title. You won't have legal title until you receive a valid deed. A restriction or an encumbrance on your lot, or on the subdivision, could adversely affect your title.”


“Here we will discuss the sales contract you will sign and the deed you will receive. We will also provide you with information about any land use restrictions and encumbrances, mortgages, or liens affecting your lot and some important facts about payments, recording, and title insurance.”


“The release provisions for the (indicate all or particular lots) have not been recorded. Therefore, they may not be honored by subsequent holders of the mortgage. If they are not honored, you may not be able to obtain clear title to a lot covered by this mortgage until we have paid the mortgage in full, even if you have paid the full purchase price of the lot. If we should default on the mortgage prior to obtaining a release of your lot, you may lose your lot and all monies paid.”


“The (state type of encumbrance) on (indicate all or particular lots) in this subdivision does not contain any provisions for the release of an individual lot when the full purchase price of the lot has been paid. Therefore, if your lot is subject to this (state type of encumbrance), you may not be able to obtain clear title to your lot until we have paid the (state type of encumbrance) in full, even though you may have received a deed and paid the full purchase price of the lot. If we should default on the (state type of encumbrance) prior to obtaining a release, you may lose your lot and all monies paid.”


“Unless your contract or deed is recorded you may lose your lot through the claims of subsequent purchasers or subsequent creditors of anyone having an interest in the land”.


“You may lose your (indicate deposit, down payment and/or installment payments) on your lot if we fail to deliver legal title to you as called for in the contract, because (they are/it is) not held in an escrow account which fully protects you.”


In addition to the purchase price of your lot, there are other expenditures which must be made.


Listed below are the major costs. There may be other fees for use of the recreational facilities.


All costs are subject to change.
