(a) In the case of an exemption under § 1010.14, an identification of the developer and subdivision to which this notice applies. In the case of an exemption under either § 1010.15 or § 1010.16, an identification of the exemption order to which the notice applies.


(b) A clear and concise statement of material facts, sufficient to inform the respondent with reasonable definiteness of the basis for the Director's determination that further exemption from the registration and disclosure requirements is not in the public interest or that the sales or leases do not meet the requirements for exemption, or both.
