# § 1022.25   Reasonable and simple methods of opting out.

(a) *In general.* You must not use eligibility information about a consumer that you receive from an affiliate to make a solicitation to the consumer about your products or services, unless the consumer is provided a reasonable and simple method to opt out, as required by § 1022.21(a)(1)(ii) of this part.


(b) *Examples*—(1) *Reasonable and simple opt-out methods.* Reasonable and simple methods for exercising the opt-out right include:


(i) Designating a check-off box in a prominent position on the opt-out form;


(ii) Including a reply form and a self-addressed envelope together with the opt-out notice;


(iii) Providing an electronic means to opt out, such as a form that can be electronically mailed or processed at a Web site, if the consumer agrees to the electronic delivery of information;


(iv) Providing a toll-free telephone number that consumers may call to opt out; or


(v) Allowing consumers to exercise all of their opt-out rights described in a consolidated opt-out notice that includes the privacy opt-out under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 15 U.S.C. 6801 *et seq.,* the affiliate sharing opt-out under the Act, and the affiliate marketing opt-out under the Act, by a single method, such as by calling a single toll-free telephone number.


(2) *Opt-out methods that are not reasonable and simple.* Reasonable and simple methods for exercising an opt-out right *do not* include—


(i) Requiring the consumer to write his or her own letter;


(ii) Requiring the consumer to call or write to obtain a form for opting out, rather than including the form with the opt-out notice;


(iii) Requiring the consumer who receives the opt-out notice in electronic form only, such as through posting at a Web site, to opt out solely by paper mail or by visiting a different Web site without providing a link to that site.


(c) *Specific opt-out means.* Each consumer may be required to opt out through a specific means, as long as that means is reasonable and simple for that consumer.
