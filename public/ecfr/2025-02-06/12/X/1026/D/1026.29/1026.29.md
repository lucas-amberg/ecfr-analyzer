(2) There is adequate provision for enforcement.


(b) *Civil liability.* (1) No exemptions granted under this section shall extend to the civil liability provisions of sections 130 and 131 of the Act.


(2) If an exemption has been granted, the disclosures required by the applicable state law (except any additional requirements not imposed by Federal law) shall constitute the disclosures required by the Act.


(c) *Applications.* The procedures under which a state may apply for an exemption under this section are set forth in appendix B to this part.
