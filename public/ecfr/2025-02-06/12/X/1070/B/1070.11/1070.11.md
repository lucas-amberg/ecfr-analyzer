# § 1070.11   Information made available; discretionary disclosures.

(a) *In general.* The FOIA provides for public access to information and records developed or maintained by Federal agencies. Generally, the FOIA divides agency information into three major categories and provides methods by which each category of information is to be made available to the public. The three major categories of information are as follows:


(1) Information required to be published in the _Federal Register_ (see § 1070.12);


(2) Information required to be made available for public inspection in an electronic format or, in the alternative, to be published and offered for sale (see § 1070.13); and


(3) Information required to be made available to any member of the public upon specific request (see §§ 1070.14 through 1070.22).


(b) *Discretionary disclosures.* Even though a FOIA exemption may apply to the information or records requested, the CFPB may, if not precluded by law, elect under the circumstances not to apply the exemption. The fact that the exemption is not applied by the CFPB in response to a particular request shall have no precedential significance in processing other requests.


(c) *Disclosures of records frequently requested.* Subject to the application of the FOIA exemptions and exclusions (5 U.S.C. 552(b) and (c)), the CFPB shall make publicly available, as provided by § 1070.13, all records regardless of form or format, which have been released previously to any person under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3) and §§ 1070.14 through 1070.22, and which the CFPB determines have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records. When the CFPB receives three (3) or more requests for substantially the same records, then the CFPB shall also make the released records publicly available.
