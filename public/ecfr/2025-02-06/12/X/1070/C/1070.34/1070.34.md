# ยง 1070.34   Procedure when response to demand is required prior to receiving instructions.

(a) If a response to a demand described in ยง 1070.33 is required before the General Counsel renders a decision, the CFPB will request that the appropriate CFPB attorney or an attorney of the Department of Justice, as appropriate, take steps to stay, postpone, or obtain relief from the demand pending decision. If necessary, the attorney will:


(1) Appear with the employee upon whom the demand has been made;


(2) Furnish the court or other authority with a copy of the regulations contained in this subpart;


(3) Inform the court or other authority that the demand has been, or is being, as the case may be, referred for the prompt consideration of the appropriate CFPB official; and


(4) Request the court or authority to stay the demand pending receipt of the requested instructions.


(b) In the event that an immediate demand for production or disclosure is made in circumstances which would preclude the proper designation or appearance of an attorney of the CFPB or the Department of Justice on the employee's behalf, the employee, if necessary, shall request from the demanding court or authority a reasonable stay of proceedings for the purpose of obtaining instructions from the General Counsel.
