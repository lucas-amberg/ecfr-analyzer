# ยง 1070.36   Considerations in determining whether the CFPB will comply with a demand or request.

(a) In deciding whether to comply with a demand or request, CFPB officials and attorneys shall consider, among other pertinent considerations:


(1) Whether such compliance would be unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable rules of discovery or the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which the demand arose;


(2) Whether the number of similar requests would have a cumulative effect on the expenditure of CFPB resources;


(3) Whether compliance is appropriate under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege or disclosure of information;


(4) The public interest;


(5) The need to conserve the time of CFPB employees for the conduct of official business;


(6) The need to avoid spending time and money of the United States for private purposes;


(7) The need to maintain impartiality between private litigants in cases where a substantial government interest is not implicated;


(8) Whether compliance would have an adverse effect on performance by the CFPB of its mission and duties;


(9) The need to avoid involving the CFPB in controversial issues not related to its mission;


(10) Whether compliance would interfere with supervisory examinations, compromise the CFPB's supervisory functions or programs, or undermine public confidence in supervised financial institutions; and


(11) Whether compliance would interfere with the CFPB's ability to monitor for risks to consumers in the offering or provision of consumer financial products and services.


(b) Among those demands and requests in response to which compliance will not ordinarily be authorized are those with respect to which any of the following factors, inter alia, exist:


(1) Compliance would violate a statute or applicable rule of procedure;


(2) Compliance would violate a specific regulation or Executive order;


(3) Compliance would reveal information properly classified in the interest of national security;


(4) Compliance would reveal confidential or privileged commercial or financial information or trade secrets without the owner's consent;


(5) Compliance would compromise the integrity of the deliberative processes of the CFPB;


(6) Compliance would not be appropriate or necessary under the relevant substantive law governing privilege;


(7) Compliance would reveal confidential information; or


(8) Compliance would interfere with ongoing investigations or enforcement proceedings, compromise constitutional rights, or reveal the identity of a confidential informant.


(c) The CFPB may condition disclosure of official information pursuant to a request or demand on the entry of an appropriate protective order.
