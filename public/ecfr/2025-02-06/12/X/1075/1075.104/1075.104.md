# ยง 1075.104   Payments to victims.

(a) *In general.* The Bureau will use funds in the Civil Penalty Fund for payments to compensate eligible victims' uncompensated harm, as described in to paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) *Victims' uncompensated harm.* (1) A victim's uncompensated harm is the victim's compensable harm, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, minus any compensation for that harm that the victim has received or is reasonably expected to receive.


(2) For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a victim has received or is reasonably expected to receive compensation in the amount of:


(i) Any Civil Penalty Fund payment that the victim has previously received or will receive as a result of a previous allocation from the Civil Penalty Fund to the victim's class;


(ii) Any redress that a final order in a Bureau enforcement action orders to be distributed, credited, or otherwise paid to the victim, and that has not been suspended or waived and that the Chief Financial Officer has not determined to be uncollectible; and


(iii) Any other redress that the Bureau knows that has been distributed, credited, or otherwise paid to the victim, or has been paid to an intermediary for distribution to the victim, to the extent that:


(A) That redress compensates the victim for the same harm as would be compensated by a Civil Penalty Fund payment; and


(B) It is not unduly burdensome, in light of the amounts at stake, to determine the amount of that redress or the extent to which it compensates the victim for the same harm as would be compensated by a Civil Penalty Fund payment.


(3) If the Fund Administrator deems it impracticable to assess the uncompensated harm of individual victims in a class, each individual victim's uncompensated harm will be the victim's share of the aggregate uncompensated harm of the victim's class.


(c) *Victims' compensable harm.* Victims' compensable harm for purposes of this part is as follows:


(1) If a final order in a Bureau enforcement action ordered redress for a class of victims, the compensable harm of each victim in the class is equal to that victim's share of the total redress ordered, including any amounts that are suspended or waived.


(2) If a final order in a Bureau enforcement action does not order redress for a class of victims, those victims' compensable harm is as follows:


(i) If the Bureau sought redress for a class of victims but a court or administrative tribunal denied that request for redress in the final order, the victims in that class have no compensable harm.


(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, if the final order in the Bureau enforcement action specifies the amount of the victims' harm, including by prescribing a formula for calculating that harm, each victim's compensable harm is equal to that victim's share of the amount specified.


(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, if the final order in the Bureau enforcement action does not specify the amount of the victims' harm, each victim's compensable harm is equal to the victim's out-of-pocket losses that resulted from the violation or violations for which a civil penalty was imposed, except to the extent such losses are impracticable to determine.
