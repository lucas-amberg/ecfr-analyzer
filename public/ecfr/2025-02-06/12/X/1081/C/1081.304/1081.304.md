# ยง 1081.304   Record of the hearing.

(a) *Reporting and transcription.* Hearings will be stenographically reported and transcribed under the supervision of the hearing officer, and the original transcript will be a part of the record and the sole official transcript. The live oral testimony of each witness may be video recorded digitally, in which case the video recording and the written transcript of the testimony will be made part of the record. Copies of transcripts will be available from the reporter at prescribed rates.


(b) *Corrections.* Corrections of the official transcript may be made only when they involve errors affecting substance and then only in the manner provided in this paragraph (b). Corrections ordered by the hearing officer or agreed to in a written stipulation signed by all counsel and parties not represented by counsel, and approved by the hearing officer, will be included in the record, and such stipulations, except to the extent they are capricious or without substance, must be approved by the hearing officer. Corrections will not be ordered by the hearing officer except upon notice and opportunity for the hearing of objections. Such corrections must be made by the official reporter by furnishing substitute type pages, under the usual certificate of the reporter, for insertion in the official record. The original uncorrected pages will be retained in the files of the Bureau.


(c) *Closing of the hearing record.* Upon completion of the hearing, the hearing officer will issue an order closing the hearing record after giving the parties seven days to determine if the record is complete or needs to be supplemented. The hearing officer retains the discretion to permit or order correction of the record as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
