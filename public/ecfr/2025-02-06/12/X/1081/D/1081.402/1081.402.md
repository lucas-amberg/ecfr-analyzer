# § 1081.402   Notice of appeal; review by the Director.

(a) *Notice of appeal*—(1) *Filing.* Any party may file exceptions to the preliminary findings and conclusions of the hearing officer by filing a notice of appeal with the Office of Administrative Adjudication within 14 days after service of the preliminary findings and conclusions. The notice must specify the party or parties against whom the appeal is taken and must designate the preliminary findings and conclusions or part thereof appealed from. If a timely notice of appeal is filed by a party, any other party may thereafter file a notice of appeal within seven days after service of the first notice, or within 14 days after service of the preliminary findings and conclusions, whichever period expires last.


(2) *Perfecting a notice of appeal.* Any party filing a notice of appeal must perfect its appeal by filing its opening appeal brief within 28 days of service of the preliminary findings and conclusions. Any party may respond to the opening appeal brief by filing an answering brief within 28 days of service of the opening brief. Any party may file a reply to an answering brief within seven days of service of the answering brief. These briefs must conform to the requirements of § 1081.403.


(b) *Director review other than pursuant to an appeal.* In the event no party perfects an appeal of the hearing officer's preliminary findings and conclusions, the Director will, within 42 days after the date of service of the preliminary findings and conclusions, either issue a final decision and order adopting the preliminary findings and conclusions, or order further briefing regarding any portion of the preliminary findings and conclusions. The Director's order for further briefing must set forth the scope of review and the issues that will be considered and will make provision for the filing of briefs in accordance with the timelines set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section (except that that opening briefs will be due within 28 days of service of the order of review) if deemed appropriate by the Director.


(c) *Exhaustion of administrative remedies.* Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 704, a perfected appeal to the Director of preliminary findings and conclusions pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section is a prerequisite to the seeking of judicial review of a final decision and order, or portion of the final decision and order, adopting the preliminary findings and conclusions.
