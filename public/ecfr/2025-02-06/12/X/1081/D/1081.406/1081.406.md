# ยง 1081.406   Reconsideration.

Within 14 days after service of the Director's decision and order, any party may file with the Director a petition for reconsideration, briefly and specifically setting forth the relief desired and the grounds in support thereof. Any petition filed under this section must be confined to new questions raised by the decision or order and upon which the petitioner had no opportunity to argue, in writing or orally, before the Director. No response to a petition for reconsideration may be filed unless requested by the Director, who will request such response before granting any petition for reconsideration. The filing of a petition for reconsideration does not operate to stay the effective date of the decision or order or to toll the running of any statutory period affecting such decision or order unless specifically so ordered by the Director.
