The motion must address the likelihood of the movant's success on appeal, whether the movant will suffer irreparable harm if a stay is not granted, the degree of injury to other parties if a stay is granted, and why the stay is in the public interest.


(d) A motion for stay must be filed within 28 days of service of the order on the party. Any party opposing the motion may file a response within seven days after receipt of the motion.

(e) The commencement of proceedings for judicial review of a final decision and order of the Director does not, unless specifically ordered by the Director or a reviewing court, operate as a stay of any order issued by the Director. The Director has discretion, on such terms as the Director finds just, to stay the effectiveness of all or any part of an order pending a final decision on a petition for judicial review of that order.
