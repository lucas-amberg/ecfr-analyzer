# ยง 1091.404   Changes to methods of filing and service, time limits, and word limits.

(a) *Generally.* This section governs a change to a method of filing or service, to a time limit, or to a word limit, whether prescribed by this part or by the Director. Changes to time limits or word limits are disfavored.


(b) *Change upon consent.* The initiating official and respondent may agree in writing to a change, unless the Director specifies otherwise. The initiating official shall file notice of the change with the Director.


(c) *Change upon written request to Director.* The initiating official or the respondent may file a written request to the Director for a change, for good cause shown. The mere filing of a written request for a change does not alleviate the obligation to meet an applicable requirement, absent written confirmation that the request has been granted.


(c) *Change upon Director's own motion.* The Director may make a change on the Director's own motion.


(e) *No conferral of rights.* Deadlines for action by the Bureau established in this part do not confer any rights on respondents.
