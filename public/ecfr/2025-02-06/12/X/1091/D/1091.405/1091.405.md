# ยง 1091.405   Confidentiality of proceedings.

(a) *General rule.* In connection with a proceeding under this part, including a petition for termination under ยง 1091.301, all documents, records or other items submitted by a respondent to the Bureau, all documents prepared by, or on behalf of, or for the use of the Bureau, and any communications between the Bureau and a person, shall be deemed confidential supervisory information under 12 CFR 1070.2(i)(1). However, this paragraph does not apply to the version of a document that is released on the Bureau's website under paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) *Publication of final decisions and orders by the Director.* The Director will make a determination regarding whether a decision or order under ยง 1091.206(a)(1) or ยง 1091.301(d) will be publicly released on the Bureau's website, in whole or in part. The respondent may file a submission regarding that issue, within ten days after service of the decision or order. The Director will not release information in a decision or order to the extent it would be exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) or (b)(6) or the Director determines there is other good cause. The Director may also decide that any determination regarding public release will itself be released on the website, in whole or in part. Section 1091.206(d) is not applicable to determinations under this paragraph.
