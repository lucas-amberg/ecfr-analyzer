(2) Requires the services of an appraiser under the interagency appraisal rules. ((Title XI, section 1121(4), 12 U.S.C. 3350), implemented by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency: 12 CFR 34.42(g) and 34.43(a); Federal Reserve Board: 12 CFR 225.62 and 225.63(a); Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation: 12 CFR 323.2(f) and 323.3(a); and National Credit Union Administration: 12 CFR 722.2(f) and 722.3(a).)

(c) *Petition* means information submitted to the ASC by the Federal or State financial institutions regulatory agencies, their respective regulated financial institutions, or other persons or institutions with a demonstrable interest in appraiser regulation, including a State Appraisal Agency, asking the ASC to exercise its discretionary authority to initiate a temporary waiver proceeding, and that meets the requirements, as determined by the ASC, set forth in ยง 1102.4.

(f) *Significant delays in the performance of appraisals* means delays that are substantially out of the ordinary when compared to performance of appraisals for similarly situated FRTs based on factors such as geographic location (*e.g.,* rural versus urban) and assignment type, and the delay is not the result of intervening circumstances outside the appraiser's control or brought about by the appraiser's client (*e.g.,* inability to access the subject property).
