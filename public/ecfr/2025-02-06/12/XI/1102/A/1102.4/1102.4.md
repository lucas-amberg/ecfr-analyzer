(i) Issue a written determination that there is a scarcity of certified or licensed appraisers leading to significant delays in the performance of appraisals for FRTs or a class of FRTs within either a portion of, or the entire State (or request that the ASC issue such a written determination), in which case, the procedures and requirements of §§ 1102.3 and 1102.6(a) shall apply; or


(ii) Recommend that the ASC take no further action.


(2) In the event the State Appraisal Agency either recommends no further action or declines to conduct further evaluation and study on a Petition, the ASC may exercise its discretion in determining whether to issue an Order initiating a temporary waiver proceeding in accordance with § 1102.5(a).
