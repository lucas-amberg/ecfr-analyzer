# ยง 1102.5   Order initiating a temporary waiver proceeding.

The ASC may exercise discretion in determining whether to issue an Order initiating a temporary waiver proceeding in response to a Petition, or alternatively, the ASC may exercise discretion to initiate a temporary waiver proceeding on its own initiative without a Petition being submitted. In either event, such an Order would include consideration of certain items that would be addressed in a Request for Temporary Waiver. (*See, e.g.,* ยง 1102.3(b)(2) through (6).) If such an Order is issued, the ASC shall publish a _Federal Register_ notice in accordance with ยง 1102.6(b).
