# § 1202.7   How will FHFA respond to my FOIA request?

(a) *Authority to grant or deny requests.* The FOIA Officer, FOIA Official, and the Chief FOIA Officer are authorized to grant or deny any request for FHFA records.


(b) *Designated standard “cut-off” date for searches.* In determining which records are responsive to a request, FHFA will include only records in its possession as of the date the FOIA request is received.


(c) *Multi-Track request processing.* FHFA uses a multi-track system to process FOIA requests. This means that a FOIA request is processed based on its complexity. When FHFA receives your request, it is assigned to a Standard Track or Complex Track. FHFA will notify you if your request is assigned to the Complex Track as described in paragraph (h) of this section.


(1) *Standard Track.* FHFA assigns FOIA requests that are routine and require little or no search time, review, or analysis to the Standard Track. FHFA responds to these requests in the order in which they are received and normally responds within 20 days after receipt. If FHFA determines while processing your Standard Track request, that it is more appropriately a Complex Track request, it will be reassigned to the Complex Track and you will be notified as described in paragraph (h) of this section.


(2) *Complex Track.* (i) FHFA assigns requests that are non-routine to the Complex Track. Complex Track requests are those to which FHFA determines that the request and/or response may—


(A) Be voluminous;


(B) Involve two or more FHFA components or units;


(C) Require consultation with other agencies or entities;


(D) Require searches of archived documents;


(E) Seek confidential commercial information as described in § 1202.8 of this part;


(F) Require an unusually high level of effort to search for, review and/or duplicate records; or


(G) Cause undue disruption to the day-to-day activities of FHFA in regulating and supervising the regulated entities or in carrying out its statutory responsibilities.


(ii) FHFA will respond to Complex Track requests as soon as reasonably possible, regardless of the date of receipt.


(d) *Referrals to other agencies.* If you submit a FOIA request that seeks records originating in another Federal Government agency, FHFA will refer those records, as applicable, to the other agency for a direct response. FHFA will provide you notice of the referral, what records were referred, and the name of the other agency and relevant contact information.


(e) *Consultation with other agencies.* When records originate with FHFA, but contain within them information of interest to another agency, FHFA will consult with the other agency(ies) prior to making a determination on your request.


(f) *Responses to FOIA requests.* FHFA will respond to your request by granting or denying it in full, or by granting and denying it in part. The response will be in writing. In determining which records are responsive to your request, FHFA will conduct a search for records in its possession as of the date of your request.


(1) *Requests that are granted.* If FHFA grants your request, the response will include the requested records or details about how FHFA will provide them to you and the amount of any fees charged.


(2) *Requests that are denied, or granted and denied in part.* If FHFA denies your request in whole or in part because a requested record does not exist or cannot be located, is not readily reproducible in the form or format you sought, is not subject to the FOIA, or is exempt from disclosure, the written response will include the requested releasable records, if any, the amount of any fees charged, the reasons for denial, and a notice and description of your right to file an administrative appeal under § 1202.9. FHFA will not provide you with a Vaughn index during the administrative stage of processing your request.


(g) *Format and delivery of disclosed records.* If FHFA grants, in whole or in part, your request for disclosure of records under the FOIA, the records may be made available to you in the form or format you requested, if they are readily reproducible in that form or format. The records will be sent to the address you provided by regular U.S. mail or by electronic mail unless alternate arrangements are made by mutual agreement, such as your agreement to pay express or expedited delivery service fees, or to pick up records at FHFA offices.


(h) *Extensions of time.* (1) In unusual circumstances, FHFA may extend the statutory time limit in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for no more than 10 days and notify you of—


(i) The reason for the extension; and


(ii) The date on which the determination is expected.


(2) When a request requires more than 30 days to process, FHFA will make available its FOIA Public Liaison or other FOIA contact to assist you in modifying or reformulating your request. If the request cannot be modified or reformulated, FHFA will notify you regarding an alternative time period for processing the request. FHFA will also notify you of the availability of the Office of Government Information Services to provide dispute resolution service.


(3) For the purpose of satisfying unusual circumstances under the FOIA, FHFA may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. FHFA will not aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.
