# ยง 1209.51   Evidence.

(a) *Admissibility.* (1) Except as is otherwise set forth in this section, relevant, material, and reliable evidence that is not unduly repetitive is admissible to the fullest extent authorized by the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 552 *et seq.*) and other applicable law.


(2) Evidence that would be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence is admissible in a proceeding conducted pursuant to subpart C of this part.


(3) Evidence that would be inadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence may not be deemed or ruled to be inadmissible in a proceeding conducted pursuant to subpart C of this part if such evidence is relevant, material, probative and reliable, and not unduly repetitive.


(b) *Official notice.* (1) Official notice may be taken of any material fact that may be judicially noticed by a United States district court and of any materially relevant information in the official public records of any Federal or State government agency.


(2) All matters officially noticed by the presiding officer or the Director shall appear on the record.


(3) If official notice is requested of any material fact, the parties, upon timely request, shall be afforded an opportunity to object.


(c) *Documents.* (1) A duplicate copy of a document is admissible to the same extent as the original, unless a genuine issue is raised as to whether the copy is in some material respect not a true and legible copy of the original.


(2) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, any document, including a report of examination, oversight activity, inspection, or visitation prepared by FHFA or by another Federal or State financial institution's regulatory agency, is admissible either with or without a sponsoring witness.


(3) Witnesses may use existing or newly created charts, exhibits, calendars, calculations, outlines, or other graphic material to summarize, illustrate, or simplify the presentation of testimony. Such materials may, subject to the presiding officer's discretion, be used with or without being admitted into evidence.


(d) *Objections.* (1) Objections to the admissibility of evidence must be timely made and rulings on all objections must appear in the record.


(2) When an objection to a question or line of questioning is sustained, the examining representative of record may make a specific proffer on the record of what he or she expected to prove by the expected testimony of the witness. The proffer may be by representation of the representative or by direct interrogation of the witness.


(3) The presiding officer shall retain rejected exhibits, adequately marked for identification, for the record and transmit such exhibits to the Director.


(4) Failure to object to admission of evidence or to any ruling constitutes a waiver of the objection.


(e) *Stipulations.* The parties may stipulate as to any relevant matters of fact or the authentication of any document to be admitted into evidence. Such stipulations must be received in evidence at a hearing, are binding on the parties with respect to the matters stipulated, and shall be made part of the record.


(f) *Depositions of unavailable witnesses.* (1) If a witness is unavailable to testify at a hearing and that witness has testified in a deposition in accordance with ยง 1209.32, a party may offer as evidence all or any part of the transcript of the deposition, including deposition exhibits, if any.


(2) Such deposition transcript is admissible to the same extent that testimony would have been admissible had that person testified at the hearing, provided that if a witness refused to answer proper questions during the deposition the presiding officer may, on that basis, limit the admissibility of the deposition in any manner that justice requires.


(3) Only those portions of a deposition or related exhibits received in evidence at the hearing in accordance with this section shall constitute a part of the record.
