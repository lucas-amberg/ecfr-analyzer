# ยง 1215.10   Processing demands and requests.

(a) The Director will review every demand or request received and, in accordance with this regulation, determine whether, and under what conditions, to authorize an employee to produce records, information, or testimony.


(b) The Director will process demands and requests in the order in which they are received. The Director will ordinarily respond within 60 days from the date that the agency receives all information necessary to evaluate the demand or request. However, the time for response will depend upon the scope of the demand or request. The Director may respond outside of the 60-day period:


(1) Under exigent or unusual circumstances; or


(2) When FHFA must receive and process records or information in the possession, custody, or control of a third party.


(c) The Director may confer with counsel to parties to a legal proceeding about demands or requests made pursuant to this part. The conference may be *ex-parte.* Failure to confer in good faith, in order to enable the Director to make an informed determination, may justify rejection of the demand or request.


(d) The Director may rely on sources of information other than those provided by the demanding or requesting parties as bases for making a determination.


(e) The Director may grant a waiver of any requirement in this section to promote a significant interest of FHFA or the United States, or for other good cause.
