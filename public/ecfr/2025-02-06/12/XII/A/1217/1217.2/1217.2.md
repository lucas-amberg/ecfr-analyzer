# § 1217.2   Definitions.

As used in this part:


*Ability to pay* is determined based on a review of the respondent's resources available both currently and prospectively, from which FHFA could ultimately recover the total penalty, and as appropriate, assessment, which may be predicted based on historical evidence.


*Assessment* means a monetary penalty that is in addition to a civil penalty and may be imposed if FHFA has made any payment, transferred property, or provided services for a claim that is determined to be in violation of paragraph (a)(1) of § 1217.3. An assessment may not exceed an amount that is twice the amount of the claim or portion of the claim determined to be in violation of paragraph (a)(1) of § 1217.3. A civil penalty other than an assessment may be imposed whether or not FHFA has made a payment, transferred property, or provided services in response to the false claim or statement.


*Benefit* means anything of value, including, but not limited to, any advantage, preference, privilege, license, permit, favorable decision, ruling, or status.


*Claim* means any request, demand, or submission:


(1) Made to FHFA for property, services, or money (including money representing benefits);


(2) Made to a recipient of property, services, or money from FHFA or to a party to a contract with FHFA:


(i) For property or services, if FHFA:


(A) Provided such property or services;


(B) Provided any portion of the funds for the purchase of such property or services; or


(C) Will reimburse such recipient or party for the purchase of such property or services; or

(A) Provided any portion of the money requested or demanded; or
