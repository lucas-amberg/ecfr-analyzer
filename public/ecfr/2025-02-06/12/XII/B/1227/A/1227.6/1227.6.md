# § 1227.6   Final suspension order.

(a) *Grounds for issuance.* A suspending official may issue a final suspension order with respect to a respondent proposed for suspension if, based solely on the written record, the suspending official determines that there is adequate evidence that:


(1) The respondent engaged in covered misconduct; and


(2) The covered misconduct is of a type that would be likely to cause significant financial or reputational harm to a regulated entity or otherwise threaten the safe and sound operation of a regulated entity.


(b) *Written record.* The written record shall include any material submitted by the respondent and any material submitted by the regulated entities, as well as any other material that was considered by the suspending official in making the final determination, including any information related to the factors in paragraph (c) of this section. FHFA may independently obtain information relevant to the suspension determination for inclusion in the written record.


(c) *Factors that may be considered by the suspending official.* In determining whether or not to issue a final suspension order with respect to the respondent where the grounds for suspension are satisfied, the suspending official may also consider any factors that the suspending official determines may be relevant in light of the circumstances of the particular case, including but not limited to:


(1) The actual or potential harm or impact that results or may result from the covered misconduct;


(2) The frequency of incidents or duration of the covered misconduct;


(3) Whether there is a pattern of prior covered misconduct;


(4) Whether and to what extent the respondent planned, initiated, or carried out the covered misconduct;


(5) Whether the respondent has accepted responsibility for the covered misconduct and recognizes its seriousness;


(6) Whether the respondent has paid or agreed to pay all criminal, civil and administrative penalties or liabilities for the covered misconduct, including any investigative or administrative costs incurred by the government, and has made or agreed to make full restitution;


(7) Whether the covered misconduct was pervasive within the respondent's organization;


(8) The kind of positions held by the individuals involved in the covered misconduct;


(9) Whether the respondent's organization took appropriate corrective action or remedial measures, such as establishing ethics training and implementing programs to prevent recurrence of the covered misconduct;


(10) Whether the respondent brought the covered misconduct to the attention of the appropriate government agency in a timely manner;


(11) Whether the respondent has fully investigated the circumstances surrounding the covered misconduct and, if so, made the result of the investigation available to the suspending official;


(12) Whether the respondent had effective standards of conduct and internal control systems in place at the time the covered misconduct occurred;


(13) Whether the respondent has taken appropriate disciplinary action against the individuals responsible for the covered misconduct; or


(14) Whether the respondent has had adequate time to eliminate the circumstances within the organization that led to the covered misconduct.


(d) *Deadline for decision.* The suspending official shall make a determination on whether to issue a final suspension order with respect to the respondent within thirty (30) calendar days of the deadline given for the respondent's response in the notice of proposed suspension, unless the suspending official notifies the respondent in writing that additional time is needed.


(e) *Determination not to issue final suspension order.* If the suspending official determines that suspension is not appropriate with respect to the respondent, the suspending official shall provide prompt written notice of that determination to the respondent, the regulated entity, and all of the other regulated entities.


(f) *Issuance of final suspension order*—(1) *General.* If the suspending official makes a final determination to suspend the respondent, the suspending official shall issue a final suspension order to each regulated entity regarding the respondent.


(2) *Content of final suspension order.* A final suspension order shall include:


(i) A statement of the suspension determination and supporting grounds, including a discussion of any relevant information submitted by the respondent or regulated entities;


(ii) Identification of each person and any affiliates thereof to which the suspension applies;


(iii) A description of the scope of the suspension, including the time period to which the suspension applies; and


(iv) A description of any limitations or qualifications that apply to the scope of the suspension, including modification of the conduct of covered transactions that may be engaged in with the respondent.


(3) *Notice to respondent required.* The suspending official shall provide prompt written notice to the respondent of the final suspension order issued to the regulated entities with respect to such respondent.


(4) *Content of notice.* The notice of a final suspension order shall include:


(i) A statement of the suspension determination and supporting grounds, including a discussion of any relevant information submitted by the respondent; and


(ii) A copy of the final suspension order.


(g) *Effective date.* A final suspension order shall take effect on the date specified in the order, which shall be at least forty-five (45) calendar days after the date on which the order is signed by the suspending official.
