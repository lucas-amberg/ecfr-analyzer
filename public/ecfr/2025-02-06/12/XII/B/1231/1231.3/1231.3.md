(a) *In general, FHFA consent is required.* No troubled institution shall make or agree to make any golden parachute payment without the Director's consent, except as provided in this part.


(b) *Exempt agreements and payments.* The following agreements and payments, including payments associated with an agreement, are not golden parachute agreements or payments for purposes of this part and, for that reason, may be made without the Director's consent:


(1) Any pension or retirement plan that is qualified (or is intended to be qualified) under section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 401);


(2) Any “employee welfare benefit plan” as that term is defined in section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (29 U.S.C. 1002(1)), other than:


(i) Any deferred compensation plan or arrangement; and


(ii) Any severance pay plan or agreement;


(3) Any benefit plan that:


(i) Is a “nondiscriminatory employee plan or program” for the purposes of section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 280G) and applicable regulations; or


(ii) Has been submitted to the Director for review in accordance with this part and that the Director has determined to be nondiscriminatory, unless such a plan is otherwise specifically addressed by this part;


(4) Any “bona fide deferred compensation plan or arrangement” as defined in this part provided that the plan:


(i) Was in effect for, and not materially amended to increase benefits payable thereunder (except for changes required by law) within, the one-year period prior to the regulated entity or the OF becoming a troubled institution; or


(ii) Has been determined to be permissible by the Director;


(5) Any payment made by reason of:


(i) Death; or


(ii) Termination caused by disability of the affiliated party; and


(6) Any severance or similar payment that is required to be made pursuant to a state statute that is applicable to all employers within the appropriate jurisdiction (with the exception of employers that are exempt due to their small number of employees or other similar criteria).


(c) *Golden parachute payment agreements for which FHFA consent is not required.* A troubled institution may enter into the following agreements to make a golden parachute payment without the Director's consent:


(1) With any affiliated party where the agreement is expressly directed or established by the Director exercising authority conferred by 12 U.S.C. 4617.


(2) With an affiliated party who is not an executive officer where the agreement:


(i) Is an individually negotiated settlement agreement, and the conditions of paragraph (e)(2) of this section are met; or


(ii) Provides for a golden parachute payment that, when aggregated with all other golden parachute payments to the affiliated party, does not exceed $5,000 (subject to any adjustment for inflation pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section).


(d) *Golden parachute payments for which FHFA consent is not required.* A troubled institution may make the following golden parachute payments without the Director's consent:


(1) To any affiliated party where:


(i) The payment is required to be made pursuant to a permitted individually negotiated settlement agreement; or


(ii) The Director previously consented to such payment in a written notice to the troubled institution (which may be included in the Director's consent to the agreement), the payment is made in accordance with a permitted agreement, and the troubled institution has met any conditions established by the Director for making the payment.


(2) To an executive officer where the payment recognizes a significant life event and does not exceed $500 in value (subject to any adjustment for inflation pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section).


(3) To an affiliated party who is not an executive officer, where:


(i) The payment is made in accordance with a permitted agreement and the conditions of paragraph (e)(2) of this section are met; or


(ii) The payment when aggregated with other golden parachute payments to the affiliated party does not exceed $5,000 (subject to any adjustment for inflation pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section).


(e) *Required due diligence review; due diligence standard*—(1) *Agreements and payments where consent is requested.* A troubled institution making a request for consent to enter into a golden parachute payment agreement with, or to make a golden parachute payment to, an individual affiliated party shall conduct due diligence appropriate to the level and responsibility of the affiliated party covered by the agreement or to whom payment would be made, to determine whether there is information, evidence, documents, or other materials that indicate there is a reasonable basis to believe, at the time the request is submitted, that the affiliated party:


(i) Has committed any fraudulent act or omission, breach of trust or fiduciary duty, or insider abuse with regard to the regulated entity or the OF that is likely to have a material adverse effect on the regulated entity or the OF;


(ii) Is substantially responsible for the regulated entity or the OF being a troubled institution;


(iii) Has materially violated any applicable Federal or State law or regulation that has had or is likely to have a material effect on the regulated entity or the OF; or


(iv) Has violated or conspired to violate sections 215, 657, 1006, 1014, or 1344 of title 18 of the United States Code, or section 1341 or 1343 of such title affecting a “financial institution” as the term is defined in title 18 of the United States Code (18 U.S.C. 20).


(2) *Agreements and payments permitted without the Director's consent.* No troubled institution shall enter into an agreement pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section or make a payment pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section unless it is reasonably assured, following due diligence in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section, that the affiliated party to whom payment would be made has not engaged in any of the actions listed in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.


(3) *Required notice to FHFA.* If a troubled institution determines it is unable to enter into an agreement pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section or make a payment pursuant to (d)(3)(i) of this section without the Director's consent because it cannot meet the standard set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, and thereafter does not request the Director's consent to make the payment, then the troubled institution shall provide notice to FHFA of each reason for which it cannot meet the standard set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, within 15 business days of its determination.


(f) *Factors for Director consideration.* In making a determination under this section, the Director may consider:


(1) Whether, and to what degree, the affiliated party was in a position of managerial or fiduciary responsibility;


(2) The length of time the affiliated party was affiliated with the regulated entity or the OF, and the degree to which the proposed payment represents a reasonable payment for services rendered over the period of affiliation;


(3) Whether the golden parachute payment would be made pursuant to an employee benefit plan that is usual and customary;


(4) Whether the golden parachute payment or agreement is excessive or abusive or threatens the financial condition of the troubled institution; and


(5) Any other factor the Director determines relevant to the facts and circumstances surrounding the golden parachute payment or agreement, including any fraudulent act or omission, breach of fiduciary duty, violation of law, rule, regulation, order, or written agreement, and the level of willful misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty, and malfeasance on the part of the affiliated party.


(g) *Adjustment for inflation.* Monetary amounts set forth in this part may be adjusted for inflation by increasing the dollar amount set forth in this part by the percentage, if any, by which the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor (“CPI-U”) for December of the calendar year preceding payment exceeds the CPI-U for the month of November 2018, with the resulting sum rounded up to the nearest whole dollar.
