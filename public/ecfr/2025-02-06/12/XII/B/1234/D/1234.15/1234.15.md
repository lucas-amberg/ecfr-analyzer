# § 1234.15   Qualifying commercial real estate loans.

(a) *General exception.* Commercial real estate loans that are securitized through a securitization transaction shall be subject to a 0 percent risk retention requirement under subpart B of this part, provided that the following conditions are met:


(1) The CRE assets meet the underwriting standards set forth in § 1234.17;


(2) The securitization transaction is collateralized solely by CRE loans and by servicing assets;


(3) The securitization transaction does not permit reinvestment periods; and


(4) The sponsor provides, or causes to be provided, to potential investors a reasonable period of time prior to the sale of asset-backed securities of the issuing entity, and, upon request, to the Commission, and to the FHFA, in written form under the caption “Credit Risk Retention” a description of the manner in which the sponsor determined the aggregate risk retention requirement for the securitization transaction after including qualifying CRE loans with 0 percent risk retention.


(b) *Risk retention requirement.* For any securitization transaction described in paragraph (a) of this section, the percentage of risk retention required under § 1234.3(a) is reduced by the percentage evidenced by the ratio of the unpaid principal balance of the qualifying CRE loans to the total unpaid principal balance of CRE loans that are included in the pool of assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities issued pursuant to the securitization transaction (the qualifying asset ratio); provided that;


(1) The qualifying asset ratio is measured as of the cut-off date or similar date for establishing the composition of the securitized assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities issued pursuant to the securitization transaction;


(2) If the qualifying asset ratio would exceed 50 percent, the qualifying asset ratio shall be deemed to be 50 percent; and


(3) The disclosure required by paragraph (a)(4) of this section also includes descriptions of the qualifying CRE loans and descriptions of the CRE loans that are not qualifying CRE loans, and the material differences between the group of qualifying CRE loans and CRE loans that are not qualifying loans with respect to the composition of each group's loan balances, loan terms, interest rates, borrower credit information, and characteristics of any loan collateral.


(c) *Exception for securitizations of qualifying CRE only.* Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, the risk retention requirements of subpart B of this part shall not apply to securitization transactions where the transaction is collateralized solely by servicing assets and qualifying CRE loans.


(d) Record maintenance. A regulated entity must retain the disclosures required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the certification required in § 1234.17(a)(10) of this part, in its records until three years after all ABS interests issued in the securitization are no longer outstanding. The regulated entity must provide the disclosures and certifications upon request to the Commission and the FHFA.
