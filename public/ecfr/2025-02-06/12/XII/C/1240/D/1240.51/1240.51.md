# § 1240.51   Introduction and exposure measurement.

(a) *General.* (1) To calculate its risk-weighted asset amounts for equity exposures, an Enterprise must use the Simple Risk-Weight Approach (SRWA) provided in § 1240.52.


(2) An Enterprise must treat an investment in a separate account (as defined in § 1240.2) as if it were an equity exposure to an investment fund.


(b) *Adjusted carrying value.* For purposes of §§ 1240.51 and 1240.52, the adjusted carrying value of an equity exposure is:


(1) For the on-balance sheet component of an equity exposure, the Enterprise's carrying value of the exposure;


(2) [Reserved]


(3) For the off-balance sheet component of an equity exposure that is not an equity commitment, the effective notional principal amount of the exposure, the size of which is equivalent to a hypothetical on-balance sheet position in the underlying equity instrument that would evidence the same change in fair value (measured in dollars) given a small change in the price of the underlying equity instrument, minus the adjusted carrying value of the on-balance sheet component of the exposure as calculated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and


(4) For a commitment to acquire an equity exposure (an equity commitment), the effective notional principal amount of the exposure is multiplied by the following conversion factors (CFs):


(i) Conditional equity commitments with an original maturity of one year or less receive a CF of 20 percent.


(ii) Conditional equity commitments with an original maturity of over one year receive a CF of 50 percent.


(iii) Unconditional equity commitments receive a CF of 100 percent.
