# ยง 1240.162   Mechanics of operational risk risk-weighted asset calculation.

(a) If an Enterprise does not qualify to use or does not have qualifying operational risk mitigants, the Enterprise's dollar risk-based capital requirement for operational risk is its operational risk exposure minus eligible operational risk offsets (if any).


(b) If an Enterprise qualifies to use operational risk mitigants and has qualifying operational risk mitigants, the Enterprise's dollar risk-based capital requirement for operational risk is the greater of:


(1) The Enterprise's operational risk exposure adjusted for qualifying operational risk mitigants minus eligible operational risk offsets (if any); or


(2) 0.8 multiplied by the difference between:


(i) The Enterprise's operational risk exposure; and


(ii) Eligible operational risk offsets (if any).


(c) The Enterprise's risk-weighted asset amount for operational risk equals the greater of:


(1) The Enterprise's dollar risk-based capital requirement for operational risk determined under paragraphs (a) or (b) multiplied by 12.5; and


(2) The Enterprise's adjusted total assets multiplied by 0.0015 multiplied by 12.5.


(d) After January 1, 2022, and until the compliance date for this section under ยง 1240.4, the Enterprise's risk weighted amount for operational risk will equal the Enterprise's adjusted total assets multiplied by 0.0015 multiplied by 12.5.
