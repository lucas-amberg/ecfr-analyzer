(a) *General requirement*—(1) *In general.* An Enterprise must calculate its standardized measure for spread risk by following the steps described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. An Enterprise also must calculate an advanced measure for spread risk by following the steps in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.


(2) *Measure for spread risk.* An Enterprise must calculate the standardized measure for spread risk, which equals the sum of the spread risk capital requirements of all covered positions using one or more of its internal models except as contemplated by paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section. An Enterprise also must calculate the advanced measure for spread risk, which equals the sum of the spread risk capital requirements of all covered positions calculated using one or more of its internal models.


(b) *Single point approach*—(1) *General.* For purposes of the standardized measure for spread risk, the spread risk capital requirement for a covered position that is an RPL, an NPL, a reverse mortgage loan, or a reverse mortgage security is the amount equal to:


(i) The market value of the covered position; multiplied by


(ii) The applicable single point shock assumption for the covered position under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.


(2) *Applicable single point shock assumption.* The applicable single point shock assumption is:


(i) 0.0475 for an RPL or an NPL;


(ii) 0.0160 for a reverse mortgage loan; and


(iii) 0.0410 for a reverse mortgage security.


(c) *Spread duration approach*—(1) *General.* For purposes of the standardized measure for spread risk, the spread risk capital requirement for a covered position that is a multifamily mortgage exposure, a PLS, or an MBS guaranteed by an Enterprise or Ginnie Mae and secured by multifamily mortgage exposures is the amount equal to:


(i) The market value of the covered position; multiplied by


(ii) The spread duration of the covered position determined by the Enterprise using one or more of its internal models; multiplied by


(iii) The applicable spread shock assumption under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.


(2) *Applicable spread shock assumption.* The applicable spread shock is:


(i) 0.0015 for a multifamily mortgage exposure;


(ii) 0.0265 for a PLS; and
