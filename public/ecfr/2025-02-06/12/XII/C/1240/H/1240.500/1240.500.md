# § 1240.500   Capital planning and stress capital buffer determination.

(a) *Purpose.* This section establishes capital planning and prior notice and approval requirements for capital distributions by the Enterprises. This section also establishes FHFA's process for determining the stress capital buffer applicable to the Enterprises.


(b) *Scope and reservation of authority*—(1) *Applicability.* This section applies to the Enterprises.


(2) *Reservation of authority.* Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of FHFA to issue or enforce a capital directive or take any other supervisory or enforcement action, including an action to address unsafe or unsound practices or conditions or violations of law.


(c) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:


*Adjusted total assets* has the same meaning as under subpart A of this part.


*Advanced approaches* means the risk-weighted assets calculation methodologies as set forth in subpart E of this part.


*Capital action* means any issuance of a debt or equity capital instrument, any capital distribution, and any similar action that FHFA determines could impact an Enterprise's consolidated capital.


*Capital distribution* means a redemption or repurchase of any debt or equity capital instrument, a payment of common or preferred stock dividends, a payment that may be temporarily or permanently suspended by the issuer on any instrument that is eligible for inclusion in the numerator of any minimum regulatory capital ratio, and any similar transaction that FHFA determines to be in substance a distribution of capital.


*Capital plan* means a written presentation of an Enterprise's capital planning strategies and capital adequacy process that includes the mandatory elements set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.


*Capital plan cycle* means the period beginning on January 1 of a calendar year and ending on December 31 of that year.


*Capital policy* means an Enterprise's written principles and guidelines used for capital planning, capital issuance, capital usage and distributions, including internal capital goals; the quantitative or qualitative guidelines for capital distributions; the strategies for addressing potential capital shortfalls; and the internal governance procedures around capital policy principles and guidelines.


*Common equity tier 1 capital* has the same meaning as under subpart C of this part.


*Effective capital distribution limitations* means any limitations on capital distributions established by FHFA by order or regulation, provided that, for any limitations based on risk-weighted assets, such limitations must be calculated using the standardized approach, as set forth in subpart D of this part.


*Final planned capital distributions* means the planned capital distributions included in a capital plan that include the adjustments made pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, if any.


*Internal baseline scenario* means a scenario that reflects the Enterprise's expectation of the economic and financial outlook, including expectations related to the Enterprise's capital adequacy and financial condition.


*Internal stress scenario* means a scenario designed by an Enterprise that stresses the specific vulnerabilities of the Enterprise's risk profile and operations, including those related to the Enterprise's capital adequacy and financial condition.


*Planning horizon* means the period of at least nine consecutive quarters for the FHFA scenarios and at least five years for the Internal scenarios, beginning with the quarter preceding the quarter in which the Enterprise submits its capital plan, over which the relevant projections extend, unless otherwise directed by FHFA.


*Regulatory capital ratio* means a capital ratio for which FHFA has established minimum requirements for the Enterprise by regulation or order, including, as applicable, the Enterprise's regulatory capital ratios calculated under subpart B of this part; except that the Enterprise shall not use the advanced approaches to calculate its regulatory capital ratios.


*Severely adverse scenario* has the same meaning as under 12 CFR part 1238.


*Stability capital buffer* has the same meaning as under subpart G of this part.


*Stress capital buffer* means the amount calculated under paragraph (e) of this section.


*Supervisory stress test* means a stress test conducted by FHFA using a severely adverse scenario and the assumptions contained in 12 CFR part 1238.


(d) *Capital planning requirements and procedures*—(1) *Annual capital planning.* (i) An Enterprise must develop and maintain a capital plan.


(ii) An Enterprise must submit its complete capital plan to FHFA by May 20 of each calendar year, or such later date as directed by FHFA.


(iii) The Enterprise's board of directors or a designated committee thereof must at least annually and prior to submission of the capital plan under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section:


(A) Review the robustness of the Enterprise's process for assessing capital adequacy;


(B) Ensure that any deficiencies in the Enterprise's process for assessing capital adequacy are appropriately remedied; and


(C) Approve the Enterprise's capital plan.


(2) *Mandatory elements of capital plan.* A capital plan must contain at least the following elements:


(i) An assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital over the planning horizon that reflects the Enterprise's size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations, assuming both expected and stressful conditions, including:


(A) Estimates of projected revenues, expenses, losses, reserves, and pro forma capital levels, including regulatory capital ratios, and any additional capital measures deemed relevant by the Enterprise, over the planning horizon under a range of scenarios, including the Internal baseline scenario and at least one Internal stress scenario, as well as any additional scenarios that FHFA may provide the Enterprise after giving notice to the Enterprise;


(B) A discussion of the results of any stress test required by law or regulation, and an explanation of how the capital plan takes these results into account; and


(C) A description of all planned capital actions over the planning horizon. Planned capital actions must be consistent with any effective capital distribution limitations, except as may be adjusted pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section. In determining whether an Enterprise's planned capital distributions are consistent with effective capital distribution limitations, an Enterprise must assume that:


(*1*) Any countercyclical capital buffer amount currently applicable to the Enterprise remains at the same level, except that the Enterprise must reflect any increases or decreases in the countercyclical capital buffer amount that have been announced by FHFA at the times indicated by FHFA's announcement for when such increases or decreases will take effect; and


(*2*) Any stability capital buffer currently applicable to the Enterprise when the capital plan is submitted remains at the same level, except that the Enterprise must reflect any increase in its stability capital buffer pursuant to § 1240.400(c)(1), beginning in the fifth quarter of the planning horizon.


(ii) A detailed description of the Enterprise's process for assessing capital adequacy, including:


(A) A discussion of how the Enterprise will, under expected and stressful conditions, maintain capital commensurate with its risks, and maintain capital above the regulatory capital ratios;


(B) A discussion of how the Enterprise will, under expected and stressful conditions, maintain sufficient capital to continue its operations by maintaining ready access to funding, meeting its obligations to creditors and other counterparties, and continuing to serve as a credit intermediary;


(iii) The Enterprise's capital policy; and


(iv) A discussion of any expected changes to the Enterprise's business plan that are likely to have a material impact on the Enterprise's capital adequacy or liquidity.


(3) *Data collection.* Upon the request of FHFA, the Enterprise shall provide FHFA with information regarding:


(i) The Enterprise's financial condition, including its capital;


(ii) The Enterprise's structure;


(iii) Amount and risk characteristics of the Enterprise's on- and off-balance sheet exposures, including exposures within the Enterprise's trading account, other trading-related exposures (such as counterparty-credit risk exposures) or other items sensitive to changes in market factors, including, as appropriate, information about the sensitivity of positions to changes in market rates and prices;


(iv) The Enterprise's relevant policies and procedures, including risk management policies and procedures;


(v) The Enterprise's liquidity profile and management;


(vi) The loss, revenue, and expense estimation models used by the Enterprise for stress scenario analysis, including supporting documentation regarding each model's development and validation; and


(vii) Any other relevant qualitative or quantitative information requested by FHFA to facilitate review of the Enterprise's capital plan under this section.


(4) *Resubmission of a capital plan.* (i) An Enterprise must update and resubmit its capital plan to FHFA within 30 calendar days of the occurrence of one of the following events:


(A) The Enterprise determines there has been or will be a material change in the Enterprise's risk profile, financial condition, or corporate structure since the Enterprise last submitted the capital plan to FHFA; or


(B) FHFA instructs the Enterprise in writing to revise and resubmit its capital plan, as necessary to monitor risks to capital adequacy, for reasons including, but not limited to:


(*1*) *The* capital plan is incomplete or the capital plan, or the Enterprise's internal capital adequacy process, contains material weaknesses;


(*2*) There has been, or will likely be, a material change in the Enterprise's risk profile (including a material change in its business strategy or any risk exposure), financial condition, or corporate structure;


(*3*) The Internal stress scenario(s) are not appropriate for the Enterprise's business model and portfolios, or changes in financial markets or the macro-economic outlook that could have a material impact on an Enterprise's risk profile and financial condition require the use of updated scenarios; or


(ii) FHFA may extend the 30-day period in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section for up to an additional 60 calendar days, or such longer period as FHFA determines appropriate.


(iii) Any updated capital plan must satisfy all the requirements of this section; however, an Enterprise may continue to rely on information submitted as part of a previously submitted capital plan to the extent that the information remains accurate and appropriate.


(5) *Confidential treatment of information submitted.* The confidentiality of information submitted to FHFA under this section and related materials shall be determined in accordance with applicable exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)) and FHFA's rule in 12 CFR part 1214—Availability of Non-Public Information.


(e) *Calculation of the stress capital buffer*—(1) *General.* FHFA will determine the stress capital buffer that applies under § 1240.11 pursuant to this paragraph (e). FHFA will calculate the Enterprise's stress capital buffer requirement annually.


(2) *Stress capital buffer calculation.* An Enterprise's stress capital buffer is

equal to the Enterprise's adjusted total assets, as of the last day of the previous calendar quarter, multiplied by the greater of:


(i) The following calculation:


(A) The ratio of an Enterprise's common equity tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets, as of the final quarter of the previous capital plan cycle, unless otherwise determined by FHFA; minus


(B) The lowest projected ratio of the Enterprise's common equity tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets, in any quarter of the planning horizon under a supervisory stress test; plus


(C) The ratio of:


(*1*) The sum of the Enterprise's planned common stock dividends (expressed as a dollar amount) for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon; to


(*2*) The adjusted total assets of the Enterprise in the quarter in which the Enterprise had its lowest projected ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets, in any quarter of the planning horizon under a supervisory stress test; and

(ii) 0.75 percent.


(3) *Recalculation of stress capital buffer.* If an Enterprise resubmits its capital plan pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section, FHFA may recalculate the Enterprise's stress capital buffer. FHFA will provide notice of whether the Enterprise's stress capital buffer will be recalculated within 75 calendar days after the date on which the capital plan is resubmitted, unless FHFA provides notice to the Enterprise that it is extending the time period.


(f) *Review of capital plans by FHFA.* FHFA will consider the following factors in reviewing an Enterprise's capital plan:


(1) The comprehensiveness of the capital plan, including the extent to which the analysis underlying the capital plan captures and addresses potential risks stemming from activities across the Enterprise and the Enterprise's capital policy;


(2) The reasonableness of the Enterprise's capital plan, the assumptions and analysis underlying the capital plan, and the robustness of its capital adequacy process;


(3) Relevant supervisory information about the Enterprise and its subsidiaries;


(4) The Enterprise's regulatory and financial reports, as well as supporting data that would allow for an analysis of the Enterprise's loss, revenue, and reserve projections;


(5) The results of any stress tests conducted by the Enterprise or FHFA; and


(6) Other information requested or required by FHFA, as well as any other information relevant, or related, to the Enterprise's capital adequacy.


(g) *FHFA notice of stress capital buffer; final planned capital distributions*—(1) *Notice.* FHFA will provide an Enterprise with notice of its stress capital buffer and an explanation of the results of the supervisory stress test. Unless otherwise determined by FHFA, notice will be provided by August 15 of the calendar year in which the capital plan was submitted pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section or within 90 calendar days of receiving notice that FHFA will recalculate the Enterprise's stress capital buffer pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section.


(2) *Response to notice*—(i) *Request for reconsideration of stress capital buffer.* An Enterprise may request reconsideration of a stress capital buffer provided under paragraph (g)(1) of this section. To request reconsideration of a stress capital buffer, an Enterprise must submit to FHFA a request pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section.


(ii) *Adjustments to planned capital distributions.* Within two business days of receipt of notice of a stress capital buffer under paragraph (g)(1) or (h)(5) of this section, as applicable, an Enterprise must:


(A) Determine whether the planned capital distributions for the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon under the Internal baseline scenario would be consistent with effective capital distribution limitations assuming the stress capital buffer provided by FHFA under paragraph (g)(1) or (h)(5) of this section, as applicable, in place of any stress capital buffer in effect; and


(*1*) If the planned capital distributions for the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon under the Internal baseline scenario would not be consistent with effective capital distribution limitations assuming the stress capital buffer provided by FHFA under paragraph (g)(1) or (h)(5) of this section, as applicable, in place of any stress capital buffer in effect, the Enterprise must adjust its planned capital distributions such that its planned capital distributions would be consistent with effective capital distribution limitations assuming the stress capital buffer provided by FHFA under paragraph (g)(1) or (h)(5) of this section, as applicable, in place of any stress capital buffer in effect; or


(*2*) If the planned capital distributions for the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon under the Internal baseline scenario would be consistent with effective capital distribution limitations assuming the stress capital buffer provided by FHFA under paragraph (g)(1) or (h)(5) of this section, as applicable, in place of any stress capital buffer in effect, the Enterprise may adjust its planned capital distributions. An Enterprise may not adjust its planned capital distributions to be inconsistent with the effective capital distribution limitations assuming the stress capital buffer provided by FHFA under paragraph (g)(1) or (h)(5) of this section, as applicable; and


(B) Notify FHFA of any adjustments made to planned capital distributions for the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon under the Internal baseline scenario.


(3) *Final planned capital distributions.* FHFA will consider the planned capital distributions, including any adjustments made pursuant to paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, to be the Enterprise's final planned capital distributions on the later of:


(i) The expiration of the time for requesting reconsideration under paragraph (i) of this section; and


(ii) The expiration of the time for adjusting planned capital distributions pursuant to paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section.


(4) *Effective date of final stress capital buffer.* (i) FHFA will provide an Enterprise with its final stress capital buffer and confirmation of the Enterprise's final planned capital distributions by August 31 of the calendar year that a capital plan was submitted pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, unless otherwise determined by FHFA. A stress capital buffer will not be considered final so as to be agency action subject to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 704 during the pendency of a request for reconsideration made pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section or before the time for requesting reconsideration has expired.


(ii) Unless otherwise determined by FHFA, an Enterprise's final planned capital distributions and final stress capital buffer shall:


(A) Be effective on October 1 of the calendar year in which a capital plan was submitted pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section; and


(B) Remain in effect until superseded.


(5) *Publication.* With respect to an Enterprise subject to this section, FHFA may disclose publicly any or all of the following:

(ii) An informal hearing shall be held within 30 calendar days of a request, if granted, provided that FHFA may extend this period upon notice to the requesting party.


(5) *Response to request.* Within 30 calendar days of receipt of the Enterprise's request for reconsideration of its stress capital buffer submitted under paragraph (h)(2) of this section or within 30 days of the conclusion of an informal hearing conducted under paragraph (h)(4) of this section, FHFA will notify the Enterprise of its decision to affirm or modify the Enterprise's stress capital buffer, provided that FHFA may extend this period upon notice to the Enterprise.


(6) *Distributions during the pendency of a request for reconsideration.* During the pendency of FHFA's decision under paragraph (h)(5) of this section, the Enterprise may make capital distributions that are consistent with effective distribution limitations, unless prior approval is required under paragraph (i)(1) of this section.


(i) *Approval requirements for certain capital actions*—(1) *Circumstances requiring approval*—*resubmission of a capital plan.* Unless it receives prior approval pursuant to paragraph (i)(3) of this section, an Enterprise may not make a capital distribution (excluding any capital distribution arising from the issuance of a capital instrument eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory capital ratio) if the capital distribution would occur after the occurrence of an event requiring resubmission under paragraph (d)(4)(i)(A) or (B) of this section.


(2) *Contents of request.* A request for a capital distribution under this section must contain the following information:


(i) The Enterprise's capital plan or a discussion of changes to the Enterprise's capital plan since it was last submitted to FHFA;


(ii) The purpose of the transaction;


(iii) A description of the capital distribution, including for redemptions or repurchases of securities, the gross consideration to be paid and the terms and sources of funding for the transaction, and for dividends, the amount of the dividend(s); and


(iv) Any additional information requested by FHFA (which may include, among other things, an assessment of the Enterprise's capital adequacy under a severely adverse scenario, a revised capital plan, and supporting data).
