(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the following rights and obligations are governed solely by the book-entry regulations contained in this part, the Securities Documentation, and Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circulars (but not including any choice of law provisions in the Securities Documentation to the extent such provisions conflict with the Book-entry regulations contained in this part):


(1) The rights and obligations of an Enterprise and the Federal Reserve Banks with respect to:


(i) A Book-entry Enterprise Security or Security Entitlement; and


(ii) The operation of the Book-entry System as it applies to Enterprise Securities; and


(2) The rights of any Person, including a Participant, against an Enterprise and the Federal Reserve Banks with respect to:


(i) A Book-entry Enterprise Security or Security Entitlement; and


(ii) The operation of the Book-entry System as it applies to Enterprise Securities;


(b) A security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank from a Participant and that is not recorded on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to ยง 1249.13(c)(1), is governed by the law (not including the conflict-of-law rules) of the jurisdiction where the head office of the Federal Reserve Bank maintaining the Participant's Securities Account is located. A security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank from a Person that is not a Participant, and that is not recorded on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to ยง 1249.13(c)(1), is governed by the law determined in the manner specified in paragraph (d) of this section.


(c) If the jurisdiction specified in the first sentence of paragraph (b) of this section is a State that has not adopted Revised Article 8, then the law specified in paragraph (b) of this section shall be the law of that State as though Revised Article 8 had been adopted by that State.


(d) To the extent not otherwise inconsistent with this part, and notwithstanding any provision in the Securities Documentation setting forth a choice of law, the provisions set forth in 31 CFR 357.11 regarding law governing other interests apply and shall be read as though modified to effectuate the application of 31 CFR 357.11 to the Enterprises.
