# § 1260.4   Timing and form of information distribution.

(a) *Timing of distribution by FHFA.* FHFA may distribute information as provided in the notice issued under § 1260.2(b) after the expiration of the applicable time period specified in § 1260.3(b) unless, within that time period, the affected Bank has filed with FHFA a written request to withhold particular proprietary information that meets the requirements of § 1260.3(a). When a Bank has filed such a request, FHFA shall not distribute the information that is the subject of the request until the Director or his designee has made the determination and provided the notice required by § 1260.3(c) and shall distribute or withhold the subject information in conformity with that determination.


(b) *Timing of distribution by Banks.* A Bank that is required to distribute information directly to the other Banks and the Office of Finance shall distribute that information at the time specified in the notice issued under § 1260.2(b) unless, within the time period specified in § 1260.3(b)(1)(iii), the Bank has submitted to FHFA a request to withhold particular proprietary information that meets the requirements of § 1260.3(a). If the Bank has filed such a request, it need not distribute the information that is the subject of the request until the Director or his designee has made the determination and provided the notice required by § 1260.3(c). Thereafter, the Bank shall distribute or withhold the subject information in conformity with that determination.


(c) *Form.* FHFA may distribute information, or require a Bank to distribute information, under this part in either tangible or electronic form, as it deems appropriate.
