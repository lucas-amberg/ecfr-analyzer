# ยง 1261.10   Independent director conflict of interests.

(a) *Employment interests.* During any independent director's term of service, such director shall not serve as an officer, employee, or director of any member of the Bank on whose board the individual sits, or of any recipient of advances from such Bank, and shall not serve as an officer of any Bank. An independent director or nominee for any independent directorship shall disclose all such interests to the Bank on whose board of directors the individual serves or which is considering the individual for nomination to its board of directors.


(b) *Holding companies.* Service as an officer, employee, or director of a holding company that controls one or more members of, or one or more recipients of advances from, the Bank on whose board an independent director serves is not deemed to be service as an officer, employee or director of a member or recipient of advances if the assets of all such members or all such recipients of advances constitute less than 35 percent of the assets of the holding company, on a consolidated basis.


(c) *Attribution.* For purposes of determining compliance with this section, a Bank shall attribute to the independent director any officer position, employee position, or directorship of the director's spouse.
