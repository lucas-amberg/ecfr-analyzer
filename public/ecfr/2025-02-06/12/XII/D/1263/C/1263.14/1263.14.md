# § 1263.14   De novo insured depository institution applicants.

(a) *Presumptive compliance.* A de novo insured depository institution applicant shall be deemed to meet the duly organized, subject to inspection and regulation, financial condition, and character of management requirements of §§ 1263.7, 1263.8, 1263.11 and 1263.12, respectively.


(b) *Makes long-term home mortgage loans requirement.* A de novo insured depository institution applicant shall be deemed to make long-term home mortgage loans, as required by section 4(a)(1)(C) of the Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1424(a)(1)(C)) and § 1263.6(a)(3), if it has filed as part of its application for membership a written justification acceptable to the Bank of how its home financing credit policy and lending practices will include originating or purchasing long-term home mortgage loans.


(c) *10 percent requirement.*—(1) *Conditional approval.* If a de novo insured depository institution applicant that commenced its initial business operations less than one year before applying for Bank membership is subject to, but cannot yet meet, the 10 percent requirement of section 4(a)(2)(A) of the Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1424(a)(2)(A)) and § 1263.6(b) as provided in § 1263.10, a Bank may conditionally approve that applicant for membership if it meets all other applicable requirements.


(2) *Approval may become final.* If, within one year after commencement of its initial business operations, an institution that was conditionally approved for membership under paragraph (c)(1) of this section supplies evidence acceptable to the Bank that it satisfies the 10 percent requirement as provided under § 1263.10, its membership approval shall become final.


(3) *Approval may become void.* If an institution that was conditionally approved for membership under paragraph (c)(1) does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, it shall be deemed to be out of compliance with the 10 percent requirement, and its conditional membership approval shall become void.


(d) *Home financing policy requirement.*—(1) *Conditional approval.* If a de novo insured depository institution applicant cannot meet the home financing policy requirement of section 4(a)(2)(C) of the Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1424(a)(2)(C)) and § 1263.6(a)(6) as provided under § 1263.13 because it has not received its first CRA performance evaluation, a Bank may conditionally approve that applicant for membership if it meets all other applicable requirements and has included in its application a written justification acceptable to the Bank of how and why its home financing credit policy and lending practices will meet the credit needs of its community.


(2) *Approval may become final.* If an institution that was conditionally approved for membership under paragraph (d)(1) of this section supplies evidence acceptable to the Bank that it has satisfied the home financing policy requirement as provided under § 1263.13 by receiving a CRA rating of “Satisfactory” or better on its first CRA performance evaluation, its membership approval shall cease to be conditional.


(3) *Approval may become void.* If an institution that was conditionally approved for membership under paragraph (d)(1) of this section receives a rating of “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Non-Compliance” on its first CRA performance evaluation, and fails to rebut the presumption of non-compliance with the home financing policy requirement as provided under § 1263.17(f), it shall be deemed to be out of compliance with that requirement and its conditional membership approval shall become void.


(e) *Other rules.* An institution that has been conditionally approved for membership under paragraph (c)(1) or (d)(1) of this section shall be subject to all regulations applicable to members generally, including those relating to stock purchase requirements and or collateral, notwithstanding that its membership may be conditional for some period of time. If an institution's conditional membership approval becomes void as provided in paragraphs (c)(3) or (d)(3) of this section, then the Bank shall liquidate any outstanding indebtedness owed by the institution to the Bank and redeem or repurchase its capital stock in accordance with § 1263.29.
