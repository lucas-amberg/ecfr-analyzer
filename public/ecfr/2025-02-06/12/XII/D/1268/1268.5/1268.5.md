# ยง 1268.5   Credit risk-sharing requirement.

(a) *General credit risk-sharing requirement.* For each AMA product, the Bank shall implement and have in place at all times, a credit risk-sharing structure that:


(1) Requires a participating financial institution to provide the credit enhancement necessary to enhance an eligible asset or pool to the credit quality specified by the terms and conditions of the AMA product, provided, however, that such credit enhancement results in the eligible asset or pool being at least AMA investment grade, as defined in ยง 1268.1; and


(2) Meets the requirements of this section.


(b) *Determination of necessary credit enhancement.* (1) No later than 30 calendar days after the purchase of the asset or after a pool closes, the Bank shall determine the total credit enhancement necessary to enhance the asset or pool to at least AMA investment grade and to be consistent with the terms and conditions of a specific AMA product. The enhancement shall be for the life of the asset or pool. The Bank shall make this determination for each AMA product using a model and methodology that the Bank deems appropriate, subject to paragraph (f) of this section.


(2) A Bank shall document its basis for concluding that the contractual credit enhancement required from each participating financial institution with regard to a particular asset or pool will equal or exceed the credit enhancement level specified in the terms and conditions of the AMA product and determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(c) *Credit risk-sharing structure.* Under any credit risk-sharing structure, the credit enhancement provided by the participating financial institution shall at all times meet the following requirements:


(1) The participating financial institution that is providing the credit enhancement required under this paragraph (c) shall in all cases:


(i) Bear the direct economic consequences of actual credit losses on the asset or pool:


(A) From the first dollar of loss up to the amount of expected losses; or


(B) Immediately following expected losses, but in an amount equal to or exceeding the amount of expected losses; and


(ii) Fully secure its direct credit enhancement obligation in accordance with ยง 1266.7; and


(2) The participating financial institution also may provide all or a portion of the credit enhancement, with the approval of the Bank, by:


(i) Contracting with an insurance affiliate of that participating financial institution to provide an enhancement, but only where such insurance is positioned in the credit risk-sharing structure so as to cover only losses remaining after the participating financial institution has borne losses as required under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section;


(ii) Purchasing loan-level insurance only where:


(A) The participating financial institution is legally obligated at all times to maintain such insurance with a qualified insurer; and


(B) Such insurance is positioned in the credit enhancement structure so as to cover only losses remaining after the participating financial institution has borne losses as required under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section;


(iii) Purchasing pool-level insurance only where:


(A) The participating financial institution is legally obligated at all times to maintain such insurance with a qualified insurer;


(B) Such insurance insures that portion of the required credit enhancement attributable to the geographic concentration and size of the pool; and


(C) Such insurance is positioned last in the credit enhancement structure so as to cover only those losses remaining after all other elements of the credit enhancement structure have been exhausted;


(iv) Contracting with another participating financial institution in the Bank's district to provide a credit enhancement consistent with this section, in return for compensation; or


(v) Contracting with a participating financial institution in another Bank's district, pursuant to an arrangement between the two Banks, to provide a credit enhancement consistent with this section, in return for compensation.


(d) *Loans guaranteed or insured by a department or agency of the U.S. government.* Instead of the structure set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, a participating financial institution also may provide the required credit enhancement through loan-level insurance that is issued by an agency or department of the U.S. government or is a guarantee from an agency or department of the U.S. government, provided that the government insurance or guarantee remains in place for as long as the Bank owns the loan.


(e) *Qualified insurers.* (1) Within one year of January 18, 2017, each Bank must develop, and subsequently maintain, written financial and operational standards that an insurer must meet for the Bank to approve it as a qualified insurer. A Bank shall review qualified insurers at least once every two years to determine whether they still meet the financial and operational standards set by the Bank. A Bank may delegate responsibility for development of these standards and approval of qualified insurers to another Bank or group of Banks pursuant to ยง 1268.8.


(2) Only qualified insurers may provide private loan insurance on AMA eligible assets or the loan or pool insurance allowed as part of the credit enhancement structure for AMA products under paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section.


(f) *Appropriate methodology for calculating credit enhancement.* A Bank shall use a model and methodology for estimating the amount of credit enhancement for an asset or pool. A Bank shall provide to FHFA upon request information about the model and methodology, including and without limitation results of any model runs and the results of any tests of the model performed by the Bank. FHFA reserves the right to direct a Bank to make changes to its model and methodology, and a Bank promptly shall institute any such FHFA-directed changes.
