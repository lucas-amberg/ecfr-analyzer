# ยง 1281.12   General counting requirements.

(a) *General.* Mortgage purchases financing single-family properties shall be evaluated based on the income of the mortgagors and the area median income at the time the mortgage was originated. To determine whether mortgages may be counted under a particular family income level (*e.g.,* low- or very low-income), the income of the mortgagor is compared to the median income for the area at the time the mortgage was originated, using the appropriate percentage factor provided under ยง 1281.1.


(b) *No double-counting.* A mortgage may be counted only once toward the achievement of the prospective mortgage purchase housing goal, even if it satisfies multiple criteria for the prospective mortgage purchase housing goal.


(c) *Application of median income.* For purposes of determining an area's median income under ยง 1281.1, the area is:


(1) The metropolitan area, if the residence that secures the mortgage is in a metropolitan area; and


(2) In all other areas, the county in which the property is located, except that where the State non-metropolitan median income is higher than the county's median income, the area is the State non-metropolitan area.


(d) *Sampling not permitted.* Performance under the housing goals for each year shall be based on a tabulation of each mortgage during that year; a sampling of such purchases is not acceptable.
