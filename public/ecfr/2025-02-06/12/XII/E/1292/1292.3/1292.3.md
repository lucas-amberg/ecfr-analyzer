A Bank also may offer other CICA programs for targeted community lending using targeted beneficiaries and targeted income levels other than those specified in ยง 1292.1, established by the Bank with the prior approval of FHFA. In addition, a Bank shall offer CICA programs under section 10(i) of the Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1430(i)) (Community Investment Program (CIP)) and section 10(j) of the Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1430(j)) (AHP). A Bank may provide advances or grants under its CICA programs except for CIP programs, under which a Bank may only provide advances.
