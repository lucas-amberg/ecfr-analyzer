# § 1293.25   Program requirements.

(a) *Requirements for underserved communities.* An Enterprise shall ensure that a plan relies on adequate information in identifying the underserved community or communities addressed by that plan and shall document that information as part of the plan. In selecting one or more underserved communities to be the focus of a plan, an Enterprise shall consider, among other factors:


(1) Input from public engagement;


(2) Whether the underserved community has previously been the focus of a plan;


(3) The extent of the needs identified for the underserved community, including such needs that may remain despite prior efforts under a plan; and


(4) Whether the underserved community is covered by a different initiative or program of the Enterprise.


(b) *Requirements for objectives.* Objectives identified in a plan shall be logically tied to one or more identified barriers and facilitate establishing meaningful actions and measurable goals.


(c) *Requirements for meaningful actions*—(1) *Relation to objectives and goals.* Meaningful actions shall be logically tied to one or more measurable goals and one or more objectives and support sustainable housing opportunities for an identified underserved community.


(2) *Other Enterprise goals and incremental action.* Meaningful actions may also serve other Enterprise objectives and goals; however, a plan shall reflect significant additional action above and beyond actions that are also serving other Enterprise objectives and goals and shall reflect more than *de minimis* action.


(3) *Significant dedication of resources.* Meaningful actions shall reflect a commitment commensurate with an Enterprise's prominence in the housing market, its available resources, its dedication of resources to other important efforts, the needs of underserved communities, market conditions, and safety and soundness.


(4) *Compliance with law.* Actions that are not compliant with the Safety and Soundness Act, the authorizing statutes, or other applicable law do not qualify as meaningful actions.


(5) *Required remedial actions.* Actions that are required to remediate supervisory findings or required as a result of enforcement actions do not qualify as meaningful actions.


(d) *Requirements for measurable goals.* Measurable goals shall be:


(1) Logically tied to one or more meaningful actions identified in a plan;


(2) Specific;


(3) Time-bound;


(4) Focused on outcomes; and


(5) Facilitative of measuring Enterprise progress, comparing Enterprise performance, and ensuring public accountability.
