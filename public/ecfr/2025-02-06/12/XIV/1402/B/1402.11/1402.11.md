# ยง 1402.11   Current index.

The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation will make available for public inspection and copying a current index to provide identifying information as to any matter required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(C) to be made available or published in the _Federal Register._ Because of the anticipated infrequency of requests for material required to be indexed, it is determined that the publication of the index in the _Federal Register_ is unnecessary and impracticable. However, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation will provide a copy of such index to a member of the public upon request therefor at a cost not in excess of the direct cost of duplication.
