(B) By 0.0010.


(d) *Secure base amount*. In addition to the Corporation's authority to reduce premiums under section 5.55(a)(3) of the Act, upon reaching the secure base amount determined by the Corporation in accordance with section 5.55 of the Act, the annual premium to be paid by each insured bank, computed in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, shall be reduced by a percentage determined by the Corporation so that the aggregate of the premiums payable by all of the Farm Credit banks for the following calendar year is sufficient to ensure that the Insurance Fund balance is maintained at not less than the secure base amount. The Corporation shall announce any such percentage no later than December 31 of the year prior to the January in which such premiums are to be paid.
