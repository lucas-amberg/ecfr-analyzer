*Covered reporter* means any financial company that meets the criteria set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; provided, however, that any covered reporter shall cease to be a covered reporter only if it does not meet the dollar thresholds specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for at least four consecutive calendar quarters.


*File observation date* means the date on which any business day ends.


*Financial company* has the same meaning as in 12 U.S.C. 5341(2).

*Government securities dealer* means any financial company registered as a government securities dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


*Investment adviser* means any financial company registered as an investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.


*Non-centrally cleared bilateral repurchase agreement transaction* means an agreement of one party to sell securities to a second party in exchange for the receipt of cash, and the simultaneous agreement of the former party to later reacquire the same securities (or any subsequently substituted securities) from that same second party in exchange for the payment of cash; or an agreement of a party to acquire securities from a second party in exchange for the payment of cash, and the simultaneous agreement of the former party to later transfer back the same securities (or any subsequently substituted securities) to the latter party in exchange for the receipt of cash. The agreement does not involve a tri-party custodian and is not cleared with a central counterparty. This definition includes, but is not limited to, transactions that are executed under a Master Repurchase Agreement (MRA) or Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA), or which are agreed to by the parties as subject to the provisions of 11 U.S.C. 559. Notwithstanding the above, transactions conducted under a Securities Lending Agreement (SLA) or a Master Securities Lending Agreement (MSLA) are not considered repurchase agreements, nor are repurchase agreements arising from either participation in a commercial mortgage loan or the initial securitization of a residential mortgage loan.


*Outstanding commitment* means the amount of financial obligations entered into pursuant to any repurchase agreement that opens on any business day or is outstanding as of the end of any business day, including transactions which both opened and closed on the same business day.
