# § 1777.22   Limitation on capital distributions.

(a) *Capital distributions in general.* An Enterprise shall make no capital distribution that would decrease the total capital of the Enterprise to an amount less than the risk-based capital level or the core capital of the Enterprise to an amount less than the minimum capital level without the prior written approval of OFHEO.


(b) *Capital distributions by an Enterprise that is not adequately capitalized*—(1) *Prohibited distributions.* An Enterprise that is not classified as adequately capitalized shall make no capital distribution that would result in the Enterprise being classified into a lower capital classification than the one to which it is classified at the time of such distribution.


(2) *Restricted distributions.* An Enterprise classified as significantly or critically undercapitalized shall make no capital distribution without the prior written approval of OFHEO. OFHEO may grant a request for such a capital distribution only if OFHEO determines, in its discretion, that the distribution:


(i) Will enhance the ability of the Enterprise to meet the risk-based capital level and the minimum capital level promptly;


(ii) Will contribute to the long-term financial safety and soundness of the Enterprise; or


(iii) Is otherwise in the public interest.
