# § 1805.500   Matching funds—general.

All financial assistance awarded under this part shall be matched with funds from sources other than the Federal government. Except as provided in § 1805.502, such matching funds shall be provided on the basis of not less than one dollar for each dollar provided by the CDFI Fund. Funds that have been used to satisfy a legal requirement for obtaining funds under either the CDFI Program or another Federal grant or award program may not be used to satisfy the matching requirements described in this section. Community Development Block Grant Program and other funds provided pursuant to the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5301 *et seq.*), shall be considered Federal government funds and shall not be used to meet the matching requirements. Matching funds shall be used as provided in the applicable Notice of Funds Availability and/or the corresponding Assistance Agreement. Funds that are used prior to the execution of the Assistance Agreement may nevertheless qualify as matching funds provided they were used as provided in the applicable Notice of Funds Availability and/or Assistance Agreement.
