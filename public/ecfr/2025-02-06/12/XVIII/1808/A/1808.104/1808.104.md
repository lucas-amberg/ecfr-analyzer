# ยง 1808.104   Deviations.

To the extent that such requirements are not specified by statute, the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, may authorize deviations on an individual or general basis from the requirements of this interim rule upon a finding that such deviation is essential to program objectives, and the special circumstances stated in the proposal make such deviation clearly in the best interest of the Federal Government. All proposals must be in writing and supported by a statement of the facts and the grounds forming the basis of the deviation. For deviations of general applicability, after a determination is made by the Secretary of the Treasury based on the deviation proposal, the CDFI Fund must publish notification of granted deviations in the _Federal Register._ Any deviation that was not captured in the original credit subsidy cost estimate will require either additional fees, or discretionary appropriations to cover the cost.
