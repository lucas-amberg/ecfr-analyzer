You may employ an Investment Adviser/Manager who will be subject to the supervision of your board of directors or general partner. If you have Leverage or plan to seek Leverage, you must obtain SBA's prior written approval of the management contract. SBA's approval of an Investment Adviser/Manager for one Licensee does not indicate approval of that manager for any other Licensee.

(1) Specify the services the Investment Adviser/Manager will render to you and to the Small Businesses in your Portfolio; and 


(2) Indicate the basis for computing Management Expenses.
