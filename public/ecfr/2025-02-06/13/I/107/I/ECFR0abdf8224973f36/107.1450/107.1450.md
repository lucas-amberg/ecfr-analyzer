At the redemption date, you must pay to SBA: 


(1) The par value (of preferred stock) or face value (of a preferred limited partnership interest); plus 


(2) Any unpaid dividends or partnership distributions accrued to the redemption date. 


(b) *Repurchase of 3 percent preferred stock for less than par value.* If you issued 3 percent preferred stock to SBA, you may ask SBA to sell it back to you at a price less than its par value. The terms and conditions of any such transaction will be as set forth in the Notice published in the _Federal Register_ on April 1, 1994 (Copies of this notice are available from SBA, 409 3rd Street, SW., Washington, DC, 20416). SBA has sole discretion to:

(2) Determine the sale price after considering any factors SBA considers appropriate. 


(3) Determine the form of payment SBA will accept. SBA is not authorized to accept the proceeds of a subsidized Debenture as payment.
