(1) You purchase such securities within 90 days of the date the public offering is first made;


(2) Your purchase price is no more than the original public offering price; and


(3) The amount paid by you for the securities (less ordinary and reasonable underwriting charges and commissions) has been, or will be, paid to the Small Business, and the underwriter certifies in writing that this requirement has been met.


(b) *Recordkeeping requirements.* You must keep records available for SBA's inspection which show the relevant details of the transaction, including, but not limited to, date, price, commissions, and the underwriter's certifications required under paragraphs (a)(3) and (c) of this section.


(c) *Underwriter's requirements.* The underwriter must certify whether it is your Associate. You may pay reasonable and customary commissions and expenses to an Associate underwriter for the portion of an offering that you purchase.

(e) *Purchases of securities from other non-issuers.* You may purchase securities of a Small Business from a non-issuer not previously described in this section if such acquisition is a reasonably necessary part of the overall sound Financing of the Small Business.
