# ยง 109.350   Maintenance of loan loss reserve.

The ILP Intermediary must maintain a reasonable loan loss reserve appropriate for the quality of the ILP Intermediary's portfolio in a federally insured depository account established by the ILP Intermediary at a well-capitalized financial institution. The loan loss reserve must be in an account separate and distinct from the ILP Intermediary's other assets and financial activities. This reserve must be maintained at not less than 5% of the principal balance of all outstanding loans to Eligible Small Business Concerns made from the ILP Relending Fund. The AA/CA or designee may require the ILP Intermediary to maintain a larger loss reserve if the AA/CA determines that the ILP Intermediary's loss reserve level is potentially inadequate to protect SBA from loss. ILP Relending Fund proceeds must not be used to establish or maintain the loan loss reserve.
