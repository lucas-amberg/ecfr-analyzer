# ยง 112.3   Discrimination prohibited.

(a) *General.* To the extent that this part applies, no person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination by any business or other activity. 


(b) *Specific discriminatory actions prohibited.* (1) To the extent that this part applies, a business or other activity may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, on ground of race, color or national origin: 


(i) Deny an individual any services, financial aid or other benefit provided by the business or other activity; 


(ii) Provide any service, financial aid or other benefit to an individual which is different or is provided in a different manner, from that provided to others by the business or other activity; 


(iii) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in any manner related to his receipt of any service, financial aid or other benefit from the business or other activity; 


(iv) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, financial aid or other benefit from the business or other activity; 


(v) Treat an individual differently from others in determining whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, membership or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid or other benefit provided by the business or other activity. 


(2) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in this paragraph does not limit the generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section. 


(3) This regulation does not prohibit the consideration of race, color, or national origin if the purpose and effect are to remove or overcome the consequences of practices or impediments which have restricted the availability of, or participation in, a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin. Where previous discriminatory practice or usage tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to which this regulation applies, the applicant or recipient has an obligation to take reasonable action to remove or overcome the consequences of the prior discriminatory practice or usage, and to accomplish the purposes of the Act.
