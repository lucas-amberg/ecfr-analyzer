# ยง 113.3   Discrimination prohibited.

To the extent not covered or prohibited by part 112 of this chapter, recipients of financial assistance may not:


(a) Discriminate with regard to goods, services, or accommodations offered or provided by the aided business or other enterprise, whether or not operated for profit, because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, or national origin of a person, or fail or refuse to accept a person on a nonsegregated basis as a patient, student, visitor, guest, customer, passenger, or patron.


(b) With regard to employment practices within the aided business or other enterprise, whether or not operated for profit; fail or refuse, because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin of a person, to seek or retain the person's services, or to provide the person with opportunities for advancement or promotion, or accord an employee the rank and rate of compensation, including fringe benefits, merited by the employee's services and abilities.


(c) With regard to employment practices within the aided business or other enterprise, whether or not operated for profit; discriminate against a qualified handicapped person; or because of handicap, fail or refuse to seek or retain the person's services or to provide the person with opportunities for advancement or promotion, or accord an employee the rank and rate of compensation, including fringe benefits, merited by the employee's services and abilities. All employment decisions shall be made in a manner which ensures that discrimination on the basis of handicap does not occur. Such decisions may not limit, segregate, or classify job applicants or employees in any way that adversely affects the opportunities or status of qualified handicapped individuals.


(d) Participate in a contractual or other relationship that has the effect of subjecting job applicants or employees to discrimination prohibited by this part. The relationships referred to in this paragraph include those with employment and referral agencies, labor unions, organizations providing or administering fringe benefits to employees of the recipient, and organizations providing training and apprenticeship programs. Activities covered by this part are as follows:


(1) Recruitment, advertising, and the processing of applications for employment;


(2) Hiring, upgrading, promotion, award of tenure, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, right of return from layoff, and rehiring;


(3) Rates of pay or any other form of compensation and changes in compensation;


(4) Job assignments, job classifications, organizational structures, position descriptions, lines of progression, and seniority lists;


(5) Leaves of absence, sick leave, or any other leave;


(6) Fringe benefits available by virtue of employment, whether or not administered by the recipient;


(7) Selection and financial support for training, including apprenticeship, professional meetings, conferences, and other related activities, and selection for leaves of absence to pursue training;


(8) Employer sponsored activities, including social or recreational programs; and


(9) Any other term, condition, or privilege of employment.


(e) Use employment tests or criteria that discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, marital status, handicap, or national origin. Employment tests which are used for all other job applicants shall be adapted in an appropriate mode for use by persons who have handicaps that impair sensory, manual, or speaking skills.


(f) Conduct a preemployment medical examination, unless required of all job applicants, and subsequent to a conditional offer of employment. The results of all such medical examinations shall be kept confidential.


(g) Make a preemployment inquiry as to whether a job applicant is a handicapped person or as to the nature or severity of a handicap: EXCEPT when a recipient is taking remedial action to overcome the effects of conditions which resulted in past discrimination, or when a recipient is taking affirmative action pursuant to section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.


(1) Such preemployment inquiry may only be made after the job applicant has been informed that such disclosure is for the purposes set forth in paragraph (g) of this section; that the disclosure is voluntary and will be kept confidential; and that refusal of the job applicant to provide such information will not subject the applicant to any adverse action.


(2) Information elicited from qualified handicapped job applicants concerning their medical history or condition shall be kept confidential EXCEPT that:


(i) Supervisors and managers may be informed about restrictions on or accommodations to be made for the qualified handicapped individual;


(ii) First aid and safety personnel may be informed, where appropriate, of the need for possible emergency treatment; and


(iii) Compliance officials shall be given relevant information, if requested.


(h) Discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, handicap or national origin in the use of toilets or any facilities for rest or comfort. Discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, handicap or national origin in the use of cafeterias, recreational programs or other programs sponsored by the applicant or recipient. 


(i) With regard to all recipients offering credit, such as Small Business Investment Companies and Community Development Companies, discriminate against debtors on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, marital status, handicap, or national origin. 


(j) With regard to the granting of credit by all recipient creditors, discriminate against any credit applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, handicap, age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract), because all or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program, or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
