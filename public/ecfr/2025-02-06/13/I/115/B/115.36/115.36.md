# ยง 115.36   Indemnity settlements.

(a) An indemnity settlement occurs when a defaulted Principal and its Surety agree upon an amount, less than the actual loss under the bond, which will satisfy the Principal's indebtedness to the Surety. Sureties must not agree to any indemnity settlement proposal or enter into any such agreement without SBA's concurrence. 


(b) Any settlement proposal submitted for SBA's consideration must include current financial information, including financial statements, tax returns, and credit reports, together with the Surety's written recommendations. It should also indicate whether the Principal is interested in further bonding. 


(c) The Surety must pay SBA its *pro rata* share of the settlement amount within 45 days of receipt. Prior to closing the file on a Principal, the Surety must certify that SBA has received its *pro rata* share of all indemnity recovery.
