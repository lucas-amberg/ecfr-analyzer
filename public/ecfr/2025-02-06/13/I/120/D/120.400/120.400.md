# ยง 120.400   Loan Guarantee Agreements.

SBA may enter into a Loan Guarantee Agreement with a Lender to make deferred participation (guaranteed) loans. Such an agreement does not obligate SBA to participate in any specific proposed loan that a Lender may submit. The existence of a Loan Guarantee Agreement does not limit SBA's rights to deny a specific loan or establish general policies. *See also* ยง 120.440(c) concerning Supplemental Guarantee Agreements.
