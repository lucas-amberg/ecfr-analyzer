# ยง 120.468   Change of ownership or control requirements for SBA Supervised Lenders.

(a) *SBA prior approval required.* Any change of ownership or control of an SBA Supervised Lender without SBA's prior written approval is prohibited. Prior to entering into any agreement, other than a non-binding letter of intent, for a change of ownership or control, SBA Supervised Lenders must receive SBA's prior written approval from the appropriate SBA official in accordance with the prevailing Delegations of Authority. An SBA Supervised Lender may not register proposed new owners on its books and records or permit them to participate in any manner in the conduct of the SBA Supervised Lender's affairs unless approved in writing by SBA. Any type of non-binding letter of intent regarding a prospective change of ownership or control must be reported to SBA within 30 calendar days. A change of ownership or control includes the following:


(1) Any transfer(s) (direct or indirect) of 10 percent or more of any class of the SBA Supervised Lender's stock or ownership interests (or series of transfers which, in the aggregate over an 18 month period, equals 10 percent or more), or any agreement providing for such transfer;


(2) Any transfer(s) (direct or indirect) that could result in the beneficial ownership by any person or group of persons acting in concert of 10 percent or more of any class of the SBA Supervised Lender's stock or ownership interests, or any agreement providing for such transfer(s);


(3) Any merger, consolidation, or reorganization;


(4) Any other transaction or agreement that transfers control of an SBA Supervised Lender; or


(5) Any other transaction or event that results in any change in the possession (direct or indirect) of the right to control, or the power to direct or cause the direction of, the management or policies of an SBA Supervised Lender, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.


(b) *Approval required by other regulatory authorities.* If a change of ownership or control of an SBA Supervised Lender is subject to the approval of any state or Federal chartering, licensing or other regulatory authority, copies of any documents filed with such authority must, at the same time, be transmitted to the appropriate SBA official in accordance with the prevailing Delegations of Authority. The approval of any state or Federal authority will be required in addition to SBA's prior written approval.


(c) *Application requirements for changes of ownership or control.* An applicant must submit a Lender Assessment Plan and a new application in accordance with ยง 120.466 for any change of ownership or control. If a proposed change of ownership is for less than 50 percent of the ownership interests in an SBA Supervised Lender, SBA may, in its sole discretion, limit the requirements of the Lender Assessment Plan or the complete application as set forth in official SBA policy and procedures.


(d) *Voluntary surrender of SBA lending authority.* An SBA Supervised Lender may voluntarily surrender its SBA lending authority (including its SBLC license or NFRL lending authority, as applicable) and withdraw as a participating Lender with SBA's prior written approval. The SBA Supervised Lender must agree to transfer its entire 7(a) loan portfolio to one or more Lenders acceptable to SBA in accordance with ยง 120.432(a), and enter into a withdrawal agreement to resolve any outstanding issues, including any outstanding monetary liabilities, to SBA's satisfaction. SBA may, in its sole discretion, take over the servicing of an SBA Supervised Lender's 7(a) loan portfolio in accordance with ยง 120.535(d) upon the voluntary surrender of its SBA lending authority.
