# § 120.420   Definitions.

(a) *7(a) Loans*—All references to 7(a) loans under this subpart include loans made under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 *et seq.*) and loans made under section 502 of the Small Business Investment Act (15 U.S.C. 661 *et seq.*), both of which may be securitized under this subpart.


(b) *Benchmark Number*—The maximum number of percentage points that a securitizer's Currency Rate can decrease without triggering the PLP suspension provision set forth in § 120.425. SBA will publish the Benchmark Number in the _Federal Register._

(c) *Currency Rate*—A securitizer's “Currency Rate” is the dollar balance of its 7(a) guaranteed loans that are less than 30 days past due divided by the dollar balance of its portfolio of 7(a) guaranteed loans outstanding, as calculated quarterly by SBA, excluding loans approved in SBA's current fiscal year.


(d) *Currency Rate Percentage*—The relationship between the securitizer's Currency Rate and the SBA 7(a) loan portfolio Currency Rate as calculated by dividing the securitizer's Currency Rate by the SBA 7(a) loan portfolio Currency Rate.


(e) *Good Standing*—In general, a Lender is in “good standing” with SBA if it: 


(1) Is in compliance with all applicable:


(i) Laws and regulations;


(ii) Policies; and


(iii) Procedures;


(2) Is in good financial condition as determined by SBA;


(3) Is not under investigation or indictment for, or has not been convicted of, or had a judgment entered against it for felony or fraud, or charges relating to a breach of trust or violation of a law or regulation protecting the integrity of business transactions or relationships, unless the Lender Oversight Committee has determined that good standing exists despite the existence of such factors.


(4) Does not have any officer or employee who has been under investigation or indictment for, or has been convicted of or had a judgment entered against him for, a felony or fraud, or charges relating to a breach of trust or violation of a law or regulation protecting the integrity of business transactions or relationships, unless the Lender Oversight Committee has determined that good standing exists despite the existence of such person.


(f) *Initial Currency Rate*—The Initial Currency Rate (ICR) is the securitizer's benchmark Currency Rate. SBA will calculate the securitizer's ICR as of the end of the calendar quarter immediately prior to the first securitization completed after April 12, 1999. This calculation will include all 7(a) loans which are outstanding and were approved in any fiscal year prior to SBA's current fiscal year. Each quarter, SBA will compare each securitizer's Currency Rate to its ICR.


(g) *Initial Currency Rate Percentage*—The Initial Currency Rate Percentage (ICRP) measures the relationship between a securitizer's Initial Currency Rate and the SBA 7(a) loan portfolio Currency Rate at the time of the first securitization after April 12, 1999. The ICRP is calculated by dividing the securitizer's Currency Rate by the SBA 7(a) loan portfolio Currency Rate. SBA will calculate the securitizer's ICRP as of the end of the calendar quarter immediately prior to the first securitization completed after April 12, 1999.


(h) *Loss Rate*—A securitizer's “loss rate,” as calculated by SBA, is the aggregate principal amount of the securitizer's 7(a) loans determined uncollectible by SBA for the most recent 10-year period, excluding SBA's current fiscal year activity, divided by the aggregate original principal amount of 7(a) loans disbursed by the securitizer during that period.


(i) *Nondepository Institution*—A “nondepository institution” is a Small Business Lending Company (“SBLC”) regulated by SBA or a Business and Industrial Development Company (“BIDCO”) or other nondepository institution participating in SBA's 7(a) program.


(j) *Securitization*—A “securitization” is the pooling and sale of the unguaranteed portion of SBA guaranteed loans to a trust, special purpose vehicle, or other mechanism, and the issuance of securities backed by those loans to investors in either a private placement or public offering.
