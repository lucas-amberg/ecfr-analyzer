(1) The Borrower remains in uncured default for 60 days on payments of principal or interest due on the note; 


(2) The Lender fails to send to the FTA on a timely basis payments it received from the Borrower; or 


(3) The FTA fails to send to the Registered Holder on a timely basis any payments it has received from the Lender. 


(c) *Full faith and credit.* SBA's guarantee to the Registered Holder is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.
