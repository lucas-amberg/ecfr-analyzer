(a) *General form and content.* Each Certificate must be registered with the FTA. SBA must approve the terms of the Certificate. 


(b) *Face amount of Pool Certificate.* The face amount of a Pool Certificate cannot be less than a minimum amount as specified in the Program Guide, and the dollar amount of Certificates must be in increments which SBA will specify in the Program Guide (except for one Certificate in each Pool). SBA may change these requirements based upon an analysis of market conditions and program experience, and will publish any such change in the _Federal Register._

(c) *Basis of payment for Pool Certificates.* Principal installments and interest payments are based on the unpaid principal balance of the portion of the Pool represented by a Pool Certificate.
