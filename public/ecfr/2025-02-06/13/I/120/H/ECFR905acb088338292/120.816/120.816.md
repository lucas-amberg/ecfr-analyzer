# ยง 120.816   CDC non-profit status and good standing.

A CDC must be a non-profit corporation, except that for-profit CDCs certified by SBA prior to January 1, 1987 may retain their certifications. An SBIC may not become a CDC. A CDC must be in good standing based upon the following criteria: 


(a) In good standing in the State in which the CDC is incorporated and any other State in which the CDC conducts business. 


(b) In compliance with all laws, including taxation requirements, in the State in which the CDC is incorporated and any other State in which the CDC conducts business.


(c) Must have satisfactory SBA performance, as determined by SBA in its discretion. The CDC's Risk Rating, among other factors, will be considered in determining satisfactory SBA performance. Other factors may include, but are not limited to, review/examination assessments, historical performance measures, loan volume to the extent that it impacts performance measures, and other performance related measurements and information (such as contribution toward SBA mission).


(d) If a non-profit CDC has a membership and the members are responsible for electing or appointing voting directors to the CDC's Board of Directors, no person or entity can control more than 25 percent of the CDC's voting membership.
