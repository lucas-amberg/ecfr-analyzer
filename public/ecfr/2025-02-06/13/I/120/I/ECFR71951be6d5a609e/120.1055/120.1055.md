# § 120.1055   Review and examination results.

(a) *Written Reports.* SBA will provide an SBA Lender and Intermediary a copy of SBA's written report prepared as a result of the SBA Lender or Intermediary review or examination (“Report”). SBA will provide the Report generally within 60 business days following SBA's conclusion of the review/examination unless SBA notifies the SBA Lender or Intermediary of a later date and the reason for the delay. The Report may contain findings, conclusions, corrective actions, and recommendations. Each director (or manager, in the absence of a Board of Directors) of the SBA Lender or Intermediary, in keeping with his or her responsibilities, must become fully informed regarding the contents of the Report.


(b) *Response to review and examination Reports.* SBA Lenders and Intermediaries must respond to Report findings, recommendations, and corrective actions, if any, in writing to SBA and, if requested, submit proposed corrective actions and/or a capital restoration plan. An SBA Lender or Intermediary must respond within 45 business days from the date the Report is received unless SBA notifies the SBA Lender or Intermediary in writing that the response, proposed corrective actions or capital restoration plan is to be filed within a different time period (either shortened or extended in SBA's discretion). The SBA Lender or Intermediary response must address each finding, recommendation, and corrective action. In proposing a corrective action or capital restoration plan, the SBA Lender or Intermediary must detail the steps it will take to correct the finding(s); the time within which each step will be taken; the timeframe for accomplishing the entire corrective action plan; and the person(s) or department at the SBA Lender or Intermediary charged with carrying out the corrective action or capital restoration plan, as applicable. In addition, SBA Lenders and Intermediaries must implement corrective actions within 90 calendar days from the date the Report or SBA's letter requiring corrective action is received, unless SBA provides written notice of another timeframe. For purposes of this paragraph (b), a Report will be deemed to have been received on the date it was emailed to the last known email address of the SBA Lender or Intermediary unless the SBA Lender or Intermediary can provide compelling evidence to the contrary.


(c) *SBA response.* SBA will provide written notice of whether the response and, if applicable, any corrective action or capital restoration plan, is approved, or whether SBA will seek additional information or require other action.


(d) *Failure to respond or to submit or implement an acceptable plan.* If an SBA Lender or Intermediary fails to respond in writing to SBA, respond timely to SBA, or provide a response acceptable to SBA within SBA's discretion, or respond to all findings and required corrective actions in a Report, then SBA may take enforcement action under this subpart. If an SBA Lender or Intermediary that is requested to submit a corrective action plan or capital restoration plan to SBA fails to do so in writing; fails to submit timely such plan to SBA; or fails to submit a plan acceptable to SBA within SBA's discretion, then SBA may take enforcement action under this subpart. If an SBA Lender or Intermediary fails to implement in any material respect a corrective action or capital restoration plan within the required timeframe, then SBA may undertake enforcement action under this subpart.
