# § 120.1500   Types of formal enforcement actions—SBA Lenders.

Upon a determination that the grounds set forth in § 120.1400 exist, the D/OCRM may undertake, in his/her discretion (and with the involvement of the LOC as appropriate and consistent with its assigned responsibilities), one or more of the following formal enforcement actions for each of the types of SBA Lender listed, and is not restricted from delegating as appropriate. SBA will consider the severity or frequency of the violation or action and the circumstances triggering the ground in determining whether and what type of enforcement action to take. SBA will take formal enforcement action in accordance with procedures set forth in § 120.1600. If formal enforcement action is taken under this section and the SBA Lender fails to implement required corrective action in any material respect within the required timeframe in response to the formal enforcement action, the D/OCRM may take further enforcement action, as authorized by law. SBA's decision to take a formal enforcement action will not, by itself, invalidate a guaranty previously provided by SBA.


(a) *Formal enforcement actions for all SBA Lenders*—(1) *Imposition of portfolio guaranty dollar limit.* SBA may limit the maximum dollar amount that SBA will guarantee on the SBA Lender's SBA loans or debentures.


(2) *Suspension or revocation of delegated authority.* SBA may suspend or revoke an SBA Lender's delegated authority (including, but not limited to, PLP, SBA Express, or PCLP delegated authorities).


(3) *Suspension or revocation from SBA program.* SBA may suspend or revoke an SBA Lender's authority to participate in the SBA loan program, including the authority to make, service, liquidate, or litigate 7(a) or 504 loans. Section 120.1400(d)(1) sets forth the grounds for SBA program suspension or revocation of an SBA Supervised Lender (except Other Regulated SBLCs). The grounds for SBA program suspension or revocation for all other SBA Lenders are set forth in § 120.1400(c) and, as applicable, paragraph (f) of § 120.1400.


(4) *Immediate suspension.* SBA may suspend, effective immediately, an SBA Lender's delegated authority or authority to participate in the SBA loan program, or the authority to make, service, liquidate, or litigate 7(a) or 504 loans. Section 120.1400(d)(2) sets forth the grounds for SBA program immediate suspension of an SBA Supervised Lender (except Other Regulated SBLCs). The grounds for SBA program immediate suspension for all other SBA Lenders and the grounds for immediate suspension of delegated authority for all SBA Lenders are set forth in § 120.1400(c)(11) and § 120.1400(c)(12).


(5) *Debarment.* In accordance with 2 CFR Parts 180 and 2700, SBA may take any necessary action to debar a Person, as defined in § 120.10, including but not limited to an officer, a director, a general partner, a manager, an employee, an agent or other participant in the affairs of an SBA Lender's SBA operations.


(6) *Other actions available under law.* SBA may take all other enforcement actions against SBA Lenders available under law.


(b) *Formal enforcement actions specific to 7(a) Lenders.* In addition to those formal enforcement actions applicable to all SBA Lenders, SBA may take the following actions:


(1) Secondary market suspension or revocation (other than temporary suspension and revocation under § 120.660). SBA may suspend or revoke a 7(a) Lender's authority to sell or purchase loans or certificates in the Secondary Market; or


(2) Civil monetary penalty (other than SBA Supervised Lender civil monetary penalty under § 120.465). SBA may assess a civil monetary penalty against a 7(a) Lender. The civil monetary penalty will be in an amount not to exceed the maximum published in the _Federal Register_ from time to time, which will be 298,887 plus any increases required under law. In determining whether to assess a civil monetary penalty and, if so, in what amount, SBA may consider, for example, the following: The gravity (*e.g.,* severity and frequency) of the violation; the history of previous violations; the financial resources and good faith of the 7(a) Lender; and any other matters as justice may require.


(c) *Formal enforcement actions specific to SBA Supervised Lenders and Other Persons (except Other Regulated SBLCs).* In addition to those enforcement actions listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, SBA may take any one or more of the following enforcement actions specific to SBA Supervised Lenders and as applicable, Other Persons:


(1) *Cease and desist order.* SBA may issue a cease and desist order against the SBA Supervised Lender or Other Person. The Cease and Desist order may either require the SBA Supervised Lender or the Other Person to take a specific action, or to refrain from a specific action. The Cease and Desist Order may be issued as effective immediately (or as a proposal for Order). SBA may include in the cease and desist order the suspension of authority to lend.


(2) *Remove Management Official.* SBA may issue an order to remove a Management Official from office. SBA may suspend a Management Official from office or prohibit a Management Official from participating in management of the SBA Supervised Lender or in reviewing, approving, closing, servicing, liquidating or litigating any 7(a) loan, or any other activities of the SBA Supervised Lender while the removal proceeding is pending in order to protect an SBA Supervised Lender or the interests of SBA or the United States.


(3) *Initiate request for appointment of receiver and/or other relief.* The SBA may make application to any Federal court of competent jurisdiction for the court to take exclusive jurisdiction, without notice, of an SBA Supervised Lender, and SBA shall be entitled to the appointment of a receiver of SBA's choosing to hold, administer, operate, and/or liquidate the SBA Supervised Lender; and to such injunctive or other equitable relief as may be appropriate. Without limiting the foregoing and with SBA's written consent, the receiver may take possession of the portfolio of 7(a) loans and sell such loans to a third party, and/or take possession of servicing activities of 7(a) loans and sell such servicing rights to a third party. In deciding whether to seek the appointment of a receiver and in determining the scope of a receivership, SBA will consider the following factors, in its discretion:


(i) for NFRLs:


(A) the existence of fraud or false statements;


(B) the NFRL's refusal to cooperate with SBA enforcement action instructions or orders;


(C) the NFRL's insolvency (legal or equitable);


(D) the size of the NFRL's SBA loan portfolio(s) in relation to other activities of the NFRL;


(E) the dollar amount of any claims SBA may have against the NFRL;


(F) the NFRL's failure to comply materially with any requirement imposed by Loan Program Requirements; and/or


(G) the existence of other non-SBA enforcement actions against the NFRL;


(ii) for SBLCs:


(A) the existence of fraud or false statements;


(B) the SBLC's refusal to cooperate with SBA enforcement action instructions or orders;


(C) the SBLC's insolvency (legal or equitable);


(D) the dollar amount of any claims SBA may have against the SBLC; and/or


(E) the SBLC's failure to comply materially with any requirement imposed by Loan Program Requirements.


(4) *Civil monetary penalties for report filing failure under § 120.465.* SBA may seek civil penalties, in accordance with § 120.465, against an SBA Supervised Lender that fails to file any regular or special report by its due date as specified by regulation or SBA written directive.


(d) *Formal enforcement actions specific to SBLCs.* In addition to those supervisory actions listed in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, SBA may take the following enforcement actions specific to SBLCs.


(1) *Capital directive.* The AA/CA may issue a capital directive upon a determination that the grounds in § 120.1400(e)(1) exist. A directive may order the SBLC to:


(i) Achieve its minimum capital requirement applicable to it by a specified date;


(ii) Adhere to a previously submitted capital restoration plan (provided under § 120.462 or § 120.1055) to achieve the applicable capital requirement;


(iii) Submit and adhere to a capital restoration plan acceptable to SBA describing the means and time schedule by which the SBLC will achieve the applicable capital requirement (The SBLC must provide its capital restoration plan within 30 days from the date of the SBA order unless SBA notifies the SBLC that the plan is to be filed within a different time period. SBA may perform an on-site examination (generally within 90 days after the restoration plan is submitted) to verify the implementation of the plan and verify that the SBLC meets minimum capital requirements.);


(iv) Refrain from taking certain actions without obtaining SBA's prior written approval (Such actions may include but are not limited to: paying any dividend; retiring any equity; maintaining a rate of growth that causes further deterioration in the capital percentage; securitizing any unguaranteed portion of its 7(a) loans; or selling participations in any of its 7(a) loans); or


(v) Undertake a combination of any of these or similar actions.


(2) *Civil action for termination.* SBA may institute a civil action to terminate the rights, privileges, and franchises of an SBLC.


(e) *Formal enforcement actions specific to CDCs.* In addition to those enforcement actions listed in paragraph (a) of this section, SBA may take any one or more of the following enforcement actions specific to CDCs:


(1) Require the CDC to transfer part or all of its existing 504 loan portfolio and/or part or all of its pending 504 loan applications to SBA, another CDC, or any other entity designated by SBA. Any such transfer may be on a temporary or permanent basis, in SBA's discretion; or


(2) Instruct the Central Servicing Agent to withhold payment of servicing, late and/or other fee(s) to the CDC. 


(3) Apply to any Federal court of competent jurisdiction for the court to take exclusive jurisdiction, without notice, of the CDC, and SBA shall be entitled to the appointment of a receiver of SBA's choosing to hold, administer, operate and/or liquidate the CDC; and to such injunctive or other equitable relief as may be appropriate. SBA will limit the scope of the receivership to the CDC's assets related to the SBA loan program(s) except where the CDC's business is almost exclusively SBA-related. SBA will only seek a receivership if there is either the existence of fraud or false statements, or if the CDC has refused to cooperate with SBA enforcement action instructions or orders. Without limiting the foregoing and with SBA's consent, the receiver may take possession of the portfolio of 504 loans and/or pending 504 loan applications, including for the purpose of carrying out an enforcement order under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
