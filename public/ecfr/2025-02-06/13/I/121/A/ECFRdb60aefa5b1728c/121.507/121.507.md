(2) Not exceed 500 employees, taking into account its affiliates; and

(i) Agree that it will manufacture the logs with its own facilities or those of another business which meets the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section; 


(ii) Agree that if it eventually resells the timber, it will resell no more than 30% of the sawtimber volume to other businesses which do not meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section; and 


(iii) Agree that if it becomes acquired or controlled by a business which does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, it will require as a condition of the acquisition or change of control that the acquiring or controlling business resell at least 70% of the sawtimber volume to businesses which do meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section; or 


(4) If it intends at the time of offer to resell the timber— 


(i) Agree that it will not sell more than 30% of such timber (50% of such timber if the concern is an Alaskan business) to a business which does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section; and 


(ii) Agree that if it becomes acquired or controlled by a business which does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, it will require as a condition of the acquisition or change of control that the acquiring or controlling business resell at least 70% of the sawtimber volume (or at least 50% of the sawtimber volume, if it is an Alaskan business) to businesses which meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section. 


(b) For a period of three years following the date upon which a concern purchases timber under a small business set-aside (other than through the Special Salvage Timber Sale program), it must maintain a record of: 


(1) The name, address and size status of every concern to which it sells the timber or sawlogs; and 


(2) The species, grades and volumes of sawlogs sold. 


(c) For a period of three years following the date upon which a concern purchases timber, it must by contract require all small business repurchasers of the sawlogs or timber it purchased under the small business set-aside to maintain the records described in paragraph (b) of this section. 


(d) The Director of Government Contracting may waive one or more of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section in limited circumstances where conditions make the requirement(s) impractical or prohibitive. A request for waiver must be made to the Director of Government Contracting and contain facts, arguments, and any appropriate supporting documentation as to why a waiver should be granted.
