# ยง 121.304   What are the size requirements for refinancing an existing SBA loan?

(a) A concern that applies to refinance an existing SBA loan or guarantee will be considered small for the refinancing even though its size has increased since the date of the original financing to exceed its applicable size standard, provided that: 


(1) The increase in size is due to natural growth (as distinguished from merger, acquisition or similar management action); and 


(2) SBA determines that refinancing is necessary to protect the Government's financial interest. 


(b) If a concern's size has increased other than by natural growth, the concern and its affiliates must be small at the time the application for refinancing is accepted for processing by SBA.
