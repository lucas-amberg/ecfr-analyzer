# ยง 123.20   How long do I have to request an increase in the amount of a physical disaster loan or an economic injury loan?

(a) You should request a loan increase as soon as possible after you discover the need for the increase, but not later than two years after SBA approved your physical disaster or economic injury loan. After two years, the SBA Associate Administrator for Disaster Assistance (AA/DA) may waive this limitation after finding extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances.


(b) For physical disaster loan increases requested under ยง 123.18(b) as a result of malfeasance, the request must be received not later than two years after the date of final disbursement.
