# ยง 123.104   What interest rate will I pay on my home disaster loan?

If you can obtain credit elsewhere, your interest rate is set by a statutory formula, but will not exceed eight (8) percent per annum. If you cannot obtain credit elsewhere, your interest rate is one-half the statutory rate, but will not exceed four (4) percent per annum. Generally, credit elsewhere means that SBA believes you could obtain financing from non-Federal sources on reasonable terms subsequent to the declaration of a disaster. SBA may include the use of credit score to make this determination. If you cannot obtain credit elsewhere, you also may be able to borrow from SBA to refinance existing recorded liens against your damaged real property.
