# ยง 123.303   How can my business spend my economic injury disaster loan?

(a) You can only use the loan proceeds for working capital necessary to carry your concern until resumption of normal operations and for expenditures necessary to alleviate the specific economic injury, but not to exceed that which the business could have provided had the injury not occurred. COVID EIDL loan proceeds also may be used to make debt payments including monthly payments, payment of deferred interest, and pre-payments on any business debts, except pre-payments are not permitted on any loans owned by a Federal agency (including SBA) or a Small Business Investment Company licensed under the Small Business Investment Act.


(b) Loan proceeds may not be used to: 


(1) Refinance indebtedness which you incurred prior to the disaster event; 


(2) Except for COVID EIDL loan proceeds, make payments on loans owned by a Federal agency (including SBA) or a Small Business Investment Company licensed under the Small Business Investment Act;


(3) Pay, directly or indirectly, any obligations resulting from a federal, state or local tax penalty as a result of negligence or fraud, or any non-tax criminal fine, civil fine, or penalty for non-compliance with a law, regulation, or order of a federal, state, regional, or local agency or similar matter; 


(4) Repair physical damage; or 


(5) Pay dividends or other disbursements to owners, partners, officers or stockholders, except for reasonable remuneration directly related to their performance of services for the business.
