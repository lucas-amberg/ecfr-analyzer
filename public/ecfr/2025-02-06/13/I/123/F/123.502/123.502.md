# § 123.502   Under what circumstances is your business ineligible to be considered for a Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan?

Your business is ineligible for a Military Reservist EIDL if it, together with its affiliates, is subject to any of the following conditions: 


(a) Any of your business' principal owners has been convicted, during the past year, of a felony during and in connection with a riot or civil disorder; 


(b) You have assumed the risk associated with employing the military reservist, as determined by SBA (for example, hiring the “essential employee” after the employee has received call-up orders or been notified that they are imminent);


(c) Any of your business' principal owners is currently incarcerated, serving a sentence of imprisonment imposed upon adjudication of guilty;


(d) Your business is an agricultural enterprise. Agricultural enterprise means a business primarily engaged in the production of food and fiber, ranching and raising of livestock, aquaculture and all other farming and agriculture-related industries. (See 13 CFR 121.107, “How does SBA determine a concern's primary industry?”) Sometimes a business is engaged in both agricultural and non-agricultural business activities. If the primary business activity of the business is not an agricultural enterprise, it may apply for a Military Reservist EIDL, but loan proceeds may not be used, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of the agricultural enterprises;


(e) Your business is engaged in any illegal activity; 


(f) Your business is a government owned entity (except for a business owned or controlled by a Native American tribe);

(j) [Reserved]


(k) Your business is not a small business concern; 


(l) Your business derives more than one-third of its gross annual revenue from legal gambling activities; 


(m) Your business is a loan packager which earns more than one-third of its gross annual revenue from packaging SBA loans; 


(n) Your business' principal activity is teaching, instructing, counseling, or indoctrinating religion or religious beliefs, whether in a religious or secular setting; or
