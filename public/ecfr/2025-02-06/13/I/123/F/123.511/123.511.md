# ยง 123.511   How will SBA disburse Military Reservist EIDL funds?

Funds will be disbursed only after the essential employee has been called to active service, and you have provided a copy of the essential employee's official call-up orders for active service showing the date of the call-up. SBA will disburse your funds in quarterly installments (unless otherwise specified in your loan authorization agreement) based on a continued need as demonstrated by comparative financial information. On or about 30 days before your scheduled fund disbursement, SBA will request ordinary and usual financial statements (including balance sheets and profit and loss statements). Based on this information, SBA will assess your continued need for disbursements under this program. Upon making such assessment, SBA will notify you of the status of future disbursements.
