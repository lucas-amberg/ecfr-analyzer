# ยง 126.404   What are the possible outcomes of a program examination and when will SBA make its determination?

(a) *Timing.* SBA will make its determination within 90 calendar days after SBA receives all requested information, when practicable.


(b) If SBA determines that the concern is eligible, SBA will send a written notice to the HUBZone small business concern and continue to designate the concern as a certified HUBZone small business concern in DSBS (or successor system).


(c) If SBA determines that the concern is not eligible, the firm will be suspended from the HUBZone program. The concern will have 30 calendar days to submit sufficient documentation showing that it was in fact eligible on the date of review. During the suspension period, SBA will remove the firm as a certified HUBZone small business concern from DSBS. In addition, the concern may not compete for or be awarded a HUBZone contract during that suspension period and must provide written notice of the concern's ineligibility to the contracting officer for any pending HUBZone award. If such concern fails to submit documentation sufficient to demonstrate its eligibility, the concern will be decertified. If SBA overturns its determination, SBA will lift the suspension and reinstate the firm as an eligible certified HUBZone small business concern in DSBS.
