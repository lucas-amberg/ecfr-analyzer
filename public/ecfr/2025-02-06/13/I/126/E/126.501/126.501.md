A certified HUBZone small business concern that acquires, is acquired by, or merges with another business entity must provide evidence to SBA, within 30 calendar days of the transaction becoming final, that the concern continues to meet the HUBZone eligibility requirements. A concern that no longer meets the requirements may voluntarily withdraw from the program or it will be removed by SBA pursuant to program decertification procedures.
