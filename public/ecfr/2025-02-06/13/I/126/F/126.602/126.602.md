# § 126.602   Must a certified HUBZone small business concern maintain the HUBZone employee residency percentage during contract performance?

(a) A certified HUBZone small business concern that has been awarded a HUBZone contract must “attempt to maintain” (*see* § 126.103) having 35% of its employees residing in a HUBZone during the performance of any HUBZone contract. If a certified HUBZone small business concern is awarded a HUBZone contract within 12 months prior to the due date for its triennial recertification, then such concern must attempt to maintain compliance with the 35% HUBZone residency requirement at the time of such recertification. However, such a concern must have at least 35% of its employees residing in HUBZones at the time of each recertification thereafter, even if the concern is still performing that HUBZone contract.


(b) For orders under indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts (including orders under multiple award contracts), a certified HUBZone small business concern must “attempt to maintain” the HUBZone residency requirement during the performance of each order that is set aside for HUBZone small business concerns.


(c) A certified HUBZone small business concern that is tribally-owned, and made the certification in § 126.200(c)(2)(ii) at the time of its HUBZone certification (or at the time of its most recent recertification), must have at least 35% of its employees engaged in performing a HUBZone contract residing within any Indian reservation governed by one or more of the concern's Indian Tribal Government owners, or residing within any HUBZone adjoining any such Indian reservation.


(d) A certified HUBZone small business concern that has less than 20% of its total employees residing in a HUBZone during the performance of a HUBZone contract has failed to attempt to maintain the HUBZone residency requirement. Such failure will result in proposed decertification pursuant to § 126.503.
