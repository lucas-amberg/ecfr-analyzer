# ยง 126.603   Does HUBZone certification guarantee receipt of HUBZone contracts?

HUBZone certification does not guarantee that a certified HUBZone small business concern will receive HUBZone contracts. Certified HUBZone small business concerns should market their capabilities to appropriate contracting activities in order to increase the prospect that the contracting activity will adopt an acquisition strategy that includes HUBZone contract opportunities.
