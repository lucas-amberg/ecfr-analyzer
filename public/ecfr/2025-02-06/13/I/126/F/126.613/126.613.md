# § 126.613   How does a price evaluation preference affect the bid of a certified HUBZone small business concern in full and open competition?

(a) *General.* (1) Where a contracting officer will award a contract on the basis of full and open competition, the contracting officer must deem the price offered by a certified HUBZone small business concern to be lower than the price offered by an offeror that is not a small business concern if: the other than small business initially is the lowest responsive and responsible offeror, and the price offered by the certified HUBZone small business concern is not more than 10% higher than the price offered by the other than small business.


(2) The HUBZone price evaluation preference does not apply where the initial lowest responsive and responsible offeror is a small business concern.


(3) The HUBZone price evaluation preference does not apply to the portion of a multiple award contract that is reserved for certified HUBZone small business concerns. However, the HUBZone price evaluation preference does apply to the non-reserved portion of a multiple award contract.


(4) To apply the HUBZone price evaluation preference, the contracting officer must add 10% to the offer of the otherwise successful other than small business offeror. If the certified HUBZone small business concern's offer is lower than that of the other than small business after the preference is applied, the certified HUBZone small business concern must be deemed the lowest-priced offeror. For a best value procurement, the contracting officer must first apply the 10% price preference to the offers of any other than small businesses and then determine which offeror represents the best value to the Government, in accordance with the terms of the solicitation. Where, after considering the price evaluation adjustment, the offer of a certified HUBZone small business concern is determined to be the best value to the Government, award shall be made to the certified HUBZone small business concern.


(b) *Agricultural commodities.* (1) For purchases by the Secretary of Agriculture of agricultural commodities, the price evaluation preferences shall be:


(i) 10%, for the portion of a contract to be awarded that is not greater than 25% of the total volume being procured for each commodity in a single invitation for bids (IFB);


(ii) 5%, for the portion of a contract to be awarded that is greater than 25%, but not greater than 40%, of the total volume being procured for each commodity in a single IFB; and


(iii) Zero, for the portion of a contract to be awarded that is greater than 40% of the total volume being procured for each commodity in a single IFB.


(2) The 10% and 5% price evaluation preferences for agricultural commodities apply to all offers from certified HUBZone small business concerns up to the 25% and 40% volume limits specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. As such, more than one certified HUBZone small business concern may receive a price evaluation preference for any given commodity in a single IFB.


(i) *Example*:

There is an IFB for 100,000 pounds of wheat. Bid 1 (from a large business) is $1/pound for 100,000 pounds of wheat. Bid 2 (from a HUBZone small business concern) is $1.05/pound for 20,000 pounds of wheat. Bid 3 (from a HUBZone small business concern) is $1.04/pound for 20,000 pounds. Bid 3 receives a 10% price evaluation adjustment for 20,000 pounds, since 20,000 is less than 25% of 100,000 pounds. With the 10% price evaluation adjustment, Bid 1 changes from $20,000 for the first 20,000 pounds to $22,000. Bid 3's price of $20,800 ($1.04 × 20,000) is now lower than any other bid for 20,000 pounds. Thus, Bid 3 will be accepted for the full 20,000 pounds. Bid 2 receives a 10% price evaluation adjustment for that amount of its bid when added to the volume in Bid 3 that does not exceed 25% of the total volume being procured. Since 25,000 pounds is 25% of the total volume of wheat under the IFB, and Bid 3 totaled 20,000 pounds, a 10% price evaluation adjustment will be applied to the first 5,000 pounds of Bid 2. With the price evaluation adjustment, the price for Bid 1, as measured against Bid 2, for 5,000 pounds changes from $5,000 to $5,500. Bid 2's price of $5,250 ($1.05 × 5,000) is lower than Bid 1 for 5,000 pounds. Bid 2 will then receive a 5% price evaluation adjustment for the remaining 15,000 pounds, since the total volume of Bids 3 and 2 receiving an adjustment does not exceed 40% of the total volume of wheat under the IFB (*i.e.*, 40,000 pounds). With the 5% price evaluation adjustment, Bid 1's price for the next 15,000 pounds changes from $15,000 to $15,750. Bid 2's price for that 15,000 pounds is also $15, 750 ($1.05 × 15,000). Because the evaluation price for Bid 2 is *not more than* 10% higher than the price offered by Bid 1, Bid 2's price is deemed to be lower than the price offered by Bid 1. Since the evaluation price for both the first 5,000 pounds (receiving a 10% price evaluation adjustment) and the remaining 15,000 pounds (receiving a 5% price evaluation adjustment) is less than Bid 1, Bid 2 will be accepted for the full 20,000 pounds.


(ii) [Reserved]


(c) *International food aid operations.* For purchases by the Secretary of Agriculture of agricultural commodities for export operations through international food aid programs administered by the Farm Service Agency, the price evaluation preference shall be 5% on the first portion of a contract to be awarded that is not greater than 20% of the total volume being procured for each commodity in a single IFB.


(d) *Not treated as partial set-aside.* A contract awarded to a certified HUBZone small business concern under a preference described in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be counted toward the fulfillment of any requirement partially set aside for competition restricted to small business concerns.


(e) *Applicability to HUBZone joint ventures.* The HUBZone price evaluation preference applies only to a joint venture consisting of a certified HUBZone small business concern and a small business concern that complies with the requirements of § 125.9. The HUBZone price evaluation preference does not apply to a joint venture consisting of a certified HUBZone small business concern and its other than small mentor.
