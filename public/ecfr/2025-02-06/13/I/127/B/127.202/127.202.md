# ยง 127.202   What are the requirements for control of an EDWOSB or WOSB?

(a) *General.* To qualify as a WOSB, the management and daily business operations of the concern must be controlled by one or more women. To qualify as an EDWOSB, the management and daily business operations of the concern must be controlled by one or more women who are economically disadvantaged. Control by one or more women or economically disadvantaged women means that both the long-term decision making and the day-to-day management and administration of the business operations must be conducted by one or more women or economically disadvantaged women.


(b) *Managerial position and experience.* A woman, or in the case of an EDWOSB an economically disadvantaged woman, must hold the highest officer position in the concern and must have managerial experience of the extent and complexity needed to run the concern. The woman or economically disadvantaged woman manager need not have the technical expertise or possess the required license to be found to control the concern if she can demonstrate that she has ultimate managerial and supervisory control over those who possess the required licenses or technical expertise. However, if a man possesses the required license and has an equity interest in the concern, he may be found to control the concern.




(c) *Limitation on outside employment.* (1) A woman or economically disadvantaged woman generally must devote full time to the business concern during its normal hours of operations. The woman or economically disadvantaged woman who holds the highest officer position of the business concern may not engage in outside employment that prevents her from devoting the time and attention to the business concern necessary to control its management and daily operations.


(2) Where a woman or economically disadvantaged woman claiming to control a business concern devotes fewer hours to the business than its normal hours of operation, SBA will assume that she does not control the business concern, unless the concern demonstrates that she has ultimate managerial and supervisory control over both the long-term decision making and day-to-day management of the business.


(3) Any qualifying woman or economically disadvantage woman who seeks to engage in outside employment after certification must notify SBA of the nature and anticipated duration of the outside employment and demonstrate to SBA that the outside employment will not prevent her from controlling the business concern.


(d) *Ownership of a partnership.* In the case of a concern which is a partnership, one or more qualifying women, or in the case of an EDWOSB, economically disadvantaged women, must serve as general partners, with control over all partnership decisions. At least 51 percent of every class of partnership interest must be unconditionally owned by one or more qualifying women or economically disadvantaged women. The ownership must be reflected in the concern's partnership agreement.


(e) *Control over a limited liability company.* In the case of a limited liability company, one or more women, or in the case of an EDWOSB, economically disadvantaged women, must serve as management members, with control over all decisions of the limited liability company.


(f) *Control over a corporation.* One or more women, or in the case of an EDWOSB, economically disadvantaged women, must control the Board of Directors of the concern. Women or economically disadvantaged women are considered to control the Board of Directors when either:


(1) One or more women or economically disadvantaged women own at least 51 percent of all voting stock of the concern, are on the Board of Directors and have the percentage of voting stock necessary to overcome any super majority voting requirements; or


(2) Women or economically disadvantaged women comprise the majority of voting directors through actual numbers or, where permitted by state law, through weighted voting.


(g) *Involvement in the concern by other individuals or entities.* Men or other entities may be involved in the management of the concern and may be stockholders, partners or limited liability members of the concern. However, no males or other entities may:


(1) Exercise actual control or have the power to control the concern;


(2) Have business relationships that cause such dependence that the qualifying woman cannot exercise independent business judgment without great economic risk;


(3) Control the concern through loan arrangements (which does not include providing a loan guaranty on commercially reasonable terms);


(4) Provide critical financial or bonding support or a critical license to the concern, which directly or indirectly allows the male or other entity to significantly influence business decisions of the qualifying woman.


(5) Be a former employer, or a principal of a former employer, of any qualifying woman, unless the concern demonstrates that the relationship between the former employer or principal and the qualifying woman does not give the former employer actual control or the potential to control the concern and such relationship is in the best interests of the concern; or


(6) Receive compensation from the concern in any form as a director, officer, or employee, that exceeds the compensation to be received by the qualifying woman who holds the highest officer position (usually Chief Executive Officer or President), unless the concern demonstrates that the compensation to be received by non-qualifying woman is commercially reasonable or that the qualifying woman has elected to take lower compensation to benefit the concern. A certified WOSB or EDWOSB must notify SBA within 30 calendar days if the compensation paid to the highest-ranking officer falls below that paid to a man. In such a case, SBA must determine that that the compensation to be received by the man is commercially reasonable or that the highest-ranking officer has elected to take lower compensation to benefit the WOSB or EDWOSB before SBA may determine that the concern is eligible for a WOSB/EDWOSB award.


(h) *Exception for extraordinary circumstances.* SBA will not find that a lack of control exists where a woman or an economically disadvantaged woman does not have the unilateral power and authority to make decisions regarding the following extraordinary circumstances:


(1) Adding a new equity stakeholder or increasing the investment amount of an equity stakeholder;


(2) Dissolution of the company;


(3) Sale of the company or all assets of the company;


(4) The merger of the company;


(5) The company declaring bankruptcy;


(6) Amendment of the company's corporate governance documents to remove the shareholder's authority to block any of the actions in paragraphs (h)(1) through (5) of this section; and


(7) Any other extraordinary action that is crafted solely to protect the investment of the minority shareholders, and not to impede the majority's ability to control the concern's operations or to conduct the concern's business as it chooses.
