# ยง 127.354   What requirements must a third-party certifier follow to demonstrate capability to certify concerns?

(a) All third-party certifiers must enter into written agreements with SBA. This agreement will detail the requirements that the third-party certifier must meet. SBA may terminate the agreement if SBA subsequently determines that the entity's certification process does not comply with SBA-approved certification standards or is not based on the same program eligibility requirements as set forth in subpart B of this part or if, upon review, SBA determines that the third-party certifier has demonstrated a pattern of certifying concerns that SBA later determines to be ineligible for certification.


(b) Third-party certifiers' certification process must comply with SBA-approved certification standards and track the WOSB or EDWOSB eligibility requirements set forth in subpart B of this part.


(c) In order for SBA to enter into an agreement with a third-party certifier, the entity must establish the following:


(1) It will render fair and impartial WOSB/EDWOSB Federal Contract Program eligibility determinations;


(2) It will provide the approved applicant a valid certificate for entering into the SBA electronic platform, and will retain documents used to determine eligibility for a period of six (6) years to support SBA's responsibility to conduct a status protest, eligibility examination, agency investigation, or audit of the third party determinations;


(3) Its certification process will require applicant concerns to register in SAM (or any successor system) and submit sufficient information as determined by SBA to enable it to determine whether the concern qualifies as a WOSB. This information must include documentation demonstrating whether the concern is:


(i) A small business concern under the SBA size standard corresponding to the concern's primary industry, as defined in ยง 121.107 of this part;


(ii) At least 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more women who are United States citizens; and


(4) It will not decline to accept a concern's application for WOSB/EDWOSB certification on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, marital or family status, or political affiliation.
