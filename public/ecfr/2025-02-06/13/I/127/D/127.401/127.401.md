# ยง 127.401   What are a WOSB's and EDWOSB's ongoing obligations to SBA?

Once certified, a WOSB or EDWOSB must notify SBA of any material changes that could affect its eligibility within 30 calendar days of any such change. Material change includes, but is not limited to, a change in the ownership, business structure, or management. The notification must be in writing and must be uploaded into the concern's profile with SBA. The method for notifying SBA can be found on *https://certify.sba.gov.* A concern's failure to notify SBA of such a material change may result in decertification and removal from SAM and DSBS (or any successor system) as a designated certified WOSB/EDWOSB concern. In addition, SBA may seek the imposition of penalties under ยง 127.700.
