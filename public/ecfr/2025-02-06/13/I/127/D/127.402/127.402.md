# ยง 127.402   What is a program examination, who will conduct it, and what will SBA examine?

(a) A program examination is an investigation by SBA officials or authorized third-party certifier that verifies the accuracy of any certification of a concern issued in connection with the concern's WOSB or EDWOSB status. Thus, examiners may verify that the concern currently meets the program's eligibility requirements, and that it met such requirements at the time of its application for certification, its most recent recertification, or its certification in connection with a WOSB or EDWOSB contract.


(b) Examiners may review any information related to the concern's eligibility requirements. SBA may also conduct site visits.


(c) It is the responsibility of program participants to ensure the information provided to SBA is kept up to date and is accurate. SBA considers all required information and documents material to a concern's eligibility and assumes that all information and documentation submitted are up to date and accurate unless SBA has information that indicates otherwise.
