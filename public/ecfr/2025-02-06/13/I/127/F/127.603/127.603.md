# ยง 127.603   What are the requirements for filing an EDWOSB or WOSB status protest?

(a) *Format.* Protests must be in writing and must specify all the grounds upon which the protest is based. A protest merely asserting that the protested concern is not an eligible EDWOSB or WOSB, without setting forth specific facts or allegations, is insufficient.


(b) *Filing.* Protestors may deliver their written protests in person, by facsimile, by express delivery service, e-mail, or by U.S. mail (received by the applicable date) to the following:


(1) To the contracting officer, if the protestor is an offeror for the specific contract; or


(2) To the D/GC, if the protest is initiated by the contracting officer or SBA. IF SBA initiates a protest, the D/GC will notify the contracting officer of such protest.


(c) *Timeliness.* (1) For negotiated acquisitions, a protest from an interested party must be received by the contracting officer prior to the close of business on the fifth business day after notification by the contracting officer of the apparent successful offeror or notification of award. Except for an order or Blanket Purchase Agreement issued under any Federal Supply Schedule contact, for an order or a Blanket Purchase Agreement that is set-aside for EDWOSB or WOSB small business under a Multiple Award Contract that is not itself set aside for EDWOSB or WOSB small business or have a reserve for EDWOSB or WOSB small business (or any EDWOSB or WOSB order where the contracting officer has requested recertification of such status), an interested party must submit its protest challenging the EDWOSB or WOSB status of a concern for the order or Blanket Purchase Agreement by close of business on the fifth business day after notification by the contracting officer of the apparent successful offeror.


(2) For sealed bid acquisitions, a protest from an interested party must be received by close of business on the fifth business day after bid opening. Where the identified low bidder is determined to be ineligible for award, a protest of any other identified low bidder must be received prior to the close of business on the 5th business day after the contracting officer has notified interested parties of the identity of that low bidder.


(3) Any protest received after the time limit is untimely, unless it is from SBA or the contracting officer. A contracting officer or SBA may file an EDWOSB or WOSB protest at any time after bid opening or notification of intended awardee, whichever applies.


(4) Any protest received prior to bid opening or notification of intended awardee, whichever applies, is premature.


(5) A timely filed protest applies to the procurement in question even if filed after award.




(d) *Referral to SBA.* The contracting officer must forward to SBA any WOSB or EDWOSB status protest received, notwithstanding whether he or she believes it is premature, sufficiently specific, or timely. The contracting officer must send all WOSB and EDWOSB status protests, along with a referral letter and documents, directly to the Director for Government Contracting, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 Third Street SW, Washington, DC 20416, or by fax to (202) 205-6390, Attn: Women-Owned Small Business Status Protest.


(1) The contracting officer's referral letter must include information pertaining to the solicitation that may be necessary for SBA to determine timeliness and standing, including: the solicitation number; the name, address, telephone number and facsimile number of the contracting officer; whether the protestor submitted an offer; whether the protested concern was the apparent successful offeror; when the protested concern submitted its offer; whether the procurement was conducted using sealed bid or negotiated procedures; the bid opening date, if applicable; when the protest was submitted to the contracting officer; when the protestor received notification about the apparent successful offeror, if applicable; and whether a contract has been awarded.


(2) Where a protestor alleges that a WOSB/EDWOSB is unduly reliant on one or more subcontractors that are not WOSBs/EDWOSBs or a subcontractor that is not a WOSB/EDWOSB will perform primary and vital requirements of the contract, the D/GC or designee will refer the matter to the Government Contracting Area Office serving the geographic area in which the principal office of the SDVO SBC is located for a determination as to whether the ostensible subcontractor rule has been met.


(3) The D/GC or designee will decide the merits of EDWOSB or WOSB status protests.
