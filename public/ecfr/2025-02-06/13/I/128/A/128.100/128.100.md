Section 8127 of Title 38 within the U.S. Code (38 U.S.C. 8127) authorizes certain procurement mechanisms to provide Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns (SDVOSB) with contracting assistance opportunities at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Section 36 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657f) authorizes certain procurement mechanisms to provide SDVOSBs with contracting assistance opportunities across the Federal Government. In addition, sections 36 and 36A of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657f, 657f-1) authorize the Small Business Administration (SBA) to certify the status of VOSB and SDVOSBs. This part implements these mechanisms and ensures that the program created, referred to as the Veteran Small Business Certification Program (VetCert), is substantially related to this important congressional goal in accordance with applicable law.
