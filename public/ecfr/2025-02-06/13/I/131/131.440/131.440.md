Program income must be used to expand the quantity or quality of services and for resources or outreach provided by the WBC project.


(b) Unused program income may be carried over to the subsequent budget period by a WBC. The WBC must report the consolidated program income sources and uses.


(c) A WBC may charge clients a reasonable fee for services, including training and counseling provided by the WBC (sponsored or cosponsored), the sale of books, or the rental of equipment or space.
