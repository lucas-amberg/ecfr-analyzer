# § 131.650   Closeout procedures.

(a) *General.* Closeout procedures are used to ensure that the WBC program funds and property acquired or developed under the WBC cooperative agreement are fully reconciled and transferred seamlessly between the recipient organization and other Federal programs. The responsibility of conducting closeout procedures is vested with the recipient organization whose cooperative agreement is being relinquished, terminated, non-renewed, or suspended.


(b) *Responsibilities*—(1) *Recipient organizations.* When a WBC cooperative agreement is not being renewed or a WBC is terminated, regardless of cause, the recipient organization will address the following in its closeout process and perform the necessary inventories and reconciliations prior to submitting the final annual financial report.


(i) An inventory of WBC property must be compiled, evaluated, and all property and the aggregate of usable supplies and materials accounted for in this inventory.


(ii) Program income balances will be reconciled and unused WBC program income which is not used as match or cannot otherwise be used to offset legitimate expenditures of the WBC must be returned to the SBA.


(iii) Client records, paper and electronic, will be compiled to facilitate an SBA program closeout review.


(iv) Financial records will be compiled to facilitate a closeout of the SBA financial examination.


(2) *SBA.* Upon receipt of the final annual financial report from a non-renewing or terminated recipient organization, the AA/OWBO will issue disposition instructions to the former recipient organization.


(c) *Final disposition.* (1) The final financial status report from the recipient organization must include the information identified in the inventory process and identify any WBC program income collected for services provided.


(2) The AA/OWBO will issue written disposition instructions to the recipient organization providing the following:


(i) The name and address of the entity or agency to which property and program income must be transferred;


(ii) The date by which the transfer must be completed;


(iii) Actions to be taken regarding property and WBC program income;


(iv) Actions to be taken regarding WBC program records such as client and training files; and


(v) Authorization to incur costs for accomplishing the transfer. Such costs may, when authorized, be applied to residual WBC program income or Federal or matching funds.
