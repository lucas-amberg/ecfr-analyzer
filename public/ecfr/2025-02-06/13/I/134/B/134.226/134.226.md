(a) *Contents.* (1) Following close of record, the Judge will issue a decision containing findings of fact and conclusions of law, the reasons for such findings and conclusions, and any relief ordered. The record will constitute the exclusive basis for a decision.


(2) An OHA decision creates precedent, unless:


(i) Another regulation in this chapter applicable to a specific type of appeal provides that the OHA decision does not create precedent; or


(ii) the decision is designated as one not to be cited as precedent.


(3) A summary decision containing only cursory findings of fact and conclusions of law may be issued only if the Judge finds a full decision will not advance understanding of Federal statutes or applicable regulations, policies, or procedures and the underlying facts and law are of a routine and non-complex nature.

(1) Each party, or, if represented by counsel, on its counsel; and
