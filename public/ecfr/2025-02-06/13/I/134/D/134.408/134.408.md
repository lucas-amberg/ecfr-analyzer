# ยง 134.408   Summary decision.

(a) *Generally.* In any appeal under this subpart D, either party may move or cross-move for summary decision, as provided in ยง 134.212. 


(b) *Summary decision based on fewer than all grounds.* If SBA has provided multiple grounds for the 8(a) determination being appealed, SBA may move for summary decision on one or more grounds. 


(1) *Non-suspension cases.* Except in suspension appeals, if the Judge finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether SBA acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or contrary to law as to any such ground or grounds, and that the SBA is entitled to a decision in its favor as a matter of law, the Judge will grant the motion for summary decision and dismiss the appeal. 


(2) *Suspension cases.* In suspension appeals, if the Judge finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether adequate evidence exists that protection of the Federal Government's interest requires suspension, as to any such ground or grounds for the proposed suspension, the SBA is entitled to a decision in its favor as a matter of law, and the Judge will grant the motion for summary decision and dismiss the appeal.
