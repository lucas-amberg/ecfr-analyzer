# ยง 134.610   Are there limitations on reimbursement for fees and expenses?

(a) Awards will be calculated on the basis of fees and expenses actually incurred. If services were provided by one or more of your employees, or were made available to you free, you may not seek an award for those services. If services were provided at a reduced rate, fees and expenses will be calculated at that reduced rate.


(b) In determining the reasonableness of the fees for attorneys, agents or expert witnesses, the ALJ will consider at least the following:


(1) That provider's customary fee for like services;


(2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which that provider ordinarily performs services;


(3) The time actually spent in representing you; and


(4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty and complexity of the issues.


(c) An award for the fees of an attorney or agent may not exceed $75 per hour, and an award for the fees of an expert witness may not exceed $25 per hour, regardless of the rate charged. 


(d) An award for the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project or similar matter prepared on your behalf may not exceed the prevailing rate payable for similar services, and you may be reimbursed only if the study or other matter was necessary to the preparation of your case.
