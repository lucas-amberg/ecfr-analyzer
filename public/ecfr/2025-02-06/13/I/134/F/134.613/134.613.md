(a) The hours worked in connection with the proceeding by each provider supplying a billable service;


(b) A description of the specific services performed by each provider;


(c) The rate at which fees were computed for each provider;


(d) The total charged by the provider on that statement or invoice; and


(e) The provider's verification that the statement or invoice is true to the best of his or her knowledge and that he or she understands that a false statement is punishable by fine and imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. 1001.
