# ยง 134.1005   Contents of the VOSB or SDVOSB status protest.

(a) VOSB and SDVOSB status protests must be in writing. There is no required format for a VOSB or SDVOSB status protest, but it must include the following:


(1) The solicitation or contract number, if applicable;


(2) Specific allegations supported by credible evidence that the concern (or joint venture) does not meet the VOSB or SDVOSB eligibility requirements listed in part 128 of this chapter. A protest merely asserting that the protested concern is not an eligible VOSB or SDVOSB, without setting forth specific facts or allegations, is insufficient;


(3) Any other pertinent information the Judge should consider; and


(4) The name, address, telephone number, and email address, if available, and signature of the protester or its attorney.


(b) If the protester intends to seek access to the SBA case file under ยง 134.205, the protester should include in its protest a request for a protective order. Unless good cause is shown, a protester must request a protective order within five days of filing the protest.
