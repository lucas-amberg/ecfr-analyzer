# ยง 134.1208   Response to an appeal petition.

(a) *Who may respond.* SBA may respond to an appeal as determined in its discretion, but SBA is not required to respond. If SBA elects not to respond, such election shall not be interpreted as an admission or waiver of any allegation of law or fact. In addition, after review of the appeal petition, OHA may request SBA to respond for good cause shown by OHA. Only SBA may respond. If filed, the response should set forth the relevant facts and legal arguments to the issues presented on appeal.


(b) *Time limit.* If an SBA response is filed, it must be filed within 45 calendar days after issuance of the Notice and Order.


(c) *Close of record.* The record will close 45 calendar days from the issuance of the Notice and Order, unless the Judge decides otherwise. Generally, filings after the close of record will not be considered.


(d) *Service.* If a response is filed, the SBA must file its response with OHA, and serve a copy of the response upon the appellant or its attorney, as applicable by utilizing the OHA Case Portal.


(e) *Reply to response.* Generally, a reply to a response is not permitted unless the Judge directs otherwise. *See* ยง 134.206(e). However, upon motion (*see* ยง 134.211), and under terms needed to avoid prejudice to any non-moving party, the Judge may permit the filing and service of a supplemental pleading after review of SBA's response and/or the administrative record. The proposed supplemental pleading must be filed and served with the motion utilizing the OHA Case Portal.
