# ยง 134.1309   When will a Judge dismiss an appeal?

The presiding Judge must dismiss the appeal if:


(a) The appeal is untimely filed under ยง 134.1303;


(b) The appeal does not, on its face, allege facts that if proven to be true, warrant reversal or modification of the determination; or


(c) The matter has been decided or is the subject of adjudication before a court of competent jurisdiction over such matters; however, once an appeal has been filed, initiation of litigation of the matter in a court of competent jurisdiction will not preclude the Judge from rendering a final decision on the matter.
