# ยง 142.34   Are there any limitations on the right to appeal to the Administrator?

(a) A defendant has no right to appear personally, or through a representative, before the Administrator. 


(b) There is no right to appeal any interlocutory ruling. 


(c) The Administrator will not consider any objection or evidence that was not raised before the ALJ unless the defendant demonstrates that the failure to object was caused by extraordinary circumstances. If the appealing defendant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that extraordinary circumstances prevented the presentation of evidence at the hearing, and that the additional evidence is material, the Administrator may remand the matter to the ALJ for consideration of the additional evidence.
