# § 304.3   District modification and termination.

(a) *Modification.* Upon the request of a District Organization and with the concurrence of the State or States affected (unless such concurrence is waived by the Assistant Secretary), EDA may modify the geographic boundaries of a District, if it determines that such modification will contribute to a more effective program for economic development.


(b) *Termination.* EDA may, upon 60 days prior written notice to the District Organization, member counties, and other areas determined by EDA and each affected State, terminate a Region's designation as an Economic Development District when:


(1) A District or District Organization no longer meets the requirements of §§ 304.1 or 304.2; or


(2) EDA determines that the District Organization fails to execute its CEDS according to the development, implementation and other performance measures set forth therein; or


(3) A District Organization has requested termination.


(c) Prior to terminating a District Organization under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, EDA will consult with the District Organization and consider all facts and circumstances regarding the District Organization's operations. EDA will not terminate a District's designation based on circumstances beyond the control of the District Organization (e.g., natural disaster, plant closure, overall economic downturn, sudden and severe economic dislocation, or other situation).


(d) EDA may further modify or terminate a Region's designation as a District according to the standards set forth in an FFO.
