# ยง 305.10   Bid underrun and overrun.

(a) *Underrun.* If at the construction contract bid opening, the lowest responsive bid is less than the total Project cost, the Recipient shall notify EDA immediately to determine relevant procedures.


(b) *Overrun.* (1) In the case of an overrun at the construction contract bid opening, the Recipient may:


(i) If provided for in the bid documents, take deductive alternatives to eliminate certain Project elements in case of insufficient funds in the exact order shown on the invitation for bid until at least one of the responsive bids, less deductive alternative(s), results in a price within the budget for that item of work;


(ii) Reject all bids and re-advertise if there is a rational basis to expect that re-advertising will result in a lower bid; or


(iii) Augment the Matching Share by an amount sufficient to cover the excess cost. The Recipient must furnish a letter to EDA identifying the source of the additional funds and confirming that the Matching Share meets the requirements of ยง 301.5 of this chapter.


(2) If the Recipient demonstrates to EDA's satisfaction that the options listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section are not feasible and the Project cannot be completed otherwise, the Recipient may submit a written request to EDA for additional funding in accordance with applicable EDA guidance. The award of additional Investment Assistance is at EDA's sole discretion and will be considered in accord with EDA's competitive process requirements. EDA's consideration of a request for additional Investment Assistance does not indicate approval.
