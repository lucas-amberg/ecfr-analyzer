# ยง 305.5   Project administration by District Organization.

(a) When a District Organization is not the Recipient or co-Recipient of Investment Assistance, the District Organization may administer the Project for the Recipient if EDA determines fulfillment of the following conditions:


(1) The Recipient has requested (either in the application or by separate written request) that the District Organization for the Region in which the Project is located administer the Project;


(2) The Recipient certifies and EDA finds that:


(i) Administration of the Project is beyond the capacity of the Recipient's current staff and would require hiring additional staff or contracting for such services;


(ii) No local organization or business exists that could administer the Project in a more efficient or cost-effective manner than the staff of the District Organization; and


(iii) The staff of the District Organization would administer the Project without sub-contracting the work; and


(3) The allowable costs for the administration of the Project by the District Organization's staff will not exceed the amount that would be allowable to the Recipient.


(b) EDA must approve the request either by approving the application in which the request is made or by separate specific written approval.
