# § 305.7   Services performed by the Recipient's own forces.

In certain circumstances, the Recipient may wish to consider having a portion or all of the design, construction, inspection, legal services or other work and/or services in connection with the Project performed by personnel who are employed by the Recipient either full-time or part-time. EDA may approve the use of such “in-house forces” if:


(a) The services are routinely performed by the Recipient for all construction Projects performed by the Recipient (for example, inspection or legal); or


(b) The Recipient has a special skill required for the construction of the Project (for example, construction of unique Indian structures); or


(c) The Recipient has made all reasonable efforts to obtain a contractor but has failed to do so because of uncontrollable factors such as the remoteness of the Project site or an overabundance of construction work in the Region; or


(d) The Recipient demonstrates substantial cost savings.
