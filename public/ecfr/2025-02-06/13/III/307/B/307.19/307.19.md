# § 307.19   RLF loan portfolio Sales and Securitizations.

EDA may take such actions as appropriate to enable an RLF Recipient to sell or securitize RLF loans, except that EDA may not issue a Federal guaranty covering any issued Security. With prior approval from EDA, an RLF Recipient may enter into a Sale or a Securitization of all or a portion of its RLF loan portfolio, provided:


(a) An RLF Recipient must use all proceeds from any Sale or Securitization (net of reasonable transaction costs) to make additional RLF loans;


(b) No Security collateralized by RLF loans and other RLF property and offered in a secondary market transaction pursuant to a Securitization shall be treated as an Exempt Security for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (15 U.S.C. 77a *et seq.*), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (15 U.S.C. 78a *et seq.*) (the “*Exchange Act*”), unless exempted by a rule or regulation issued by the Commission; and


(c) Except as provided in paragraph (b), no provision of this section supersedes or otherwise affects the application of the “securities laws” (as such term is defined in section 3(a)(47) of the Exchange Act) or the rules, regulations or orders issued by the Commission or a self-regulatory organization under the Commission.
