# § 315.2   Definitions.

In addition to the defined terms set forth in § 300.3 of this chapter, the following terms used in this part shall have the meanings set forth below:


*Adjustment Assistance* means technical assistance provided to Firms by TAACs under chapter 3 of title II of the Trade Act. The type of assistance provided is determined by EDA and may include one or more of the following:


(1) Assistance in preparing a Firm's petition for certification of eligibility;


(2) Assistance to a Certified Firm in developing an Adjustment Proposal for the Firm; and


(3) Assistance to a Certified Firm in implementing an Adjustment Proposal.


*Adjustment Proposal* means a Certified Firm's plan for improving the Firm's competitiveness in the marketplace.


*Certified Firm* means a Firm which has been determined by EDA to be eligible to apply for Adjustment Assistance.


*Confidential Business Information* means any information submitted to EDA or a TAAC by a Firm that concerns or relates to trade secrets for commercial or financial purposes, which is exempt from public disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(4) and 15 CFR part 4.


*Contributed Importantly,* with respect to an Increase in Imports, refers to a cause which is important but not necessarily more important than any other cause. Imports will not be considered to have Contributed Importantly if other factors were so dominant, acting singly or in combination, that the worker separation or threat thereof or decline in sales or production would have been essentially the same, irrespective of the influence of imports.


*Decreased Absolutely* means a Firm's sales or production has declined by a minimum of five percent relative to its sales or production during the applicable prior time period, and this decline is:


(1) Independent of industry or market fluctuations; and


(2) Relative only to the previous performance of the Firm, unless EDA determines that these limitations in a given case would not be consistent with the purposes of the Trade Act.


*Directly Competitive or Like* means imported articles or services that compete with and are substantially equivalent for commercial purposes (*i.e.,* are adapted for the same function or use and are essentially interchangeable) as the Firm's articles or services. For the purposes of this term, any Firm that engages in exploring or drilling for oil or natural gas, or otherwise produces oil or natural gas, shall be considered to be producing articles directly competitive with imports of oil and with imports of natural gas.


*Firm* means an individual proprietorship, partnership, joint venture, association, corporation (includes a development corporation), business trust, cooperative, trustee in bankruptcy or receiver under court decree, and includes fishing, agricultural or service sector entities and those which explore, drill or otherwise produce oil or natural gas. *See also* the definition of Service Sector Firm. Pursuant to section 259 of chapter 3 of title II of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2351), a Firm, together with any predecessor or successor firm, or any affiliated firm controlled or substantially beneficially owned by substantially the same person, may be considered a single Firm where necessary to prevent Unjustifiable Benefits. For purposes of receiving benefits under this part, when a Firm owns or controls other Firms, the Firm and such other Firms may be considered a single Firm when they produce or supply like or Directly Competitive articles or services or are exerting essential economic control over one or more production facilities. Accordingly, such other Firms may include a(n):


(1) *Predecessor*—see the following definition for Successor;


(2) *Successor*—a newly established Firm (that has been in business less than two years) which has purchased substantially all of the assets of a previously operating company (or in some cases a whole distinct division) (such prior company, unit or division, a ‘Predecessor’) and is able to demonstrate that it continued the operations of the Predecessor which has operated as an autonomous unit, provided that there were no significant transactions between the Predecessor unit and any related parent, subsidiary, or affiliate that would have affected its past performance, and that separate records are available for the Predecessor's operations for at least two years before the petition is submitted. The Successor Firm must have continued virtually all of the Predecessor Firm's operations by producing the same type of products or services, in the same plant, utilizing most of the same machinery and equipment and most of its former workers, and the Predecessor Firm must no longer be in existence;


(3) *Affiliate*—a company (either foreign or domestic) controlled or substantially beneficially owned by substantially the same person or persons that own or control the Firm filing the petition; or


(4) *Subsidiary*—a company (either foreign or domestic) that is wholly owned or effectively controlled by another company. A Firm that has been acquired by another Firm but which maintains operations independent of the acquiring Firm is considered an *Independent Subsidiary* and may be considered separately from the acquiring Firm as eligible for TAAF assistance.


*Increase in Imports* means an increase in imports of Directly Competitive or Like Articles or Services with articles produced or services supplied by a Firm.


*Like Articles or Services* means any articles or services, as applicable, which are substantially identical in their intrinsic characteristics.


*Partial Separation* occurs when there has been no increase in overall employment at the Firm and either of the following applies:


(1) A reduction in an employee's work hours to 80 percent or less of the employee's average weekly hours during the year of such reductions as compared to the preceding year; or


(2) A reduction in the employee's weekly wage to 80 percent or less of his/her average weekly wage during the year of such reduction as compared to the preceding year.


*Person* means an individual, organization or group.


*Record* means any of the following:


(1) A petition for certification of eligibility to qualify for Adjustment Assistance;


(2) Any supporting information submitted by a petitioner;


(3) The report of an EDA investigation with respect to petition; and


(4) Any information developed during an investigation or in connection with any public hearing held on a petition.


*Service Sector Firm* means a Firm engaged in the business of supplying services.


*Significant Number or Proportion of Workers* means five percent of a Firm's work force or 50 workers, whichever is less, unless EDA determines that these limitations in a given case would not be consistent with the purposes of the Trade Act. An individual farmer or fisherman is considered a Significant Number or Proportion of Workers.


*Substantial Interest* means a direct material economic interest in the certification or non-certification of the petitioner.


*TAAC* means a Trade Adjustment Assistance Center, as more fully described in § 315.5.


*Threat of Total or Partial Separation* means, with respect to any group of workers, one or more events or circumstances clearly demonstrating that a Total or Partial Separation is imminent.


*Total Separation* means the laying off or termination of employment of an employee in a Firm for lack of work.


*Unjustifiable Benefits* means Adjustment Assistance inappropriately accruing to the benefit of:


(1) Other Firms that would not otherwise be eligible when provided to a Firm; or


(2) Any predecessor or successor Firm, or any affiliated Firm controlled or substantially beneficially owned by substantially the same person, rather than treating these entities as a single Firm.
