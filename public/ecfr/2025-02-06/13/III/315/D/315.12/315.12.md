# ยง 315.12   Adjustment Proposal requirements.

EDA evaluates Adjustment Proposals based on the following:


(a) The Adjustment Proposal must include a description of any Adjustment Assistance requested to implement such proposal, including financial and other supporting documentation as EDA determines is necessary, based upon either:


(1) An analysis of the Firm's problems, strengths, and weaknesses and an assessment of its prospects for recovery; or


(2) If EDA so determines, other available information;


(b) The Adjustment Proposal must:


(1) Be reasonably calculated to contribute materially to the economic adjustment of the Firm (*i.e.,* that such proposal will constructively assist the Firm to establish a competitive position in the same or a different industry);


(2) Give adequate consideration to the interests of a sufficient number of separated workers of the Firm, by providing, for example, that the Firm will:


(i) Give a rehiring preference to such workers;


(ii) Make efforts to find new work for a number of such workers; and


(iii) Assist such workers in obtaining benefits under available programs; and


(3) Demonstrate that the Firm will make all reasonable efforts to use its own resources for its recovery, though under certain circumstances, resources of related Firms or major stockholders will also be considered; and


(c) The Adjustment Assistance identified in the Adjustment Proposal must consist of specialized consulting services designed to assist the Firm in becoming more competitive in the global marketplace. For purposes of this paragraph (c), Adjustment Assistance generally consists of knowledge-based services such as market penetration studies, customized business improvements, and designs for new products. Adjustment Assistance does not include expenditures for capital improvements or for the purchase of business machinery or supplies.
