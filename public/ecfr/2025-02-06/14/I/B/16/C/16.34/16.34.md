# ยง 16.34   Consent orders.

(a) The parties may agree at any time before the issuance of a final agency decision to dispose of the case by proposing a consent order. Good faith efforts to resolve a complaint through issuance of a consent order may continue throughout the administrative process. However, except as provided in ยง 16.11(a), such efforts may not serve as the basis for extensions of the times set forth in this part.


(b) A proposal for a consent order, specified in paragraph (a) of this section, shall include:


(1) A proposed consent order;


(2) An admission of all jurisdictional facts; and


(3) An express waiver of the right to further procedural steps and of all rights of judicial review.


(c) If the parties agree to dispose of a case by issuance of a consent order before the FAA issues a Director's Determination, the proposal for a consent order is submitted jointly by the parties to the Director, together with a request to adopt the consent order and dismiss the case. The Director may issue the consent order as an order of the FAA and terminate the proceeding.
