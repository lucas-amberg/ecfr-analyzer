# ยง 16.243   Consent orders.

(a) The agency attorney and the respondents may agree at any time before the issuance of a final decision and order to dispose of the case by issuance of a consent order. Good faith efforts to resolve a complaint through issuance of a consent order may continue throughout the administrative process. Except as provided in ยง 16.209, such efforts may not serve as the basis for extensions of the times set forth in this part. 


(b) A proposal for a consent order, specified in paragraph (a) of this section, shall include: 


(1) A proposed consent order; 


(2) An admission of all jurisdictional facts; 


(3) An express waiver of the right to further procedural steps and of all rights of judicial review; and 


(4) The hearing order, if issued, and an acknowledgment that the hearing order may be used to construe the terms of the consent order. 


(c) If the issuance of a consent order has been agreed upon by all parties to the hearing, the proposed consent order shall be filed with the hearing officer, along with a draft order adopting the consent decree and dismissing the case, for the hearing officer's adoption. 


(d) The deadline for the hearing officer's initial decision and the final agency decision is extended by the amount of days elapsed between the filing of the proposed consent order with the hearing officer and the issuance of the hearing officer's order continuing the hearing. 


(e) If the agency attorney and sponsor agree to dispose of a case by issuance of a consent order before the FAA issues a hearing order, the proposal for a consent order is submitted jointly to the official authorized to issue a hearing order, together with a request to adopt the consent order and dismiss the case. The official authorized to issue the hearing order issues the consent order as an order of the FAA and terminates the proceeding.
