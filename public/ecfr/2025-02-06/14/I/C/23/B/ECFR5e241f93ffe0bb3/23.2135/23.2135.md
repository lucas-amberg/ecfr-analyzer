# § 23.2135   Controllability.

(a) The airplane must be controllable and maneuverable, without requiring exceptional piloting skill, alertness, or strength, within the operating envelope—


(1) At all loading conditions for which certification is requested;


(2) During all phases of flight;


(3) With likely reversible flight control or propulsion system failure; and


(4) During configuration changes.


(b) The airplane must be able to complete a landing without causing substantial damage or serious injury using the steepest approved approach gradient procedures and providing a reasonable margin below V_ref_ or above approach angle of attack.


(c) V_MC_ is the calibrated airspeed at which, following the sudden critical loss of thrust, it is possible to maintain control of the airplane. For multiengine airplanes, the applicant must determine V_MC,_ if applicable, for the most critical configurations used in takeoff and landing operations.


(d) If the applicant requests certification of an airplane for aerobatics, the applicant must demonstrate those aerobatic maneuvers for which certification is requested and determine entry speeds.
