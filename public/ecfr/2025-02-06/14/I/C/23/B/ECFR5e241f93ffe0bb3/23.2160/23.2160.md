# § 23.2160   Vibration, buffeting, and high-speed characteristics.

(a) Vibration and buffeting, for operations up to V_D_/M_D,_ must not interfere with the control of the airplane or cause excessive fatigue to the flightcrew. Stall warning buffet within these limits is allowable.


(b) For high-speed airplanes and all airplanes with a maximum operating altitude greater than 25,000 feet (7,620 meters) pressure altitude, there must be no perceptible buffeting in cruise configuration at 1g and at any speed up to V_MO_/M_MO_, except stall buffeting.


(c) For high-speed airplanes, the applicant must determine the positive maneuvering load factors at which the onset of perceptible buffet occurs in the cruise configuration within the operational envelope. Likely inadvertent excursions beyond this boundary must not result in structural damage.


(d) High-speed airplanes must have recovery characteristics that do not result in structural damage or loss of control, beginning at any likely speed up to V_MO_/M_MO_, following—


(1) An inadvertent speed increase; and


(2) A high-speed trim upset for airplanes where dynamic pressure can impair the longitudinal trim system operation.
