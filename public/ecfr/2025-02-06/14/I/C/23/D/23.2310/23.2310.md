# § 23.2310   Buoyancy for seaplanes and amphibians.

Airplanes intended for operations on water, must—


(a) Provide buoyancy of 80 percent in excess of the buoyancy required to support the maximum weight of the airplane in fresh water; and


(b) Have sufficient margin so the airplane will stay afloat at rest in calm water without capsizing in case of a likely float or hull flooding.
