# § 23.2320   Occupant physical environment.

(a) The applicant must design the airplane to—

(2) Protect the pilot and flight controls from propellers; and


(3) Protect the occupants from serious injury due to damage to windshields, windows, and canopies.


(b) For level 4 airplanes, each windshield and its supporting structure directly in front of the pilot must withstand, without penetration, the impact equivalent to a two-pound bird when the velocity of the airplane is equal to the airplane's maximum approach flap speed.


(c) The airplane must provide each occupant with air at a breathable pressure, free of hazardous concentrations of gases, vapors, and smoke during normal operations and likely failures.


(d) If a pressurization system is installed in the airplane, it must be designed to protect against—


(1) Decompression to an unsafe level; and


(2) Excessive differential pressure.


(e) If an oxygen system is installed in the airplane, it must—


(1) Effectively provide oxygen to each user to prevent the effects of hypoxia; and
