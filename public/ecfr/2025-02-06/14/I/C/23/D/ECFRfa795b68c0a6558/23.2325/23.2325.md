# § 23.2325   Fire protection.

(a) The following materials must be self-extinguishing—


(1) Insulation on electrical wire and electrical cable;


(2) For levels 1, 2, and 3 airplanes, materials in the baggage and cargo compartments inaccessible in flight; and


(3) For level 4 airplanes, materials in the cockpit, cabin, baggage, and cargo compartments.


(b) The following materials must be flame resistant—


(1) For levels 1, 2 and 3 airplanes, materials in each compartment accessible in flight; and


(2) Any equipment associated with any electrical cable installation and that would overheat in the event of circuit overload or fault.


(c) Thermal/acoustic materials in the fuselage, if installed, must not be a flame propagation hazard.


(d) Sources of heat within each baggage and cargo compartment that are capable of igniting adjacent objects must be shielded and insulated to prevent such ignition.


(e) For level 4 airplanes, each baggage and cargo compartment must—


(1) Be located where a fire would be visible to the pilots, or equipped with a fire detection system and warning system; and


(2) Be accessible for the manual extinguishing of a fire, have a built-in fire extinguishing system, or be constructed and sealed to contain any fire within the compartment.

(1) The pilot, while seated, can easily access the fire extinguishing means; and


(2) For levels 3 and 4 airplanes, passengers have a fire extinguishing means available within the passenger compartment.


(g) Each area where flammable fluids or vapors might escape by leakage of a fluid system must—


(1) Be defined; and


(2) Have a means to minimize the probability of fluid and vapor ignition, and the resultant hazard, if ignition occurs.


(h) Combustion heater installations must be protected from uncontained fire.
