# § 23.2405   Automatic power or thrust control systems.

(a) An automatic power or thrust control system intended for in-flight use must be designed so no unsafe condition will result during normal operation of the system.


(b) Any single failure or likely combination of failures of an automatic power or thrust control system must not prevent continued safe flight and landing of the airplane.


(c) Inadvertent operation of an automatic power or thrust control system by the flightcrew must be prevented, or if not prevented, must not result in an unsafe condition.


(d) Unless the failure of an automatic power or thrust control system is extremely remote, the system must—


(1) Provide a means for the flightcrew to verify the system is in an operating condition;


(2) Provide a means for the flightcrew to override the automatic function; and


(3) Prevent inadvertent deactivation of the system.
