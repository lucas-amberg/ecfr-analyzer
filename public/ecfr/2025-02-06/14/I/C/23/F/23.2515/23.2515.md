# § 23.2515   Electrical and electronic system lightning protection.

An airplane approved for IFR operations must meet the following requirements, unless an applicant shows that exposure to lightning is unlikely:


(a) Each electrical or electronic system that performs a function, the failure of which would prevent the continued safe flight and landing of the airplane, must be designed and installed such that—


(1) The function at the airplane level is not adversely affected during and after the time the airplane is exposed to lightning; and


(2) The system recovers normal operation of that function in a timely manner after the airplane is exposed to lightning unless the system's recovery conflicts with other operational or functional requirements of the system.


(b) Each electrical and electronic system that performs a function, the failure of which would significantly reduce the capability of the airplane or the ability of the flightcrew to respond to an adverse operating condition, must be designed and installed such that the system recovers normal operation of that function in a timely manner after the airplane is exposed to lightning.
