# Appendix D to Part 25


*Criteria for determining minimum flight crew.* The following are considered by the Agency in determining the minimum flight crew under ยง 25.1523: 


(a) *Basic workload functions.* The following basic workload functions are considered: 


(1) Flight path control. 


(2) Collision avoidance. 


(3) Navigation. 


(4) Communications. 


(5) Operation and monitoring of aircraft engines and systems. 


(6) Command decisions. 


(b) *Workload factors.* The following workload factors are considered significant when analyzing and demonstrating workload for minimum flight crew determination: 


(1) The accessibility, ease, and simplicity of operation of all necessary flight, power, and equipment controls, including emergency fuel shutoff valves, electrical controls, electronic controls, pressurization system controls, and engine controls. 


(2) The accessibility and conspicuity of all necessary instruments and failure warning devices such as fire warning, electrical system malfunction, and other failure or caution indicators. The extent to which such instruments or devices direct the proper corrective action is also considered. 


(3) The number, urgency, and complexity of operating procedures with particular consideration given to the specific fuel management schedule imposed by center of gravity, structural or other considerations of an airworthiness nature, and to the ability of each engine to operate at all times from a single tank or source which is automatically replenished if fuel is also stored in other tanks. 


(4) The degree and duration of concentrated mental and physical effort involved in normal operation and in diagnosing and coping with malfunctions and emergencies. 


(5) The extent of required monitoring of the fuel, hydraulic, pressurization, electrical, electronic, deicing, and other systems while en route. 


(6) The actions requiring a crewmember to be unavailable at his assigned duty station, including: observation of systems, emergency operation of any control, and emergencies in any compartment. 


(7) The degree of automation provided in the aircraft systems to afford (after failures or malfunctions) automatic crossover or isolation of difficulties to minimize the need for flight crew action to guard against loss of hydraulic or electric power to flight controls or to other essential systems. 


(8) The communications and navigation workload. 


(9) The possibility of increased workload associated with any emergency that may lead to other emergencies. 


(10) Incapacitation of a flight crewmember whenever the applicable operating rule requires a minimum flight crew of at least two pilots. 


(c) *Kind of operation authorized.* The determination of the kind of operation authorized requires consideration of the operating rules under which the airplane will be operated. Unless an applicant desires approval for a more limited kind of operation. It is assumed that each airplane certificated under this Part will operate under IFR conditions.
