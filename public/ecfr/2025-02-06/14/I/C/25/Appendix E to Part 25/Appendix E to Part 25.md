# Appendix E to Part 25


(a) Each applicant for an increase in the maximum certificated takeoff and landing weights of an airplane equipped with a type-certificated standby power rocket engine may obtain an increase as specified in paragraph (b) if—


(1) The installation of the rocket engine has been approved and it has been established by flight test that the rocket engine and its controls can be operated safely and reliably at the increase in maximum weight; and 


(2) The Airplane Flight Manual, or the placard, markings or manuals required in place thereof, set forth in addition to any other operating limitations the Administrator may require, the increased weight approved under this regulation and a prohibition against the operation of the airplane at the approved increased weight when—


(i) The installed standby power rocket engines have been stored or installed in excess of the time limit established by the manufacturer of the rocket engine (usually stenciled on the engine casing); or 


(ii) The rocket engine fuel has been expended or discharged. 


(b) The currently approved maximum takeoff and landing weights at which an airplane is certificated without a standby power rocket engine installation may be increased by an amount that does not exceed any of the following: 


(1) An amount equal in pounds to 0.014 IN, where I is the maximum usable impulse in pounds-seconds available from each standby power rocket engine and N is the number of rocket engines installed. 


(2) An amount equal to 5 percent of the maximum certificated weight approved in accordance with the applicable airworthiness regulations without standby power rocket engines installed. 


(3) An amount equal to the weight of the rocket engine installation. 


(4) An amount that, together with the currently approved maximum weight, would equal the maximum structural weight established for the airplane without standby rocket engines installed. 


The Administrator may grant performance credit for the use of standby power on transport category airplanes. However, the performance credit applies only to the maximum certificated takeoff and landing weights, the takeoff distance, and the takeoff paths, and may not exceed that found by the Administrator to result in an overall level of safety in the takeoff, approach, and landing regimes of flight equivalent to that prescribed in the regulations under which the airplane was originally certificated without standby power. For the purposes of this appendix, “standby power” is power or thrust, or both, obtained from rocket engines for a relatively short period and actuated only in cases of emergency. The following provisions apply: 


(1) *Takeoff; general.* The takeoff data prescribed in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this appendix must be determined at all weights and altitudes, and at ambient temperatures if applicable, at which performance credit is to be applied. 


(2) *Takeoff path.*

(a) The one-engine-inoperative takeoff path with standby power in use must be determined in accordance with the performance requirements of the applicable airworthiness regulations. 


(b) The one-engine-inoperative takeoff path (excluding that part where the airplane is on or just above the takeoff surface) determined in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section must lie above the one-engine-inoperative takeoff path without standby power at the maximum takeoff weight at which all of the applicable air-worthiness requirements are met. For the purpose of this comparison, the flight path is considered to extend to at least a height of 400 feet above the takeoff surface. 


(c) The takeoff path with all engines operating, but without the use of standby power, must reflect a conservatively greater overall level of performance than the one-engine-inoperative takeoff path established in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. The margin must be established by the Administrator to insure safe day-to-day operations, but in no case may it be less than 15 percent. The all-engines-operating takeoff path must be determined by a procedure consistent with that established in complying with paragraph (a) of this section. 


(d) For reciprocating-engine-powered airplanes, the takeoff path to be scheduled in the Airplane Flight Manual must represent the one-engine-operative takeoff path determined in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and modified to reflect the procedure (see paragraph (6)) established by the applicant for flap retraction and attainment of the en route speed. The scheduled takeoff path must have a positive slope at all points of the airborne portion and at no point must it lie above the takeoff path specified in paragraph (a) of this section. 


(3) *Takeoff distance.* The takeoff distance must be the horizontal distance along the one-engine-inoperative take off path determined in accordance with paragraph (2)(a) from the start of the takeoff to the point where the airplane attains a height of 50 feet above the takeoff surface for reciprocating-engine-powered airplanes and a height of 35 feet above the takeoff surface for turbine-powered airplanes. 


(4) *Maximum certificated takeoff weights.* The maximum certificated takeoff weights must be determined at all altitudes, and at ambient temperatures, if applicable, at which performance credit is to be applied and may not exceed the weights established in compliance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. 


(a) The conditions of paragraphs (2)(b) through (d) must be met at the maximum certificated takeoff weight. 


(b) Without the use of standby power, the airplane must meet all of the en route requirements of the applicable airworthiness regulations under which the airplane was originally certificated. In addition, turbine-powered airplanes without the use of standby power must meet the final takeoff climb requirements prescribed in the applicable airworthiness regulations. 


(5) *Maximum certificated landing weights.*

(a) The maximum certificated landing weights (one-engine-inoperative approach and all-engine-operating landing climb) must be determined at all altitudes, and at ambient temperatures if applicable, at which performance credit is to be applied and must not exceed that established in compliance with paragraph (b) of this section. 


(b) The flight path, with the engines operating at the power or thrust, or both, appropriate to the airplane configuration and with standby power in use, must lie above the flight path without standby power in use at the maximum weight at which all of the applicable airworthiness requirements are met. In addition, the flight paths must comply with subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph. 


(i) The flight paths must be established without changing the appropriate airplane configuration. 


(ii) The flight paths must be carried out for a minimum height of 400 feet above the point where standby power is actuated. 


(6) *Airplane configuration, speed, and power and thrust; general.* Any change in the airplane's configuration, speed, and power or thrust, or both, must be made in accordance with the procedures established by the applicant for the operation of the airplane in service and must comply with paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. In addition, procedures must be established for the execution of balked landings and missed approaches. 


(a) The Administrator must find that the procedure can be consistently executed in service by crews of average skill. 


(b) The procedure may not involve methods or the use of devices which have not been proven to be safe and reliable. 


(c) Allowances must be made for such time delays in the execution of the procedures as may be reasonably expected to occur during service. 


(7) *Installation and operation; standby power.* The standby power unit and its installation must comply with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. 


(a) The standby power unit and its installation must not adversely affect the safety of the airplane. 


(b) The operation of the standby power unit and its control must have proven to be safe and reliable.
