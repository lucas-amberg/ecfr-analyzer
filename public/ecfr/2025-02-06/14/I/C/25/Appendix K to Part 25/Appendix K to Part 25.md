# Appendix K to Part 25—Extended Operations (ETOPS)


This appendix specifies airworthiness requirements for the approval of an airplane-engine combination for extended operations (ETOPS). For two-engine airplanes, the applicant must comply with sections K25.1 and K25.2 of this appendix. For airplanes with more than two engines, the applicant must comply with sections K25.1 and K25.3 of this appendix.


K25.1 *Design requirements.*

K25.1.1 *Part 25 compliance.*

The airplane-engine combination must comply with the requirements of part 25 considering the maximum flight time and the longest diversion time for which the applicant seeks approval.


K25.1.2 *Human factors.*

An applicant must consider crew workload, operational implications, and the crew's and passengers' physiological needs during continued operation with failure effects for the longest diversion time for which it seeks approval.


K25.1.3 *Airplane systems.*

(a) *Operation in icing conditions.*

(1) The airplane must be certificated for operation in icing conditions in accordance with § 25.1419.


(2) The airplane must be able to safely conduct an ETOPS diversion with the most critical ice accretion resulting from:


(i) Icing conditions encountered at an altitude that the airplane would have to fly following an engine failure or cabin decompression.


(ii) A 15-minute hold in the continuous maximum icing conditions specified in Appendix C of this part with a liquid water content factor of 1.0.


(iii) Ice accumulated during approach and landing in the icing conditions specified in Appendix C of this part.


(b) *Electrical power supply.* The airplane must be equipped with at least three independent sources of electrical power.


(c) *Time limited systems.* The applicant must define the system time capability of each ETOPS significant system that is time-limited.


K25.1.4 *Propulsion systems.*

(a) *Fuel system design.* Fuel necessary to complete an ETOPS flight (including a diversion for the longest time for which the applicant seeks approval) must be available to the operating engines at the pressure and fuel-flow required by § 25.955 under any airplane failure condition not shown to be extremely improbable. Types of failures that must be considered include, but are not limited to: crossfeed valve failures, automatic fuel management system failures, and normal electrical power generation failures.


(1) If the engine has been certified for limited operation with negative engine-fuel-pump-inlet pressures, the following requirements apply:


(i) Airplane demonstration-testing must cover worst case cruise and diversion conditions involving:


(A) Fuel grade and temperature.


(B) Thrust or power variations.


(C) Turbulence and negative G.


(D) Fuel system components degraded within their approved maintenance limits.


(ii) Unusable-fuel quantity in the suction feed configuration must be determined in accordance with § 25.959.


(2) For two-engine airplanes to be certificated for ETOPS beyond 180 minutes, one fuel boost pump in each main tank and at least one crossfeed valve, or other means for transferring fuel, must be powered by an independent electrical power source other than the three power sources required to comply with section K25.1.3(b) of this appendix. This requirement does not apply if the normal fuel boost pressure, crossfeed valve actuation, or fuel transfer capability is not provided by electrical power.


(3) An alert must be displayed to the flightcrew when the quantity of fuel available to the engines falls below the level required to fly to the destination. The alert must be given when there is enough fuel remaining to safely complete a diversion. This alert must account for abnormal fuel management or transfer between tanks, and possible loss of fuel. This paragraph does not apply to airplanes with a required flight engineer.


(b) *APU design.* If an APU is needed to comply with this appendix, the applicant must demonstrate that:


(1) The reliability of the APU is adequate to meet those requirements; and


(2) If it is necessary that the APU be able to start in flight, it is able to start at any altitude up to the maximum operating altitude of the airplane, or 45,000 feet, whichever is lower, and run for the remainder of any flight .


(c) *Engine oil tank design.* The engine oil tank filler cap must comply with § 33.71(c)(4) of this chapter.


K25.1.5 *Engine-condition monitoring.*

(e) This statement: “The type-design reliability and performance of this airplane-engine combination has been evaluated under 14 CFR 25.1535 and found suitable for (identify maximum approved diversion time) extended operations (ETOPS) when the configuration, maintenance, and procedures standard contained in (identify the CMP document) are met. The actual maximum approved diversion time for this airplane may be less based on its most limiting system time capability. This finding does not constitute operational approval to conduct ETOPS.”


K25.2. *Two-engine airplanes.*

An applicant for ETOPS type design approval of a two-engine airplane must use one of the methods described in section K25.2.1, K25.2.2, or K25.2.3 of this appendix.

(a) *Service experience.* The world fleet for the airplane-engine combination must accumulate a minimum of 250,000 engine-hours. The FAA may reduce this number of hours if the applicant identifies compensating factors that are acceptable to the FAA. The compensating factors may include experience on another airplane, but experience on the candidate airplane must make up a significant portion of the total service experience.


(b) *In-flight shutdown (IFSD) rates.* The demonstrated 12-month rolling average IFSD rate for the world fleet of the airplane-engine combination must be commensurate with the level of ETOPS approval being sought.


(1) For type design approval up to and including 120 minutes: An IFSD rate of 0.05 or less per 1,000 world-fleet engine-hours, unless otherwise approved by the FAA. Unless the IFSD rate is 0.02 or less per 1,000 world-fleet engine-hours, the applicant must provide a list of corrective actions in the CMP document specified in section K25.1.6 of this appendix, that, when taken, would result in an IFSD rate of 0.02 or less per 1,000 fleet engine-hours.


(2) For type design approval up to and including 180 minutes: An IFSD rate of 0.02 or less per 1,000 world-fleet engine-hours, unless otherwise approved by the FAA. If the airplane-engine combination does not meet this rate by compliance with an existing 120-minute CMP document, then new or additional CMP requirements that the applicant has demonstrated would achieve this IFSD rate must be added to the CMP document.


(3) For type design approval beyond 180 minutes: An IFSD rate of 0.01 or less per 1,000 fleet engine-hours unless otherwise approved by the FAA. If the airplane-engine combination does not meet this rate by compliance with an existing 120-minute or 180-minute CMP document, then new or additional CMP requirements that the applicant has demonstrated would achieve this IFSD rate must be added to the CMP document.


(c) *Propulsion system assessment.* (1) The applicant must conduct a propulsion system assessment based on the following data collected from the world-fleet of the airplane-engine combination:


(i) A list of all IFSD's, unplanned ground engine shutdowns, and occurrences (both ground and in-flight) when an engine was not shut down, but engine control or the desired thrust or power level was not achieved, including engine flameouts. Planned IFSD's performed during flight training need not be included. For each item, the applicant must provide—


(A) Each airplane and engine make, model, and serial number;

(iii) A list of all propulsion system events (whether or not caused by maintenance or flightcrew error), including dispatch delays, cancellations, aborted takeoffs, turnbacks, diversions, and flights that continue to destination after the event.


(iv) The total number of engine hours and cycles, the number of hours for the engine with the highest number of hours, the number of cycles for the engine with the highest number of cycles, and the distribution of hours and cycles.


(v) The mean time between failures (MTBF) of propulsion system components that affect reliability.


(vi) A history of the IFSD rates since introduction into service using a 12-month rolling average.


(2) The cause or potential cause of each item listed in K25.2.1(c)(1)(i) must have a corrective action or actions that are shown to be effective in preventing future occurrences. Each corrective action must be identified in the CMP document specified in section K25.1.6. A corrective action is not required:


(i) For an item where the manufacturer is unable to determine a cause or potential cause.


(ii) For an event where it is technically unfeasible to develop a corrective action.


(iii) If the world-fleet IFSD rate—


(A) Is at or below 0.02 per 1,000 world-fleet engine-hours for approval up to and including 180-minute ETOPS; or
