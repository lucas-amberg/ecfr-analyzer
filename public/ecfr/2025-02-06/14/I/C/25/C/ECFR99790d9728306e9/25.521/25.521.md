# § 25.521   General.

(a) Seaplanes must be designed for the water loads developed during takeoff and landing, with the seaplane in any attitude likely to occur in normal operation, and at the appropriate forward and sinking velocities under the most severe sea conditions likely to be encountered. 


(b) Unless a more rational analysis of the water loads is made, or the standards in ANC-3 are used, §§ 25.523 through 25.537 apply. 


(c) The requirements of this section and §§ 25.523 through 25.537 apply also to amphibians.
