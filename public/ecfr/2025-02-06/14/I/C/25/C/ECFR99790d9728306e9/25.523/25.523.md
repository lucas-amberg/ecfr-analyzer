# ยง 25.523   Design weights and center of gravity positions.

(a) *Design weights.* The water load requirements must be met at each operating weight up to the design landing weight except that, for the takeoff condition prescribed in ยง 25.531, the design water takeoff weight (the maximum weight for water taxi and takeoff run) must be used. 


(b) *Center of gravity positions.* The critical centers of gravity within the limits for which certification is requested must be considered to reach maximum design loads for each part of the seaplane structure.
