# ยง 25.533   Hull and main float bottom pressures.

(a) *General.* The hull and main float structure, including frames and bulkheads, stringers, and bottom plating, must be designed under this section. 


(b) *Local pressures.* For the design of the bottom plating and stringers and their attachments to the supporting structure, the following pressure distributions must be applied: 


(1) For an unflared bottom, the pressure at the chine is 0.75 times the pressure at the keel, and the pressures between the keel and chine vary linearly, in accordance with figure 3 of appendix B. The pressure at the keel (psi) is computed as follows: 


(2) For a flared bottom, the pressure at the beginning of the flare is the same as that for an unflared bottom, and the pressure between the chine and the beginning of the flare varies linearly, in accordance with figure 3 of appendix B. The pressure distribution is the same as that prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for an unflared bottom except that the pressure at the chine is computed as follows: 


(c) *Distributed pressures.* For the design of the frames, keel, and chine structure, the following pressure distributions apply: 


(1) Symmetrical pressures are computed as follows: 


(2) The unsymmetrical pressure distribution consists of the pressures prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section on one side of the hull or main float centerline and one-half of that pressure on the other side of the hull or main float centerline, in accordance with figure 3 of appendix B.
