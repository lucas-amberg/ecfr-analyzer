# § 25.407   Trim tab effects.

The effects of trim tabs on the control surface design conditions must be accounted for only where the surface loads are limited by maximum pilot effort. In these cases, the tabs are considered to be deflected in the direction that would assist the pilot, and the deflections are—


(a) For elevator trim tabs, those required to trim the airplane at any point within the positive portion of the pertinent flight envelope in § 25.333(b), except as limited by the stops; and 


(b) For aileron and rudder trim tabs, those required to trim the airplane in the critical unsymmetrical power and loading conditions, with appropriate allowance for rigging tolerances.
