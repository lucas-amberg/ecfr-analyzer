# § 25.479   Level landing conditions.

(a) In the level attitude, the airplane is assumed to contact the ground at forward velocity components, ranging from V_L1_ to 1.25 V_L2_ parallel to the ground under the conditions prescribed in § 25.473 with—


(1) V_L1_ equal to V_S0_ (TAS) at the appropriate landing weight and in standard sea level conditions; and


(2) V_L2_ equal to V_S0_ (TAS) at the appropriate landing weight and altitudes in a hot day temperature of 41 degrees F. above standard.


(3) The effects of increased contact speed must be investigated if approval of downwind landings exceeding 10 knots is requested.


(b) For the level landing attitude for airplanes with tail wheels, the conditions specified in this section must be investigated with the airplane horizontal reference line horizontal in accordance with Figure 2 of Appendix A of this part.


(c) For the level landing attitude for airplanes with nose wheels, shown in Figure 2 of Appendix A of this part, the conditions specified in this section must be investigated assuming the following attitudes:


(1) An attitude in which the main wheels are assumed to contact the ground with the nose wheel just clear of the ground; and


(2) If reasonably attainable at the specified descent and forward velocities, an attitude in which the nose and main wheels are assumed to contact the ground simultaneously.


(d) In addition to the loading conditions prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, but with maximum vertical ground reactions calculated from paragraph (a), the following apply:


(1) The landing gear and directly affected attaching structure must be designed for the maximum vertical ground reaction combined with an aft acting drag component of not less than 25% of this maximum vertical ground reaction.


(2) The most severe combination of loads that are likely to arise during a lateral drift landing must be taken into account. In absence of a more rational analysis of this condition, the following must be investigated:


(i) A vertical load equal to 75% of the maximum ground reaction of § 25.473 must be considered in combination with a drag and side load of 40% and 25% respectively of that vertical load.


(ii) The shock absorber and tire deflections must be assumed to be 75% of the deflection corresponding to the maximum ground reaction of § 25.473(a)(2). This load case need not be considered in combination with flat tires.


(3) The combination of vertical and drag components is considered to be acting at the wheel axle centerline.
