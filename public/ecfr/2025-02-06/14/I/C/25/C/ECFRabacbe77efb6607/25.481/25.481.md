# § 25.481   Tail-down landing conditions.

(a) In the tail-down attitude, the airplane is assumed to contact the ground at forward velocity components, ranging from V_L1_ to V_L2_ parallel to the ground under the conditions prescribed in § 25.473 with—


(1) *V*_L__1_ equal to *V*_S__0_ (TAS) at the appropriate landing weight and in standard sea level conditions; and 


(2) *V*_L__2_ equal to *V*_S__0_ (TAS) at the appropriate landing weight and altitudes in a hot day temperature of 41 degrees F. above standard. 


(3) The combination of vertical and drag components considered to be acting at the main wheel axle centerline.


(b) For the tail-down landing condition for airplanes with tail wheels, the main and tail wheels are assumed to contact the ground simultaneously, in accordance with figure 3 of appendix A. Ground reaction conditions on the tail wheel are assumed to act—


(1) Vertically; and 


(2) Up and aft through the axle at 45 degrees to the ground line. 


(c) For the tail-down landing condition for airplanes with nose wheels, the airplane is assumed to be at an attitude corresponding to either the stalling angle or the maximum angle allowing clearance with the ground by each part of the airplane other than the main wheels, in accordance with figure 3 of appendix A, whichever is less.
