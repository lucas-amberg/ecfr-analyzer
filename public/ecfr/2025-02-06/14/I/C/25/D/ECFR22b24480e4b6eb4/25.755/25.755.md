# ยง 25.755   Hulls.

(a) Each hull must have enough watertight compartments so that, with any two adjacent compartments flooded, the buoyancy of the hull and auxiliary floats (and wheel tires, if used) provides a margin of positive stability great enough to minimize the probability of capsizing in rough, fresh water. 


(b) Bulkheads with watertight doors may be used for communication between compartments.
