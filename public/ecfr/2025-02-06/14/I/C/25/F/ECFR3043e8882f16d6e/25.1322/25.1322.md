# ยง 25.1322   Flightcrew alerting.

(a) Flightcrew alerts must:


(1) Provide the flightcrew with the information needed to:


(i) Identify non-normal operation or airplane system conditions, and


(ii) Determine the appropriate actions, if any.


(2) Be readily and easily detectable and intelligible by the flightcrew under all foreseeable operating conditions, including conditions where multiple alerts are provided.


(3) Be removed when the alerting condition no longer exists.


(b) Alerts must conform to the following prioritization hierarchy based on the urgency of flightcrew awareness and response.


(1) Warning: For conditions that require immediate flightcrew awareness and immediate flightcrew response.


(2) Caution: For conditions that require immediate flightcrew awareness and subsequent flightcrew response.


(3) Advisory: For conditions that require flightcrew awareness and may require subsequent flightcrew response.


(c) Warning and caution alerts must:


(1) Be prioritized within each category, when necessary.


(2) Provide timely attention-getting cues through at least two different senses by a combination of aural, visual, or tactile indications.


(3) Permit each occurrence of the attention-getting cues required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section to be acknowledged and suppressed, unless they are required to be continuous.


(d) The alert function must be designed to minimize the effects of false and nuisance alerts. In particular, it must be designed to:


(1) Prevent the presentation of an alert that is inappropriate or unnecessary.


(2) Provide a means to suppress an attention-getting component of an alert caused by a failure of the alerting function that interferes with the flightcrew's ability to safely operate the airplane. This means must not be readily available to the flightcrew so that it could be operated inadvertently or by habitual reflexive action. When an alert is suppressed, there must be a clear and unmistakable annunciation to the flightcrew that the alert has been suppressed.


(e) Visual alert indications must:


(1) Conform to the following color convention:


(i) Red for warning alert indications.


(ii) Amber or yellow for caution alert indications.


(iii) Any color except red or green for advisory alert indications.


(2) Use visual coding techniques, together with other alerting function elements on the flight deck, to distinguish between warning, caution, and advisory alert indications, if they are presented on monochromatic displays that are not capable of conforming to the color convention in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.


(f) Use of the colors red, amber, and yellow on the flight deck for functions other than flightcrew alerting must be limited and must not adversely affect flightcrew alerting.
