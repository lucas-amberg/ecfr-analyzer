# ยง 25.1505   Maximum operating limit speed.

The maximum operating limit speed (*V*_MO_/*M*_MO_ airspeed or Mach Number, whichever is critical at a particular altitude) is a speed that may not be deliberately exceeded in any regime of flight (climb, cruise, or descent), unless a higher speed is authorized for flight test or pilot training operations. *V*_MO_/*M*_MO_ must be established so that it is not greater than the design cruising speed *V*_C_ and so that it is sufficiently below *V*_D_/*M*_D_ or *V*_DF_/*M*_DF,_ to make it highly improbable that the latter speeds will be inadvertently exceeded in operations. The speed margin between *V*_MO_/*M*_MO_ and *V*_D_/*M*_D_ or *V*_DF_*M/*_DF_ may not be less than that determined under ยง 25.335(b) or found necessary during the flight tests conducted under ยง 25.253.
