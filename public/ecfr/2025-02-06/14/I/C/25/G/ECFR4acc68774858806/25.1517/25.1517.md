# ยง 25.1517   Rough air speed, V

(a) A rough air speed, V_RA,_ for use as the recommended turbulence penetration airspeed, and a rough air Mach number, M_RA_, for use as the recommended turbulence penetration Mach number, must be established. V_RA_/M_RA_ must be sufficiently less than V_MO_/M_MO_ to ensure that likely speed variation during rough air encounters will not cause the overspeed warning to operate too frequently.


(b) At altitudes where V_MO_ is not limited by Mach number, in the absence of a rational investigation substantiating the use of other values, V_RA_ must be less than V_MO_ minus 35 KTAS.




(c) At altitudes where V_MO_ is limited by Mach number, M_RA_ may be chosen to provide an optimum margin between low and high speed buffet boundaries.
