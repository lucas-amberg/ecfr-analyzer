# ยง 25.1707   System separation: EWIS.

(a) Each EWIS must be designed and installed with adequate physical separation from other EWIS and airplane systems so that an EWIS component failure will not create a hazardous condition. Unless otherwise stated, for the purposes of this section, adequate physical separation must be achieved by separation distance or by a barrier that provides protection equivalent to that separation distance.


(b) Each EWIS must be designed and installed so that any electrical interference likely to be present in the airplane will not result in hazardous effects upon the airplane or its systems.


(c) Wires and cables carrying heavy current, and their associated EWIS components, must be designed and installed to ensure adequate physical separation and electrical isolation so that damage to circuits associated with essential functions will be minimized under fault conditions.


(d) Each EWIS associated with independent airplane power sources or power sources connected in combination must be designed and installed to ensure adequate physical separation and electrical isolation so that a fault in any one airplane power source EWIS will not adversely affect any other independent power sources. In addition:


(1) Airplane independent electrical power sources must not share a common ground terminating location.


(2) Airplane system static grounds must not share a common ground terminating location with any of the airplane's independent electrical power sources.


(e) Except to the extent necessary to provide electrical connection to the fuel systems components, the EWIS must be designed and installed with adequate physical separation from fuel lines and other fuel system components, so that:


(1) An EWIS component failure will not create a hazardous condition.


(2) Any fuel leakage onto EWIS components will not create a hazardous condition.


(f) Except to the extent necessary to provide electrical connection to the hydraulic systems components, EWIS must be designed and installed with adequate physical separation from hydraulic lines and other hydraulic system components, so that:


(1) An EWIS component failure will not create a hazardous condition.


(2) Any hydraulic fluid leakage onto EWIS components will not create a hazardous condition.


(g) Except to the extent necessary to provide electrical connection to the oxygen systems components, EWIS must be designed and installed with adequate physical separation from oxygen lines and other oxygen system components, so that an EWIS component failure will not create a hazardous condition.


(h) Except to the extent necessary to provide electrical connection to the water/waste systems components, EWIS must be designed and installed with adequate physical separation from water/waste lines and other water/waste system components, so that:


(1) An EWIS component failure will not create a hazardous condition.


(2) Any water/waste leakage onto EWIS components will not create a hazardous condition.


(i) EWIS must be designed and installed with adequate physical separation between the EWIS and flight or other mechanical control systems cables and associated system components, so that:


(1) Chafing, jamming, or other interference are prevented.


(2) An EWIS component failure will not create a hazardous condition.


(3) Failure of any flight or other mechanical control systems cables or systems components will not damage the EWIS and create a hazardous condition.


(j) EWIS must be designed and installed with adequate physical separation between the EWIS components and heated equipment, hot air ducts, and lines, so that:


(1) An EWIS component failure will not create a hazardous condition.


(2) Any hot air leakage or heat generated onto EWIS components will not create a hazardous condition.


(k) For systems for which redundancy is required, by certification rules, by operating rules, or as a result of the assessment required by ยง 25.1709, EWIS components associated with those systems must be designed and installed with adequate physical separation.


(l) Each EWIS must be designed and installed so there is adequate physical separation between it and other aircraft components and aircraft structure, and so that the EWIS is protected from sharp edges and corners, to minimize potential for abrasion/chafing, vibration damage, and other types of mechanical damage.
