# § 27.175   Demonstration of static longitudinal stability.

(a) *Climb.* Static longitudinal stability must be shown in the climb condition at speeds from Vy − 10 kt to Vy + 10 kt with—


(1) Critical weight; 


(2) Critical center of gravity; 


(3) Maximum continuous power; 


(4) The landing gear retracted; and 


(5) The rotorcraft trimmed at *V*_Y._

(b) *Cruise.* Static longitudinal stability must be shown in the cruise condition at speeds from 0.8 V_NE_ − 10 kt to 0.8 V_NE_ + 10 kt or, if V_H_ is less than 0.8 V_NE_, from V_H_ −10 kt to V_H_ + 10 kt, with— 


(1) Critical weight; 


(2) Critical center of gravity; 


(3) Power for level flight at 0.8 V_NE_ or V_H_, whichever is less; 


(4) The landing gear retracted; and 


(5) The rotorcraft trimmed at 0.8 V_NE_ or V_H_, whichever is less.


(c) *V*_NE._ Static longitudinal stability must be shown at speeds from V_NE_ − 20 kt to V_NE_ with—


(1) Critical weight;


(2) Critical center of gravity;


(3) Power required for level flight at V_NE_ −10 kt or maximum continuous power, whichever is less;


(4) The landing gear retracted; and


(5) The rotorcraft trimmed at V_NE_ − 10 kt.


(d) *Autorotation.* Static longitudinal stability must be shown in autorotation at—


(1) Airspeeds from the minimum rate of descent airspeed−10 kt to the minimum rate of descent airspeed + 10 kt, with—


(i) Critical weight;


(ii) Critical center of gravity;


(iii) The landing gear extended; and


(iv) The rotorcraft trimmed at the minimum rate of descent airspeed.


(2) Airspeeds from best angle-of-glide airspeed−10 kt to the best angle-of-glide airspeed + 10 kt, with—


(i) Critical weight;


(ii) Critical center of gravity;


(iii) The landing gear retracted; and


(iv) The rotorcraft trimmed at the best angle-of-glide airspeed.
