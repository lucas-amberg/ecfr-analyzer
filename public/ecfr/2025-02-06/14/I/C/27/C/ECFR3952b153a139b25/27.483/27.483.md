# § 27.483   One-wheel landing conditions.

For the one-wheel landing condition, the rotorcraft is assumed to be in the level attitude and to contact the ground on one aft wheel. In this attitude—


(a) The vertical load must be the same as that obtained on that side under § 27.479(b)(1); and 


(b) The unbalanced external loads must be reacted by rotorcraft inertia.
