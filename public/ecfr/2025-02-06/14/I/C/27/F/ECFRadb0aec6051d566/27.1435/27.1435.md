# ยง 27.1435   Hydraulic systems.

(a) *Design.* Each hydraulic system and its elements must withstand, without yielding, any structural loads expected in addition to hydraulic loads. 


(b) *Tests.* Each system must be substantiated by proof pressure tests. When proof tested, no part of any system may fail, malfunction, or experience a permanent set. The proof load of each system must be at least 1.5 times the maximum operating pressure of that system. 


(c) *Accumulators.* No hydraulic accumulator or pressurized reservoir may be installed on the engine side of any firewall unless it is an integral part of an engine.
