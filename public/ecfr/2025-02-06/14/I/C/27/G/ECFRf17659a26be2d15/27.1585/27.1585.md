# § 27.1585   Operating procedures.

(a) Parts of the manual containing operating procedures must have information concerning any normal and emergency procedures and other information necessary for safe operation, including takeoff and landing procedures and associated airspeeds. The manual must contain any pertinent information including—


(1) The kind of takeoff surface used in the tests and each appropriate climbout speed; and


(2) The kind of landing surface used in the tests and appropriate approach and glide airspeeds.


(b) For multiengine rotorcraft, information identifying each operating condition in which the fuel system independence prescribed in § 27.953 is necessary for safety must be furnished, together with instructions for placing the fuel system in a configuration used to show compliance with that section. 


(c) For helicopters for which a V_NE_ (power-off) is established under § 27.1505(c), information must be furnished to explain the V_NE_ (power-off) and the procedures for reducing airspeed to not more than the V_NE_ (power-off) following failure of all engines. 


(d) For each rotorcraft showing compliance with § 27.1353 (g)(2) or (g)(3), the operating procedures for disconnecting the battery from its charging source must be furnished. 


(e) If the unusable fuel supply in any tank exceeds five percent of the tank capacity, or one gallon, whichever is greater, information must be furnished which indicates that when the fuel quantity indicator reads “zero” in level flight, any fuel remaining in the fuel tank cannot be used safely in flight. 


(f) Information on the total quantity of usable fuel for each fuel tank must be furnished.


(g) The airspeeds and rotor speeds for minimum rate of descent and best glide angle as prescribed in § 27.71 must be provided.
