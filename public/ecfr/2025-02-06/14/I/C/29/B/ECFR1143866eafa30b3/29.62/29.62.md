# § 29.62   Rejected takeoff: Category A.

The rejected takeoff distance and procedures for each condition where takeoff is approved will be established with—


(a) The takeoff path requirements of §§ 29.59 and 29.60 being used up to the TDP where the critical engine failure is recognized and the rotorcraft is landed and brought to a complete stop on the takeoff surface;


(b) The remaining engines operating within approved limits;


(c) The landing gear remaining extended throughout the entire rejected takeoff; and


(d) The use of only the primary controls until the rotorcraft is on the ground. Secondary controls located on the primary control may not be used until the rotorcraft is on the ground. Means other than wheel brakes may be used to stop the rotorcraft if the means are safe and reliable and consistent results can be expected under normal operating conditions.
