# § 29.177   Static directional stability.

(a) The directional controls must operate in such a manner that the sense and direction of motion of the rotorcraft following control displacement are in the direction of the pedal motion with throttle and collective controls held constant at the trim conditions specified in § 29.175(a), (b), (c), and (d). Sideslip angles must increase with steadily increasing directional control deflection for sideslip angles up to the lesser of—


(1) ±25 degrees from trim at a speed of 15 knots less than the speed for minimum rate of descent varying linearly to ±10 degrees from trim at V_NE_;


(2) The steady-state sideslip angles established by § 29.351;


(3) A sideslip angle selected by the applicant, which corresponds to a sideforce of at least 0.1g; or


(4) The sideslip angle attained by maximum directional control input.


(b) Sufficient cues must accompany the sideslip to alert the pilot when approaching sideslip limits.


(c) During the maneuver specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the sideslip angle versus directional control position curve may have a negative slope within a small range of angles around trim, provided the desired heading can be maintained without exceptional piloting skill or alertness.
