The rotorcraft must be designed for—


(a) A limit maneuvering load factor ranging from a positive limit of 3.5 to a negative limit of −1.0; or


(b) Any positive limit maneuvering load factor not less than 2.0 and any negative limit maneuvering load factor of not less than −0.5 for which—


(1) The probability of being exceeded is shown by analysis and flight tests to be extremely remote; and 


(2) The selected values are appropriate to each weight condition between the design maximum and design minimum weights.
