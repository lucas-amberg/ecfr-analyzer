# ยง 29.511   Ground load: unsymmetrical loads on multiple-wheel units.

(a) In dual-wheel gear units, 60 percent of the total ground reaction for the gear unit must be applied to one wheel and 40 percent to the other. 


(b) To provide for the case of one deflated tire, 60 percent of the specified load for the gear unit must be applied to either wheel except that the vertical ground reaction may not be less than the full static value. 


(c) In determining the total load on a gear unit, the transverse shift in the load centroid, due to unsymmetrical load distribution on the wheels, may be neglected.
