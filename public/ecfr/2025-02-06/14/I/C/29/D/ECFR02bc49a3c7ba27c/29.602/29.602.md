# ยง 29.602   Critical parts.

(a) *Critical part.* A critical part is a part, the failure of which could have a catastrophic effect upon the rotocraft, and for which critical characterists have been identified which must be controlled to ensure the required level of integrity.


(b) If the type design includes critical parts, a critical parts list shall be established. Procedures shall be established to define the critical design characteristics, identify processes that affect those characteristics, and identify the design change and process change controls necessary for showing compliance with the quality assurance requirements of part 21 of this chapter.
