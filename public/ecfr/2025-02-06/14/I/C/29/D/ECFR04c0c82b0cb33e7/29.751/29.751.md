# § 29.751   Main float buoyancy.

(a) For main floats, the buoyancy necessary to support the maximum weight of the rotorcraft in fresh water must be exceeded by—


(1) 50 percent, for single floats; and 


(2) 60 percent, for multiple floats. 


(b) Each main float must have enough water-tight compartments so that, with any single main float compartment flooded, the mainfloats will provide a margin of positive stability great enough to minimize the probability of capsizing.
