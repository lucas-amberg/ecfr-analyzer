(c) [Reserved]


(d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the following categories of rotorcraft must be tested in accordance with the requirements of appendix D of this part to demonstrate that the maximum seating capacity, including the crewmembers required by the operating rules, can be evacuated from the rotorcraft to the ground within 90 seconds:


(1) Rotorcraft with a seating capacity of more than 44 passengers.


(2) Rotorcraft with all of the following:
