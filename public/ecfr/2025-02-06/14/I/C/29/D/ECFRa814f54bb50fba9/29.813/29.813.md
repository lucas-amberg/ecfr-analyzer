(a) Each passageway between passenger compartments, and each passageway leading to Type I and Type II emergency exits, must be—


(1) Unobstructed; and 


(2) At least 20 inches wide. 


(b) For each emergency exit covered by § 29.809(f), there must be enough space adjacent to that exit to allow a crewmember to assist in the evacuation of passengers without reducing the unobstructed width of the passageway below that required for that exit. 


(c) There must be access from each aisle to each Type III and Type IV exit, and 


(1) For rotorcraft that have a passenger seating configuration, excluding pilot seats, of 20 or more, the projected opening of the exit provided must not be obstructed by seats, berths, or other protrusions (including seatbacks in any position) for a distance from that exit of not less than the width of the narrowest passenger seat installed on the rotorcraft; 


(2) For rotorcraft that have a passenger seating configuration, excluding pilot seats, of 19 or less, there may be minor obstructions in the region described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if there are compensating factors to maintain the effectiveness of the exit.
