# ยง 29.725   Limit drop test.

The limit drop test must be conducted as follows: 


(a) The drop height must be at least 8 inches. 


(b) If considered, the rotor lift specified in ยง 29.473(a) must be introduced into the drop test by appropriate energy absorbing devices or by the use of an effective mass. 


(c) Each landing gear unit must be tested in the attitude simulating the landing condition that is most critical from the standpoint of the energy to be absorbed by it. 


(d) When an effective mass is used in showing compliance with paragraph (b) of this section, the following formulae may be used instead of more rational computations.
