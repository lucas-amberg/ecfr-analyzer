# § 29.733   Tires.

Each landing gear wheel must have a tire—


(a) That is a proper fit on the rim of the wheel; and 


(b) Of a rating that is not exceeded under—


(1) The design maximum weight; 


(2) A load on each main wheel tire equal to the static ground reaction corresponding to the critical center of gravity; and 


(3) A load on nose wheel tires (to be compared with the dynamic rating established for those tires) equal to the reaction obtained at the nose wheel, assuming that the mass of the rotorcraft acts as the most critical center of gravity and exerts a force of 1.0 *g* downward and 0.25 *g* forward, the reactions being distributed to the nose and main wheels according to the principles of statics with the drag reaction at the ground applied only at wheels with brakes. 


(c) Each tire installed on a retractable landing gear system must, at the maximum size of the tire type expected in service, have a clearance to surrounding structure and systems that is adequate to prevent contact between the tire and any part of the structure or systems.
