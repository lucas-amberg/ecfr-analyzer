# § 29.695   Power boost and power-operated control system.

(a) If a power boost or power-operated control system is used, an alternate system must be immediately available that allows continued safe flight and landing in the event of—


(1) Any single failure in the power portion of the system; or 


(2) The failure of all engines. 


(b) Each alternate system may be a duplicate power portion or a manually operated mechanical system. The power portion includes the power source (such as hydrualic pumps), and such items as valves, lines, and actuators. 


(c) The failure of mechanical parts (such as piston rods and links), and the jamming of power cylinders, must be considered unless they are extremely improbable.
