# § 29.951   General.

(a) Each fuel system must be constructed and arranged to ensure a flow of fuel at a rate and pressure established for proper engine and auxiliary power unit functioning under any likely operating conditions, including the maneuvers for which certification is requested and during which the engine or auxiliary power unit is permitted to be in operation. 


(b) Each fuel system must be arranged so that—


(1) No engine or fuel pump can draw fuel from more than one tank at a time; or 


(2) There are means to prevent introducing air into the system. 


(c) Each fuel system for a turbine engine must be capable of sustained operation throughout its flow and pressure range with fuel initially saturated with water at 80 degrees F. and having 0.75cc of free water per gallon added and cooled to the most critical condition for icing likely to be encountered in operation.
