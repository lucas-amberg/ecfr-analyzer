# ยง 29.979   Pressure refueling and fueling provisions below fuel level.

(a) Each fueling connection below the fuel level in each tank must have means to prevent the escape of hazardous quantities of fuel from that tank in case of malfunction of the fuel entry valve. 


(b) For systems intended for pressure refueling, a means in addition to the normal means for limiting the tank content must be installed to prevent damage to the tank in case of failure of the normal means. 


(c) The rotorcraft pressure fueling system (not fuel tanks and fuel tank vents) must withstand an ultimate load that is 2.0 times the load arising from the maximum pressure, including surge, that is likely to occur during fueling. The maximum surge pressure must be established with any combination of tank valves being either intentionally or inadvertently closed. 


(d) The rotorcraft defueling system (not including fuel tanks and fuel tank vents) must withstand an ultimate load that is 2.0 times the load arising from the maximum permissible defueling pressure (positive or negative) at the rotorcraft fueling connection.
