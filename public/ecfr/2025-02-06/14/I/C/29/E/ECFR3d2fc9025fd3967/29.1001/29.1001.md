# § 29.1001   Fuel jettisoning.

If a fuel jettisoning system is installed, the following apply: 


(a) Fuel jettisoning must be safe during all flight regimes for which jettisoning is to be authorized. 


(b) In showing compliance with paragraph (a) of this section, it must be shown that— 


(1) The fuel jettisoning system and its operation are free from fire hazard; 


(2) No hazard results from fuel or fuel vapors which impinge on any part of the rotorcraft during fuel jettisoning; and 


(3) Controllability of the rotorcraft remains satisfactory throughout the fuel jettisoning operation. 


(c) Means must be provided to automatically prevent jettisoning fuel below the level required for an all-engine climb at maximum continuous power from sea level to 5,000 feet altitude and cruise thereafter for 30 minutes at maximum range engine power. 


(d) The controls for any fuel jettisoning system must be designed to allow flight personnel (minimum crew) to safely interrupt fuel jettisoning during any part of the jettisoning operation. 


(e) The fuel jettisoning system must be designed to comply with the powerplant installation requirements of § 29.901(c). 


(f) An auxiliary fuel jettisoning system which meets the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), (d), and (e) of this section may be installed to jettison additional fuel provided it has separate and independent controls.
