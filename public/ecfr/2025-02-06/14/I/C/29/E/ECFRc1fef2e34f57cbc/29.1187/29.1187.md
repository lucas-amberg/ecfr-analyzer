# § 29.1187   Drainage and ventilation of fire zones.

(a) There must be complete drainage of each part of each designated fire zone to minimize the hazards resulting from failure or malfunction of any component containing flammable fluids. The drainage means must be—


(1) Effective under conditions expected to prevail when drainage is needed; and 


(2) Arranged so that no discharged fluid will cause an additional fire hazard. 


(b) Each designated fire zone must be ventilated to prevent the accumulation of flammable vapors. 


(c) No ventilation opening may be where it would allow the entry of flammable fluids, vapors, or flame from other zones. 


(d) Ventilation means must be arranged so that no discharged vapors will cause an additional fire hazard. 


(e) For category A rotorcraft, there must be means to allow the crew to shut off the sources of forced ventilation in any fire zone (other than the engine power section of the powerplant compartment) unless the amount of extinguishing agent and the rate of discharge are based on the maximum airflow through that zone.
