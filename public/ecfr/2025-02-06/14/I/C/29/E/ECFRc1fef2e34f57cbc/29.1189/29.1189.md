# § 29.1189   Shutoff means.

(a) There must be means to shut off or otherwise prevent hazardous quantities of fuel, oil, de-icing fluid, and other flammable fluids from flowing into, within, or through any designated fire zone, except that this means need not be provided—


(1) For lines, fittings, and components forming an integral part of an engine;


(2) For oil systems for turbine engine installations in which all components of the system, including oil tanks, are fireproof or located in areas not subject to engine fire conditions; or


(3) For engine oil systems in category B rotorcraft using reciprocating engines of less than 500 cubic inches displacement. 


(b) The closing of any fuel shutoff valve for any engine may not make fuel unavailable to the remaining engines. 


(c) For category A rotorcraft, no hazardous quantity of flammable fluid may drain into any designated fire zone after shutoff has been accomplished, nor may the closing of any fuel shutoff valve for an engine make fuel unavailable to the remaining engines. 


(d) The operation of any shutoff may not interfere with the later emergency operation of any other equipment, such as the means for declutching the engine from the rotor drive. 


(e) Each shutoff valve and its control must be designed, located, and protected to function properly under any condition likely to result from fire in a designated fire zone. 


(f) Except for ground-use-only auxiliary power unit installations, there must be means to prevent inadvertent operation of each shutoff and to make it possible to reopen it in flight after it has been closed.
