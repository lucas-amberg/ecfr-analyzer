(2) Not protected under § 29.861. 


(b) Each auxiliary power unit, combustion heater, and other combustion equipment to be used in flight, must be isolated from the rest of the rotorcraft by firewalls, shrouds, or equivalent means.

(d) Each opening in the firewall or shroud must be sealed with close-fitting fireproof grommets, bushings, or firewall fittings. 


(e) Each firewall and shroud must be fireproof and protected against corrosion.
