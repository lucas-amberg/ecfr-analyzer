# § 29.1197   Fire extinguishing agents.

(a) Fire extinguishing agents must—


(1) Be capable of extinguishing flames emanating from any burning of fluids or other combustible materials in the area protected by the fire extinguishing system; and 


(2) Have thermal stability over the temperature range likely to be experienced in the compartment in which they are stored. 


(b) If any toxic extinguishing agent is used, it must be shown by test that entry of harmful concentrations of fluid or fluid vapors into any personnel compartment (due to leakage during normal operation of the rotorcraft, or discharge on the ground or in flight) is prevented, even though a defect may exist in the extinguishing system.
