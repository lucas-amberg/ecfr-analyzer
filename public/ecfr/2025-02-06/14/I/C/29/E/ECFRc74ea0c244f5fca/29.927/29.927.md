# § 29.927   Additional tests.

(a) Any additional dynamic, endurance, and operational tests, and vibratory investigations necessary to determine that the rotor drive mechanism is safe, must be performed. 


(b) If turbine engine torque output to the transmission can exceed the highest engine or transmission torque limit, and that output is not directly controlled by the pilot under normal operating conditions (such as where the primary engine power control is accomplished through the flight control), the following test must be made: 


(1) Under conditions associated with all engines operating, make 200 applications, for 10 seconds each, of torque that is at least equal to the lesser of—


(i) The maximum torque used in meeting § 29.923 plus 10 percent; or 


(ii) The maximum torque attainable under probable operating conditions, assuming that torque limiting devices, if any, function properly. 


(2) For multiengine rotorcraft under conditions associated with each engine, in turn, becoming inoperative, apply to the remaining transmission torque inputs the maximum torque attainable under probable operating conditions, assuming that torque limiting devices, if any, function properly. Each transmission input must be tested at this maximum torque for at least fifteen minutes. 


(c) *Lubrication system failure.* For lubrication systems required for proper operation of rotor drive systems, the following apply: 


(1) *Category A.* Unless such failures are extremely remote, it must be shown by test that any failure which results in loss of lubricant in any normal use lubrication system will not prevent continued safe operation, although not necessarily without damage, at a torque and rotational speed prescribed by the applicant for continued flight, for at least 30 minutes after perception by the flightcrew of the lubrication system failure or loss of lubricant. 


(2) *Category B.* The requirements of Category A apply except that the rotor drive system need only be capable of operating under autorotative conditions for at least 15 minutes. 


(d) *Overspeed test.* The rotor drive system must be subjected to 50 overspeed runs, each 30 ±3 seconds in duration, at not less than either the higher of the rotational speed to be expected from an engine control device failure or 105 percent of the maximum rotational speed, including transients, to be expected in service. If speed and torque limiting devices are installed, are independent of the normal engine control, and are shown to be reliable, their rotational speed limits need not be exceeded. These runs must be conducted as follows: 


(1) Overspeed runs must be alternated with stabilizing runs of from 1 to 5 minutes duration each at 60 to 80 percent of maximum continuous speed. 


(2) Acceleration and deceleration must be accomplished in a period not longer than 10 seconds (except where maximum engine acceleration rate will require more than 10 seconds), and the time for changing speeds may not be deducted from the specified time for the overspeed runs. 


(3) Overspeed runs must be made with the rotors in the flattest pitch for smooth operation. 


(e) The tests prescribed in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section must be conducted on the rotorcraft and the torque must be absorbed by the rotors to be installed, except that other ground or flight test facilities with other appropriate methods of torque absorption may be used if the conditions of support and vibration closely simulate the conditions that would exist during a test on the rotorcraft.


(f) Each test prescribed by this section must be conducted without intervening disassembly and, except for the lubrication system failure test required by paragraph (c) of this section, each part tested must be in a serviceable condition at the conclusion of the test.
