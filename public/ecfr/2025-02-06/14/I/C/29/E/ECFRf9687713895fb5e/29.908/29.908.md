# § 29.908   Cooling fans.

For cooling fans that are a part of a powerplant installation the following apply: 


(a) *Category A.* For cooling fans installed in Category A rotorcraft, it must be shown that a fan blade failure will not prevent continued safe flight either because of damage caused by the failed blade or loss of cooling air. 


(b) *Category B.* For cooling fans installed in category B rotorcraft, there must be means to protect the rotorcraft and allow a safe landing if a fan blade fails. It must be shown that—


(1) The fan blade would be contained in the case of a failure; 


(2) Each fan is located so that a fan blade failure will not jeopardize safety; or 


(3) Each fan blade can withstand an ultimate load of 1.5 times the centrifugal force expected in service, limited by either—


(i) The highest rotational speeds achievable under uncontrolled conditions; or 


(ii) An overspeed limiting device.


(c) *Fatigue evaluation.* Unless a fatigue evaluation under § 29.571 is conducted, it must be shown that cooling fan blades are not operating at resonant conditions within the operating limits of the rotorcraft.
