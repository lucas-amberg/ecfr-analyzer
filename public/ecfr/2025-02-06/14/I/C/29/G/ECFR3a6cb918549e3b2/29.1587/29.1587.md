# § 29.1587   Performance information.

Flight manual performance information which exceeds any operating limitation may be shown only to the extent necessary for presentation clarity or to determine the effects of approved optional equipment or procedures. When data beyond operating limits are shown, the limits must be clearly indicated. The following must be provided:


(a) *Category A.* For each category A rotorcraft, the Rotorcraft Flight Manual must contain a summary of the performance data, including data necessary for the application of any operating rule of this chapter, together with descriptions of the conditions, such as airspeeds, under which this data was determined, and must contain—


(1) The indicated airspeeds corresponding with those determined for takeoff, and the procedures to be followed if the critical engine fails during takeoff; 


(2) The airspeed calibrations; 


(3) The techniques, associated airspeeds, and rates of descent for autorotative landings; 


(4) The rejected takeoff distance determined under § 29.62 and the takeoff distance determined under § 29.61;


(5) The landing data determined under § 29.81 and § 29.85;


(6) The steady gradient of climb for each weight, altitude, and temperature for which takeoff data are to be scheduled, along the takeoff path determined in the flight conditions required in § 29.67(a)(1) and (a)(2):


(i) In the flight conditions required in § 29.67(a)(1) between the end of the takeoff distance and the point at which the rotorcraft is 200 feet above the takeoff surface (or 200 feet above the lowest point of the takeoff profile for elevated heliports);


(ii) In the flight conditions required in § 29.67(a)(2) between the points at which the rotorcraft is 200 and 1000 feet above the takeoff surface (or 200 and 1000 feet above the lowest point of the takeoff profile for elevated heliports); and 


(7) Out-of-ground effect hover performance determined under § 29.49 and the maximum weight for each altitude and temperature condition at which the rotorcraft can safely hover out-of-ground effect in winds of not less than 17 knots from all azimuths. These data must be clearly referenced to the appropriate hover charts.


(b) *Category B.* For each category B rotorcraft, the Rotorcraft Flight Manual must contain—


(1) The takeoff distance and the climbout speed together with the pertinent information defining the flight path with respect to autorotative landing if an engine fails, including the calculated effects of altitude and temperature;


(2) The steady rates of climb and in-ground-effect hovering ceiling, together with the corresponding airspeeds and other pertinent information, including the calculated effects of altitude and temperature; 


(3) The landing distance, appropriate airspeed, and type of landing surface, together with all pertinent information that might affect this distance, including the effects of weight, altitude, and temperature;


(4) The maximum safe wind for operation near the ground; 


(5) The airspeed calibrations; 


(6) The height-velocity envelope except for rotorcraft incorporating this as an operating limitation;




(7) Glide distance as a function of altitude when autorotating at the speeds and conditions for minimum rate of descent and best glide angle, as determined in § 29.71;






(8) Out-of-ground effect hover performance determined under § 29.49 and the maximum safe wind demonstrated under the ambient conditions for data presented. In addition, the maximum weight for each altitude and temperature condition at which the rotorcraft can safely hover out-of-ground-effect in winds of not less than 17 knots from all azimuths. These data must be clearly referenced to the appropriate hover charts; and 


(9) Any additional performance data necessary for the application of any operating rule in this chapter.
