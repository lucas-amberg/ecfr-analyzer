# § 29.1509   Rotor speed.

(a) *Maximum power-off (autorotation).* The maximum power-off rotor speed must be established so that it does not exceed 95 percent of the lesser of—


(1) The maximum design r.p.m. determined under § 29.309(b); and 


(2) The maximum r.p.m. shown during the type tests. 


(b) *Minimum power-off.* The minimum power-off rotor speed must be established so that it is not less than 105 percent of the greater of—


(1) The minimum shown during the type tests; and 


(2) The minimum determined by design substantiation. 


(c) *Minimum power-on.* The minimum power-on rotor speed must be established so that it is—


(1) Not less than the greater of—


(i) The minimum shown during the type tests; and 


(ii) The minimum determined by design substantiation; and 


(2) Not more than a value determined under § 29.33 (a)(1) and (c)(1).
