# ยง 33.39   Lubrication system.

(a) The lubrication system of the engine must be designed and constructed so that it will function properly in all flight attitudes and atmospheric conditions in which the airplane is expected to operate. In wet sump engines, this requirement must be met when only one-half of the maximum lubricant supply is in the engine. 


(b) The lubrication system of the engine must be designed and constructed to allow installing a means of cooling the lubricant. 


(c) The crankcase must be vented to the atmosphere to preclude leakage of oil from excessive pressure in the crankcase.
