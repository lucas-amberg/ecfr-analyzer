# ยง 35.16   Propeller critical parts.

The integrity of each propeller critical part identified by the safety analysis required by ยง 35.15 must be established by:


(a) A defined engineering process for ensuring the integrity of the propeller critical part throughout its service life,


(b) A defined manufacturing process that identifies the requirements to consistently produce the propeller critical part as required by the engineering process, and


(c) A defined service management process that identifies the continued airworthiness requirements of the propeller critical part as required by the engineering process.
