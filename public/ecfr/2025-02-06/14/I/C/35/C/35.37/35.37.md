# ยง 35.37   Fatigue limits and evaluation.

This section does not apply to fixed-pitch wood propellers of conventional design.


(a) Fatigue limits must be established by tests, or analysis based on tests, for propeller:


(1) Hubs.


(2) Blades.


(3) Blade retention components.


(4) Components which are affected by fatigue loads and which are shown under ยง 35.15 to have a fatigue failure mode leading to hazardous propeller effects.


(b) The fatigue limits must take into account:


(1) All known and reasonably foreseeable vibration and cyclic load patterns that are expected in service; and


(2) Expected service deterioration, variations in material properties, manufacturing variations, and environmental effects.


(c) A fatigue evaluation of the propeller must be conducted to show that hazardous propeller effects due to fatigue will be avoided throughout the intended operational life of the propeller on either:


(1) The intended airplane by complying with ยง 23.2400(c) or ยง 25.907 of this chapter, as applicable; or


(2) A typical airplane.
