# ยง 38.9   Relationship to other regulations.

In accordance with certain provisions of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 (CAA) (42 U.S.C. 7571 *et seq.*), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is authorized to set standards for aircraft engine emissions in the United States, while the FAA is authorized to ensure compliance with those standards under a delegation from the Secretary of Transportation (49 CFR 1.83). The fuel efficiency limits in ยง 38.17 are intended to be the same as that promulgated by the EPA in 40 CFR part 1030. Accordingly, if the EPA changes any regulation in 40 CFR part 1030 that corresponds with a regulation in this part, a certification applicant may request a waiver of those provisions as they appear in this part in order to comply with part 1030. In addition, unless otherwise specified in this part, all terminology and abbreviations in this part that are defined in 40 CFR part 1030 have the meaning specified in part 1030.
