# Appendix A to Part 38—Determination of Airplane Fuel Efficiency Metric Value


A38.1.1 This appendix describes the processes and procedures for determining the fuel efficiency metric value for an airplane subject to this part.


A38.1.2.1 SAR may be determined by either—


A38.1.2.1.1 Direct flight test measurement at the SAR test points, including any corrections of test data to reference specifications; or


A38.1.2.1.2 Use of a performance model.


A38.1.2.2 For any determination made under section A38.1.2.1.1 of this appendix, the SAR flight test data must have been acquired in accordance with the procedures defined in this appendix and approved by the FAA.


A38.1.2.3 For any determination made under section A38.1.2.1.2 of this appendix, the performance model must:


A38.1.2.3.1 Be verified that the model produces the values that are the same as FAA-approved SAR flight test data;


A38.1.2.3.2 Include a detailed description of any test and analysis method and any algorithm used so as to allow evaluation by the FAA; and


A38.1.2.3.3 Be approved by the FAA before use.


A38.2.1 The following reference specifications must be established when determining SAR values for an airplane. No reference specification may exceed any airworthiness limit approved for the airplane under this chapter. See section A38.5 of this appendix for further information.


A38.2.1.1 Reference specifications at the airplane level:


A38.2.1.1.1 Airplane at the reference masses listed in § 38.13(b);


A38.2.1.1.2 A combination of altitude and airspeed selected by the applicant;


A38.2.1.1.3 Airplane in steady, unaccelerated, straight and level flight;


A38.2.1.1.4 Airplane in longitudinal and lateral trim;


A38.2.1.1.5 Airplane gravitational acceleration when travelling in the direction of true North in still air at the reference altitude and a geodetic latitude of 45.5 degrees, based on g_0_ (g_0_ is 9.80665 m/s
2, which is the standard acceleration due to gravity at sea level and a geodetic latitude of 45.5 degrees);


A38.2.1.1.6 A reference airplane center of gravity (CG) position selected by the applicant to be representative of the mid-CG point relevant to design cruise performance at each of the three reference airplane masses; and


A38.2.1.1.7 A wing structural loading condition defined by the applicant that is representative of operations conducted in accordance with the airplane's maximum payload capability.


A38.2.1.2 Reference specifications at the engine level:


A38.2.1.2.1 Electrical and mechanical power extraction and bleed flow relevant to design cruise performance, as selected by the applicant;


*Note 1 to A38.2.1.2.1*—Power extraction and bleed flow attributable to the use of optional equipment such as passenger entertainment systems need not be included.


A38.2.1.2.2 Engine stability bleeds operating according to the manufacturer's normal schedule for the engine; and


A38.2.1.2.3 Engines with at least 15 cycles or 50 engine flight hours.


A38.2.1.3 Other reference specifications:


A38.2.1.3.1 ICAO standard day atmosphere (Doc 7488/3, 3rd edition 1993, titled “Manual of the ICAO Standard Atmosphere (extended to 80 kilometres (262 500 feet))”) (incorporated by reference, see § 38.7); and


A38.2.1.3.2 Fuel lower heating value equal to 43.217 MJ/kg (18,−580 BTU/lb).


A38.2.2 If any test conditions are not the same as the reference specifications of this appendix, the test conditions must be corrected to the reference specifications as described in section A38.5 of this appendix.


A38.3.1 This section provides additional information for determining the RGF, as required by § 38.15.


A38.3.2 The area that defines RGF includes all pressurized space on a single or multiple decks including aisles, assist spaces, passageways, stairwells and areas that can accommodate cargo or auxiliary fuel containers. It does not include permanent integrated fuel tanks within the cabin, or any unpressurized fairings, crew rest or work areas, or cargo areas that are not on the main or upper deck (*e.g.,* `loft' or under floor areas). RGF does not include the flight deck crew zone.


A38.3.3 The aft boundary to be used for calculating RGF is the aft pressure bulkhead. The forward boundary is the forward pressure bulkhead, not including the flight deck crew zone.


A38.3.4 Areas that are accessible to both crew and passengers are not considered part of the flight deck crew zone. For an airplane that has a flight deck door, the aft boundary of the flight deck crew zone is the plane of the flight deck door. For an airplane that has no flight deck door or has optional interior configurations that include different locations of the flight deck door, the aft boundary is determined by the configuration that provides the smallest available flight deck crew zone. For airplanes certificated for single-pilot operation, the flight deck crew zone is measured as half the width of the flight deck.


A38.3.5 Figures A38-1 and A38-2 of this appendix provide a notional view of the RGF boundary conditions.


A38.4.1 Certification Test Specifications. This section prescribes the specifications under which an applicant must conduct SAR certification tests.


A38.4.2 Flight Test Procedures


A38.4.2.1 Before a Test Flight. The test flight procedures must include the following elements and must be approved by the FAA before any test flight is conducted:


A38.4.2.1.1 *Airplane conformity.* The test airplane must conform to the critical configuration of the type design for which certification is sought.


A38.4.2.1.2 *Airplane weight.* The test airplane must be weighed. Any change in mass after the weighing and prior to the test flight must be accounted for.

A38.4.2.1.4 *Fuel lower heating value.* The lower heating value of the fuel used on a test flight must be determined from a sample of fuel used for the test flight. The lower heating value of the fuel sample must be used to correct measured data to reference specifications. The determination of lower heating value and the correction to reference specifications are subject to approval by the FAA.


A38.4.2.1.4.1 The fuel lower heating value may be determined in accordance with ASTM D4809-13 “Standard Test Method for Heat of Combustion of Liquid Hydrocarbon Fuels by Bomb Calorimeter (Precision Method)”, or as approved by the FAA.


A38.4.2.1.4.2 The fuel sample may be representative of the fuel used for each flight test and should not have errors or variations due to fuel being uplifted from multiple sources, fuel tank selection, or fuel layering in a tank.


A38.4.2.1.5 *Fuel specific gravity and viscosity.* When volumetric fuel flow meters are used, the specific gravity and viscosity of the fuel used on a test flight must be determined from a sample of fuel used for the test flight.


A38.4.2.1.5.1 The fuel specific gravity may be determined in accordance with ASTM D4052-11 “Standard Test Method for Density, Relative Density, and API Gravity of Liquids”, or as approved by FAA.

A38.4.2.2 Flight Test Procedures and Test Condition Stability. An applicant must conduct each flight test in accordance with the flight test procedures and the stability conditions as follows:


A38.4.2.2.1 Flight Test Procedure. The following procedures must be maintained during each flight used to gather data for determining SAR values:


A38.4.2.2.1.1 To the extent that is practicable, the airplane is flown at constant pressure altitude and constant heading along isobars;


A38.4.2.2.1.2 The engine thrust/power setting is stable for unaccelerated level flight;


A38.4.2.2.1.3 The airplane is flown as close as practicable to the reference specifications to minimize the magnitude of any correction;


A38.4.2.2.1.4 Changes in trim or engine power/thrust settings, engine stability and handling bleeds, or electrical and mechanical power extraction (including bleed flow) are avoided or minimized as practicable; and


A38.4.2.2.1.5 There is no unnecessary movement of on-board personnel.


A38.4.2.2.2 Test Condition Stability. To obtain a valid SAR measurement, the following conditions must be maintained during each test flight, including the indicated tolerances for at least 1 minute while SAR data is acquired:

A38.4.2.2.2.8 Pressure altitude within ±23 m (±75 ft).


A38.4.2.2.3 Alternatives to the stable test condition criteria of section A38.4.2.2.2 of this appendix may be used provided that stability is sufficiently demonstrated to the FAA.


A38.4.2.2.4 Data obtained at test points that do not meet the stability criteria of section A38.4.2.2.2 may be acceptable as an equivalent procedure, subject to FAA approval.


A38.4.2.2.5 SAR measurements at the test points must be separated by either:


A38.4.2.2.5.1 Two minutes; or


A38.4.2.2.5.2 An exceedance of one or more of the stability criteria limits described in A38.4.2.2.2.


A38.4.2.3 Verification of Airplane Mass at Test Conditions


A38.4.2.3.1 The procedure for determining the mass of the airplane at each test condition must be approved by the FAA.


A38.4.2.3.2 The mass of the airplane during a flight test is determined by subtracting the fuel used from the mass of the airplane at the start of the test flight. The accuracy of the determination of the fuel used must be verified by:


A38.4.2.3.2.1 Weighing the test airplane on calibrated scales before and after the SAR test flight;


A38.4.2.3.2.2 Weighing the test airplane before and after another test flight that included a cruise segment, provided that flight occurs within one week or 50 flight hours (at the option of the applicant) of the SAR test flight and using the same, unaltered fuel flow meters; or


A38.4.2.3.2.3 Other methods as approved by the FAA.


A38.5.1 Measurement System


A38.5.1.1 The following parameters must be recorded at a minimum sampling rate of 1 Hertz (cycle per second):


A38.5.1.1.1 Airspeed;


A38.5.1.1.2 Ground speed;


A38.5.1.1.3 True airspeed;


A38.5.1.1.4 Fuel flow;


A38.5.1.1.5 Engine power setting;


A38.5.1.1.6 Pressure altitude;


A38.5.1.1.7 Temperature;


A38.5.1.1.8 Heading;


A38.5.1.1.9 Track; and


A38.5.1.1.10 Fuel used (for the determination of gross mass and CG position).


A38.5.1.2 The following parameters must be recorded:


A38.5.1.2.1 Latitude;


A38.5.1.2.2 Engine bleed positions and power off-takes; and


A38.5.1.2.3 Power extraction (electrical and mechanical load).


A38.5.1.3 The value of each parameter used for the determination of SAR (except for ground speed) is the simple arithmetic average of the measured values for that parameter obtained throughout the stable test condition described in section A38.4.2.2.2 of this appendix.


A38.5.1.4 For ground speed, the value is the rate of change of ground speed during the SAR test measurement. The rate of change of ground speed during the SAR measurement must be used to evaluate and correct any acceleration or deceleration that might occur during the SAR measurement.


A38.5.1.5 Each measurement device must have sufficient resolution to determine that the stability of a parameter defined in section A38.4.2.2.2 of this appendix is maintained during SAR measurement.


A38.5.1.6 The SAR measurement system consists of the combined instruments and devices, and any associated procedures, used to acquire the following parameters necessary to determine SAR:


A38.5.1.6.1 Fuel flow;


A38.5.1.6.2 Mach number;


A38.5.1.6.3 Altitude;


A38.5.1.6.4 Airplane mass;


A38.5.1.6.5 Ground speed;


A38.5.1.6.6 Outside air temperature;


A38.5.1.6.7 Fuel lower heating value; and


A38.5.1.6.8 CG.


A38.5.1.7 The SAR value is affected by the accuracy of each element that comprises the SAR measurement system. The cumulative error associated with the SAR measurement system is defined as the root sum of squares (RSS) of the individual accuracies.


A38.5.1.8 If the absolute value of the cumulative error of the overall SAR measurement system is greater than 1.5 percent, a penalty equal to the amount that the RSS value exceeds 1.5 percent must be applied to the SAR value that has been corrected to reference specifications (see section A38.5.2 of this appendix). If the absolute value of the cumulative error of the overall SAR measurement system is less than or equal to 1.5 percent, no penalty will be applied.


A38.5.2 Calculation of Specific Air Range from Measured Data


A38.5.2.1 Calculating SAR. SAR must be calculated using the following equation:


A38.5.2.2 Correcting Measured SAR Values to Reference Specifications


A38.5.2.2.1 The measured SAR values must be corrected to the reference specifications listed in A38.2 of this appendix. Unless otherwise approved by the FAA, corrections to reference specifications must be applied for each of the following measured parameters:


A38.5.2.2.1.1 *Acceleration/deceleration (energy).* Drag determination is based on an assumption of steady, unaccelerated flight. Acceleration or deceleration occurring during a test condition affects the assessed drag level. The reference specification is in section A38.2.1.1.3 of this appendix.


A38.5.2.2.1.2 *Aeroelastics.* Wing aeroelasticity may cause a variation in drag as a function of airplane wing mass distribution. Airplane wing mass distribution will be affected by the fuel load distribution in the wings and the presence of any external stores. The reference specification is in section A38.2.1.1.7 of this appendix.


A38.5.2.2.1.3 *Altitude.* The altitude at which the airplane is flown affects the fuel flow. The reference specification is in section A38.2.1.1.2 of this appendix.


A38.5.2.2.1.4 *Apparent gravity.* Acceleration, caused by the local effect of gravity, and inertia, affect the test weight of the airplane. The apparent gravity at the test conditions varies with latitude, altitude, ground speed, and direction of motion relative to the Earth's axis. The reference gravitational acceleration is the gravitational acceleration for the airplane travelling in the direction of true North in still air at the reference altitude, a geodetic latitude of 45.5 degrees, and based on g_0_ (see section A38.2.1.1.5 of this appendix).


A38.5.2.2.1.5 *CG position.* The position of the airplane CG affects the drag due to longitudinal trim. The reference specification is in section A38.2.1.1.6 of this appendix.


A38.5.2.2.1.6 *Electrical and mechanical power extraction and bleed flow.* Electrical and mechanical power extraction, and bleed flow affect the fuel flow. The reference specifications are in sections A38.2.1.2.1 and A38.2.1.2.2 of this appendix.


A38.5.2.2.1.7 *Engine deterioration level.* The requirement in section A38.2.1.2.3 of this appendix addresses the minimum deterioration of an engine that is used to determine SAR. Since engine deterioration is rapid when an engine is new, when used for SAR determination:


A38.5.2.2.1.7.1 Subject to FAA approval, an engine having less deterioration than the reference deterioration level in section A38.2.1.2.3 of this appendix must correct the fuel flow to the reference deterioration using an approved method.


A38.5.2.2.1.7.2 An engine with greater deterioration than the reference deterioration level in section A38.2.1.2.3 of this appendix may be used, and no correction is permitted.


A38.5.2.2.1.8 *Fuel lower heating value.* The fuel lower heating value defines the energy content of the fuel. The lower heating value directly affects the fuel flow at a given test condition. The reference specification is in section A38.2.1.3.2 of this appendix.


A38.5.2.2.1.9 *Reynolds number.* The Reynolds number affects airplane drag. For a given test condition the Reynolds number is a function of the density and viscosity of air at the test altitude and temperature. The reference Reynolds number is derived from the density and viscosity of air from the ICAO standard atmosphere at the reference altitude (see sections A38.2.1.1.2 and A38.2.1.3.1 of this appendix, incorporated by reference see § 38.7).


A38.5.2.2.1.10 *Temperature.* The ambient temperature affects the fuel flow. The reference temperature is the standard day temperature from the ICAO standard atmosphere at the reference altitude (see section A38.2.1.3.1 of this appendix, incorporated by reference see § 38.7).


*Note 2 to A38.5.2.2.1.10*—Post-flight data analysis includes the correction of measured data for data acquisition hardware response characteristics (*e.g.,* system latency, lag, offset, buffering, etc.).


A38.5.2.2.2 Correction methods are subject to the approval of the FAA.


A38.5.2.3 Using Specific Air Range to Determine the Fuel Efficiency Metric Value


A38.5.2.3.1 Calculate the SAR values for each of the three reference masses as described in § 38.13, including any corrections to reference specifications, as required under this part. The final SAR value for each reference mass is the simple arithmetic average of all valid test points at the appropriate gross mass, or derived from a validated performance model. No data acquired from a valid test point may be omitted unless approved by the FAA.


A38.5.2.3.2 When an FAA-approved performance model is used, extrapolations to aircraft masses other than those tested may be approved when such extrapolations are consistent with accepted airworthiness practices. Since a performance model must be based on data covering an adequate range of lift coefficient, Mach number, and thrust specific fuel consumption, no extrapolation of those parameters is permitted.


A38.5.3 Validity of Results


A38.5.3.1 A 90 percent confidence interval must be calculated for each of the SAR values at the three reference masses.


A38.5.3.2 If the 90 percent confidence interval of the SAR value at any of the three reference airplane masses—


A38.5.3.2.1 Is less than or equal to ±1.5 percent, the SAR value may be used.


A38.5.3.2.2 Exceeds ±1.5 percent, a penalty equal to the amount that the 90 percent confidence interval exceeds ±1.5 percent must be applied to the SAR value, as approved by the FAA.


A38.5.3.3 If clustered data is acquired separately for each of the three gross mass reference points, the minimum sample size acceptable for each of the three gross mass SAR values is six.


A38.5.3.4 If SAR data is collected over a range of masses, the minimum sample size is 12 and the 90 percent confidence interval is calculated for the mean regression line through the data.
