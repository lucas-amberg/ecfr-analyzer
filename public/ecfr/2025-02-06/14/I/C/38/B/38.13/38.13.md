# ยง 38.13   Specific air range.

(a) For each airplane subject to this part, the SAR of an airplane must be determined by either:


(1) Direct flight test measurements; or


(2) Using a performance model that is:


(i) Validated by actual SAR flight test data; and


(ii) Approved by the FAA before any SAR calculations are submitted.


(b) For the airplane model, establish a 1/SAR value at each of the following reference airplane masses:


(1) High gross mass: 92 percent MTOM.


(2) Low gross mass: (0.45 * MTOM) + (0.63 * (MTOM^0.924)).


(3) Mid gross mass: simple arithmetic average of high gross mass and low gross mass.


(c) To obtain (1/SAR)_avg_ as required to determine the fuel efficiency metric value described in ยง 38.11, calculate the average of the three 1/SAR values described in paragraph (b) of this section. Do not include auxiliary power units in any 1/SAR calculation.


(d) All determinations made under this section must be made in accordance with the procedures applicable to SAR as described in appendix A to this part.
