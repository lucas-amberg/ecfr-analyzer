(g) Each person performing an annual or 100-hour inspection shall inspect (where applicable) all components and systems that make up the complete empennage assembly for poor general condition, fabric or skin deterioration, distortion, evidence of failure, insecure attachment, improper component installation, and improper component operation. 


(h) Each person performing an annual or 100-hour inspection shall inspect (where applicable) the following components of the propeller group: 


(1) Propeller assembly—for cracks, nicks, binds, and oil leakage. 


(2) Bolts—for improper torquing and lack of safetying. 


(3) Anti-icing devices—for improper operations and obvious defects. 


(4) Control mechanisms—for improper operation, insecure mounting, and restricted travel.
