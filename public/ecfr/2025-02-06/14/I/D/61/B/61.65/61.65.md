(7) Safe and efficient operation of aircraft under instrument flight rules and conditions; 


(8) Recognition of critical weather situations and windshear avoidance; 


(9) Aeronautical decision making and judgment; and 


(10) Crew resource management, including crew communication and coordination. 


(c) *Flight proficiency.* A person who applies for an instrument rating must receive and log training from an authorized instructor in an aircraft, or in a full flight simulator or flight training device, in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, that includes the following areas of operation:


(1) Preflight preparation; 


(2) Preflight procedures; 


(3) Air traffic control clearances and procedures; 


(4) Flight by reference to instruments; 


(5) Navigation systems; 


(6) Instrument approach procedures; 


(7) Emergency operations; and 


(8) Postflight procedures. 


(d) *Aeronautical experience for the instrument-airplane rating.* A person who applies for an instrument-airplane rating must have logged:


(1) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, 50 hours of cross-country time as pilot in command, of which 10 hours must have been in an airplane; and


(2) Forty hours of actual or simulated instrument time in the areas of operation listed in paragraph (c) of this section, of which 15 hours must have been received from an authorized instructor who holds an instrument-airplane rating, and the instrument time includes:


(i) Three hours of instrument flight training from an authorized instructor in an airplane that is appropriate to the instrument-airplane rating within 2 calendar months before the date of the practical test; and


(ii) Instrument flight training on cross country flight procedures, including one cross country flight in an airplane with an authorized instructor, that is performed under instrument flight rules, when a flight plan has been filed with an air traffic control facility, and that involves—


(A) A flight of 250 nautical miles along airways or by directed routing from an air traffic control facility;


(B) An instrument approach at each airport; and


(C) Three different kinds of approaches with the use of navigation systems.


(e) *Aeronautical experience for the instrument-helicopter rating.* A person who applies for an instrument-helicopter rating must have logged:


(1) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, 50 hours of cross-country time as pilot in command, of which 10 hours must have been in a helicopter; and


(2) Forty hours of actual or simulated instrument time in the areas of operation listed under paragraph (c) of this section, of which 15 hours must have been with an authorized instructor who holds an instrument-helicopter rating, and the instrument time includes:


(i) Three hours of instrument flight training from an authorized instructor in a helicopter that is appropriate to the instrument-helicopter rating within 2 calendar months before the date of the practical test; and


(ii) Instrument flight training on cross country flight procedures, including one cross country flight in a helicopter with an authorized instructor that is performed under instrument flight rules and a flight plan has been filed with an air traffic control facility, and involves—


(A) A flight of 100 nautical miles along airways or by directed routing from an air traffic control facility;


(B) An instrument approach at each airport; and


(C) Three different kinds of approaches with the use of navigation systems.


(f) *Aeronautical experience for the instrument-powered-lift rating.* A person who applies for an instrument-powered-lift rating must have logged:


(1) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, 50 hours of cross-country time as pilot in command, of which 10 hours must have been in a powered-lift; and


(2) Forty hours of actual or simulated instrument time in the areas of operation listed under paragraph (c) of this section, of which 15 hours must have been received from an authorized instructor who holds an instrument-powered-lift rating, and the instrument time includes:


(i) Three hours of instrument flight training from an authorized instructor in a powered-lift that is appropriate to the instrument-powered-lift rating within 2 calendar months before the date of the practical test; and


(ii) Instrument flight training on cross country flight procedures, including one cross country flight in a powered-lift with an authorized instructor that is performed under instrument flight rules, when a flight plan has been filed with an air traffic control facility, that involves—


(A) A flight of 250 nautical miles along airways or by directed routing from an air traffic control facility;


(B) An instrument approach at each airport; and


(C) Three different kinds of approaches with the use of navigation systems.


(g) An applicant for a combined private pilot certificate with an instrument rating may satisfy the cross-country time requirements of this section by crediting:

(2) For an instrument-helicopter rating, up to 47 hours of cross-country time performing the duties of pilot in command with an authorized instructor.


(h) *Use of full flight simulators or flight training devices.* If the instrument time was provided by an authorized instructor in a full flight simulator or flight training device—


(1) A maximum of 30 hours may be performed in that full flight simulator or flight training device if the instrument time was completed in accordance with part 142 of this chapter; or


(2) A maximum of 20 hours may be performed in that full flight simulator or flight training device if the instrument time was not completed in accordance with part 142 of this chapter.
