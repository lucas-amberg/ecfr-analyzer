(g) *Aircraft not capable of instrument maneuvers and procedures.* An applicant may add a type rating to an airline transport pilot certificate with an aircraft that is not capable of the instrument maneuvers and procedures required on the practical test under the following circumstances—


(1) The rating is limited to “VFR only.”


(2) The type rating is added to an airline transport pilot certificate that has instrument privileges in that category and class of aircraft.


(3) The “VFR only” limitation may be removed for that aircraft type after the applicant:


(i) Passes a practical test in that type of aircraft on the appropriate instrument maneuvers and procedures in § 61.157; or
