# ยง 77.31   Determinations.

(a) The FAA will issue a determination stating whether the proposed construction or alteration would be a hazard to air navigation, and will advise all known interested persons.


(b) The FAA will make determinations based on the aeronautical study findings and will identify the following:


(1) The effects on VFR/IFR aeronautical departure/arrival operations, air traffic procedures, minimum flight altitudes, and existing, planned, or proposed airports listed in ยง 77.15(e) of which the FAA has received actual notice prior to issuance of a final determination.


(2) The extent of the physical and/or electromagnetic effect on the operation of existing or proposed air navigation facilities, communication aids, or surveillance systems.


(c) The FAA will issue a Determination of Hazard to Air Navigation when the aeronautical study concludes that the proposed construction or alteration will exceed an obstruction standard and would have a substantial aeronautical impact.


(d) A Determination of No Hazard to Air Navigation will be issued when the aeronautical study concludes that the proposed construction or alteration will exceed an obstruction standard but would not have a substantial aeronautical impact to air navigation. A Determination of No Hazard to Air Navigation may include the following:


(1) Conditional provisions of a determination.


(2) Limitations necessary to minimize potential problems, such as the use of temporary construction equipment.


(3) Supplemental notice requirements, when required.


(4) Marking and lighting recommendations, as appropriate.
