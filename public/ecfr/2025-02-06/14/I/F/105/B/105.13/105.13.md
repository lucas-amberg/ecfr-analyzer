# § 105.13   Radio equipment and use requirements.

(a) Except when otherwise authorized by air traffic control—


(1) No person may conduct a parachute operation, and no pilot in command of an aircraft may allow a parachute operation to be conducted from that aircraft, in or into controlled airspace unless, during that flight—


(i) The aircraft is equipped with a functioning two-way radio communication system appropriate to the air traffic control facilities being used; and


(ii) Radio communications have been established between the aircraft and the air traffic control facility having jurisdiction over the affected airspace of the first intended exit altitude at least 5 minutes before the parachute operation begins. The pilot in command must establish radio communications to receive information regarding air traffic activity in the vicinity of the parachute operation.


(2) The pilot in command of an aircraft used for any parachute operation in or into controlled airspace must, during each flight—


(i) Continuously monitor the appropriate frequency of the aircraft's radio communications system from the time radio communications are first established between the aircraft and air traffic control, until the pilot advises air traffic control that the parachute operation has ended for that flight.


(ii) Advise air traffic control when the last parachutist or object leaves the aircraft.


(b) Parachute operations must be aborted if, prior to receipt of a required air traffic control authorization, or during any parachute operation in or into controlled airspace, the required radio communications system is or becomes inoperative.
