(a) *Application for approval.* An applicant for approval of a Category II manual or an amendment to an approved Category II manual must submit the proposed manual or amendment to the responsible Flight Standards office. If the application requests an evaluation program, it must include the following: 


(1) The location of the aircraft and the place where the demonstrations are to be conducted; and


(2) The date the demonstrations are to commence (at least 10 days after filing the application). 


(b) *Contents.* Each Category II manual must contain: 


(1) The registration number, make, and model of the aircraft to which it applies; 


(2) A maintenance program as specified in section 4 of this appendix; and 


(3) The procedures and instructions related to recognition of decision height, use of runway visual range information, approach monitoring, the decision region (the region between the middle marker and the decision height), the maximum permissible deviations of the basic ILS indicator within the decision region, a missed approach, use of airborne low approach equipment, minimum altitude for the use of the autopilot, instrument and equipment failure warning systems, instrument failure, and other procedures, instructions, and limitations that may be found necessary by the Administrator. 


The instruments and equipment listed in this section must be installed in each aircraft operated in a Category II operation. This section does not require duplication of instruments and equipment required by § 91.205 or any other provisions of this chapter. 


(a) *Group I.* (1) Two localizer and glide slope receiving systems. Each system must provide a basic ILS display and each side of the instrument panel must have a basic ILS display. However, a single localizer antenna and a single glide slope antenna may be used. 


(2) A communications system that does not affect the operation of at least one of the ILS systems. 


(3) A marker beacon receiver that provides distinctive aural and visual indications of the outer and the middle markers. 


(4) Two gyroscopic pitch and bank indicating systems. 


(5) Two gyroscopic direction indicating systems. 


(6) Two airspeed indicators. 


(7) Two sensitive altimeters adjustable for barometric pressure, each having a placarded correction for altimeter scale error and for the wheel height of the aircraft. After June 26, 1979, two sensitive altimeters adjustable for barometric pressure, having markings at 20-foot intervals and each having a placarded correction for altimeter scale error and for the wheel height of the aircraft. 


(8) Two vertical speed indicators. 


(9) A flight control guidance system that consists of either an automatic approach coupler or a flight director system. A flight director system must display computed information as steering command in relation to an ILS localizer and, on the same instrument, either computed information as pitch command in relation to an ILS glide slope or basic ILS glide slope information. An automatic approach coupler must provide at least automatic steering in relation to an ILS localizer. The flight control guidance system may be operated from one of the receiving systems required by subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. 


(10) For Category II operations with decision heights below 150 feet either a marker beacon receiver providing aural and visual indications of the inner marker or a radio altimeter. 


(b) *Group II.* (1) Warning systems for immediate detection by the pilot of system faults in items (1), (4), (5), and (9) of Group I and, if installed for use in Category III operations, the radio altimeter and autothrottle system. 


(2) Dual controls. 


(3) An externally vented static pressure system with an alternate static pressure source. 


(4) A windshield wiper or equivalent means of providing adequate cockpit visibility for a safe visual transition by either pilot to touchdown and rollout. 


(5) A heat source for each airspeed system pitot tube installed or an equivalent means of preventing malfunctioning due to icing of the pitot system. 


(a) *General.* The instruments and equipment required by section 2 of this appendix must be approved as provided in this section before being used in Category II operations. Before presenting an aircraft for approval of the instruments and equipment, it must be shown that since the beginning of the 12th calendar month before the date of submission— 


(1) The ILS localizer and glide slope equipment were bench checked according to the manufacturer's instructions and found to meet those standards specified in RTCA Paper 23-63/DO-117 dated March 14, 1963, “Standard Adjustment Criteria for Airborne Localizer and Glide Slope Receivers,” which may be obtained from the RTCA Secretariat, 1425 K St., NW., Washington, DC 20005. 


(2) The altimeters and the static pressure systems were tested and inspected in accordance with appendix E to part 43 of this chapter; and 


(3) All other instruments and items of equipment specified in section 2(a) of this appendix that are listed in the proposed maintenance program were bench checked and found to meet the manufacturer's specifications. 


(b) *Flight control guidance system.* All components of the flight control guidance system must be approved as installed by the evaluation program specified in paragraph (e) of this section if they have not been approved for Category III operations under applicable type or supplemental type certification procedures. In addition, subsequent changes to make, model, or design of the components must be approved under this paragraph. Related systems or devices, such as the autothrottle and computed missed approach guidance system, must be approved in the same manner if they are to be used for Category II operations. 


(c) *Radio altimeter.* A radio altimeter must meet the performance criteria of this paragraph for original approval and after each subsequent alteration. 


(1) It must display to the flight crew clearly and positively the wheel height of the main landing gear above the terrain. 


(2) It must display wheel height above the terrain to an accuracy of plus or minus 5 feet or 5 percent, whichever is greater, under the following conditions: 


(i) Pitch angles of zero to plus or minus 5 degrees about the mean approach attitude. 


(ii) Roll angles of zero to 20 degrees in either direction. 


(iii) Forward velocities from minimum approach speed up to 200 knots. 


(iv) Sink rates from zero to 15 feet per second at altitudes from 100 to 200 feet. 


(3) Over level ground, it must track the actual altitude of the aircraft without significant lag or oscillation. 


(4) With the aircraft at an altitude of 200 feet or less, any abrupt change in terrain representing no more than 10 percent of the aircraft's altitude must not cause the altimeter to unlock, and indicator response to such changes must not exceed 0.1 seconds and, in addition, if the system unlocks for greater changes, it must reacquire the signal in less than 1 second. 


(5) Systems that contain a push-to-test feature must test the entire system (with or without an antenna) at a simulated altitude of less than 500 feet. 


(6) The system must provide to the flight crew a positive failure warning display any time there is a loss of power or an absence of ground return signals within the designed range of operating altitudes. 


(d) *Other instruments and equipment.* All other instruments and items of equipment required by § 2 of this appendix must be capable of performing as necessary for Category II operations. Approval is also required after each subsequent alteration to these instruments and items of equipment.

(iv) No unusual roughness or excessive attitude changes occur after leaving the middle marker; and 


(v) In the case of an aircraft equipped with an approach coupler, the aircraft is sufficiently in trim when the approach coupler is disconnected at the decision height to allow for the continuation of a normal approach and landing. 


(3) *Records.* During the evaluation program the following information must be maintained by the applicant for the aircraft with respect to each approach and made available to the Adninistrator upon request: 


(i) Each deficiency in airborne instruments and equipment that prevented the initiation of an approach. 


(ii) The reasons for discontinuing an approach, including the altitude above the runway at which it was discontinued. 


(iii) Speed control at the 100-foot decision height if auto throttles are used. 


(iv) Trim condition of the aircraft upon disconnecting the auto coupler with respect to continuation to flare and landing.
