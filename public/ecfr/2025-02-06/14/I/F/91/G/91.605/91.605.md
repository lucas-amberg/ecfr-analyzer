# § 91.605   Transport category civil airplane weight limitations.

(a) No person may take off any transport category airplane (other than a turbine-engine-powered airplane certificated after September 30, 1958) unless— 


(1) The takeoff weight does not exceed the authorized maximum takeoff weight for the elevation of the airport of takeoff; 


(2) The elevation of the airport of takeoff is within the altitude range for which maximum takeoff weights have been determined; 


(3) Normal consumption of fuel and oil in flight to the airport of intended landing will leave a weight on arrival not in excess of the authorized maximum landing weight for the elevation of that airport; and 


(4) The elevations of the airport of intended landing and of all specified alternate airports are within the altitude range for which the maximum landing weights have been determined. 


(b) No person may operate a turbine-engine-powered transport category airplane certificated after September 30, 1958, contrary to the Airplane Flight Manual, or take off that airplane unless— 


(1) The takeoff weight does not exceed the takeoff weight specified in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of the airport and for the ambient temperature existing at the time of takeoff; 


(2) Normal consumption of fuel and oil in flight to the airport of intended landing and to the alternate airports will leave a weight on arrival not in excess of the landing weight specified in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of each of the airports involved and for the ambient temperatures expected at the time of landing; 


(3) The takeoff weight does not exceed the weight shown in the Airplane Flight Manual to correspond with the minimum distances required for takeoff, considering the elevation of the airport, the runway to be used, the effective runway gradient, the ambient temperature and wind component at the time of takeoff, and, if operating limitations exist for the minimum distances required for takeoff from wet runways, the runway surface condition (dry or wet). Wet runway distances associated with grooved or porous friction course runways, if provided in the Airplane Flight Manual, may be used only for runways that are grooved or treated with a porous friction course (PFC) overlay, and that the operator determines are designed, constructed, and maintained in a manner acceptable to the Administrator.


(4) Where the takeoff distance includes a clearway, the clearway distance is not greater than one-half of—


(i) The takeoff run, in the case of airplanes certificated after September 30, 1958, and before August 30, 1959; or 


(ii) The runway length, in the case of airplanes certificated after August 29, 1959. 


(c) No person may take off a turbine-engine-powered transport category airplane certificated after August 29, 1959, unless, in addition to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section—


(1) The accelerate-stop distance is no greater than the length of the runway plus the length of the stopway (if present); and 


(2) The takeoff distance is no greater than the length of the runway plus the length of the clearway (if present); and 


(3) The takeoff run is no greater than the length of the runway.
