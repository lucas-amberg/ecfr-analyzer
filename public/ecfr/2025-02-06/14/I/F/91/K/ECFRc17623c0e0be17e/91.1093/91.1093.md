(2) The potential results of improper, untimely, or nonexecution of safety measures during a check; 


(3) Training and practice in conducting flight checks from the left and right pilot seats in the required normal, abnormal, and emergency procedures to ensure competence to conduct the pilot flight checks required by this subpart; and 


(4) The safety measures to be taken from either pilot seat for emergency situations that are likely to develop during checking. 


(f) The requirements of paragraph (e) of this section may be accomplished in full or in part in flight, in a flight simulator, or in a flight training device, as appropriate. 


(g) The initial and transition flight training for a check pilot (simulator) must include the following:
