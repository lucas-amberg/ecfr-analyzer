# ยง 91.1441   CAMP: Transfer of maintenance records.

When a U.S.-registered fractional ownership program aircraft maintained under a CAMP is removed from the list of program aircraft in the management specifications, the program manager must transfer to the purchaser, at the time of the sale, the following records of that aircraft, in plain language form or in coded form that provides for the preservation and retrieval of information in a manner acceptable to the Administrator: 


(a) The records specified in ยง 91.1439(a)(2). 


(b) The records specified in ยง 91.1439(a)(1) that are not included in the records covered by paragraph (a) of this section, except that the purchaser may allow the program manager to keep physical custody of such records. However, custody of records by the program manager does not relieve the purchaser of its responsibility under ยง 91.1439(c) to make the records available for inspection by the Administrator or any representative of the National Transportation Safety Board.
