# § 93.71   General operating procedures.

(a) Flight restrictions are in effect below 3,500 feet MSL in the airspace above Niagara Falls, New York, west of a line from latitude 43°06′33″ N., longitude 79°03′30″ W. (the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge) to latitude 43°04′47″ N., longitude 79°02′44″ W. (the Niagara River Inlet) to latitude 43°04′29″ N., longitude 79°03′30″ W. (the International Control Dam) to the United States/Canadian Border and thence along the border to the point of origin. 


(b) No flight is authorized below 3,500 feet MSL in the area described in paragraph (a) of this section, except for aircraft operations conducted directly to or from an airport/heliport within the area, aircraft operating on an ATC-approved IFR flight plan, aircraft operating the Scenic Falls Route pursuant to approval of Transport Canada, aircraft carrying law enforcement officials, or aircraft carrying properly accredited news representatives for which a flight plan has been filed with Buffalo NY (BUF) Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS).


(c) Check with Transport Canada for flight restrictions in Canadian airspace. Commercial air tour operations approved by Transport Canada will be conducting a north/south orbit of the Niagara Falls area below 3,500 feet MSL over the Niagara River. 


(d) The minimum altitude for VFR flight over the Scenic Falls area is 3,500 feet MSL. 


(e) Comply with the following procedures when conducting flight over the area described in paragraph (a) of this section: 


(1) Fly a clockwise pattern; 


(2) Do not proceed north of the Rainbow Bridge; 


(3) Prior to joining the pattern, broadcast flight intentions on frequency 122.05 Mhz, giving altitude and position, and monitor the frequency while in the pattern; 


(4) Use the Niagara Falls airport altimeter setting. Contact Niagara Falls Airport Traffic Control Tower to obtain the current altimeter setting, to facilitate the exchange of traffic advisories/restrictions, and to reduce the risk of midair collisions between aircraft operating in the vicinity of the Falls. If the Control Tower is closed, use the appropriate Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) Frequency; 


(5) Do not exceed 130 knots; 


(6) Anticipate heavy congestion of VFR traffic at or above 3,500 feet MSL; and 


(7) Use caution to avoid high-speed civil and military aircraft transiting the area to or from Niagara Falls Airport. 


(f) These procedures do not relieve pilots from the requirements of § 91.113 of this chapter to see and avoid other aircraft. 


(g) Flight following, to and from the area, is available through Buffalo Approach.
