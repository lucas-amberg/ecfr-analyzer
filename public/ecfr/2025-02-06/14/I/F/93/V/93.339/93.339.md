# § 93.339   Requirements for operating in the DC SFRA, including the DC FRZ.

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and in § 93.345, or unless authorized by Air Traffic Control, no pilot may operate an aircraft, including an ultralight vehicle or any civil aircraft or public aircraft, in the DC SFRA, including the DC FRZ, unless—


(1) The aircraft is equipped with an operable two-way radio capable of communicating with Air Traffic Control on appropriate radio frequencies;


(2) Before operating an aircraft in the DC SFRA, including the DC FRZ, the pilot establishes two-way radio communications with the appropriate Air Traffic Control facility and maintains such communications while operating the aircraft in the DC SFRA, including the DC FRZ;


(3) The aircraft is equipped with an operating automatic altitude reporting transponder;


(4) Before operating an aircraft in the DC SFRA, including the DC FRZ, the pilot obtains and transmits a discrete transponder code from Air Traffic Control, and the aircraft's transponder continues to transmit the assigned code while operating within the DC SFRA;


(5) For VFR operations, the pilot must file and activate a DC FRZ or DC SFRA flight plan by obtaining a discrete transponder code. The flight plan is closed upon landing at an airport within the DC SFRA or when the aircraft exits the DC SFRA;


(6) Before operating the aircraft into, out of, or through the Washington, DC Tri-Area Class B Airspace Area, the pilot receives a specific Air Traffic Control clearance to operate in the Class B airspace area; and


(7) Before operating the aircraft into, out of, or through Class D airspace area that is within the DC SFRA, the pilot complies with § 91.129 of this chapter.


(b) Paragraph (a)(5) of this section does not apply to operators of Department of Defense aircraft, law enforcement operations, or lifeguard or air ambulance operations under an FAA/TSA airspace authorization, if the flight crew is in contact with Air Traffic Control and is transmitting an Air Traffic Control-assigned discrete transponder code.


(c) When operating an aircraft in the VFR traffic pattern at an airport within the DC SFRA (but not within the DC FRZ) that does not have an airport traffic control tower, a pilot must—


(1) File a DC SFRA flight plan for traffic pattern work;


(2) Communicate traffic pattern position via the published Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF);


(3) Monitor VHF frequency 121.5 or UHF frequency 243.0, if the aircraft is suitably equipped;


(4) Obtain and transmit the Air Traffic Control-assigned discrete transponder code; and


(5) When exiting the VFR traffic pattern, comply with paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section.


(d) When operating an aircraft in the VFR traffic pattern at an airport within the DC SFRA (but not within the DC FRZ) that has an operating airport traffic control tower, a pilot must—


(1) Before departure or before entering the traffic pattern, request to remain in the traffic pattern;


(2) Remain in two-way radio communications with the tower. If the aircraft is suitably equipped, the pilot must also monitor VHF frequency 121.5 or UHF frequency 243.0;


(3) Continuously operate the aircraft transponder on code 1234 unless Air Traffic Control assigns a different code; and


(4) Before exiting the traffic pattern, comply with paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section.


(e) Pilots must transmit the assigned transponder code. No pilot may use transponder code 1200 while in the DC SFRA.
