# Appendix H to Part 121—Advanced Simulation






This appendix prescribes criteria for use of Level B or higher FFSs to satisfy the inflight requirements of Appendices E and F of this part and the requirements of § 121.439. The criteria in this appendix are in addition to the FFS approval requirements in § 121.407. Each FFS used under this appendix must be approved as a Level B, C, or D FFS, as appropriate.


For a certificate holder to conduct Level C or D training under this appendix, all required FFS instruction and checks must be conducted under an advanced simulation training program approved by the Administrator for the certificate holder. This program must also ensure that all instructors, check pilots, and check flight engineers used in Appendix H training and checking are highly qualified to provide the training required in the training program. The advanced simulation training program must include the following:


1. The certificate holder's initial, transition, conversion, upgrade, and recurrent FFS training programs and its procedures for re-establishing recency of experience in the FFS.


2. How the training program will integrate Level B, C, and D FFSs with other FSTDs to maximize the total training, checking, and certification functions.


3. Documentation that each instructor and check pilot has served for at least 1 year in that capacity in a certificate holder's approved program or has served for at least 1 year as a pilot in command or second in command in an airplane of the group in which that pilot is instructing or checking.


4. A procedure to ensure that each instructor, check pilot, and check flight engineer-actively participates in either an approved regularly scheduled line flying program as a flightcrew member or an approved line observation program in the same airplane type for which that person is instructing or checking.


5. A procedure to ensure that each instructor, check pilot, and check flight engineer-is given a minimum of 4 hours of training each year to become familiar with the certificate holder's advanced simulation training program, or changes to it, and to emphasize their respective roles in the program. Training for instructors, check pilots, and check flight engineers must include training policies and procedures, instruction methods and techniques, operation of FFS controls (including environmental and trouble panels), limitations of the FFS, and minimum equipment required for each course of training.


6. A special Line-Oriented Flight Training (LOFT) program to facilitate the transition from the FFS to line flying. This LOFT program must consist of at least a 4-hour course of training for each flightcrew. It also must contain at least two representative flight segments of the certificate holder's operations. One of the flight segments must contain strictly normal operating procedures from pushback at one airport to arrival at another. Another flight segment must contain training in appropriate abnormal and emergency flight operations. The LOFT must provide an opportunity for the pilot to demonstrate workload management and pilot monitoring skills.


a. Recent experience (§ 121.439).


b. Training in night takeoffs and landings (Appendix E of this part).


c. Except for EFVS operations, landings in a proficiency check (Appendix F of this part).


a. Recent experience (§ 121.439).


b. All pilot flight training and checking required by this part except the following:


i. The operating experience, operating cycles, and consolidation of knowledge and skills requirements of § 121.434;


ii. The line check required by § 121.440; and


iii. The visual inspection of the exterior and interior of the airplane required by appendices E and F.


c. The practical test requirements of § 61.153(h) of this chapter, except the visual inspection of the exterior and interior of the airplane.
