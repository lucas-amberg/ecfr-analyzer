# § 121.323   Instruments and equipment for operations at night.

No person may operate an airplane at night under this part unless it is equipped with the following instruments and equipment in addition to those required by §§ 121.305 through 121.321 and 121.803:


(a) Position lights. 


(b) An anti-collision light. 


(c) Two landing lights, except that only one landing light is required for nontransport category airplanes type certificated after December 31, 1964. 


(d) Instrument lights providing enough light to make each required instrument, switch, or similar instrument, easily readable and installed so that the direct rays are shielded from the flight crewmembers' eyes and that no objectionable reflections are visible to them. There must be a means of controlling the intensity of illumination unless it is shown that nondimming instrument lights are satisfactory. 


(e) An airspeed-indicating system with heated pitot tube or equivalent means for preventing malfunctioning due to icing. 


(f) A sensitive altimeter.
