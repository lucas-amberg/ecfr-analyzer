# § 121.374   Continuous airworthiness maintenance program (CAMP) for two-engine ETOPS.

In order to conduct an ETOPS flight using a two-engine airplane, each certificate holder must develop and comply with the ETOPS continuous airworthiness maintenance program, as authorized in the certificate holder's operations specifications, for each airplane-engine combination used in ETOPS. The certificate holder must develop this ETOPS CAMP by supplementing the manufacturer's maintenance program or the CAMP currently approved for the certificate holder. This ETOPS CAMP must include the following elements:


(a) *ETOPS maintenance document.* The certificate holder must have an ETOPS maintenance document for use by each person involved in ETOPS.


(1) The document must—


(i) List each ETOPS significant system,


(ii) Refer to or include all of the ETOPS maintenance elements in this section,


(iii) Refer to or include all supportive programs and procedures,


(iv) Refer to or include all duties and responsibilities, and


(v) Clearly state where referenced material is located in the certificate holder's document system.


(b) *ETOPS pre-departure service check.* Except as provided in Appendix P of this part, the certificate holder must develop a pre-departure check tailored to their specific operation.


(1) The certificate holder must complete a pre-departure service check immediately before each ETOPS flight.


(2) At a minimum, this check must—


(i) Verify the condition of all ETOPS Significant Systems;


(ii) Verify the overall status of the airplane by reviewing applicable maintenance records; and


(iii) Include an interior and exterior inspection to include a determination of engine and APU oil levels and consumption rates.


(3) An appropriately trained maintenance person, who is ETOPS qualified, must accomplish and certify by signature ETOPS specific tasks. Before an ETOPS flight may commence, an ETOPS pre-departure service check (PDSC) Signatory Person, who has been authorized by the certificate holder, must certify by signature, that the ETOPS PDSC has been completed.


(4) For the purposes of this paragraph (b) only, the following definitions apply:


(i) ETOPS qualified person: A person is ETOPS qualified when that person satisfactorily completes the operator's ETOPS training program and is authorized by the certificate holder.


(ii) ETOPS PDSC Signatory Person: A person is an ETOPS PDSC Signatory Person when that person is ETOPS qualified and that person:


(A) When certifying the completion of the ETOPS PDSC in the United States:


(*1*) Works for an operator authorized to engage in part 121 operation or works for a part 145 repair station; and


(*2*) Holds a U.S. Mechanic's Certificate with airframe and powerplant ratings.


(B) When certifying the completion of the ETOPS PDSC outside of the U.S. holds a certificate in accordance with § 43.17(c)(1) of this chapter; or


(C) When certifying the completion of the ETOPS PDSC outside the U.S. holds the certificates needed or has the requisite experience or training to return aircraft to service on behalf of an ETOPS maintenance entity.


(iii) ETOPS maintenance entity: An entity authorized to perform ETOPS maintenance and complete ETOPS PDSC and that entity is:


(A) Certificated to engage in part 121 operations;


(B) Repair station certificated under part 145 of this chapter; or


(C) Entity authorized pursuant to § 43.17(c)(2) of this chapter.


(c) *Limitations on dual maintenance.* (1) Except as specified in paragraph (c)(2), the certificate holder may not perform scheduled or unscheduled dual maintenance during the same maintenance visit on the same or a substantially similar ETOPS Significant System listed in the ETOPS maintenance document, if the improper maintenance could result in the failure of an ETOPS Significant System.


(2) In the event dual maintenance as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section cannot be avoided, the certificate holder may perform maintenance provided:


(i) The maintenance action on each affected ETOPS Significant System is performed by a different technician, or


(ii) The maintenance action on each affected ETOPS Significant System is performed by the same technician under the direct supervision of a second qualified individual; and


(iii) For either paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, a qualified individual conducts a ground verification test and any in-flight verification test required under the program developed pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.


(d) *Verification program.* The certificate holder must develop and maintain a program for the resolution of discrepancies that will ensure the effectiveness of maintenance actions taken on ETOPS Significant Systems. The verification program must identify potential problems and verify satisfactory corrective action. The verification program must include ground verification and in-flight verification policy and procedures. The certificate holder must establish procedures to indicate clearly who is going to initiate the verification action and what action is necessary. The verification action may be performed on an ETOPS revenue flight provided the verification action is documented as satisfactorily completed upon reaching the ETOPS Entry Point.


(e) *Task identification.* The certificate holder must identify all ETOPS-specific tasks. An appropriately trained mechanic who is ETOPS qualified must accomplish and certify by signature that the ETOPS-specific task has been completed.


(f) *Centralized maintenance control procedures.* The certificate holder must develop and maintain procedures for centralized maintenance control for ETOPS.


(g) *Parts control program.* The certificate holder must develop an ETOPS parts control program to ensure the proper identification of parts used to maintain the configuration of airplanes used in ETOPS.


(h) *Reliability program.* The certificate holder must have an ETOPS reliability program. This program must be the certificate holder's existing reliability program or its Continuing Analysis and Surveillance System (CASS) supplemented for ETOPS. This program must be event-oriented and include procedures to report the events listed below, as follows:


(1) The certificate holder must report the following events within 96 hours of the occurrence to its responsible Flight Standards office:


(i) IFSDs, except planned IFSDs performed for flight training.


(ii) Diversions and turnbacks for failures, malfunctions, or defects associated with any airplane or engine system.


(iii) Uncommanded power or thrust changes or surges.


(iv) Inability to control the engine or obtain desired power or thrust.


(v) Inadvertent fuel loss or unavailability, or uncorrectable fuel imbalance in flight.


(vi) Failures, malfunctions or defects associated with ETOPS Significant Systems.


(vii) Any event that would jeopardize the safe flight and landing of the airplane on an ETOPS flight.


(2) The certificate holder must investigate the cause of each event listed in paragraph (h)(1) of this section and submit findings and a description of corrective action to its responsible Flight Standards office. The report must include the information specified in § 121.703(e). The corrective action must be acceptable to its responsible Flight Standards office.


(i) *Propulsion system monitoring.* (1) If the IFSD rate (computed on a 12-month rolling average) for an engine installed as part of an airplane-engine combination exceeds the following values, the certificate holder must do a comprehensive review of its operations to identify any common cause effects and systemic errors. The IFSD rate must be computed using all engines of that type in the certificate holder's entire fleet of airplanes approved for ETOPS.


(i) A rate of 0.05 per 1,000 engine hours for ETOPS up to and including 120 minutes.


(ii) A rate of 0.03 per 1,000 engine hours for ETOPS beyond 120-minutes up to and including 207 minutes in the North Pacific Area of Operation and up to and including 180 minutes elsewhere.


(iii) A rate of 0.02 per 1,000 engine hours for ETOPS beyond 207 minutes in the North Pacific Area of Operation and beyond 180 minutes elsewhere.


(2) Within 30 days of exceeding the rates above, the certificate holder must submit a report of investigation and any necessary corrective action taken to its responsible Flight Standards office.


(j) *Engine condition monitoring.* (1) The certificate holder must have an engine condition monitoring program to detect deterioration at an early stage and to allow for corrective action before safe operation is affected.


(2) This program must describe the parameters to be monitored, the method of data collection, the method of analyzing data, and the process for taking corrective action.


(3) The program must ensure that engine-limit margins are maintained so that a prolonged engine-inoperative diversion may be conducted at approved power levels and in all expected environmental conditions without exceeding approved engine limits. This includes approved limits for items such as rotor speeds and exhaust gas temperatures.


(k) *Oil-consumption monitoring.* The certificate holder must have an engine oil consumption monitoring program to ensure that there is enough oil to complete each ETOPS flight. APU oil consumption must be included if an APU is required for ETOPS. The operator's oil consumption limit may not exceed the manufacturer's recommendation. Monitoring must be continuous and include oil added at each ETOPS departure point. The program must compare the amount of oil added at each ETOPS departure point with the running average consumption to identify sudden increases.


(l) *APU in-flight start program.* If the airplane type certificate requires an APU but does not require the APU to run during the ETOPS portion of the flight, the certificate holder must develop and maintain a program acceptable to the FAA for cold soak in-flight start-and-run reliability.


(m) *Maintenance training.* For each airplane-engine combination, the certificate holder must develop a maintenance training program that provides training adequate to support ETOPS. It must include ETOPS specific training for all persons involved in ETOPS maintenance that focuses on the special nature of ETOPS. This training must be in addition to the operator's maintenance training program used to qualify individuals to perform work on specific airplanes and engines.


(n) *Configuration, maintenance, and procedures (CMP) document.* If an airplane-engine combination has a CMP document, the certificate holder must use a system that ensures compliance with the applicable FAA-approved document.


(o) *Procedural changes.* Each substantial change to the maintenance or training procedures that were used to qualify the certificate holder for ETOPS, must be submitted to the CHDO for review. The certificate holder cannot implement a change until its responsible Flight Standards office notifies the certificate holder that the review is complete.
