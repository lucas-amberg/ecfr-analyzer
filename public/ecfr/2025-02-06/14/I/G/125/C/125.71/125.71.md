(c) The manual must not be contrary to any applicable Federal regulations, foreign regulation applicable to the certificate holder's operations in foreign countries, or the certificate holder's operating certificate or operations specifications. 


(d) A copy of the manual, or appropriate portions of the manual (and changes and additions) shall be made available to maintenance and ground operations personnel by the certificate holder and furnished to—


(1) Its flight crewmembers; and 


(2) The responsible Flight Standards office charged with the overall inspection of its operations. 


(e) Each employee of the certificate holder to whom a manual or appropriate portions of it are furnished under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall keep it up to date with the changes and additions furnished to them. 




(f) The information and instructions contained in the manual must be displayed clearly and be retrievable in the English language.
