# § 125.213   Miscellaneous equipment.

No person may conduct any operation unless the following equipment is installed in the airplane:


(a) If protective fuses are installed on an airplane, the number of spare fuses approved for the airplane and appropriately described in the certificate holder's manual.


(b) A windshield wiper or equivalent for each pilot station.


(c) A power supply and distribution system that meets the requirements of §§ 25.1309, 25.1331, 25.1351 (a) and (b) (1) through (4), 25.1353, 25.1355, and 25.1431(b) or that is able to produce and distribute the load for the required instruments and equipment, with use of an external power supply if any one power source or component of the power distribution system fails. The use of common elements in the system may be approved if the Administrator finds that they are designed to be reasonably protected against malfunctioning. Engine-driven sources of energy, when used, must be on separate engines.


(d) A means for indicating the adequacy of the power being supplied to required flight instruments.


(e) Two independent static pressure systems, vented to the outside atmospheric pressure so that they will be least affected by air flow variation or moisture or other foreign matter, and installed so as to be airtight except for the vent. When a means is provided for transferring an instrument from its primary operating system to an alternative system, the means must include a positive positioning control and must be marked to indicate clearly which system is being used. 


(f) A placard on each door that is the means of access to a required passenger emergency exit to indicate that it must be open during takeoff and landing. 


(g) A means for the crew, in an emergency, to unlock each door that leads to a compartment that is normally accessible to passengers and that can be locked by passengers.
