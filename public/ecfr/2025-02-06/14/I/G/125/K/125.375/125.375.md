# § 125.375   Fuel supply: Nonturbine and turbopropeller-powered airplanes.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no person may release for flight or take off a nonturbine or turbopropeller-powered airplane unless, considering the wind and other weather conditions expected, it has enough fuel—


(1) To fly to and land at the airport to which it is released; 


(2) Thereafter, to fly to and land at the most distant alternate airport specified in the flight release; and 


(3) Thereafter, to fly for 45 minutes at normal crusing fuel consumption. 


(b) If the airplane is released for any flight other than from one point in the conterminous United States to another point in the conterminous United States, it must carry enough fuel to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section and thereafter fly for 30 minutes plus 15 percent of the total time required to fly at normal cruising fuel consumption to the airports specified in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section, or fly for 90 minutes at normal cruising fuel consumption, whichever is less. 


(c) No person may release a nonturbine or turbopropeller-powered airplane to an airport for which an alternate is not specified under § 125.367(b) unless it has enough fuel, considering wind and other weather conditions expected, to fly to that airport and thereafter to fly for 3 hours at normal cruising fuel consumption.
