(c) Unless otherwise prescribed in this appendix, the applicant must select the take-off, en route, and landing configurations for the airplane. 


(d) The airplane configuration may vary with weight, altitude, and temperature, to the extent they are compatible with the operating procedures required by paragraph (e) of this section. 


(e) Unless otherwise prescribed in this appendix, in determining the critical engine inoperative takeoff performance, the accelerate-stop distance, takeoff distance, changes in the airplane's configuration, speed, power, and thrust must be made under procedures established by the applicant for operation in service. 


(f) Procedures for the execution of balked landings must be established by the applicant and included in the Airplane Flight Manual. 


(g) The procedures established under paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section must—


(1) Be able to be consistently executed in service by a crew of average skill; 


(2) Use methods or devices that are safe and reliable; and 


(3) Include allowance for any time delays, in the execution of the procedures, that may reasonably be expected in service. 


5. *Takeoff.* (a) *General.* Takeoff speeds, the accelerate-stop distance, the takeoff distance, and the one-engine-inoperative takeoff flight path data (described in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (f) of this section), must be determined for—


(1) Each weight, altitude, and ambient temperature within the operational limits selected by the applicant; 


(2) The selected configuration for takeoff; 


(3) The center of gravity in the most unfavorable position; 


(4) The operating engine within approved operating limitations; and 


(5) Takeoff data based on smooth, dry, hard-surface runway. 


(b) *Takeoff speeds.* (1) The decision speed *V*_1_ is the calibrated airspeed on the ground at which, as a result of engine failure or other reasons, the pilot is assumed to have made a decision to continue or discontinue the takeoff. The speed *V*_1_ must be selected by the applicant but may not be less than—


(i) 1.10*V*_S__1_; 


(ii) 1.10*V*_MC_; 


(iii) A speed that allows acceleration to *V*_1_ and stop under paragraph (c) of this section; or 


(iv) A speed at which the airplane can be rotated for takeoff and shown to be adequate to safely continue the takeoff, using normal piloting skill, when the critical engine is suddenly made inoperative. 


(2) The initial climb out speed *V*_2_, in terms of calibrated airspeed, must be selected by the applicant so as to allow the gradient of climb required in section 6(b)(2), but it must not be less than *V*_1_ or less than 1.2*V*_S__1_. 


(3) Other essential take off speeds necessary for safe operation of the airplane. 


(c) *Accelerate-stop distance.* (1) The accelerate-stop distance is the sum of the distances necessary to—


(i) Accelerate the airplane from a standing start to *V*_1_; and 


(ii) Come to a full stop from the point at which *V*_1_ is reached assuming that in the case of engine failure, failure of the critical engine is recognized by the pilot at the speed *V*_1_. 


(2) Means other than wheel brakes may be used to determine the accelerate-stop distance if that means is available with the critical engine inoperative and—


(i) Is safe and reliable; 


(ii) Is used so that consistent results can be expected under normal operating conditions; and 


(iii) Is such that exceptional skill is not required to control the airplane.

(f) *One-engine-inoperative takeoff flight path data.* The one-engine-inoperative takeoff flight path data consist of takeoff flight paths extending from a standing start to a point in the takeoff at which the airplane reaches a height 1,000 feet above the takeoff surface under paragraph (e) of this section. 


6. *Climb.* (a) *Landing climb: All-engines-operating.* The maximum weight must be determined with the airplane in the landing configuration, for each altitude, and ambient temperature within the operational limits established for the airplane, with the most unfavorable center of gravity, and out-of-ground effect in free air, at which the steady gradient of climb will not be less than 3.3 percent, with:

7. *Landing.* (a) The landing field length described in paragraph (b) of this section must be determined for standard atmosphere at each weight and altitude within the operational limits established by the applicant. 


(b) The landing field length is equal to the landing distance determined under FAR 23.75(a) divided by a factor of 0.6 for the destination airport and 0.7 for the alternate airport. Instead of the gliding approach specified in FAR 23.75(a)(1), the landing may be preceded by a steady approach down to the 50-foot height at a gradient of descent not greater than 5.2 percent (3°) at a calibrated airspeed not less than 1.3*V*_S__1_.

9. *Static longitudinal stability.* (a) In showing compliance with FAR 23.175(b) and with paragraph (b) of this section, the airspeed must return to within ±7
1/2 percent of the trim speed. 


(b) *Cruise stability.* The stick force curve must have a stable slope for a speed range of ±50 knots from the trim speed except that the speeds need not exceed *V*_FC_/*M*_FC_ or be less than 1.4*V*_S__1_. This speed range will be considered to begin at the outer extremes of the friction band and the stick force may not exceed 50 pounds with—


(1) Landing gear retracted; 


(2) Wing flaps retracted; 


(3) The maximum cruising power as selected by the applicant as an operating limitation for turbine engines or 75 percent of maximum continuous power for reciprocating engines except that the power need not exceed that required at *V*_MO_/*M*_MO_;

(c) *Climb stability (turbopropeller powered airplanes only).* In showing compliance with FAR 23.175(a), an applicant must, instead of the power specified in FAR 23.175(a)(4), use the maximum power or thrust selected by the applicant as an operating limitation for use during climb at the best rate of climb speed, except that the speed need not be less than 1.4*V*_S__1_. 


10. *Stall warning.* If artificial stall warning is required to comply with FAR 23.207, the warning device must give clearly distinguishable indications under expected conditions of flight. The use of a visual warning device that requires the attention of the crew within the cockpit is not acceptable by itself. 


11. *Electric trim tabs.* The airplane must meet FAR 23.677 and in addition it must be shown that the airplane is safely controllable and that a pilot can perform all the maneuvers and operations necessary to effect a safe landing following any probable electric trim tab runaway which might be reasonably expected in service allowing for appropriate time delay after pilot recognition of the runaway. This demonstration must be conducted at the critical airplane weights and center of gravity positions. 


12. *Arrangement and visibility.* Each instrument must meet FAR 23.1321 and in addition:

(b) The airspeed indicating system must be calibrated to determine the system error, i.e., the relation between IAS and CAS, in flight and during the accelerate-takeoff ground run. The ground run calibration must be obtained between 0.8 of the minimum value of *V*_1_ and 1.2 times the maximum value of *V*_1_, considering the approved ranges of altitude and weight. The ground run calibration is determined assuming an engine failure at the minimum value of *V*_1_. 


(c) The airspeed error of the installation excluding the instrument calibration error, must not exceed 3 percent or 5 knots whichever is greater, throughout the speed range from *V*_MO_ to 1.3*V*_S__1_ with flaps retracted and from 1.3*V*_SO_ to *V*_FE_ with flaps in the landing position.

(a) The maximum operating limit speed must not exceed the design cruising speed *V*_C_ and must be sufficiently below *V*_D_/*M*_D_ or *V*_DF_/*M*_DF_ to make it highly improbable that the latter speeds will be inadvertently exceeded in flight. 


(b) The speed *V*_MO_ must not exceed 0.8*V*_D_/*M*_D_ or 0.8*V*_DF_/*M*_DF_ unless flight demonstrations involving upsets as specified by the Administrator indicates a lower speed margin will not result in speeds exceeding *V*_D_/*M*_D_ or *V*_DF._ Atmospheric variations, horizontal gusts, system and equipment errors, and airframe production variations are taken into account.

This weight may not exceed the weight at which the landing field length determined under section 7(b) is equal to the available runway length. In showing compliance with this operating limitation, it is acceptable to assume that the landing weight at the destination will be equal to the takeoff weight reduced by the normal consumption of fuel and oil en route. 


20. *Performance information.* The Airplane Flight Manual must contain the performance information determined under the performance requirements of this appendix. The information must include the following: 


(a) Sufficient information so that the takeoff weight limits specified in section 19(b) can be determined for all temperatures and altitudes within the operation limitations selected by the applicant. 


(b) The conditions under which the performance information was obtained, including the airspeed at the 50-foot height used to determine landing distances.

(2) At speeds between *V*_mo_ and *V*_c,_ the loads resulting from the disconnection of the engine compressor from the turbine or from loss of the turbine blades are considered to be ultimate loads. 


(3) The time history of the thrust decay and drag buildup occurring as a result of the prescribed engine failures must be substantiated by test or other data applicable to the particular engine-propeller combination. 


(4) The timing and magnitude of the probable pilot corrective action must be conserv- atively estimated, considering the characteristics of the particular engine-propeller-airplane combination. 


(b) Pilot corrective action may be assumed to be initiated at the time maximum yawing velocity is reached, but not earlier than 2 seconds after the engine failure. The magnitude of the corrective action may be based on the control forces in FAR 23.397 except that lower forces may be assumed where it is shown by analysis or test that these forces can control the yaw and roll resulting from the prescribed engine failure conditions.

37. *In flight restarting of engine.* If the engine on turbopropeller powered airplanes cannot be restarted at the maximum cruise altitude, a determination must be made of the altitude below which restarts can be consistently accomplished. Restart information must be provided in the Airplane Flight Manual. 


38. *Engines.* (a) *For turbopropeller powered airplanes.* The engine installation must comply with the following: 


(1) *Engine isolation.* The powerplants must be arranged and isolated from each other to allow operation, in at least one configuration, so that the failure or malfunction of any engine, or of any system that can affect the engine, will not—


(i) Prevent the continued safe operation of the remaining engines; or 


(ii) Require immediate action by any crewmember for continued safe operation. 


(2) *Control of engine rotation.* There must be a means to individually stop and restart the rotation of any engine in flight except that engine rotation need not be stopped if continued rotation could not jeopardize the safety of the airplane. Each component of the stopping and restarting system on the engine side of the firewall, and that might be exposed to fire, must be at least fire resistant. If hydraulic propeller feathering systems are used for this purpose, the feathering lines must be at least fire resistant under the operating conditions that may be expected to exist during feathering.

39. *Turbopropeller reversing systems.* (a) Turbopropeller reversing systems intended for ground operation must be designed so that no single failure or malfunction of the system will result in unwanted reverse thrust under any expected operating condition. Failure of structural elements need not be considered if the probability of this kind of failure is extremely remote. 


(b) Turbopropeller reversing systems intended for in flight use must be designed so that no unsafe condition will result during normal operation of the system, or from any failure (or reasonably likely combination of failures) of the reversing system, under any anticipated condition of operation of the airplane. Failure of structural elements need not be considered if the probability of this kind of failure is extremely remote. 


(c) Compliance with this section may be shown by failure analysis, testing, or both for propeller systems that allow propeller blades to move from the flight low-pitch position to a position that is substantially less than that at the normal flight low-pitch stop position. The analysis may include or be supported by the analysis made to show compliance with the type certification of the propeller and associated installation components. Credit will be given for pertinent analysis and testing completed by the engine and propeller manufacturers. 


40. *Turbopropeller drag-limiting systems.* Turbopropeller drag-limiting systems must be designed so that no single failure or malfunction of any of the systems during normal or emergency operation results in propeller drag in excess of that for which the airplane was designed. Failure of structural elements of the drag-limiting systems need not be considered if the probability of this kind of failure is extremely remote. 


41. *Turbine engine powerplant operating characteristics.* For turbopropeller powered airplanes, the turbine engine powerplant operating characteristics must be investigated in flight to determine that no adverse characteristics (such as stall, surge, or flameout) are present to a hazardous degree, during normal and emergency operation within the range of operating limitations of the airplane and of the engine. 


42. *Fuel flow.* (a) For turbopropeller powered airplanes—


(1) The fuel system must provide for continuous supply of fuel to the engines for normal operation without interruption due to depletion of fuel in any tank other than the main tank; and

(2) Accessible for drainage and cleaning and, for the strainer screen, easily removable; and 


(3) Mounted so that its weight is not supported by the connecting lines or by the inlet or outlet connections of the strainer or filter itself. 


(b) Unless there are means in the fuel system to prevent the accumulation of ice on the filter, there must be means to automatically maintain the fuel-flow if ice-clogging of the filter occurs; and 


(c) The fuel strainer or filter must be of adequate capacity (for operating limitations established to ensure proper service) and of appropriate mesh to insure proper engine operation, with the fuel contaminated to a degree (for particle size and density) that can be reasonably expected in service. The degree of fuel filtering may not be less than that established for the engine type certification.

For the cooling tests a temperature is “stabilized” when its rate of change is less than 2 °F. per minute. 


(b) Temperatures must be stabilized under the conditions from which entry is made into each stage of flight being investigated unless the entry condition is not one during which component and engine fluid temperatures would stabilize, in which case, operation through the full entry condition must be conducted before entry into the stage of flight being investigated to allow temperatures to reach their natural levels at the time of entry. The takeoff cooling test must be preceded by a period during which the powerplant component and engine fluid temperatures are stabilized with the engines at ground idle. 


(c) Cooling tests for each stage of flight must be continued until—


(1) The component and engine fluid temperatures stabilize; 


(2) The stage of flight is completed; or

50. *Exhaust system drains.* Turbopropeller engine exhaust systems having low spots or pockets must incorporate drains at those locations. These drains must discharge clear of the airplane in normal and ground attitudes to prevent the accumulation of fuel after the failure of an attempted engine start. 


51. *Engine controls.* If throttles or power levers for turbopropeller powered airplanes are such that any position of these controls will reduce the fuel flow to the engine(s) below that necessary for satisfactory and safe idle operation of the engine while the airplane is in flight, a means must be provided to prevent inadvertent movement of the control into this position. The means provided must incorporate a positive lock or stop at this idle position and must require a separate and distinct operation by the crew to displace the control from the normal engine operating range. 


52. *Reverse thrust controls.* For turbopropeller powered airplanes, the propeller reverse thrust controls must have a means to prevent their inadvertent operation. The means must have a positive lock or stop at the idle position and must require a separate and distinct operation by the crew to displace the control from the flight regime.
