This briefing shall include a statement that the Federal Aviation Regulations require passenger compliance with the lighted passenger information signs (if such signs are required), posted placards, areas designated for safety purposes as no smoking areas, and crewmember instructions with regard to these items. The briefing shall also include a statement (if the aircraft is equipped with a lavatory) that Federal law prohibits: tampering with, disabling, or destroying any smoke detector installed in an aircraft lavatory; smoking in lavatories; and, when applicable, smoking in passenger compartments.


(2) The use of safety belts, including instructions on how to fasten and unfasten the safety belts. Each passenger shall be briefed on when, where, and under what conditions the safety belt must be fastened about that passenger. This briefing shall include a statement that the Federal Aviation Regulations require passenger compliance with lighted passenger information signs and crewmember instructions concerning the use of safety belts.


(3) The placement of seat backs in an upright position before takeoff and landing; 


(4) Location and means for opening the passenger entry door and emergency exits; 


(5) Location of survival equipment; 


(6) If the flight involves extended overwater operation, ditching procedures and the use of required flotation equipment; 


(7) If the flight involves operations above 12,000 feet MSL, the normal and emergency use of oxygen; and

(b) Before each takeoff the pilot in command shall ensure that each person who may need the assistance of another person to move expeditiously to an exit if an emergency occurs and that person's attendant, if any, has received a briefing as to the procedures to be followed if an evacuation occurs. This paragraph does not apply to a person who has been given a briefing before a previous leg of a flight in the same aircraft.

(1) Be appropriate for the aircraft on which they are to be used;


(2) Contain a diagram of, and method of operating, the emergency exits;


(3) Contain other instructions necessary for the use of emergency equipment on board the aircraft; and


(4) No later than June 12, 2005, for scheduled Commuter passenger-carrying flights, include the sentence, “Final assembly of this aircraft was completed in [INSERT NAME OF COUNTRY].”


(f) The briefing required by paragraph (a) may be delivered by means of an approved recording playback device that is audible to each passenger under normal noise levels.


(g) If any passengers on board a flight conducted under this part are secured with a supplemental restraint system, the pilot in command of that flight must ensure those passengers are briefed in accordance with § 91.108(g) of this chapter.
