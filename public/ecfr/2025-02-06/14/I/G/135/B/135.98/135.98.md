# § 135.98   Operations in the North Polar Area.

After August 13, 2008, no certificate holder may operate an aircraft in the region north of 78° N latitude (“North Polar Area”), other than intrastate operations wholly within the state of Alaska, unless authorized by the FAA. The certificate holder's operation specifications must include the following:


(a) The designation of airports that may be used for en-route diversions and the requirements the airports must meet at the time of diversion.


(b) Except for all-cargo operations, a recovery plan for passengers at designated diversion airports.


(c) A fuel-freeze strategy and procedures for monitoring fuel freezing for operations in the North Polar Area.


(d) A plan to ensure communication capability for operations in the North Polar Area.


(e) An MEL for operations in the North Polar Area.


(f) A training plan for operations in the North Polar Area.


(g) A plan for mitigating crew exposure to radiation during solar flare activity.


(h) A plan for providing at least two cold weather anti-exposure suits in the aircraft, to protect crewmembers during outside activity at a diversion airport with extreme climatic conditions. The FAA may relieve the certificate holder from this requirement if the season of the year makes the equipment unnecessary.
