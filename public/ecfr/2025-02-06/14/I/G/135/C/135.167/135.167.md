(1) An approved life preserver equipped with an approved survivor locator light for each occupant of the aircraft. The life preserver must be easily accessible to each seated occupant. 


(2) Enough approved liferafts of a rated capacity and buoyancy to accommodate the occupants of the aircraft. 


(b) Each liferaft required by paragraph (a) of this section must be equipped with or contain at least the following: 


(1) One approved survivor locator light. 


(2) One approved pyrotechnic signaling device. 


(3) Either—

(xix) One book on survival appropriate for the area in which the aircraft is operated. 


(c) No person may operate an airplane in extended overwater operations unless there is attached to one of the life rafts required by paragraph (a) of this section, an approved survival type emergency locator transmitter. Batteries used in this transmitter must be replaced (or recharged, if the batteries are rechargeable) when the transmitter has been in use for more than 1 cumulative hour, or, when 50 percent of their useful life (or for rechargeable batteries, 50 percent of their useful life of charge) has expired, as established by the transmitter manufacturer under its approval. The new expiration date for replacing (or recharging) the battery must be legibly marked on the outside of the transmitter. The battery useful life (or useful life of charge) requirements of this paragraph do not apply to batteries (such as water-activated batteries) that are essentially unaffected during probable storage intervals.
