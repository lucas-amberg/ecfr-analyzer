(2) The Administrator determines that the proposed operations can be conducted safely. 


(c) A person may operate an aircraft under IFR outside of controlled airspace if the certificate holder has been approved for the operations and that operation is necessary to—

(2) Climb into controlled airspace during an approved missed approach procedure; or 


(3) Make an IFR departure from an airport having an approved instrument approach procedure. 


(d) The Administrator may issue operations specifications to the certificate holder to allow it to depart at an airport that does not have an approved standard instrument approach procedure when the Administrator determines that it is necessary to make an IFR departure from that airport and that the proposed operations can be conducted safely. The approval to operate at that airport does not include an approval to make an IFR approach to that airport.
