(f) A certificate holder that is also the holder of a type certificate (including a supplemental type certificate), a Parts Manufacturer Approval, or a Technical Standard Order Authorization, or that is the licensee of a type certificate need not report a failure, malfunction, or defect under this section if the failure, malfunction, or defect has been reported by it under § 21.3 or § 37.17 of this chapter or under the accident reporting provisions of 49 CFR part 830 of the regulations of the National Transportation Safety Board.
