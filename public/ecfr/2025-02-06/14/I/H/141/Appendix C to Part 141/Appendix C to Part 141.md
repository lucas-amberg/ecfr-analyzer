1. *Applicability.* This appendix prescribes the minimum curriculum for an instrument rating course and an additional instrument rating course, required under this part, for the following ratings: 


(a) Instrument—airplane. 


(b) Instrument—helicopter. 


(c) Instrument—powered-lift. 


2. *Eligibility for enrollment.* A person must hold at least a private pilot certificate with an aircraft category and class rating appropriate to the instrument rating for which the course applies prior to enrolling in the flight portion of the instrument rating course. 


3. *Aeronautical knowledge training.* (a) Each approved course must include at least the following ground training on the aeronautical knowledge areas listed in paragraph (b) of this section appropriate to the instrument rating for which the course applies: 


(1) 30 hours of training if the course is for an initial instrument rating. 


(2) 20 hours of training if the course is for an additional instrument rating. 


(b) Ground training must include the following aeronautical knowledge areas: 


(1) Applicable Federal Aviation Regulations for IFR flight operations; 


(2) Appropriate information in the “Aeronautical Information Manual”; 


(3) Air traffic control system and procedures for instrument flight operations; 


(4) IFR navigation and approaches by use of navigation systems; 


(5) Use of IFR en route and instrument approach procedure charts; 


(6) Procurement and use of aviation weather reports and forecasts, and the elements of forecasting weather trends on the basis of that information and personal observation of weather conditions; 


(7) Safe and efficient operation of aircraft under instrument flight rules and conditions; 


(8) Recognition of critical weather situations and windshear avoidance; 


(9) Aeronautical decision making and judgment; and 


(10) Crew resource management, to include crew communication and coordination. 


4. *Flight training.* (a) Each approved course must include at least the following flight training on the approved areas of operation listed in paragraph (d) of this section, appropriate to the instrument-aircraft category and class rating for which the course applies: 


(1) 35 hours of instrument training if the course is for an initial instrument rating. 


(2) 15 hours of instrument training if the course is for an additional instrument rating. 


(b) For the use of full flight simulators, flight training devices, or aviation training devices—


(1) The course may include training in a full flight simulator, flight training device, or aviation training device, provided it is representative of the aircraft for which the course is approved, meets the requirements of this paragraph, and the training is given by an authorized instructor.


(2) Credit for training in a full flight simulator that meets the requirements of § 141.41(a) cannot exceed 50 percent of the total flight training hour requirements of the course or of this section, whichever is less.


(3) Credit for training in a flight training device that meets the requirements of § 141.41(a), an advanced aviation training device that meets the requirements of § 141.41(b), or a combination of these devices cannot exceed 40 percent of the total flight training hour requirements of the course or of this section, whichever is less. Credit for training in a basic aviation training device that meets the requirements of § 141.41(b) cannot exceed 25 percent of the total training hour requirements permitted under this paragraph.


(4) Credit for training in full flight simulators, flight training devices, and aviation training devices if used in combination, cannot exceed 50 percent of the total flight training hour requirements of the course or of this section, whichever is less. However, credit for training in a flight training device or aviation training device cannot exceed the limitation provided for in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.


(c) Each approved course must include the following flight training— 


(1) *For an instrument airplane course:* Instrument training time from a certificated flight instructor with an instrument rating on the approved areas of operation in paragraph (d) of this section including at least one cross-country flight that— 


(i) Is in the category and class of airplane that the course is approved for, and is performed under IFR; 


(ii) Is a distance of at least 250 nautical miles along airways or ATC-directed routing with one segment of the flight consisting of at least a straight-line distance of 100 nautical miles between airports; 


(iii) Involves an instrument approach at each airport; and 


(iv) Involves three different kinds of approaches with the use of navigation systems. 


(2) *For an instrument helicopter course:* Instrument training time from a certificated flight instructor with an instrument rating on the approved areas of operation in paragraph (d) of this section including at least one cross-country flight that— 


(i) Is in a helicopter and is performed under IFR; 


(ii) Is a distance of at least 100 nautical miles along airways or ATC-directed routing with one segment of the flight consisting of at least a straight-line distance of 50 nautical miles between airports; 


(iii) Involves an instrument approach at each airport; and 


(iv) Involves three different kinds of approaches with the use of navigation systems. 


(3) *For an instrument powered-lift course:* Instrument training time from a certificated flight instructor with an instrument rating on the approved areas of operation in paragraph (d) of this section including at least one cross-country flight that— 


(i) Is in a powered-lift and is performed under IFR; 


(ii) Is a distance of at least 250 nautical miles along airways or ATC-directed routing with one segment of the flight consisting of at least a straight-line distance of 100 nautical miles between airports; 


(iii) Involves an instrument approach at each airport; and 


(iv) Involves three different kinds of approaches with the use of navigation systems. 


(d) Each course must include flight training on the areas of operation listed under this paragraph appropriate to the instrument aircraft category and class rating (if a class rating is appropriate) for which the course applies:


(1) Preflight preparation; 


(2) Preflight procedures; 


(3) Air traffic control clearances and procedures; 


(4) Flight by reference to instruments; 


(5) Navigation systems; 


(6) Instrument approach procedures; 


(7) Emergency operations; and 


(8) Postflight procedures. 


5. *Stage checks and end-of-course tests.* Each student enrolled in an instrument rating course must satisfactorily accomplish the stage checks and end-of-course tests, in accordance with the school's approved training course, consisting of the approved areas of operation listed in paragraph (d) of section No. 4 of this appendix that are appropriate to the aircraft category and class rating for which the course applies.
