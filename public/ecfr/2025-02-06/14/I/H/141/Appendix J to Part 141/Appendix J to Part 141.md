(a) A type rating in an airplane category—single-engine class. 


(b) A type rating in an airplane category—multiengine class. 


(c) A type rating in a rotorcraft category—helicopter class. 


(d) A type rating in a powered-lift category. 


(e) Other aircraft type ratings specified by the Administrator through the aircraft type certificate procedures. 


2. *Eligibility for enrollment.* Prior to enrolling in the flight portion of an aircraft type rating course, a person must hold at least a private pilot certificate and: 


(a) An instrument rating in the category and class of aircraft that is appropriate to the aircraft type rating for which the course applies, provided the aircraft's type certificate does not have a VFR limitation; or 


(b) Be concurrently enrolled in an instrument rating course in the category and class of aircraft that is appropriate to the aircraft type rating for which the course applies, and pass the required instrument rating practical test concurrently with the aircraft type rating practical test. 


3. *Aeronautical knowledge training.* (a) Each approved course must include at least 10 hours of ground training on the aeronautical knowledge areas listed in paragraph (b) of this section, appropriate to the aircraft type rating for which the course applies. 


(b) Ground training must include the following aeronautical areas: 


(1) Proper control of airspeed, configuration, direction, altitude, and attitude in accordance with procedures and limitations contained in the aircraft's flight manual, checklists, or other approved material appropriate to the aircraft type; 


(2) Compliance with approved en route, instrument approach, missed approach, ATC, or other applicable procedures that apply to the aircraft type; 


(3) Subjects requiring a practical knowledge of the aircraft type and its powerplant, systems, components, operational, and performance factors; 


(4) The aircraft's normal, abnormal, and emergency procedures, and the operations and limitations relating thereto; 


(5) Appropriate provisions of the approved aircraft's flight manual; 


(6) Location of and purpose for inspecting each item on the aircraft's checklist that relates to the exterior and interior preflight; and 


(7) Use of the aircraft's prestart checklist, appropriate control system checks, starting procedures, radio and electronic equipment checks, and the selection of proper navigation and communication radio facilities and frequencies. 


4. *Flight training.* (a) Each approved course must include at least: 


(1) Flight training on the approved areas of operation of paragraph (c) of this section in the aircraft type for which the course applies; and 


(2) 10 hours of training of which at least 5 hours must be instrument training in the aircraft for which the course applies. 


(b) For the use of full flight simulators or flight training devices:


(1) The course may include training in a full flight simulator or flight training device, provided it is representative of the aircraft for which the course is approved, meets requirements of this paragraph, and the training is given by an authorized instructor.


(2) Training in a full flight simulator that meets the requirements of § 141.41(a), may be credited for a maximum of 50 percent of the total flight training hour requirements of the approved course, or of this section, whichever is less.


(3) Training in a flight training device that meets the requirements of § 141.41(a), may be credited for a maximum of 25 percent of the total flight training hour requirements of the approved course, or of this section, whichever is less.


(4) Training in the full flight simulators or flight training devices described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, if used in combination, may be credited for a maximum of 50 percent of the total flight training hour requirements of the approved course, or of this section, whichever is less. However, credit training in a flight training device that meets the requirements of § 141.41(a) cannot exceed the limitation provided for in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.


(c) Each approved course must include the flight training on the areas of operation listed in this paragraph, that are appropriate to the aircraft category and class rating for which the course applies: 


(1) *A type rating for an airplane—single-engine course:* (i) Preflight preparation; 


(ii) Preflight procedures; 


(iii) Takeoff and departure phase; 


(iv) In-flight maneuvers; 


(v) Instrument procedures; 


(vi) Landings and approaches to landings;

(viii) Emergency procedures; and 


(ix) Postflight procedures. 


(2) *A type rating for an airplane—multiengine course:* (i) Preflight preparation; 


(ii) Preflight procedures; 


(iii) Takeoff and departure phase; 


(iv) In-flight maneuvers; 


(v) Instrument procedures; 


(vi) Landings and approaches to landings; 


(vii) Normal and abnormal procedures; 


(viii) Emergency procedures; and 


(ix) Postflight procedures. 


(3) *A type rating for a powered-lift course:* (i) Preflight preparation; 


(ii) Preflight procedures; 


(iii) Takeoff and departure phase; 


(iv) In-flight maneuvers; 


(v) Instrument procedures; 


(vi) Landings and approaches to landings; 


(vii) Normal and abnormal procedures; 


(viii) Emergency procedures; and 


(ix) Postflight procedures. 


(4) *A type rating for a rotorcraft—helicopter course:* (i) Preflight preparation; 


(ii) Preflight procedures; 


(iii) Takeoff and departure phase; 


(iv) In-flight maneuvers; 


(v) Instrument procedures; 


(vi) Landings and approaches to landings; 


(vii) Normal and abnormal procedures; 


(viii) Emergency procedures; and 


(ix) Postflight procedures. 


(5) *Other aircraft type ratings specified by the Administrator through aircraft type certificate procedures:* (i) Preflight preparation;
