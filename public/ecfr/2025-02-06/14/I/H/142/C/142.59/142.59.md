(a) An applicant for, or holder of, a training center certificate must show that each flight simulator and flight training device used for training, testing, and checking (except AQP) will be or is specifically qualified and approved by the Administrator for—


(1) Each maneuver and procedure for the make, model, and series of aircraft, set of aircraft, or aircraft type simulated, as applicable; and 


(2) Each curriculum or training course in which the flight simulator or flight training device is used, if that curriculum or course is used to satisfy any requirement of 14 CFR chapter I. 


(b) The approval required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section must include—

(1) Be maintained to ensure the reliability of the performances, functions, and all other characteristics that were required for qualification; 


(2) Be modified to conform with any modification to the aircraft being simulated if the modification results in changes to performance, function, or other characteristics required for qualification;

(1) Route segments during line-oriented flight training scenarios; and 


(2) Visual data bases replicating a specific customer's bases of operation.
