The following ratings are issued under this subpart:


(a) *Airframe ratings.* (1) *Class 1:* Composite construction of small aircraft.


(2) *Class 2:* Composite construction of large aircraft.


(3) *Class 3:* All-metal construction of small aircraft.


(4) *Class 4:* All-metal construction of large aircraft.


(b) *Powerplant ratings.* (1) *Class 1:* Reciprocating engines of 400 horsepower or less.


(2) *Class 2:* Reciprocating engines of more than 400 horsepower.


(3) *Class 3:* Turbine engines.


(c) *Propeller ratings.* (1) *Class 1:* Fixed-pitch and ground-adjustable propellers of wood, metal, or composite construction.


(2) *Class 2:* Other propellers, by make.


(d) *Radio ratings.* (1) *Class 1:* Communication equipment. Radio transmitting and/or receiving equipment used in an aircraft to send or receive communications in flight, regardless of carrier frequency or type of modulation used. This equipment includes auxiliary and related aircraft interphone systems, amplifier systems, electrical or electronic intercrew signaling devices, and similar equipment. This equipment does not include equipment used for navigating or aiding navigation of aircraft, equipment used for measuring altitude or terrain clearance, other measuring equipment operated on radio or radar principles, or mechanical, electrical, gyroscopic, or electronic instruments that are a part of communications radio equipment.


(2) *Class 2:* Navigational equipment. A radio system used in an aircraft for en route or approach navigation. This does not include equipment operated on radar or pulsed radio frequency principles, or equipment used for measuring altitude or terrain clearance.


(3) *Class 3:* Radar equipment. An aircraft electronic system operated on radar or pulsed radio frequency principles.


(e) *Instrument ratings.* (1) *Class 1:* Mechanical. A diaphragm, bourdon tube, aneroid, optical, or mechanically driven centrifugal instrument used on aircraft or to operate aircraft, including tachometers, airspeed indicators, pressure gauges drift sights, magnetic compasses, altimeters, or similar mechanical instruments.


(2) *Class 2:* Electrical. Self-synchronous and electrical-indicating instruments and systems, including remote indicating instruments, cylinder head temperature gauges, or similar electrical instruments.


(3) *Class 3:* Gyroscopic. An instrument or system using gyroscopic principles and motivated by air pressure or electrical energy, including automatic pilot control units, turn and bank indicators, directional gyros, and their parts, and flux gate and gyrosyn compasses.


(4) *Class 4:* Electronic. An instrument whose operation depends on electron tubes, transistors, or similar devices, including capacitance type quantity gauges, system amplifiers, and engine analyzers.


(f) *Accessory ratings.* (1) *Class 1:* A mechanical accessory that depends on friction, hydraulics, mechanical linkage, or pneumatic pressure for operation, including aircraft wheel brakes, mechanically driven pumps, carburetors, aircraft wheel assemblies, shock absorber struts and hydraulic servo units.


(2) *Class 2:* An electrical accessory that depends on electrical energy for its operation, and a generator, including starters, voltage regulators, electric motors, electrically driven fuel pumps magnetos, or similar electrical accessories.


(3) *Class 3:* An electronic accessory that depends on the use of an electron tube transistor, or similar device, including supercharger, temperature, air conditioning controls, or similar electronic controls.
