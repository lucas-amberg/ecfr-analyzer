# Appendix H to Part 151


There is set forth below the contract provision required by the regulations of the Secretary of Labor in part 5 of title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Section 151.49(a) requires sponsors to insert this provision in full in each construction contract. 


*A. Minimum wages.* (1) All mechanics and laborers employed or working upon the site of the work will be paid unconditionally and not less often than once a week, and without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account (except such payroll deductions as are permitted by regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor under the Copeland Act [29 CFR part 3]), the full amounts due at time of payment computed at wage rates not less than those contained in the wage determination decision(s) of the Secretary of Labor which is (are) attached hereto and made a part hereof, regardless of any contractual relationship which may be alleged to exist between the contractor and such laborers and mechanics; and the wage determination decision(s) shall be posted by the contractor at the site of the work in a prominent place where it (they) can be easily seen by the workers. For the purpose of this paragraph, contributions made or costs reasonably anticipated under section 1(b)(2) of the Davis-Bacon Act on behalf of laborers or mechanics are considered wages paid to such laborers or mechanics, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (4) below. Also for the purpose of this paragraph, regular contributions made or costs incurred for more than a weekly period under plans, funds, or programs, but covering the particular weekly period, are deemed to be constructively made or incurred during such weekly period (29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(i)). 


(2) Any class of laborers or mechanics which is not listed in the wage determination(s) and which is to be employed under the contract, shall be classified or reclassified comformably to the wage determination(s), and a report of the action taken shall be sent by the [insert sponsor's name] to the FAA for approval and transmittal to the Secretary of Labor. In the event that the interested parties cannot agree on the proper classification or reclassification of a particular class of laborers and mechanics to be used, the question accompanied by the recommendation of the FAA shall be referred to the Secretary of Labor for final determination (29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(ii)). 


(3) Whenever the minimum wage rate prescribed in the contract for a class of laborers or mechanics includes a fringe benefit which is not expressed as an hourly wage rate and the contractor is obligated to pay a cash equivalent of such a fringe benefit, an hourly cash equivalent thereof shall be established. In the event the interested parties cannot agree upon a cash equivalent of the fringe benefit, the question, accompanied by the recommendation of the FAA shall be referred to the Secretary of Labor for determination (29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(iii)). 


(4) If the contractor does not make payments to a trustee or other third person, he may consider as part of the wages of any laborer or mechanic the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing benefits under a plan or program of a type expressly listed in the wage determination decision of the Secretary of Labor which is a part of this contract: *Provided, however,* The Secretary of Labor has found, upon the written request of the contractor, that the applicable standards of the Davis-Bacon Act have been met. The Secretary of Labor may require the contractor to set aside in a separate account assets for the meeting of obligations under the plan or program. 


*B. Withholding: FAA from sponsor.* Pursuant to the terms of the grant agreement between the United States and [insert sponsor's name], relating to Federal-aid Airport Project No. __, and part 151 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 151), the FAA may withhold or cause to be withheld from the [insert sponsor's name] so much of the accrued payments or advances as may be considered necessary to pay laborers and mechanics employed by the contractor or any subcontractor on the work the full amount of wages required by this contract. In the event of failure to pay any laborer or mechanic employed or working on the site of the work all or part of the wages required by this contract, the FAA may, after written notice to the [insert sponsor's name], take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased (29 CFR 5.5(a)(2)). 


*C. Payrolls and basic records.* (1) Payrolls and basic records relating thereto will be maintained during the course of the work and preserved for a period of three years thereafter for all laborers and mechanics working at the site of the work. Such records will contain the name and address of each such employee, his correct classification, rates of pay (including rates of contributions or costs anticipated of the types described in section 1(b)(2) of the Davis-Bacon Act), daily and weekly number of hours worked, deductions made and actual wages paid. Whenever the Secretary of Labor has found, under 29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(iv) (see subparagraph (4) of subparagraph (A) above), that the wages of any laborer or mechanic include the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing benefits under a plan or program described in section 1(b)(2)(B) of the Davis-Bacon Act, the contractor shall maintain records which show that the commitment to provide such benefits is enforceable, that the plan or program is financially responsible, and that the plan or program has been communicated in writing to the laborers or mechanics affected, and records which show the costs anticipated or the actual cost incurred in providing such benefits (29 CFR 5.5(a)(3)(i)). 


(2) The contractor will submit weekly a copy of all payrolls to the [insert sponsor's name] for transmission to the FAA, as required by § 151.53(a). The copy shall be accompanied by a statement signed by the employer or his agent indicating that the payrolls are correct and complete, that the wage rates contained therein are not less than those determined by the Secretary of Labor and that the classifications set forth for each laborer or mechanic conform with the work he performed. A submission of a “Weekly Statement of Compliance” which is required under this contract and the Copeland regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR part 3) and the filing with the initial payroll or any subsequent payroll of a copy of any findings by the Secretary of Labor, under 29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(iv) (see subparagraph (4) of paragraph (A) above), shall satisfy this requirement. The prime contractor shall be responsible for the submission of copies of payrolls of all subcontractors. The contractor will make the records required under the labor standards clauses of the contract available for inspection by authorized representatives of the FAA and the Department of Labor, and will permit such representatives to interview employees during working hours on the job (29 CFR 5.5(a)(3)(ii)). 


*D. Apprentices.* Apprentices will be permitted to work as such only when they are registered, individually, under a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State apprenticeship agency which is recognized by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, United States Department of Labor; or, if no such recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, United States Department of Labor. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program. Any employee listed on a payroll at an apprentice wage rate, who is not registered as above, shall be paid the wage rate determined by the Secretary of Labor for the classification of work he actually performed. The contractor or subcontractor will be required to furnish to the [insert sponsor's name] written evidence of the registration of his program and apprentices as well as of the appropriate ratios and wage rates, for the area of construction prior to using any apprentices on the contract work (29 CFR 5.5(a)(4)). 


*E. Compliance with Copeland Regulations.* The contractor shall comply with the Copeland Regulations (29 CFR part 3) of the Secretary of Labor which are herein incorporated by reference (29 CFR 5.5(a)(5)). 


*F. Overtime requirements.* No contractor or subcontractor contracting for any part of the contract work which may require or involve the employment of laborers or mechanics shall require or permit any laborer or mechanic in any workweek in which he is employed on such work to work in excess of eight hours in any calendar day or in excess of forty hours in such workweek unless such laborer or mechanic received compensation at a rate not less than one and one-half times his basic rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight hours in any calendar day or in excess of forty hours in such workweek, as the case may be (29 CFR 5.5(c)(1)). 


*G. Violations; liability for unpaid wages; liquidated damages.* In the event of any violation of paragraph F of this provision, the contractor and any subcontractor responsible therefore shall be liable to any affected employee for his unpaid wages. In addition, such contractor and subcontractor shall be liable to the United States for liquidated damages. Such liquidated damages shall be computed, with respect to each individual laborer or mechanic employed in violation of said paragraph F of this provision, in the sum of $10 for each calendar day on which such employee was required or permitted to work in excess of eight hours or in excess of the standard workweek of forty hours without payment of the overtime wages required by said paragraph F of this provision (29 CFR 5.5 (c)(2)). 


*H. Withholding for unpaid wages and liquidated damages, and priority of payment* (1) The FAA may withhold or cause to be withheld, from any moneys payable on account of work performed by the contractor or subcontractor, such sums as may administratively be determined to be necessary to satisfy any liabilities of such contractor or subcontractor for unpaid wages and liquidated damages as provided in paragraph G of this provision (29 CFR 5.5(c)(3)). 


(2) In the event of failure or refusal of the contractor or any subcontractor to comply with overtime pay requirements of the Contract Work Hours Standards Act, if the funds withheld by the FAA for the violations are not sufficient to pay fully both the unpaid wages due laborers and mechanics and the liquidated damages due the United States, the available funds shall be used first to compensate the laborers and mechanics for the wages to which they are entitled (or an equitable portion thereof when the funds are not adequate for this purpose); and the balance, if any, shall be used for the payment of liquidated damages (29 CFR 5.14 (d)(2)). 


*I. Subcontracts.* The contractor will insert in each of his subcontracts the clauses contained in paragraphs A through H and J of this provision, and also a clause requiring the subcontractors to include these provisions in any lower tier subcontracts which they may enter into, together with a clause requiring this insertion in any further subcontracts that may in turn be made (29 CFR 5.5(a)(6), 5.5(c)(4)). 


*J. Contract termination; debarment.* A breach of paragraphs A through I of this provision may be grounds for termination of the contract. A breach of paragraphs A through E and I may also be grounds for debarment as provided in 29 CFR 5.6 of the regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR 5.5(a)(8)).
