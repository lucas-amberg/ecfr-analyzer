# ยง 151.23   Procedures: Application; funding information.

Each sponsor must state in its application that it has on hand, or show that it can obtain as needed, funds to pay all estimated costs of the proposed project that are not borne by the United States or by another sponsor. If any of the funds are to be furnished to a sponsor, or used to pay project costs on behalf of a sponsor, by a State agency or any other public agency that is not a sponsor of the project, that agency may, instead of the sponsor, submit evidence that the funds will be provided if the project is approved.
