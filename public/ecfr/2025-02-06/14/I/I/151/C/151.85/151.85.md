# § 151.85   Special treatment areas.

The following special treatment for areas adjacent to pavement is eligible for inclusion in a project in cases where, due to the operation of turbojet powered aircraft, it may be necessary to treat those areas adjacent to runway ends, holding aprons, and taxiways to prevent erosion from the blast effects of the turbojet: 


(a) Runway ends—a stabilized area the width of the runway and extending 100 to 150 feet from the end of the runway. 


(b) Holding aprons—a stabilized area up to 50 feet from the edge of the pavement. 


(c) Taxiway intersections—a stabilized area 25 feet on each side of the taxiway and extending 300 feet from the intersection. 


(d) Taxiway (continuous movement of aircraft)—dense turf 25 feet on each side of the taxiway, or in a geographic area where dense turf cannot be established, stabilization.
