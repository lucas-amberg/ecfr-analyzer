This appendix sets forth contract and labor provisions applicable to grants under the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970. 


This appendix does not apply to: (1) Any contract with the owner of airport hazards, buildings, pipelines, powerlines, or other structures or facilities, for installing, extending, changing, removing, or relocating that structure or facility, and (2) any written agreement or understanding between a sponsor and another public agency that is not a sponsor of the project, under which the public agency undertakes construction work for or as agent of the sponsor. 


Each sponsor entering into a construction contract for an airport development project shall insert in the contract and any supplemental agreement: 


(1) The provisions required by the Secretary of Labor, as set forth in paragraphs A through K; 


(2) The provisions set forth in paragraph L, and 


(3) Any other provisions necessary to ensure completion of the work in accordance with the grant agreement.


*A. Minimum wages.* (1) All mechanics and laborers employed or working upon the site of the work will be paid unconditionally and not less often than once a week, and without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account (except such payroll deductions as are permitted by regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor under the Copeland Act [29 CFR part 3], the full amounts due at time of payment computed at wage rates not less than those contained in the wage determination decision(s) of the Secretary of Labor which is (are) attached hereto and made a part hereof, regardless of any contractual relationship which may be alleged to exist between the contractor and such laborers and mechanics; and the wage determination decision(s) shall be posted by the contractor at the site of the work in a prominent place where it (they) can be easily seen by the workers. For the purpose of this paragraph, contributions made or costs reasonably anticipated under section 1(b)(2) of the Davis-Bacon Act on behalf of laborers or mechanics are considered wages paid to such laborers or mechanics, subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) below. Also for the purpose of this paragraph, regular contributions made or costs incurred for more than a weekly period under plans, funds, or programs, but covering the particular weekly period, are deemed to be constructively made or incurred during such weekly period (29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(i)). 


(2) Any class of laborers or mechanics, including apprentices and trainees, which is not listed in the wage determination(s) and which is to be employed under the contract, shall be classified or reclassified conformably to the wage determination(s), and a report of the action taken shall be sent by the [insert sponsor's name] to the FAA for approval and transmittal to the Secretary of Labor. In the event that the interested parties cannot agree on the proper classification or reclassification of a particular class of laborers and mechanics, including apprentices and trainees, to be used, the question accompanied by the recommendation of the FAA shall be referred to the Secretary of Labor for final determination (29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(ii)). 


(3) Whenever the minimum wage rate prescribed in the contract for a class of laborers or mechanics includes a fringe benefit which is not expressed as an hourly wage rate and the contractor is obligated to pay a cash equivalent of such a fringe benefit, an hourly cash equivalent thereof shall be established. In the event the interested parties cannot agree upon a cash equivalent of the fringe benefit, the question accompanied by the recommendation of the FAA shall be referred to the Secretary of Labor for determination (29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(iii)). 


(4) If the contractor does not make payments to a trustee or other third person, he may consider as part of the wages of any laborer or mechanic the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing benefits under a plan or program of a type expressly listed in the wage determination decision of the Secretary of Labor which is a part of this contract: *Provided, however,* the Secretary of Labor has found, upon written request of the contractor, that the applicable standards of the Davis-Bacon Act have been met. The Secretary of Labor may require the contractor to set aside in a separate account assets for the meeting of obligations under the plan or program (29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(iv)). 


*B. Withholding: FAA from sponsor.* Pursuant to the terms of the grant agreement between the United States and [insert sponsor's name], relating to Airport Development Aid Project No. __, and part 152 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 152), the FAA may withhold or cause to be withheld from the [insert sponsor's name] so much of the accrued payments or advances as may be considered necessary to pay laborers and mechanics, including apprentices and trainees, employed by the contractor or any subcontractor on the work the full amount of wages required by this contract. In the event of failure to pay any laborer or mechanics, including any apprentice or trainee, employed or working on the site of the work all or part of the wages required by this contract, the FAA may, after written notice to the [insert sponsor's name], take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased (29 CFR 5.5(a)(2)). 


*C. Payrolls and basic records.* (1) Payrolls and basic records relating thereto will be maintained during the course of the work and preserved for a period of 3 years thereafter for all laborers and mechanics working at the site of the work. Such records will contain the name and address of each such employee, his correct classification, rates of pay (including rates of contributions or costs anticipated of the types described in section 1(b)(2) of the Davis-Bacon Act), daily and weekly number of hours worked, deductions made and actual wages paid. Whenever the Secretary of Labor has found, under 29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(iv) (see paragraph (4) of paragraph A above), that the wages of any laborer or mechanic include the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing benefits under a plan or program described in section 1(b)(2)(B) of the Davis-Bacon Act, the contractor shall maintain records which show that the commitment to provide such benefits is enforceable, that the plan or program is financially responsible, and that the plan or program has been communicated in writing to the laborers or mechanics affected, and records which show the costs anticipated or the actual costs incurred in providing such benefits (29 CFR 5.5(a)(3)(i)). 


(2) The contractor will submit weekly a copy of all payrolls to the [insert sponsor's name] for availability to the FAA.

The prime contractor shall be responsible for submission of copies of payrolls of all subcontractors. The contractor will make the records required under the labor standards clauses of the contract available for inspection by authorized representatives of the FAA and the Department of Labor, and will permit such representatives to interview employees during working hours on the job.

The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program. Any employee listed on a payroll at an apprentice wage rate, who is not a trainee as defined in paragraph (2) of this paragraph or is not registered or otherwise employed as stated above, shall be paid the wage rate determined by the Secretary of Labor for the classification of work he actually performed. The contractor or subcontractor will be required to furnish to the [insert sponsor's name] or a representative of the Wage-Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor written evidence of the registration of his program and apprentices as well as the appropriate ratios and wage rates (expressed in percentages of the journeyman hourly rates), for the area of construction prior to using any apprentices on the contract work.

(3) *Equal employment opportunity.* The utilization of apprentices, trainees and journeymen under this paragraph shall be in conformity with the equal employment opportunity requirements of Executive Order 11246, as amended, and 29 CFR part 30 (29 CFR 5.5(a)(4)(iii)).
