Agrees that, in furtherance of the policy of the FAA under this covenant, unless authorized by the Administrator, it will not, either directly or indirectly, grant or permit any person, firm or corporation the exclusive right at the Airport, or at any other airport now owned or controlled by it, to conduct any aeronautical activities, including, but not limited to charter flights, pilot training, aircraft rental and sightseeing, aerial photography, crop dusting, aerial advertising and surveying, air carrier operations, aircraft sales and services, sale of aviation petroleum products whether or not conducted in conjunction with other aeronautical activity, repair and maintenance of aircraft, sale of aircraft parts, and any other activities which because of their direct relationship to the operation of aircraft can be regarded as an aeronautical activity.


c. Agrees that it will terminate any existing exclusive right to engage in the sale of gasoline or oil, or both, granted before July 17, 1962, at such an airport, at the earliest renewal, cancellation, or expiration date applicable to the agreement that established the exclusive right; and


d. Agrees that it will terminate any other exclusive right to conduct an aeronautical activity now existing at such an airport before the grant of any assistance under the Airport and Airway Development Act.


20. *Public use and benefit.* The Sponsor agrees that it will operate the Airport for the use and benefit of the public, on fair and reasonable terms, and without unjust discrimination. In furtherance of the covenant (but without limiting its general applicability and effect), the Sponsor specifically covenants and agrees:


a. That in its operation and the operation of all facilities on the Airport, neither it nor any person or organization occupying space or facilities thereon will discriminate against any person or class of persons by reason of race, color, creed, or national origin in the use of any of the facilities provided for the public on the Airport.


b. That in any agreement, contract, lease or other arrangement under which a right or privilege at the Airport is granted to any person, firm, or corporation to conduct or engage in any aeronautical activity for furnishing services to the public at the Airport, the Sponsor will insert and enforce provisions requiring the contractor— 


(1) To furnish said service on a fair, equal, and not unjustly discriminatory basis to all users thereof, and


(2) To charge fair, reasonable, and not unjustly discriminatory prices for each unit or service; Provided, That the contractor may be allowed to make reasonable and nondiscriminatory discounts, rebates, or other similar types of price reductions to volume purchasers.


c. That it will not exercise or grant any right or privilege which would operate to prevent any person, firm or corporation operating aircraft on the Airport from performing any services on its own aircraft with its own employees (including, but not limited to maintenance and repair) that it may choose to perform. 


d. In the event the Sponsor itself exercises any of the rights and privileges referred to in subsection b, the services involved will be provided on the same conditions as would apply to the furnishing of such services by contractors or concessionaires of the Sponsor under the provisions of such subsection b. 


21. *Nonaviation activities.* Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit the granting or exercise of an exclusive right for the furnishing of nonaviation products and supplies or any service of a nonaeronautical nature or to obligate the Sponsor to furnish any particular nonaeronautical service at the Airport. 


22. *Operation and maintenance of the airport.* The Sponsor will operate and maintain in a safe and serviceable condition the Airport and all facilities thereon and connected therewith which are necessary to serve the aeronautical users of the Airport other than facilities owned or controlled by the United States, and will not permit any activity thereon which would interfere with its use for airport purposes; *Provided,* That nothing contained herein shall be construed to require that the Airport be operated for aeronautical uses during temporary periods when snow, flood, or other climatic conditions interfere with such operation and maintenance; and *Provided further,* That nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the maintenance, repair, restoration or replacement of any structure or facility which is substantially damaged or destroyed due to an act of God or other condition or circumstance beyond the control of the Sponsor. In furtherance of this covenant the sponsor will have in effect at all times arrangements for—


a. Operating the airport's aeronautical facilities whenever required; 


b. Promptly marking and lighting hazards resulting from airport conditions, including temporary conditions; and 


c. Promptly notifying airmen of any condition affecting aeronautical use of the Airport. 


23. *Airport Hazards.* Insofar as it is within its power and reasonable, the Sponsor will, either by the acquisition and retention of easements or other interests in or rights for the use of land or airspace or by the adoption and enforcement of zoning regulations, prevent the construction, erection, alteration, or growth of any structure, tree, or other object in the approach areas of the runways of the Airport, which would constitute an airport hazard. 


In addition, the Sponsor will not erect or permit the erection of any permanent structure or facility which would interfere materially with the use, operation, or future development of the Airport, in any portion of a runway approach area in which the Sponsor has acquired, or hereafter acquires, property interests permitting it to so control the use made of the surface of the land. 


24. *Use of adjacent land.* Insofar as it is within its power and reasonable, the Sponsor will, either by the acquisition and retention of easements or other interests in or rights for the use of land or airspace or by the adoption and enforcement of zoning regulations, take action to restrict the use of land adjacent to or in the immediate vicinity of the Airport to activities and purposes compatible with normal airport operations including landing and takeoff of aircraft. 


25. *Airport layout plan.* The Sponsor will keep up to date at all times an airport layout plan of the Airport showing (1) boundaries of the Airport and all proposed additions thereto, together with the boundaries of all offsite areas owned or controlled by the Sponsor for airport purposes, and proposed additions thereto; (2) the location and nature of all existing and proposed airport facilities and structures (such as runways, taxiways, aprons, terminal buildings, hangars and roads), including all proposed extensions and reductions of existing airport facilities; and (3) the location of all existing and proposed nonaviation areas and of all existing improvements thereon. Such airport layout plan and each amendment, revision, or modification thereof, shall be subject to the approval of the FAA, which approval shall be evidenced by the signature of a duly authorized representative of the FAA on the face of the airport layout plan. The Sponsor will not make or permit any changes or alterations in the airport or in any of its facilities other than in conformity with the airport layout plan as so approved by the FAA, if such changes or alterations might adversely affect the safety, utility, or efficiency of the Airport. 


26. *Federal use of facilities.* All facilities of the Airport developed with Federal aid and all those usable for the landing and taking off of aircraft, will be available to the United States at all times, without charge, for use by government aircraft in common with other aircraft, except that if the use by government aircraft is substantial, a reasonable share, proportional to such use, of the cost of operating and maintaining facilities so used, may be charged. Unless otherwise determined by the FAA, or otherwise agreed to by the Sponsor and the using agency, substantial use of an airport by government aircraft will be considered to exist when operations of such aircraft are in excess of those which, in the opinion of the FAA, would unduly interfere with use of the landing area by other authorized aircraft, or during any calendar month that—


a. Five (5) or more government aircraft are regularly based at the airport or on land adjacent thereto; or 


b. The total number of movements (counting each landing as a movement and each takeoff as a movement) of government aircraft is 300 or more, or the gross accumulative weight of government aircraft using the Airport (the total movements of government aircraft multiplied by gross certified weights of such aircraft) is in excess of five million pounds. 


27. *Areas for FAA Use.* Whenever so requested by the FAA, the Sponsor will furnish without cost to the Federal Government, for construction, operation, and maintenance of facilities for air traffic control activities, or weather reporting activities and communication activities related to air traffic control, such areas of land or water, or estate therein, or rights in buildings of the Sponsor as the FAA may consider necessary or desirable for construction at Federal expense of space or facilities for such purposes. The approximate amounts of areas and the nature of the property interests and/or rights so required will be set forth in the Grant Agreement relating to the project. Such areas or any portion thereof will be made available as provided herein within 4 months after receipt of written requests from the FAA. 


28. *Fee and rental structure.* The airport operator or owner will maintain a fee and rental structure for the facilities and services being provided the airport users which will make the Airport as self-sustaining as possible under the circumstances existing at the Airport, taking into account such factors as the volume of traffic and economy of collection. 


29. *Reports to FAA.* The Sponsor will furnish the FAA with such annual or special airport financial and operational reports as may be reasonably requested. Such reports may be submitted on forms furnished by the FAA, or may be submitted in such manner as the Sponsor elects so long as the essential data are furnished. The Airport and all airport records and documents affecting the Airport, including deeds, leases, operation and use agreements, regulations, and other instruments, will be made available of inspection and audit by the Secretary and the Comptroller General of the United States, or their duly authorized representatives, upon reasonable request. The Sponsor will furnish to the FAA or to the General Accounting Office, upon request, a true copy of any such document. 


30. *System of accounting.* All project accounts and records will be kept in accordance with a standard system of accounting if so prescribed by the Secretary. 


31. *Interfering right.* If at any time it is determined by the FAA that there is any outstanding right or claim of right in or to the Airport property, other than those set forth in Part II of the Application for Federal Assistance, the existence of which creates an undue risk of interference with the operation of the Airport or the performance of the covenants of this part, the sponsor will acquire, extinguish, or modify such right or claim of right in a manner acceptable to the FAA. 


32. *Performance obligation.* The Sponsor will not enter into any transaction which would operate to deprive it of any of the rights and powers necessary to perform any or all of the covenants made herein, unless by such transaction the obligation to perform all such covenants is assumed by another public agency found by the FAA to be eligible under the Act and Regulations to assume such obligations and having the power, authority, and financial resources to carry out all such obligations. If an arrangement is made for management or operation of the Airport by any agency or person other than the Sponsor or an employee of the Sponsor, the Sponsor will reserve sufficient rights and authority to insure that the Airport will be operated and maintained in accordance with the Act, the Regulations, and these covenants. 


33. *Meaning of terms.* Unless the context otherwise requires, all terms used in these covenants which are defined in the Act and the Regulations shall have the meanings assigned to them therein. 


B. *Airport Layout Plan Approval.* A sponsor seeking FAA approval of a new or revised airport layout plan shall submit with the plan an environmental assessment prepared in conformance with Appendix 6 of FAA Order 1050.1C, “Policies and Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts” (45 FR 2244; January 10, 1980) and FAA Order 5050.4 “Airport Environmental Handbook” (45 FR 56622; August 25, 1980), if an assessment is required by Order 5050.4. 


Each applicant for an airport planning grant shall submit the assurances numbered 1 (except for the phrase “and to finance and construct the proposed facilities”), 7, 9, 11 (except for the last sentence), and 12, 14, 15, 30, and 33 of Part II of this appendix.
