# § 152.209   Grant payments: General.

(a) An application for a grant payment is made on a form and in a manner prescribed by the Administrator, and must be accompanied by any supporting information, that the FAA needs to determine the allowability of any costs for which payment is requested.


(b) *Methods of payment.* Grant payments to sponsors and planning agencies will be made by—


(1) Letter of credit;


(2) Advance by Treasury check; or


(3) Reimbursement by Treasury checks.


(c) *Letter of credit funding.* Letter of credit funding may not be used unless—


(1) There is or will be a continuing relationship between a sponsor or planning agency and the FAA for at least a 12-month period and the total amount of advances to be received within that period is $120,000 or more;


(2) The sponsor or planning agency has established or demonstrated to the FAA the willingness and ability to establish procedures that will minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and their disbursement by the grantee; and


(3) The sponsor's or planning agency's financial management system meets the standards for fund control and accountability prescribed in Attachment G of Office of Management and Budget Circular A-102 (42 FR 45828).


(d) *Advance by Treasury check.* Advance of funds by Treasury check may be made subject to the following conditions—


(1) The sponsor or planning agency meets the requirements of paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section;


(2) The timing and amount of cash advances are as close as administratively feasible to actual disbursements by the sponsor or planning agency; and


(3) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, in the case of an airport development project, advance payments do not exceed the estimated project costs of the airport development expected to be accomplished within 30 days after the date of the sponsor's application for the advance payment.


(e) No advance payment for airport development projects may be made in an amount that would bring the aggregate amount of all partial payments to more than the lower of the following:


(i) 90 percent of the estimated United States' share of the total estimated cost of all airport development included in the project, but not including contingency items; or


(ii) 90 percent of the maximum obligation of the United States as stated in the grant agreement.


(f) *Reimbursement by Treasury check.* Reimbursement by Treasury check will be made if the sponsor or planning agency does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section.


(g) *Withholding of payments.* Payment to the sponsor or planning agency may be withheld at any time during the grant period under the following circumstances:


(1) The sponsor or planning agency has failed to comply with the program objectives, grant award conditions, or Federal reporting requirements.


(2) The sponsor or planning agency is indebted to the United States and collection of the indebtedness will not impair accomplishment of the objectives of any grant program sponsored by the United States. 


(3) The sponsor or planning agency has withheld payment to a contractor to assure satisfactory completion of work. Payment will be made to the sponsor or planning agency when it has made final payment to the contractor, including the amounts withheld.


(h) *Labor violations.* If a contractor or a subcontractor fails or refuses to comply with the labor provisions of a contract under a grant agreement for an airport development project, further grant payments to the sponsor are suspended until—


(1) The violations are corrected;


(2) The Administrator determines the allowability of the project costs to which the violations relate; or


(3) If the violations consist of underpayments to labor, the sponsor furnishes satisfactory assurances to the FAA that restitution has been or will be made to the affected employees.


(i) *Excess payments.* Upon determination of the allowability of all project costs of a project, if it is found that the total of grant payments to the sponsor or planning agency was more than the total United States share of the allowable costs of the project, the sponsor or planning agency shall promptly return the excess to FAA.
