(C) Change the scope of a project, or


(D) Increase the PFC level to be collected from each passenger.

(4) A description of the proposed amendment;


(5) Justification, if the amendment involves an increase in the PFC amount for a project by more than 25 percent of the original approved amount if that amount is $1,000,000 or greater, an increase in the PFC amount by any percentage if the original approved amount was less than $1,000,000 and the amended approved amount is $1,000,000 or greater, a change in the approved project scope, or any increase in the approved PFC level to be collected from each passenger.


(6) A description of how each project meets the requirements of § 158.17(b), for each project proposed for an increase of the PFC level above $3.00 at a medium or large hub airport;

The effective date of any new PFC level must be no earlier than the first day of a month which is at least 30 days from the date the public agency notifies the carriers.
