# § 161.105   Requirements for new entrants.

(a) Within 45 days of the publication of the notice of a proposed restriction by the airport operator under § 161.103(b) of this part, any person intending to provide new air service to the airport within 180 days of the proposed date of implementation of the restriction (as evidenced by submission of a plan of operations to the airport operator) must notify the airport operator if it would be affected by the restriction contained in the proposed agreement, and either that it—


(1) Agrees to the restriction; or 


(2) Objects to the restriction. 


(b) Failure of any person described in § 161.105(a) of this part to notify the airport operator that it objects to the proposed restriction will constitute waiver of the right to claim that it did not consent to the agreement and render that person ineligible to use lack of signature as ground to apply for sanctions under subpart F of this part for two years following the effective date of the restriction. The signature of such a person need not be obtained by the airport operator in order to comply with § 161.107(a) of this part. 


(c) All other new entrants are also ineligible to use lack of signature as ground to apply for sanctions under subpart F of this part for two years.
