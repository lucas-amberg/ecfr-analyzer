# § 161.205   Required analysis of proposed restriction and alternatives.

(a) Each airport operator proposing a noise or access restriction on Stage 2 aircraft operations shall prepare the following and make it available for public comment: 


(1) An analysis of the anticipated or actual costs and benefits of the proposed noise or access restriction; 


(2) A description of alternative restrictions; and 


(3) A description of the alternative measures considered that do not involve aircraft restrictions, and a comparison of the costs and benefits of such alternative measures to costs and benefits of the proposed noise or access restriction. 


(b) In preparing the analyses required by this section, the airport operator shall use the noise measurement systems and identify the airport noise study area as specified in §§ 161.9 and 161.11, respectively; shall use currently accepted economic methodology; and shall provide separate detail on the costs and benefits of the proposed restriction with respect to the operations of Stage 2 aircraft weighing less than 75,000 pounds if the restriction applies to this class. The airport operator shall specify the methods used to analyze the costs and benefits of the proposed restriction and the alternatives. 


(c) The kinds of information set forth in § 161.305 are useful elements of an adequate analysis of a noise or access restriction on Stage 2 aircraft operations.
