# § 161.321   Optional use of 14 CFR part 150 procedures.

(a) An airport operator may use the procedures in part 150 of this chapter, instead of the procedures described in §§ 161.303(b) and 161.309(b) of this part, as a means of providing an adequate public notice and opportunity to comment on proposed Stage 3 restrictions, including submitted alternatives. 


(b) If the airport operator elects to use 14 CFR part 150 procedures to comply with this subpart, the operator shall: 


(1) Ensure that all parties identified for direct notice under § 161.303(b) are notified that the airport's 14 CFR part 150 program submission will include a proposed Stage 3 restriction under part 161, and that these parties are offered the opportunity to participate as consulted parties during the development of the 14 CFR part 150 program; 


(2) Include the information required in § 161.303(c) (2) through (5) and § 161.305 in the analysis of the proposed restriction in the 14 CFR part 150 program submission; and 


(3) Include in its 14 CFR part 150 submission to the FAA evidence of compliance with the notice requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and include the information required for a part 161 application in § 161.311, together with a clear identification that the 14 CFR part 150 submission includes a proposed Stage 3 restriction for FAA review and approval under §§ 161.313, 161.315, and 161.317. 


(c) The FAA will evaluate the proposed part 161 restriction on Stage 3 aircraft operations included in the 14 CFR part 150 submission in accordance with the procedures and standards of this part, and will review the total 14 CFR part 150 submission in accordance with the procedures and standards of 14 CFR part 150. 


(d) An amendment of a restriction, as specified in § 161.319(b) of this part, may also be processed under 14 CFR part 150 procedures.
