(ii) Completing an aircraft familiarity flight meeting the requirements of section 5.(b) of this appendix.


(2) After the applicant meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the applicant may receive another endorsement for the applicant to act as pilot in command of the specific powered-lift to accomplish the demonstration flight with an authorized instructor on board as set forth in section 6.(a) of this appendix. This endorsement is valid for 90 days from the day the demonstration of proficiency in the full flight simulator was successfully completed.


(c) *Solo Flights.* After an applicant receives an endorsement to conduct solo flights in accordance with section 6.(a)(4) of this appendix, the applicant must complete 20 hours of solo flight in the aircraft, which must include:
