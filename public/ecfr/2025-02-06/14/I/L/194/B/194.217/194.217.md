# § 194.217   Test pilots, FAA test pilots, or aviation safety inspectors: Alternate aeronautical experience and logging requirements for a commercial pilot certificate with a powered-lift category rating.

(a) *General applicability.* An applicant for a commercial pilot certificate with a powered-lift category rating who is a test pilot for the manufacturer of an experimental powered-lift, an FAA test pilot, or an aviation safety inspector may satisfy the alternate aeronautical experience and logging requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, provided—


(1) The flights are conducted in an experimental powered-lift at the manufacturer;


(2) The applicant is authorized by the Administrator to act as pilot in command of the experimental powered-lift.


(b) *Alternate aeronautical experience requirements.* Notwithstanding the eligibility requirement specified in § 61.123(f) of this chapter, a test pilot, FAA test pilot, or aviation safety inspector may meet the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section in lieu of the aeronautical experience requirements of § 61.129(e)(3) and (4) of this chapter.


(1) A test pilot, FAA test pilot, or aviation safety inspector may receive 20 hours of flight training on the areas of operation listed in § 61.127(b)(5) of this chapter from an instructor pilot for the manufacturer of an experimental powered-lift in lieu of an authorized instructor, provided—


(i) The training is conducted in accordance with the manufacturer's proposed training curriculum in the experimental powered-lift; and


(ii) The test pilot, FAA test pilot, or aviation safety inspector receives a logbook or training record endorsement from the instructor pilot certifying that the test pilot satisfactorily completed the training curriculum specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.


(2) A test pilot, FAA test pilot, or aviation safety inspector may accomplish the practical test preparation requirements in § 61.129(e)(3)(iv) of this chapter with a pilot who serves as an instructor pilot for the manufacturer of the experimental powered-lift.


(3) A test pilot, FAA test pilot, or aviation safety inspector may satisfy the aeronautical experience requirement in § 61.129(e)(4) of this chapter by logging at least 10 hours of solo flight time under an endorsement from an instructor pilot or performing the duties of pilot-in-command in an experimental powered-lift with one of the following individuals onboard (which may be credited towards the flight time requirement in §§ 61.129(e)(2), and (e)(2)(ii) of this chapter and 194.216(a))—


(i) A test pilot for the manufacturer of the powered-lift who is authorized by the Administrator to act as pilot-in-command of the experimental powered-lift; or


(ii) An instructor pilot for the manufacturer of the powered-lift who is authorized by the Administrator to act as pilot-in-command of the experimental powered-lift.


(4) A test pilot, FAA test pilot, or aviation safety inspector may satisfy the alternate requirements in § 194.233 in lieu of the cross-country aeronautical experience requirements specified in § 61.129(e)(3)(ii) and (iii) and (e)(4)(i) of this chapter.


(c) *Alternate logging requirement.* Notwithstanding the logging requirements in § 61.51(e)(1) of this chapter, an applicant for a commercial pilot certificate with a powered-lift category rating may log pilot-in-command flight time for the purpose of satisfying the aeronautical experience requirements in §§ 61.129(e)(2)(ii) and 194.216(a) of this chapter for flights when the pilot is the sole manipulator of the controls of an experimental powered-lift for which the pilot is not rated, provided—


(1) The test pilot, FAA test pilot, or aviation safety inspector is acting as pilot-in-command of the experimental powered-lift in accordance with a letter of authorization issued by the Administrator; and


(2) The flight is conducted for the purpose of research and development or showing compliance with the regulations in this chapter in accordance with the experimental certificate issued to the powered-lift pursuant to § 21.191 of this chapter.
