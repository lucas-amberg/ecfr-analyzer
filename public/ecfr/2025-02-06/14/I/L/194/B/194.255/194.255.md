(b) The limitation described in paragraph (a) of this section may be removed from the rating if the person complies with the following:

(2) Logs each flight and the observing pilot attests in writing to each flight, and


(3) Presents evidence of the supervised operating experience to any examiner or Flight Standards office to have the limitation removed.


(c) The observing pilot must have unobstructed visual sight of the controls and instrumentation.
