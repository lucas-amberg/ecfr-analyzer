(1) Part 205, with the minimum coverage requirements of § 205.5(b),


(2) Part 215, 


(3) Part 298, subpart D, §§ 298.30, and 298.38, and subpart H, and 


(4) Part 298, subpart F, if the certificated carrier conducts operations with small aircraft only (a certificated carrier conducting operations with both small and large aircraft is subject only to the reporting requirements contained in part 241 of this chapter).


(b) If a certificated carrier, when conducting operations with small aircraft, provides foreign air transportation that includes a segment for which tariff filing is required and another segment for which tariff filing is not required, then for through service over that routing the carrier has the option of filing a tariff or charging the sum of the applicable local rates, fares, or charges. If the carrier files a tariff for through service, it is not exempt from Chapter 415 or section 41310 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII for that air transportation.
