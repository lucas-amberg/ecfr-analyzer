(d)(1) Applications shall be filed at least 5 business days before commencement of the proposed flight or flights, except as specified in paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(4) of this section. Late applications may be considered upon a showing of good cause for the lateness.

(e)(1) Any person may file a memorandum supporting or opposing an application. Three copies of each memorandum shall be filed within 7 business days after service of the application or before the date of the proposed flight or flights, whichever is earlier. Memorandums will be considered to the extent practicable; the Department may act on an application without waiting for supporting or opposing memorandums to be filed.


(2) Each memorandum shall set forth the reasons why the application should be granted or denied, accompanied by whatever data, including affidavits, the Department is requested to consider.


(3) A copy of each memorandum shall be served on the certified or foreign air carrier applying for approval.


(f)(1) Unless otherwise ordered by the Department, each application and memorandum filed in response will be available for public inspection at the Office of International Aviation immediately upon filing. Such information with respect to codeshare applications and responsive pleadings will be available for public inspection at DOT Dockets or at the DOT Dockets website. Notice of the filing of all applications shall be published in the Department's Weekly List of Applications Filed.


(2) Any person objecting to public disclosure of any information in an application or memorandum must state the grounds for the objection in writing. If the Department finds that disclosure of all or part of the information would adversely affect the objecting person, and that the public interest does not require disclosure, it will order that the injurious information be withheld.
