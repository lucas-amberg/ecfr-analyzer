# ยง 217.9   Waivers from reporting requirements.

(a) A waiver from any reporting requirement contained in Schedule T-100(f) may be granted by the Department upon its own initiative, or upon the submission of a written request of the air carrier to the Director, Office of Airline Information, when such a waiver is in the public interest.


(b) Each request for waiver must demonstrate that: Existing peculiarities or unusual circumstances warrant a departure from the prescribed procedure or technique; a specifically defined alternative procedure or technique will result in substantially equivalent or more accurate portrayal of the operations reported; and the application of such alternative procedure will not adversely affect the uniformity in reporting applicable to all air carriers.
