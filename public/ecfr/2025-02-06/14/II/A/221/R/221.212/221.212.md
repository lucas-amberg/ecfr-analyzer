(a) When a filer submits an electronic tariff or an amendment to an electronic tariff for which authority is sought to effect changes on less than bilateral/statutory notice, and no related tariff material is involved, the submission shall bear a sequential filing advice number. The submission shall appear in the Government Filing File and the Filing Advice Status File, and shall be referenced in such a manner to clearly indicate that such changes are sought to be made on less than bilateral/statutory notice.
