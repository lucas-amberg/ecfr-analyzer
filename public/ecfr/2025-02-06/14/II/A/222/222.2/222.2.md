# § 222.2   Scope of permissible intermodal cargo services.

(a) Under its foreign air carrier permit, a direct foreign air carrier may provide or control the surface portion of intermodal cargo services within a zone extending 35 miles from the boundary of the airport or city it is authorized to serve. A direct foreign air carrier shall not provide or control the surface portion of intermodal cargo services outside of this 35-mile zone unless authorized to do so by the Department in accordance with §§ 222.3, 222.4 and 222.5.


(b) A direct foreign air carrier shall be considered to control the surface portion of intermodal cargo services if it has or publicly represents that it has any responsibility for or control over the movement of, or has any ownership, controlling or exclusive dealing relationship with, the carrier actually providing the surface transportation.


(c) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section with respect to control by a direct foreign air carrier, any U.S. or foreign indirect air carrier, surface carrier or surface freight forwarder may provide the surface portion of intermodal cargo services without limitation as to geographic area within the United States.


(d) The Department may withdraw the authority of an indirect foreign air carrier to provide the surface portion of intermodal cargo services, or the authority of a direct foreign air carrier to offer intermodal cargo services pursuant to joint fares with other carriers providing the surface transportation, at any time, with or without hearing, if the Department finds it in the public interest.
