# Section 6   Objective Classification of Balance Sheet Elements

(a) Record here all general and working funds available on demand as of the date of the balance sheet which are not formally restricted or earmarked for specific objectives. Funds deposited for special purposes which are to be satisfied within one year shall be included in account 1100 Short-term Investments and funds restricted as to general availability, which are not offset by current liabilities, shall be included in account 1550 Special Funds. 


(b) Each air carrier shall subdivide this account in such manner that the balance can be readily segregated as between balances in United States currency and the balances in each foreign currency. 


(a) Record here the cost of short-term investments such as special deposits and United States Government securities, any other temporary cash investments, and the allowance for unrealized gain or loss on current marketable equity securities. 


(b) Special deposits for more than one year, not offset by current liabilities, shall not be included in this account but in account 1550 Special Funds. 


(c) This account should be charged or credited for discount or premium on United States Government securities or other securities which should be amortized to profit and loss account 80 Interest Income. 


(a) Record here current notes receivable including those from associated companies, company personnel, and all other sources.

(a) Record here accruals for estimated losses from uncollectible accounts. 


(b) All accounts against which allowances have been established shall be examined quarterly for the purpose of redetermining the basis of accruals to be applied to subsequent accounting periods and the reasonableness of allowances already provided. 


(a) Record here the cost of: 


(1) Flight equipment replacement parts of a type which ordinarily would be recurrently expended and replaced rather than repaired and reused; 


(2) Unissued fuel inventories for use in the overall or system operations of the carrier. Adjustments of inventories for aircraft fuel due to retroactive price increases and decreases shall not be entered in this account but in profit and loss account 45, Aircraft Fuels and Oils; and 


(3) Unissued and unapplied materials and supplies held in stock such as unissued shop materials, expendable tools, stationery and office supplies, passenger service supplies, and restaurant and food service supplies. 


(b) Costs paid by the air carrier such as transportation charges and customs duties; excise, sales, use and other taxes; special insurance; and other charges applicable to the cost of spare parts and supplies shall be charged to this account when they can be definitely allocated to specific items or units of property. If such costs cannot be so allocated, or if of minor significance in relation to the cost of such property, such amounts may be charged to balance sheet account 1890 Other Assets and Deferred Charges and cleared either by a suitable “loading charge” as the parts are used or by current charges to appropriate expense or property accounts; so long as the method of application does not cause material distortion in operating expenses from one accounting period to another. 


(c) Reusable spare parts and supplies recovered in connection with construction, maintenance, or retirement of property and equipment shall be included in this account at fair and reasonable values but in no case shall such values exceed original cost. Recoveries of normally reparable and reusable parts of a type for which losses in value may be covered on a practical basis through valuation allowance provisions shall be included in this account on an original cost basis. Scrap and nonusable parts, expensed from this account and recovered, shall be included at net amounts realizable therefrom with contra credit to the expense accounts initially charged. 


(d) The cost of rotable parts and assemblies of material value included in this account which ordinarily are repaired and reused and possess a service life approximating that of the primary property types to which related shall not be recorded in this account but in balance sheet account 1608 Flight Equipment Rotable Parts and Assemblies. For purposes of identifying rotable parts and assemblies of insignificant unit value which may be included in this account, a reasonable maximum unit value limitation may be established. 


(e) Any losses sustained or gains realized upon the abandonment or other disposition of flight equipment expendable parts shall be taken up as capital gains or losses in the periods in which sustained or realized. (See balance sheet account 1311.) 


(f) Items in this account shall be charged to appropriate expense accounts as issued for use. Profit and loss on sales of inventory items as a routine service to others shall be included in profit and loss accounts 14 General Service Sales—Associated Companies, or 16 General Service Sales—Outside, and the parts sold shall be removed from this accounts at full cost.

(i) Subaccounts shall be established within this account for the separate recording of each class or type of spare parts and supplies. 


(a) Accruals shall be made to this account when allowances are established for losses in the value of expendable parts. The accruals to this account shall be made by charges to profit and loss account 73 Provisions for Obsolescence and Deterioration—Expendable Parts. Records shall be maintained with sufficient detail to permit association of the allowances with each class or type of expendable parts. 


(b) The accruals to this account shall be based upon a predetermination by the air carrier of that portion of the total inventory of each class and type of expendable parts against which an allowance for loss is to be accrued. Expendable parts issued for use in operations shall be charged to operating expenses as issued and shall not be charged to this account. If at the end of any calendar year the amount of the allowance exceeds the product of the applicable inventory for the year determined consistently on a year-end or average basis, and the sum of the standard percentage accrual rates for all prior years including the current, the allowance shall be adjusted downward by the amount of the excess. Such adjustments shall be charged to this account and credited to profit and loss account 73 Provisions for Obsolescence and Deterioration—Expendable Parts. 


(c) Where changing conditions necessitate a revision or adjustment in rates of accrual, such revision or adjustment shall be made applicable to current and subsequent accounting periods and shall not be applied retroactively to prior accounting periods. Following retirement of airframe or aircraft engine types to which related, any balance remaining in this account shall be offset against related balances carried in balance sheet account 1300 Spare Parts and Supplies and the net cleared to profit and loss accounts 88.5 Capital Gains and Losses—Operating Property or 88.6 Capital Gains and Losses—Other.

(b) Costs chargeable to this account shall include items directly related to each specific developmental or preoperating project, such as travel and incidental expenses, legal expenses, flight crew training expenses, and regulatory proceedings expenses. Expenses which would be otherwise incurred in the normal air transport operations conducted by the air carrier during the current accounting period shall not be allocated to developmental or preoperating projects and charged to this account. Nor shall this account be credited for revenues from aircraft flights of a developmental or preoperating character the operating costs of which are charged to this account. Any such revenues shall be included in the profit and loss account for the respective type of revenue. This account shall include charges for only those costs associated with projects directed at obtaining new operating authority or expanding the physical capacity of the air carrier and shall not include costs incurred for the purpose of generating revenues through rate adjustment.
