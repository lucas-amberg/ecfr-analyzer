# ยง 19-8.6   Dissemination.

Any Ticket that is submitted that involves a Reporting Carrier and an International Point providing service in whole or in part under this part are generally not available to the Department, the U.S. carriers, or U.S. interests. Therefore, because of the damaging competitive impact on U.S. carriers and the adverse effect upon the public interest that would result from unilateral disclosure of international ticket survey data that involves a Reporting Carrier, the Department will not disclose international ticket data that involves a Reporting Carrier in the Passenger Origin-Destination Survey to citizens or non-citizens except:


(a) To an air carrier directly participating in and contributing input data to the Survey under this part or to a legal or consulting firm designated by a directly participating air carrier to use on its behalf and in connection with a specific assignment by such carrier;


(b) To parties to any proceeding before the Department to the extent that such data are relevant and material to the issues in the proceeding upon a determination to this effect by the Administrative Law Judge or by the Department's decision-maker. Any data to which access is granted pursuant to this section may be introduced into evidence subject to the normal rules of admissibility of evidence;


(c) To agencies and other components of the U.S. Government;


(d) To other persons upon a showing that the release of the data will serve specifically identified needs of U.S. users which are consistent with U.S. interests; and


(e) To foreign governments and foreign users as provided in formal reciprocal arrangements between the foreign and U.S. Governments for the exchange of comparable O&D data.
