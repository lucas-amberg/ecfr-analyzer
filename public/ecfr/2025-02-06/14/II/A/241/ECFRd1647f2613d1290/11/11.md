(b) This function shall not include expenses incurred directly in promoting traffic or in promoting relations of the air carrier generally with the public which shall be included in function 6700 Promotion and Sales. Nor shall this function include expenses, regularly applicable in large part to a specific function, which contribute only incidentally, or in small amount, to various other functions. Such expenses when of such size as will not distort the function to which predominantly related, shall be included in the specific function to which regularly related. However, expenses of a general administrative character and of significant amount regularly contributing to operating functions generally shall be included in this function. 


This function shall include all charges to expense to record losses suffered through current exhaustion of the serviceability of property and equipment due to wear and tear from use and the action of time and the elements, which are not replaced by current repairs, as well as losses in serviceability occasioned by obsolescence, supersession, discoveries, change in popular demand or action by public authority. It shall also include charges for the amortization of capitalized developmental and preoperating costs, leased property under capital leases, and other intangible assets applicable to the performance of air transportation. (See sections 6-1696, 1830 and 1890.)

Expenses applicable to the generation of such revenues shall be included in profit and loss classification 8100, Nonoperating Income and Expense-Net, and the accounting modified to conform with that of a nontransport division whether or not the service is organized as a nontransport division. 


(c) This function shall also include expenses representing increases in costs incurred in common with the air transport service, to the extent such increases result from the added transport-related services, as well as a pro rata share of the costs incurred by the air carrier in operating facilities which are used jointly with others. As a general rule, this function shall not include those expenses, other than joint facilities, costs, which would remain as an essential part of the air transport services if the transport-related services were terminated.
