(e) *Maximum authorized takeoff weight* has the meaning assigned to it in regulations of the Canadian Transport Commission.


(f) *Maximum certificated takeoff weight* means the maximum takeoff weight authorized by the terms of the aircraft airworthiness certificate. This weight may be found in the airplane operating record or in the airplane flight manual that is incorporated by regulation into the airworthiness certificate.
