Any requests for extension of time for filing of an answer to such complaint shall be filed in accordance with § 302.11. 


(b) All answers shall be served in accordance with § 302.7 and shall fully and completely advise the parties and the Department as to the nature of the defense and shall admit or deny specifically and in detail each allegation of the complaint unless the respondent is without knowledge, in which case, his or her answer shall so state and the statement shall operate as a denial.
