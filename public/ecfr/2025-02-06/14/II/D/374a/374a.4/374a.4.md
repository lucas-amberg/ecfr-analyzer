# ยง 374a.4   Conditions governing extension of unsecured credit.

(a) Unless adequate security is posted, or full payment in advance is made, no air carrier shall provide transportation to any person it knows, or has reasons to know, is a candidate or a person acting on behalf of such candidate, in connection with the campaign of such candidate, except in accordance with, and subject to, the following conditions: 


(1) At least once a month the air carrier shall submit to each such candidate or person a statement covering all unsecured credit extended to such candidate or person, as the case may be (whether in connection with the campaign of such candidate or otherwise.) 


(2) Such statements shall be mailed no later than the second business day following the last day of the billing period, covered by the statement. 


(3) The amount of indebtedness shown on each such statement shall be payable in full no later than 25 days after the last day of the billing period, after which time the indebtedness shall be overdue.


(4)(i) Unsecured credit shall not be extended by an air carrier to a candidate, or to any person acting on his behalf in connection with the campaign of such candidate, so long as any overdue indebtedness of such candidate to such air carrier shall remain unpaid, in whole or in part, or so long as such air carrier shall know that any overdue indebtedness of such candidate to any other air carrier remains unpaid, in whole or in part. 


(ii) Unsecured credit shall not be extended by an air carrier to a person acting on behalf of a candidate, for transportation in connection with the campaign of such candidate, so long as any overdue indebtedness of such person to such carrier shall remain unpaid, in whole or in part, or so long as such air carrier shall know that any overdue indebtedness of such person to any other air carrier remains unpaid, in whole or in part. 


(5)(i) With respect to transportation in connection with the campaign of any candidate to be performed after June 1, 1972, unsecured credit shall not be extended by an air carrier to any person acting on behalf of such candidate unless the carrier is authorized in writing by such candidate to extend such credit. The foregoing sentence shall not be construed as requiring the candidate to assume liability to the carrier for credit so extended. 


(ii) Within 7 days after indebtedness becomes overdue for any unsecured credit extended by an air carrier to a person acting on behalf of a candidate in accordance with paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, the carrier shall notify the candidate in writing of the amount of the overdue indebtedness, and, unless paid in full within 25 days after the date of such notice, the overdue indebtedness shall be deemed to be the overdue indebtedness of the candidate, for the purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section.


(b) It shall be presumed that a candidate or person acting on behalf of a candidate intends to use transportation in connection with the campaign of such candidate for nomination for election, or election, to Federal office.
