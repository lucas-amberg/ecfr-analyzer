(a) Air carriers shall make monthly reports to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics with respect to the credit for transportation furnished to candidates, or persons acting on behalf of candidates, during the period from 6 months before nomination, if any, or from 6 months before election, until the date of election. After that 6-month period, air carriers shall file such a report with the Bureau of Transportation Statistics not later than the 20th day following the end of the calendar month in which the election or nomination takes place, and thereafter when any change occurs in that report, until a negative report is filed showing that no debt for such extension of credit is owed to the carrier.


(b)(1) A separate report shall be filed for each candidate with an aggregate indebtedness balance of over $5,000 on the last day of the month to which the report pertains. The report shall cover all debts incurred by the candidate, whether or not incurred in connection with his campaign, and all debts incurred by persons acting on his behalf in connection with such campaign. The indebtedness accounts reported shall be those which the air carrier knows, or has reason to know, have been incurred by or on behalf of a candidate; and it shall be presumed that the transportation for which the indebtedness has been incurred is intended to be used in connection with the campaign of such candidate for nomination for election, or election, to Federal office. 


(2) The reports required by this paragraph (b) shall be filed with the Office of Airline Information not later than the 20th day following the end of the calendar month to which the report pertains. They shall include the following data: (i) Name of account; (ii) the credit limit established for such account; (iii) the balance, if any, of the amount payable for transportation not paid for in advance; (iv) any unpaid balance of the charges for such transportation as of the last day of the month covered by the report, and the length of time that such balance has remained unpaid; and (v) a description of the type and value of any bond, collateral, or other security securing such unpaid balance. 


(3) The report required by this paragraph (b) shall be in the form attached hereto as appendix A.

(c) A separate report shall be filed for each person acting on behalf of any candidate, if the aggregate indebtedness balance of such person to the reporting air carrier (including all debts incurred by such person, whether or not incurred in connection with the campaign of a candidate, as defined in this part) is over $5,000 on the last day of the month to which the report pertains. The report shall be filed with the Office of Airline Information not later than the 20th day following the end of the calendar month to which the report pertains and shall include (1) the credit limitation established for such person; (2) the balance, if any, of the amount payable for transportation not paid for in advance; (3) any unpaid balance of the charges for such transportation as of the last day of the month covered by the report, and the length of time that such balance has remained unpaid; and (4) a description of the type and value of any bond, collateral, or other security securing such unpaid balance.
