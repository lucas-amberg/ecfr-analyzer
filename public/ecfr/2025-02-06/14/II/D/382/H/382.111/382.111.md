As a carrier, you must provide services within the aircraft cabin as requested by or on behalf of passengers with a disability, or when offered by carrier personnel and accepted by passengers with a disability, as follows:


(a) Assistance in moving to and from seats, as part of the enplaning and deplaning processes;


(b) Assistance in preparation for eating, such as opening packages and identifying food;


(c) If there is an on-board wheelchair on the aircraft, assistance with the use of the on-board wheelchair to enable the person to move to and from a lavatory;
