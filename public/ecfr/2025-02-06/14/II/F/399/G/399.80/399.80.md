# ยง 399.80   Unfair and deceptive practices of ticket agents.

It is the policy of the Department to regard as an unfair or deceptive practice or unfair method of competition the practices enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (o) of this section by a ticket agent of any size and the practice enumerated in paragraph (s) of this section by a ticket agent that sells air transportation online and is not considered a small business under the Small Business Administration's size standards set forth in 13 CFR 121.201:




(a) Misrepresentations 
1 which may induce members of the public to believe that the ticket agent is an air carrier. 


(b) Using or displaying or permitting or suffering to be used or displayed the name, trade name, slogan or any abbreviation thereof, of the ticket agent, in advertisements, on or in places of business, or on aircraft in connection with the name of an air carrier with whom it does business, in such manner that it may mislead or confuse the traveling public with respect to the agency status of the ticket agent. 


(c) Misrepresentations as to the quality or kind of service, type or size of aircraft, time of departure or arrival, points served, route to be flown, stops to be made, or total trip-time from point of departure to destination. 


(d) Misrepresentation as to qualifications of pilots or safety record or certification of pilots, aircraft or air carriers. 


(e) Misrepresentations that passengers are directly insured when they are not so insured; for example, where the only insurance in force is that protecting the air carrier in event of liability. 


(f) Misrepresentations as to fares and charges for air transportation or services in connection therewith. 


(g) Misrepresentation that special discounts or reductions are available, when such discounts or reductions are not specific in the lawful tariffs of the air carrier which is to perform the transportation. 


(h) [Reserved]


(i) Misrepresentations that special priorities for reservations are available when such special considerations are not in fact granted to members of the public generally. 


(j) Selling air transportation to persons on a reservation or charter basis for specified space, flight, or time, or representing that such definite reservation or charter is or will be available or has been arranged, without a binding commitment with an air carrier for the furnishing of such definite reservation or charter as represented or sold. 


(k) Selling or issuing tickets or other documents to passengers to be exchanged or used for air transportation knowing or having reason to know or believe that such tickets or other documents will not be or cannot be legally honored by air carriers for air transportation. 


(l) Failing to make a prompt refund of airfare (including any taxes and ancillary fees) to a consumer, upon request, for a cancelled flight or a significantly delayed or changed flight if the consumer chooses not to travel or accept compensation in lieu of a refund in situations described in 14 CFR 260.6(a) and (b) when the ticket agent is the merchant of record. Failing to provide a prompt refund of airfare (including any taxes and ancillary fees), upon request, for a significantly delayed or changed flight itinerary to consumers on the same reservation as an individual with a disability who does not want to continue travel because of a significant change described in paragraph (l)(1)(vii)(E) of this section related to downgrades or paragraph (l)(1)(vii)(G) of this section related to aircraft substitution which result in one or more accessibility features needed by the individual with a disability becoming unavailable or because of the significant change described in paragraph (l)(1)(vii)(F) of this section related to change in connecting airports. A prompt refund is one that is made within 7 business days of the ticket agent receiving information from a carrier as specified in 14 CFR 260.6(d), as required by 12 CFR part 1026 for credit card purchases, and within 20 calendar days of refund becoming due for cash, check, debit card, or other forms of purchases. Ticket agents must provide the refunds in the original form of payment (*i.e.,* money is returned to individual using whatever payment method the individual used to make the original payment, such as a check, a credit card, a debit card, cash, or airline miles), unless the consumer agrees to receive the refund in another form of payment that is cash equivalent. A ticket agent may retain a service fee charged when issuing the original ticket to the extent that service is for more than processing payment for a flight that the consumer found. That fee must be on a per-passenger basis and its existence, amount, and the non-refundable nature if that is the case must be clearly and prominently disclosed to consumers at the time they purchase the airfare. Ticket agents may offer alternative transportation, travel credits, vouchers, or other compensation that remains valid and redeemable by the consumer for a period of at least 5 years from the date on which such voucher, credit, or other form of compensation in lieu of refunds but must first inform consumers that they are entitled to a refund if that is the case. Ticket agents must clearly disclose any material restrictions, conditions, and limitations on travel credits, vouchers, or other compensation they offer, including the expiration date of the travel credits, vouchers, or other compensation, which must be provided, upon request, to an individual who self identifies as an individual with a disability in an electronic format accessible to the recipient.

It is not cash equivalent if consumers bear the burden for maintenance or usage fees related to the payment.
