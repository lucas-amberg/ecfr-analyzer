# § 399.85   Notice of ancillary service fees.

(a) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:


*Air transportation* means interstate air transportation, foreign air transportation, or the transportation of mail by aircraft as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(23) and (25).


*Ancillary service fee* means the fee charged for any optional service related to air travel that a U.S. or foreign air carrier provides beyond passenger air transportation. Such fees may include, but are not limited to, fees for checked or carry-on baggage, advance seat selection, access to in-flight entertainment programs, in-flight beverages, lounge access, snacks and meals, pillows and blankets, and seat upgrades.


*Ancillary service package* means a package or bundle of one or more ancillary services offered for sale by a carrier or ticket agent.


*Anonymous itinerary search* means a search that does not take into account information specific to the passenger but does take into account information specific to the itinerary (*e.g.,* geography, travel dates, cabin class, and ticketed fare class) that may impact the critical ancillary service fees to be charged or policies to be applied.


*Break in journey* means a deliberate interruption by a passenger of a journey between a point in the United States and a point in a foreign country where a stopover at a foreign point is scheduled. The factors to consider to determine whether a stopover is a deliberate interruption include whether the segment between two foreign points and the segment between a foreign point and the United States were purchased in a single transaction and as a single ticket/itinerary, whether the segment between two foreign points is operated or marketed by a carrier that has no codeshare or interline agreement with the carrier operating or marketing the segment to or from the United States, and whether the stopover at a foreign point involves the passenger picking up checked baggage, leaving the airport, and continuing the next segment after a substantial amount of time.


*Clear and conspicuous* means that a disclosure is difficult to miss (*i.e.,* easily noticeable), easily understandable by consumers, and presented in a manner that allows consumers to determine the true cost and enable them to select the best flight options for them.


*Critical ancillary service* means any ancillary service critical to consumers' purchasing decisions. Such services are: transporting the first checked bag, the second checked bag, or a carry-on bag, the ability for a consumer to cancel or change a reservation, and any other services determined, after notice and opportunity to comment, to be critical by the Secretary.


*Consumer* or *user* refers to a person who seeks to obtain information about or purchase air transportation from a U.S. carrier, a foreign carrier, or a ticket agent, whether through an online platform or other means (*e.g.,* over the telephone, in person).


*Corporate travel agent* refers to a ticket agent engaged in providing travel services to the employees of a business entity pursuant to a written contract with that entity for the business travel of its employees.


*Online platform* refers to any interactive electronic medium, including, but not limited to, websites and mobile applications, that allow the consumer to search for or purchase air transportation from a U.S. carrier, a foreign carrier, or a ticket agent.


*Passenger-specific itinerary search* means a search that takes into account information specific to the passenger (*e.g.,* the passenger's status in the airline's frequent flyer program, the passenger's military status, or the passenger's status as a holder of a particular credit card) that was affirmatively provided by that passenger and information specific to the itinerary (*e.g.,* geography, travel dates, cabin class, and ticketed fare class) that may impact the critical ancillary service fees to be charged or policies to be applied.


(b) *Passenger-specific and anonymous itinerary searches.* Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that advertises or sells air transportation marketed to U.S. consumers must offer consumers both the option to conduct a passenger-specific itinerary search and the option to conduct an anonymous itinerary search.


(c) *Online disclosures of ancillary service fees*—(1) *Critical ancillary service fees.* Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must clearly and conspicuously disclose on its online platform the accurate fee that applies, if any, for all critical ancillary services. The fee cannot be designated as $0 in circumstances where a critical ancillary service is not available to the consumer but rather must state “not available” or a similar notation. The fee information must be provided the first time that fare and schedule information is disclosed after a consumer conducts a passenger-specific itinerary search or an anonymous itinerary search. The fees cannot be displayed through a hyperlink.


(2) *Other ancillary service fees.* Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation may disclose ancillary service fees that are not critical ancillary service fees at the same time as critical ancillary service fees.


(3) *Ancillary service packages.* Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must disclose the standalone fee for each critical ancillary service required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section when fare and schedule information is provided. Nothing in this section requires or prohibits a carrier or ticket agent from disclosing an ancillary service package that includes critical ancillary services if it chooses to do so.


(4) *Air tour packages.* Each ticket agent that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air tour packages must clearly and conspicuously disclose, at the time the ticket agent offers a package fare quotation for a specific itinerary selected by a consumer, where the carrier providing air transportation is not known, that additional fees for baggage may apply and that those fees may be reduced or waived based on the passenger's frequent flyer status, method of payment, or other consumer characteristic. When the carrier providing air transportation for an air-tour package is known, that ticket agent must provide baggage fee information as prescribed by this paragraph (c) at the time that the ticket agent discloses the name of the carrier to the consumer.


(5) *Website disclosure of all ancillary service fees.* A U.S. or foreign air carrier that has a website marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must clearly and conspicuously disclose on its website accurate information on ancillary service fees available to a passenger purchasing air transportation with a clear and conspicuous link from the carrier's homepage directly to a page or a place on a page where all such ancillary services and related fees are disclosed. In general, fees for particular services may be expressed as a range; however, baggage fees must be expressed as specific charges taking into account any factors (*e.g.,* frequent flyer status, early purchase) that affect those charges.


(d) *Online disclosure of baggage policies.* Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must clearly and conspicuously disclose on its online platform, before ticket purchase, the accurate weight and dimension limitations that the carrier imposes for a first and second checked bag and a carry-on bag after a consumer conducts a passenger-specific itinerary search or an anonymous itinerary search.


(e) *Intent to travel with a bag.* Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation may clearly and conspicuously solicit information from a consumer prior to the consumer conducting a passenger-specific itinerary or an anonymous itinerary search for air transportation regarding the consumer's intention to travel with a carry-on bag, a first checked bag, or a second checked bag. If the consumer affirmatively takes action to indicate that the consumer and all others in the booking party do not intend to travel with a carry-on bag, a first checked bag, or a second checked bag, then the carrier or ticket agent may forego disclosing the fees for that bag with the fare and schedule information as required by paragraph (c) of this section. Carriers and ticket agents (except a corporate travel agent) must disclose the baggage policies before ticket purchase as required by paragraph (d) of this section and must disclose information regarding the passenger's free baggage allowance and fee information for a carry-on bag, a first checked bag, and a second checked bag on e-ticket confirmations as required by paragraph (k) of this section even if a consumer indicates an intention not to travel with a bag.


(f) *Online disclosure of cancellation and change policies.* Each U.S. carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must accurately, clearly, and conspicuously, disclose on its online platform, before ticket purchase, the components of change and cancellation policies identified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section.


(1) *Restrictions and prohibitions.* A summary of the applicable restrictions and prohibitions to change or cancel a ticket that apply to the consumer conducting a passenger-specific itinerary or an anonymous itinerary search, including any prohibitions or restrictions to obtaining a refund of the full amount paid;


(2) *Form of refund.* A summary of the applicable policy regarding the form of the refund for a change or cancellation (*e.g.,* a credit to the original form of payment, airline credits or voucher) that apply to the consumer conducting a passenger-specific itinerary or an anonymous itinerary search;


(3) *Fare differential.* A summary of the applicable policy regarding a consumer's right to, or responsibility for, any fare differential, including whether the consumer is entitled to a refund in fare difference if the consumer changes to a lower cost replacement flight, that apply to the consumer conducting a passenger-specific itinerary or an anonymous itinerary search; and


(4) *24-Hour hold or cancellation.* A statement disclosed clearly and conspicuously on the last page of the booking process on allowing the reservation to be held at the quoted fare without payment, or cancelled without penalty, for at least twenty-four hours after the reservation is made, consistent with a carrier's customer service plan in § 259.5(b)(4) of this chapter and consistent with a ticket agent's policy. A ticket agent that has a policy of not allowing a 24-hour hold or cancellation must disclose that information clearly and conspicuously on the last page of the booking process. The disclosures in this paragraph (f)(4) are required if the reservation is made one week or more prior to a flight's departure.


(g) *Disclosures on landing page.* Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it sells air transportation and that accepts a redirect of consumers to its online platform to complete the booking must ensure that the required critical ancillary service fee information in paragraph (c) of this section is accurately, clearly, and conspicuously displayed on the first page of the online platform to which the consumer has been directed, unless the consumer was provided accurate fee information of critical ancillary services on the directing entity's online platform.


(h) *Seat guarantee notice.* Each U.S. carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must clearly and conspicuously disclose the following notice on any page or step of the booking process in which a consumer is offered a seat selection for a fee: “A seat is included in your fare. You are not required to purchase a seat assignment to travel. If you decide to purchase a ticket and do not select a seat prior to purchase, a seat will be provided to you without additional charge when you travel.”


(i) *Code-share partner disclosures.* For air transportation within, to or from the United States, a carrier marketing a flight under its identity that is operated by a different carrier, otherwise known as a code-share flight, must through its website disclose to consumers booked on a code-share flight any differences between its optional services and related fees and those of the carrier operating the flight. This disclosure may be made through a conspicuous notice of the existence of such differences on the marketing carrier's website or a conspicuous hyperlink taking the reader directly to the operating carrier's fee listing or to a page on the marketing carrier's website that lists the differences in policies among code-share partners.


(j) *Offline fee disclosures of ancillary services.* Each U.S. air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that markets air transportation to U.S. consumers in person or by phone must disclose to consumers, at the time a fare is quoted for an itinerary, that baggage fees (for a first checked, second checked, or carry-on bag), change fees, and cancellation fees apply, if that is the case. The U.S. carrier, foreign carrier, or ticket agent (other than a corporate travel agent) must then ask the consumer if they wish to hear more about the specific baggage fees, change fees, cancellation fees, and any other critical ancillary service fees that apply. These carriers and ticket agents, upon request from the consumer, must disclose those specific fees taking into account passenger-specific information provided by the consumer.


(k) *Disclosures of baggage fees on e-ticket confirmations.* A U.S. carrier, a foreign air carrier, or a ticket agent (except a corporate travel agent) that has an online platform marketed to U.S. consumers where it advertises or sells air transportation must include information regarding the passenger's free baggage allowance (including personal item) and the applicable fee for a carry-on bag and the first and second checked bag on all e-ticket confirmations for air transportation within, to or from the United States, including on the summary page at the completion of an online purchase and in a post-purchase email confirmation. Carriers and ticket agents must provide the fee information for a carry-on bag, first checked bag, and second checked bag in text form in the e-ticket confirmation taking into account any passenger-specific factors that affect those charges.


(l) *Sharing information on fee rules and policies.* Each U.S. and foreign air carrier that provides fare, schedule, and availability information for air transportation within, to, or from the United States to an entity that is required by law to disclose critical ancillary service fee and policy information directly to consumers must disclose fee and policy information for critical ancillary fee services to that entity. The information provided must be useable, current, accurate, and sufficient to ensure compliance by such entities.


(m) *Unfair and deceptive practice.* The Department considers the failure to provide and adhere to the disclosures required by this section to be an unfair and deceptive practice within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712.
