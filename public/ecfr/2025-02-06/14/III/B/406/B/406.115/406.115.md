# ยง 406.115   Serving documents on other parties.

(a) *Service required.* A person must serve on each other party at the time of filing a copy of any document filed with the Federal Docket Management System. Service on a party's attorney or representative of record is adequate service on the party.


(b) *Method of service.* A person must serve documents by personal delivery or by mail. 


(c) *Certificate of service.* A person may attach a certificate of service to a document filed with the FDMS. Any certificate of service must include a statement, dated and signed by the individual filing the document, that the document was served on each party, the method of service, and the date of service.


(d) *Date of service.* The date of service is the date of personal delivery; or if mailed, the mailing date shown on the certificate of service, the date shown on the postmark if there is no certificate of service, or other mailing date shown by other evidence if there is no certificate of service or postmark. The date shown in the FDMS index is not necessarily the date of service. It is the date the FDMS received the document.


(e) *Additional time after service by mail.* Whenever a party has a right or a duty to act or to make any response within a prescribed period after service by mail, or on a specified date after service by mail, 5 days is added to the prescribed period. 


(f) *Service by the administrative law judge.* The administrative law judge must serve a copy of each document including, but not limited to, notices of pre-hearing conferences and hearings, rulings on motions, decisions, and orders, upon each party to the proceedings by personal delivery or by mail. 


(g) *Service made.* A document is deemed served in accordance with this subpart if it was properly addressed; was sent in accordance with this subpart; and was returned, not claimed, or refused. Service is considered valid as of the date and the time that the document was mailed, or personal delivery of the document was refused. 


(h) *Presumption of service.* There is a presumption of service where a party or a person, who customarily receives mail, or receives it in the ordinary course of business, at either the person's residence or the person's principal place of business, acknowledges receipt of the document.
