# ยง 406.121   Extension of time.

Before an appeal is filed with the FAA decisionmaker, the parties may seek an extension of time as follows: 


(a) *Extension of time by agreement of the parties.* The parties may agree to extend for a reasonable period of time for filing a document under this subpart with the agreement of the administrative law judge. The party seeking the extension of time must submit a draft order to the administrative law judge for signature, file it with the Federal Docket Management System, and serve it on each party.


(b) *Motion for extension of time.* If the parties do not agree to an extension of time for filing a document, a party desiring an extension may file with the Federal Docket Management System and serve a written motion for an extension of time not later than 7 days before the document is due unless good cause for the late filing is shown. The administrative law judge may grant the extension of time if good cause for the extension is shown.


(c) *Failure to rule.* If the administrative law judge fails to rule on a written motion for an extension of time by the date the document is due, the motion for an extension of time is granted for no more than 20 days after the original date the document was to be filed.
