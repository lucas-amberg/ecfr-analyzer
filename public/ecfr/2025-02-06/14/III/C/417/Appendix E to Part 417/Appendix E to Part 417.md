# Appendix E to Part 417—Flight Termination System Testing and Analysis


(a) *Scope and compliance.* This appendix contains requirements for tests and analyses that apply to all flight termination systems and the components that make up each flight termination system. Section 417.301 requires that a launch operator's flight safety system employ a flight termination system that complies with this appendix. Section 417.301 also contains requirements that apply to a launch operator's demonstration of compliance with the requirement of this appendix. A launch operator must employ on its launch vehicle only those flight termination system components that satisfy the requirements of this appendix. 


(b) *Component tests and analyses.* A component must satisfy each test or analysis required by any table of this appendix to demonstrate that the component satisfies all its performance specifications when subjected to non-operating and operating environments. A launch operator must identify and implement any additional test or analysis for any new technology or any unique application of an existing technology. 


(c) *Test plans.* Each test of a component, subsystem, or system must follow a written plan that specifies the test parameters, including pass/fail criteria, and a testing sequence that satisfy the requirements of this appendix. For any component that is used for more than one flight, the test plan must provide for component reuse qualification, refurbishment, and acceptance as required by section E417.7(g). The test plan must include any alternate procedures for testing a component when it is in place on the launch vehicle. 


(d) *Test failures.* If a test of a component results in a failure, the component does not satisfy the test requirement. Each of the following is a test failure:

(3) Any component sample with a test result that indicates that the component is out-of-family when compared to other samples of the component, even if the component satisfies other test criteria; 


(4) Any unexpected change in the performance of a component sample occurring at any time during testing; 


(5) Any component sample that exhibits any sign that a part is stressed beyond its design limit, such as a cracked circuit board, bent clamps, worn part, or loose connector or screw, even if the component passes the final functional test; 


(6) When component examination shows any defect that could adversely affect the component's performance; 


(7) Any discontinuity or dropout in a measured performance parameter that could prevent the component from satisfying a performance specification; 


(8) Any inadvertent output; or 


(9) Any indication of internal component damage. 


(e) *Failure analysis.* In the event of a test failure, the test item, procedures and equipment must undergo a written failure analysis.

If a repair requires disassembly of the component or soldering operations, the component must repeat any test necessary to demonstrate that the repair corrected the original anomaly and did not cause other damage. The total number of acceptance tests experienced by a repaired component must not exceed the environments for which the component is qualified.

(4) *Initial open-loop test of a secure high-alphabet command destruct system.* Any flight termination system that uses a secure high-alphabet command receiver decoder must undergo an open-loop radio frequency test to demonstrate the integrity of the system between the command control transmitter system and launch vehicle radio frequency system from the antenna to the command receiver decoders. The test must satisfy all of the following: 


(i) The test must occur before loading the secure flight code on to the command transmitting system and the command receiver decoders; 


(ii) The test must use a non-secure code, also known as a maintenance code, loaded on to the command control transmitting system and the command receiver decoders;

(5) *End-to-end test of a secure high-alphabet command destruct system.* Any flight termination system that uses a secure high-alphabet command receiver decoder must undergo an end-to-end test of all flight termination system subsystems, including command destruct systems and inadvertent separation destruct systems. The test must satisfy all of the following: 


(i) The system must undergo the test no earlier than 72 hours before the first flight attempt. After the test, if the flight is delayed more than 14 calendar days or the flight termination system configuration is broken or modified for any reason, such as to replace batteries, the system must undergo the end-to-end tests again no earlier than 72 hours before the next flight attempt; 


(ii) The system must undergo the test in a closed-loop configuration using the secure flight code; 


(iii) The flight termination system, except for the ordnance initiation devices, must undergo the test in its final onboard launch vehicle configuration; 


(iv) The test must use a destruct initiator simulator that satisfies § 417.307(h) in place of each flight initiator to demonstrate that the command destruct and inadvertent separation destruct systems deliver the energy required to initiate the flight termination system ordnance; 


(v) The flight termination system must undergo the test while powered by the batteries that the launch vehicle will use for flight. A flight termination system battery must not undergo recharging at any time during or after the end-to-end test. If the battery is recharged at any time before flight the system must undergo the end-to-end test again; 


(vi) The test must exercise all command receiver decoder functions critical to flight termination system operation during flight, including the pilot or check tone, in a closed-loop test configuration using ground support testing equipment hardwired to the launch vehicle radio frequency receiving system;
