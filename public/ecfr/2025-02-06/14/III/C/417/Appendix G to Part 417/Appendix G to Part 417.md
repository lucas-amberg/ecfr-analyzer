# Appendix G to Part 417—Natural and Triggered Lightning Flight Commit Criteria


This appendix provides flight commit criteria for mitigating against natural lightning strikes and lightning triggered by the flight of a launch vehicle through or near an electrified environment. A launch operator may not initiate flight unless the weather conditions at the time of launch satisfy all lightning flight commit criteria of this appendix.


(a) In order to meet the lightning flight commit criteria, a launch operator must employ any:


(1) Weather monitoring and measuring equipment needed, and


(2) Procedures needed to verify compliance.


(b) When equipment or procedures, such as a field mill or calculation of the volume-averaged, height-integrated radar reflectivity (VAHIRR) of clouds, are used with the lightning flight commit criteria to increase launch opportunities, a launch operator must evaluate all applicable measurements to determine whether the measurements satisfy the criteria. A launch operator may not turn off available instrumentation to create the appearance of meeting a requirement and must use all radar reflectivity measurements within a specified volume for a VAHIRR calculation.


(c) If a launch operator proposes any alternative lightning flight commit criteria, the launch operator must clearly and convincingly demonstrate that the alternative provides an equivalent level of safety to that required by this appendix.


For the purpose of this appendix:


*Anvil cloud* means a stratiform or fibrous cloud formed by the upper-level outflow or blow-off from a thunderstorm or convective cloud.


*Associated* means two or more clouds are caused by the same disturbed weather or are physically connected.


*Bright band* means an enhancement of radar reflectivity caused by frozen hydrometeors falling and beginning to melt at any altitude where the temperature is 0 degrees Celsius or warmer.


*Cloud* means a visible mass of suspended water droplets or ice crystals, or a combination of water droplets and ice crystals. The cloud is the entire volume containing such particles.


*Cloud layer* means a vertically continuous array of clouds, not necessarily of the same type, whose bases are approximately at the same altitude.


*Cone of silence* means the volume within which a radar cannot detect any object, and is an inverted circular cone centered on the radar antenna. A cone of silence consists of all elevation angles greater than the maximum elevation angle reached by the radar.


*Debris cloud* means any cloud, except an anvil cloud, that has become detached from a parent cumulonimbus cloud or thunderstorm, or that results from the decay of a parent cumulonimbus cloud or thunderstorm.


*Disturbed weather* means a weather system where a dynamical process destabilizes the air on a scale larger than the individual clouds or cells. Examples of disturbed weather include fronts, troughs, and squall lines.


*Electric field* means a vertical electric field (Ez) at the surface of the Earth.


*Field mill* means an electric-field sensor that uses a moving, grounded conductor to induce a time-varying electric charge on one or more sensing elements in proportion to the ambient electrostatic field.


*Flight path* means a launch vehicle's planned flight trajectory, and includes the trajectory's vertical and horizontal uncertainties resulting from all three-sigma guidance and performance deviations.


*Horizontal distance* means a distance that is measured horizontally between a field mill or electric field measurement point and the nearest part of the vertical projection of an object or flight path onto the surface of the Earth.


*Moderate precipitation* means a precipitation rate of 0.1 inches/hr or a radar reflectivity of 30 dBZ.


*Non-transparent* means that one or more of the following conditions apply:


(1) Objects above, including higher clouds, blue sky, and stars, are blurred, indistinct, or obscured when viewed from below when looking through a cloud at visible wavelengths; or objects below, including terrain, buildings, and lights on the ground, are blurred, indistinct, or obscured when viewed from above when looking through a cloud at visible wavelengths;


(2) Objects above an observer are seen distinctly only through breaks in a cloud; or


(3) The cloud has a radar reflectivity of 0 dBZ or greater.


*Precipitation* means detectable rain, snow, hail, graupel, or sleet at the ground; virga; or a radar reflectivity greater than 18 dBZ.


*Radar reflectivity* means the radar reflectivity factor due to hydrometeors, in dBZ.


*Slant distance* means the shortest distance between two ports, whether horizontal, vertical, or inclined, in three dimensional space.


*Thick cloud layer* means one or more cloud layers whose combined vertical extent from the base of the bottom cloud layer to the top of the uppermost cloud layer exceeds 4,500 feet. Cloud layers are combined with neighboring layers for determining total thickness only when they are physically connected by vertically continuous clouds.


*Thunderstorm* means any convective cloud that produces lightning.


*Transparent* means that any of the following conditions apply:


(1) Objects above, including higher clouds, blue sky, and stars, are not blurred, are distinct and are not obscured when viewed at visible wavelengths; or objects below, including terrain, buildings, and lights on the ground, are clear, distinct, and not obscured when viewed at visible wavelengths; (2) Objects identified in paragraph (1) of this definition are seen distinctly not only through breaks in a cloud; and (3) The cloud has a radar reflectivity of less than 0 dBZ.


*Triboelectrification* means the transfer of electrical charge between ice particles and a launch vehicle when the ice particles collide with the vehicle during flight.


*Volume-averaged, height integrated radar reflectivity (VAHIRR)* means the product, expressed in units of dBZ-km or dBZ-kft, of a volume-averaged radar reflectivity and an average cloud thickness in a specified volume corresponding to a point.
