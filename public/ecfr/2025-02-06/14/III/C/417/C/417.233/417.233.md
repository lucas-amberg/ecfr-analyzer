# ยง 417.233   Analysis for an unguided suborbital launch vehicle flown with a wind weighting safety system.

For each launch of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle flown with a wind weighting safety system, in addition to the other requirements in this subpart outlined in ยง 417.201(c), the flight safety analysis must:


(a) Establish flight commit criteria and other launch safety rules that a launch operator must implement to control the risk to the public from potential adverse effects resulting from normal and malfunctioning flight;


(b) Establish any wind constraints under which launch may occur; and


(c) Include a wind weighting analysis that establishes the launcher azimuth and elevation settings that correct for the windcocking and wind-drift effects on the unguided suborbital launch vehicle.
