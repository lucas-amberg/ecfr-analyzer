# ยง 431.7   Payload and payload reentry determinations.

(a) A payload determination is required to launch a payload unless the proposed payload is exempt from payload review under ยง 415.53 of this chapter. Requirements for obtaining a payload determination are set forth in part 415, subpart D of this chapter. 


(b) A payload reentry determination is required to reenter a payload to Earth on an RLV unless the proposed payload is exempt from payload reentry review. 


(c) A payload reentry determination made under a previous license application under this subchapter may satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. 


(d) The FAA conducts a review, as described in subpart D of this part, to make a payload reentry determination. Either an RLV mission license applicant or a payload owner or operator may request a review of the proposed payload using the application procedures contained in part 413 of this subchapter. Upon receipt of an application, the FAA may conduct a payload reentry review independently of an RLV mission license application.
