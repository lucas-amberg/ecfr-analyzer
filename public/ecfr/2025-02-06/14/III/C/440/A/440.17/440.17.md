(b) The licensee or permittee and each of its contractors and subcontractors, each customer, and each customer's contractors and subcontractors, must enter into a reciprocal waiver of claims agreement under which each party waives and releases claims against all the other parties to the waiver and against any other customer, and agrees to assume financial responsibility for property damage it sustains and for bodily injury or property damage sustained by its own employees, and to hold harmless and indemnify each other from bodily injury or property damage sustained by its employees, resulting from a licensed or permitted activity, regardless of fault.


(1) The licensee or permittee must extend the reciprocal waiver of claims requirements to each of its contractors and subcontractors involved in launch or reentry services, and each of its first-tier customers.

(c) For each licensed or permitted activity in which the United States, or its contractors and subcontractors, is involved or where property insurance is required under § 440.9(d), the Federal Aviation Administration of the Department of Transportation, the licensee or permittee, and each first-tier customer must enter into a reciprocal waiver of claims agreement. The reciprocal waiver of claims must be in a form acceptable to the Administrator, such as those contained in advisory circular AC 440.17-1, and must provide that:












(1) Each party to the reciprocal waiver of claims, including the United States but only to the extent provided in legislation:


(i) Waives and releases claims it may have against each other party to the reciprocal waiver of claims, any customer, and against their respective contractors and subcontractors, for property damage it sustains and for bodily injury or property damage sustained by its own employees, resulting from licensed or permitted activities, regardless of fault;


(ii) Assumes responsibility for property damage it sustains and for bodily injury or property damage sustained by its own employees, resulting from licensed or permitted activities, regardless of fault. A licensee or permittee and each first-tier customer shall each hold harmless and indemnify each other, the United States, any other customer, and the contractors and subcontractors of each for bodily injury or property damage sustained by its own employees, resulting from licensed or permitted activities, regardless of fault; and


(iii) Extends the requirements of the waiver and release of claims, and the assumption of responsibility, hold harmless, and indemnification, to its contractors and subcontractors involved in launch and reentry services, and, for each customer, to its contractors and subcontractors involved in launch and reentry services, and customers, by requiring them to waive and release all claims as follows:


(A) For each contractor and subcontractor of the licensee or permittee, all claims against any customer, the United States, and each of their respective contractors and subcontractors, and to agree to be responsible for property damage they sustain and to be responsible, hold harmless and indemnify any customer, the United States, and each of their respective contractors and subcontractors, for bodily injury or property damage sustained by their own employees, resulting from licensed activities, regardless of fault;


(B) For each contractor and subcontractor of any customer, all claims against the licensee or permittee, any other customer, the United States, and each of their respective contractors and subcontractors, and to agree to be responsible for property damage they sustain and to be responsible, hold harmless and indemnify the licensee or permittee, any other customer, the United States, and each of their respective contractors and subcontractors, for bodily injury or property damage sustained by their own employees, resulting from licensed activities, regardless of fault;


(C) For each contractor and subcontractor of the United States, all claims against the licensee or permittee, any customer, and each of their respective contractors and subcontractors, and to agree to be responsible for property damage they sustain and to be responsible, hold harmless and indemnify the licensee or permittee, any other customer, the United States, and each of their respective contractors and subcontractors, for bodily injury or property damage sustained by their own employees, resulting from licensed activities, regardless of fault to the extent that claims they would otherwise have for such damage or injury exceed the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility required under § 440.9(c) and (e);


(D) For each part 440 customer, all claims against the licensee or permittee, any other customer, the United States, and each of their respective contractors and subcontractors; and to agree to be responsible for property damage they sustain and to be responsible, hold harmless and indemnify the licensee or permittee, any other customer, the United States, and each of their respective contractors and subcontractors, for bodily injury or property damage sustained by their own employees, resulting from licensed activities, regardless of fault; and


(2) For the following parties—


(i) The licensee or permittee must hold harmless and indemnify each first-tier customer and its directors, officers, servants, agents, subsidiaries, employees and assignees, or any of them; the United States and its servants, agents, subsidiaries, employees and assignees, or any of them; and any part 440 customer and its directors, officers, servants, agents, subsidiaries, employees and assignees, or any of them from and against liability, loss or damage arising out of claims that any of licensee's or permittee's contractors and subcontractors may have for property damage sustained by them and for bodily injury or property damage sustained by their employees, resulting from licensed or permitted activities and arising out of the indemnifying party's failure to implement properly the waiver requirement. The requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section to hold harmless and indemnify the United States and its servants, agents, subsidiaries, employees and assignees, or any of them, does not apply when:


(A) Claims result from willful misconduct of the United States or its agents;


(B) Claims for property damage sustained by the United States or its contractors and subcontractors exceed the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility required under § 440.9(e);


(C) For licensed activity, claims by a third party for bodily injury or property damage exceed the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility required under § 440.9(c), and do not exceed $1,500,000,000 (as adjusted for inflation after January 1, 1989) above such amount, and are payable pursuant to the provisions of 51 U.S.C. 50915 and § 440.19; or
