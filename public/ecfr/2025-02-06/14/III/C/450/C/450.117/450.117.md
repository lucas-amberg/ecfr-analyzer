# § 450.117   Trajectory analysis for normal flight.

(a) *General.* A flight safety analysis must include a trajectory analysis that establishes, for any phase of flight within the scope as provided by § 450.113(a), the limits of a launch or reentry vehicle's normal flight as defined by the nominal trajectory, and the following sets of trajectories sufficient to characterize variability and uncertainty during normal flight:


(1) A set of trajectories to characterize variability. This set must describe how the intended trajectory could vary due to conditions known prior to initiation of flight; and


(2) A set of trajectories to characterize uncertainty. This set must describe how the actual trajectory could differ from the intended trajectory due to random uncertainties in all parameters with a significant influence on the vehicle's behavior throughout normal flight.


(b) *Trajectory model.* A final trajectory analysis must use a six-degree of freedom trajectory model to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.


(c) *Atmospheric effects.* A trajectory analysis must account for atmospheric conditions that have an effect on the trajectory, including atmospheric profiles that are no less severe than the worst conditions under which flight might be attempted, and for uncertainty in the atmospheric conditions.


(d) *Application requirements.* An applicant must submit the following:


(1) A description of the methods used to characterize the vehicle's flight behavior throughout normal flight, in accordance with § 450.115(c).


(2) The quantitative input data, including uncertainties, used to model the vehicle's normal flight in six degrees of freedom.


(3) The worst atmospheric conditions under which flight might be attempted, and a description of how the operator will evaluate the atmospheric conditions and uncertainty in the atmospheric conditions prior to initiating the operation;


(4) Representative normal flight trajectory analysis outputs, including the position velocity, and orientation for each second of flight for—


(i) The nominal trajectory;


(ii) A set of trajectories that characterize variability in the intended trajectory based on conditions known prior to initiation of flight; and


(iii) A set of trajectories that characterize how the actual trajectory could differ from the intended trajectory due to random uncertainties.
