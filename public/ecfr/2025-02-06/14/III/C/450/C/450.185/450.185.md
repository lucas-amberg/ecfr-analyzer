# § 450.185   Ground hazard analysis.

An operator must perform and document a ground hazard analysis, and continue to maintain it throughout the lifecycle of the launch or reentry system. The analysis must—


(a) *Hazard identification.* Identify system and operation hazards posed by the vehicle and ground hardware, including site and ground support equipment. Hazards identified must include the following:


(1) System hazards, including:


(i) Vehicle over-pressurization;


(ii) Sudden energy release, including ordnance actuation;


(iii) Ionizing and non-ionizing radiation;


(iv) Fire or deflagration;


(v) Radioactive materials;


(vi) Toxic release;


(vii) Cryogens;


(viii) Electrical discharge; and


(ix) Structural failure.


(2) Operation hazards, including:


(i) Propellant handling and loading;


(ii) Transporting of vehicle or vehicle components;


(iii) Vehicle testing; and


(iv) Vehicle or system activation.


(b) *Hazard assessment.* Assess each hazard's likelihood and severity.


(c) *Risk acceptability criteria.* Ensure that the risk associated with each hazard meets the following criteria:


(1) The likelihood of any hazardous condition that may cause death or serious injury to the public must be extremely remote; and


(2) The likelihood of any hazardous condition that may cause major damage to property not associated with the launch or reentry must be remote.


(d) *Risk mitigation.* Identify and describe the risk elimination and mitigation measures required to satisfy paragraph (c) of this section.


(e) *Validation and verification.* Document that the risk elimination and mitigation measures achieve the risk levels of paragraph (c) of this section through validation and verification. Verification includes:


(1) Analysis;


(2) Test;


(3) Demonstration; or


(4) Inspection.


(f) *Application requirements.* An applicant must submit—


(1) A description of the methodology used to perform the ground hazard analysis;


(2) A list of all systems and operations that may cause a hazard involving the vehicle or any payload; and


(3) The ground hazard analysis products of paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, including data that verifies the risk elimination and mitigation measures.
