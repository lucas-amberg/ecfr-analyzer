# ยง 1203.201   Information security objectives.

The objectives of the NASA Information Security Program are to:


(a) Ensure that information is classified only when a sound basis exists for such classification and only for such period as is necessary.


(b) Prevent both the unwarranted classification and the overclassification of NASA information.


(c) Ensure the greatest practicable uniformity within NASA in the classification of information.


(d) Ensure effective coordination and reasonable uniformity with other Government departments and agencies, particularly in areas where there is an exchange or sharing of information, techniques, hardware, software, or other technologies.


(e) Provide a timely and effective means for downgrading or declassifying information when the circumstances necessitating the original classification change or no longer exist.
