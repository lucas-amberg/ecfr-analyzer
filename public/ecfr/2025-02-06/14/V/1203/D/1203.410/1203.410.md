(3) Restrain competition; or


(4) Prevent or delay the release of information that does not require protection in the interest of the national security.


(b) Basic scientific research information not clearly related to the national security may not be classified.


(c) Information may not be reclassified after declassification after being released to the public under proper authority unless: The reclassification is based on a document-by-document review by NASA and a determination that reclassification is required to prevent at least significant damage to the national security and personally approved in writing by the Administrator, the Deputy Administrator, or the Assistant Administrator for Protective Services. All reclassification actions will be coordinated with the Information Security Oversight Office before final approval; the information may be reasonably recovered without bringing undue public attention to the information; the reclassification action is reported promptly to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (the National Security Advisor) and the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office; and for documents in the physical and legal custody of the National Archives and Records Administration (National Archives) that have been available for public use, the Administrator, the Deputy Administrator, or the Assistant Administrator for Protective Services, after making the determinations required by this paragraph, shall notify the Archivist of the United States (hereafter, Archivist), who shall suspend public access pending approval of the reclassification action by the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office. Any such decision by the Director may be appealed by the agency head to the President through the National Security Advisor. Public access shall remain suspended pending a prompt decision on the appeal.


(d) Information that has not previously been disclosed to the public under proper authority may be classified or reclassified after an agency has received a request for it under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the Presidential Records Act, 44 U.S.C. 2204(c)(1), the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or the mandatory review provisions of section 3.5 of this Order only if such classification meets the requirements of this Order and is accomplished by document-by-document review with the personal participation or under the direction of the Administrator, the Deputy Administrator, or the Assistant Administrator for Protective Services. The requirements in this paragraph also apply to those situations in which information has been declassified in accordance with a specific date or event determined by an original classification authority in accordance with section 1.5 of this Order.


(e) Compilations of items of information that are individually unclassified may be classified if the compiled information reveals an additional association or relationship that:


(1) Meets the standards for classification under this Order; and


(2) Is not otherwise revealed in the individual items of information.
