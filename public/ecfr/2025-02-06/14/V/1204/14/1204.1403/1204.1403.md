# § 1204.1403   Available airport facilities.

The facilities available vary at each NASA Installation having an airfield. The airport facilities available are:


(a) [Reserved]




(b) *Wallops Airport*—(1) *Runways.* There are three hard surfaced runways in satisfactory condition. The runways and taxiways are concrete and/or asphalt. Runway 10-28 is 8,000 feet long, 200 feet wide with maximum wheel load of 57,500 pounds; runway 04-22 is 8,750 feet long, 150 feet wide with maximum wheel load of 57,500 pounds; and runway 17-35 is 4,820 feet long, 150 feet wide with maximum wheel load of 14,700 pounds.


(2) *Parking Areas and Hangar Space.* No hangar space is available. However, limited concrete parking ramp space is available as directed by the control tower.


(3) *Control Tower.* This control tower is normally in operation from 0630 to 1830 local time, Monday through Friday, excluding Federal holidays. The tower may be contacted on 126.5 MHz or 394.3 MHz. When the tower is in operation, FAA regulations pertaining to the operation of aircraft at airports with an operating tower (§ 91.87 of this title) will apply. When the tower is not in operation, all aircraft operations will be handled by Wallops UNICOM on the tower frequency, and FAA regulations pertaining to the operation of aircraft at airports without an operating control tower (§ 91.89 of this title) will apply. In addition to Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR's) (s 91 of this title), Wallops requires that pilots obtain clearances from the Wallops UNICOM before landings, takeoffs, and taxiing. Civil aircraft operations are normally confined to daylight hours.


(4) *Navigation Aids.* All runways, 04-22, 10-28, and 17-35 are lighted. Both active taxiways, parallels 04-22 and 10-28, are lighted. Airfield lighting is available upon request. All runway approaches are equipped with operating precision approach path indicator (PAPI) systems and are available on request. All airfield obstructions are equipped with red obstruction lights. 


(5) *Hazards.* Numerous towers in airport vicinity up to 241 feet above ground level. Existing tree obstructions are located 1500 feet west of runway 10 threshold. High shore bird population exists in the Wallops area. Deer occasionally venture across runways. Light-controlled traffic crossovers are in existence. Potential radio frequency (RF) hazards exist from tracking radars. Hazards involving aircraft and rocket launch operations exist when Restricted Area R-6604 is active.


(6) *Emergency Equipment.* Aircraft rescue and fire-fighting equipment is normally available on a continuous basis.


(c)-(d) [Reserved]








(e) *NASA owned but non-NASA operated airfields.* (1) Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) may be made available on an individual emergency basis to a user with prior permission from the airfield operator.


(2) Moffett Federal Airfield (MFA) may be made available on an individual emergency basis to a user with prior permission from the airfield operator.


(3) No facilities or services other than those described in this section are available except on an individual prior permission or emergency basis to any user.




(f) *Status of facilities.* Changes to the status of the KSC, WFF, and MFA facilities will be published in appropriate current FAA or Department of Defense (DOD) aeronautical publications.
