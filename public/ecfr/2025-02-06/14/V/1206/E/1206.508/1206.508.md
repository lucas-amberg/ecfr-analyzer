# ยง 1206.508   Aggregation of requests.

(a) A requester may not file multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents, solely in order to avoid payment of fees.


(b) When NASA has reason to believe that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests on a single subject or related subjects for the purpose of avoiding the assessment of fees, NASA will aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly.


(c) NASA will consider that multiple requests made within a 30-day period were so intended submitted as such to avoid fees, unless there is evidence to the contrary.


(d) NASA will aggregate requests separated by a longer period of time only when there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved.


(e) NASA will not aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects from one requester or organization.
