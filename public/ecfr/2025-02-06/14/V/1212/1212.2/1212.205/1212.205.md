(a) The NASA Administrator has determined that the systems of records set forth in ยง 1212.501 are exempt from disclosure to the extent provided therein.


(b) *Medical records.* Normally, an individual's medical record shall be disclosed to the individual, unless the system manager, in consultation with a medical doctor, determines that access to the record could have an adverse effect upon the individual. In this case, NASA shall allow access to the record by a medical doctor designated in writing by the requesting individual.

(d) *Information compiled for civil actions or proceedings.* Nothing in this part shall allow an individual access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.
