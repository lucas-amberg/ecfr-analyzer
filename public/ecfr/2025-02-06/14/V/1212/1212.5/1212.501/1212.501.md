# § 1212.501   Record systems determined to be exempt.

The Administrator has determined that the following systems of records are exempt to the extent provided hereinafter.


(a) *Inspector General Investigations Case Files*—(1) *Sections of the Act from which exempted.* (i) The Inspector General Investigations Case Files system of records is exempt from all sections of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) except the following sections: (b) relating to conditions of disclosure; (c) (1) and (2) relating to keeping and maintaining a disclosure accounting; (e)(4) (A) through (F) relating to publishing a system notice setting forth name, location, categories of individuals and records, routine uses, and policies regarding storage, retrievability, access controls, retention and disposal of the records; (e) (6), (7), (9), (10), and (11) relating to dissemination and maintenance of records, and (i) relating to criminal penalties. This exemption applies to those records and information contained in the system of records pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws.


(ii) To the extent that noncriminal investigative files may exist within this system of records, the Inspector General Investigations Case Files system of records is exempt from the following sections of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a): (c)(3) relating to access to the disclosure accounting, (d) relating to access to records, (e)(1) relating to the type of information maintained in the records; (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I) relating to publishing the system notice information as to agency procedures for access and amendment and information as to the categories of sources or records, and (f) relating to developing agency rules for gaining access and making corrections.


(2) *Reason for exemptions.* (i) The Office of Inspector General is an office of NASA, a component of which performs as its principal function activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws, within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2). This exemption applies only to those records and information contained in the system of records pertaining to criminal investigations. This system of records is exempt for one or more of the following reasons:


(A) To prevent interference with law enforcement proceedings.


(B) To avoid unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, by disclosure of information about third parties, including other subjects of investigation, investigators, and witnesses.


(C) To protect the identity of Federal employees who furnish a complaint or information to the OIG, consistent with section 7(b) of the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, 5 U.S.C. App.


(D) To protect the confidentiality of non-Federal employee sources of information.


(E) To assure access to sources of confidential information, including that contained in Federal, State, and local criminal law enforcement information systems.


(F) To prevent disclosure of law enforcement techniques and procedures.


(G) To avoid endangering the life or physical safety of confidential sources and law enforcement personnel.


(ii) Investigative records within this system of records which are compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material within the scope of subsection (j)(2), are exempt under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2): *Provided, however,* That if any individual is denied any right, privilege, or benefit that they would otherwise be entitled by Federal law, or for which they would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of such material, such material shall be provided to such individual, except to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to January 1, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the sources would be held in confidence. This system of records is exempt for one or more of the following reasons:


(A) To prevent interference with law enforcement proceedings.


(B) To protect investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes.


(C) To avoid unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, by disclosure of information about third parties, including other subjects of investigation, law enforcement personnel, and sources of information.


(D) To fulfill commitments made to protect the confidentiality of sources.


(E) To protect the identity of Federal employees who furnish a complaint or information to the OIG, consistent with section 7(b) of the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, 5 U.S.C. App.


(F) To assure access to sources of confidential information, including that contained in Federal, State, and local criminal law enforcement information systems.


(G) To prevent disclosure of law enforcement techniques and procedures.


(H) To avoid endangering the life or physical safety of confidential sources and law enforcement personnel.


(iii) Records within this system of records comprised of investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability or eligibility for Federal civilian employment or access to classified information, are exempt under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), but only to the extent that disclosure would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or prior to January 1, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence. This system of records is exempt for one or more of the following reasons:


(A) To fulfill commitments made to protect the confidentiality of sources.


(B) To assure access to sources of confidential information, including that contained in Federal, State, and local criminal law enforcement information systems.


(b) *Security Records System*—(1) *Sections of the Act from which exempted.* The Security Records System is exempted from the following sections of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a): (c)(3) relating to access to the disclosure accounting; (d) relating to access to the records; (e)(1) relating to the type of information maintained in the records; (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I) relating to publishing the system notice information as to agency procedures for access and amendment, and information as to the categories of sources of records; and (f) relating to developing Agency rules for gaining access and making corrections.


(2) *Reason for exemption.* (i) Personnel Security Records contained in the system of records which are compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal civilian employment, Federal contracts, or access to classified information are exempt under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), but only to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of the source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to January 1, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the sources would be held in confidence. This system of records is exempt for one or more of the following reasons:


(A) To fulfill commitments made to protect the confidentiality of sources.


(B) To assure access to sources of confidential information, including that contained in Federal, State, and local criminal law enforcement information systems.


(ii) Criminal Matter Records are contained in the system of records and are exempt under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2): *Provided, however,* That if any individual is denied any right, privilege, or benefit that they would otherwise be entitled by Federal law, or for which they would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of such material, such material shall be provided to such individual, except to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to January 1, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the sources would be held in confidence. This system of records is exempt for one or more of the following reasons:


(A) To prevent interference with law enforcement proceedings.


(B) To protect investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes.


(C) To avoid unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, by disclosure of information about third parties, including other subjects of investigation, law enforcement personnel, and sources of information.


(D) To fulfill commitments made to protect the confidentiality of sources.


(E) To assure access to sources of confidential information, including that contained in Federal, State, and local criminal law enforcement information systems.


(F) To prevent disclosure of law enforcement techniques and procedures.


(G) To avoid endangering the life or physical safety of confidential sources and law enforcement personnel.


(iii) The system of records includes records subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1) (required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy), and such records are exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1).




(c) *Harassment Report Case Files*—(1) *Sections of the Act from which exempted.* Harassment Report Case Files records are exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) from the following sections of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a): subsection (c)(3) relating to access to the disclosure accounting; subsection (d) relating to access to the records; subsection (e)(1) relating to the type of information maintained in the records; subsections (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) relating to publishing in the annual system notice information as to agency procedures for access and correction and information as to the categories of sources of records; and subsection (f) relating to developing agency rules for gaining access and making corrections.


(2) *Reason for exemption*—(i) *Subsection (c)(3).* The release of the disclosure accounting to the individual who is the subject of the investigation/fact-finding would present a serious impediment to NASA's ability to conduct fact-findings into potential violations of law or policy.


(ii) *Subsection (d).* Access to records contained in this system would inform the subject of an actual or potential investigation, of the existence of that investigation, of the nature and scope of the investigation, of the information and evidence obtained as to their activities, and of the identity of witnesses. Such access would impede a fact-finder/investigator's ability to freely investigate such cases, including concerns that some witnesses have been promised confidentiality and would not want their statements provided to the subject of the investigation. Amendment of the records would interfere with the ongoing fact-finding process.


(iii) *Subsection (e)(1).* Under the provision of (e)(1), the agency must only maintain such information that is relevant and necessary. It is difficult to know during the course of an investigation what is relevant and necessary. In this connection, facts or evidence may not seem relevant at first, but later in the investigation, their relevance is borne out.


(iv) *Subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H).* These subsections are inapplicable to the extent that these systems are exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d) and the rules provisions of subsection (f).


(v) *Subsection (e)(4)(I).* The categories of sources of the records in these systems have been published in the _Federal Register_ in broad generic terms in the belief that this is all that subsection (e)(4)(I) of the Act requires. In the event, however, that this subsection should be interpreted to require more detail as to the identity of sources of the records in this system, exemption from this provision is necessary to protect the confidentiality of the sources of criminal and related law enforcement information. Such exemption is further necessary to protect the privacy and physical safety of witnesses and informants.


(vi) *Subsection (f).* Procedures for notice to an individual pursuant to subsection (f)(1) as to existence of records pertaining to the individual dealing with an actual or potential criminal, civil, or regulatory investigation or prosecution must be exempted because such notice to an individual would be detrimental to the successful conduct and/or completion of an investigation or case, pending or future. In addition, mere notice of the fact of an investigation could inform the subject or others that their activities are under investigation or may become the subject of an investigation and could enable the subjects to avoid detection, to influence witnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate testimony. Since an exemption is being claimed for subsection (d) of the Act, the rules required pursuant to subsections (f)(2) through (5) are inapplicable to these systems of records to the extent that these systems of records are exempted from subsection (d).


(3) *Determination.* NASA has determined that the exemption of this system of records from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (e)(4)(I), and (f) of the Privacy Act is necessary for the Agency's law enforcement efforts to address and eradicate harassment in its workplace.
