# ยง 1212.606   Duplicate copies of records or portions of records.

(a) NASA officials may maintain and use, for official purposes, duplicate copies of records or portions of records from a system of records maintained by their own organizational unit. This practice should occur only where there are justifiable organizational needs for it, e.g., where geographic distances make use of the system of records time consuming or inconvenient. These duplicate copies shall not be considered a separate NASA system of records. For example, an office head or designee may keep duplicate copies of personnel, training, or similar records on employees within the organization for administrative convenience purposes.


(b) No disclosure shall be made from duplicate copies outside of the organizational unit. Any outside request for disclosure shall be referred to the appropriate system manager for response.


(c) Duplicate copies are subject to the same safeguard requirements applicable to the system of records.
