# ยง 1215.101   Scope.

This subpart sets forth the policy governing TDRSS services provided to non-U.S. Government users and the reimbursement for rendering such services. Cooperative missions are not under the purview of this subpart. The arrangements for TDRSS services for cooperative missions will be covered in an agreement, as a consequence of negotiations between NASA and the other concerned party. Any agreement which includes provision for any TDRSS service will require signatory concurrence by the Deputy Associate Administrator for SCaN prior to dedicating SCaN resources for support of a cooperative mission.
