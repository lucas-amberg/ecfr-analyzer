# ยง 1216.306   Actions normally requiring an environmental impact statement (EIS).

(a) NASA shall prepare an EIS for actions that are likely to significantly impact the quality of the human environment, including actions for which an EA demonstrates that significant environmental impacts will potentially occur which will not be reduced or eliminated by changes to the proposed action or mitigation of its potentially significant environmental impacts. An EIS shall be prepared and published in accordance with CEQ's implementing regulations (40 CFR part 1502).


(b) NASA actions normally requiring an EIS include:


(1) Development and operation of new NASA-developed launch vehicles or space transportation systems.


(2) Management, including recovery, transport, and curation, of sample returns to Earth from solar system bodies (such as asteroids, comets, planets, dwarf planets, and planetary moons) that would receive a Restricted Earth Return categorization. NASA requires such a mission to include additional measures to ensure any potential indigenous life form would be contained so it could not adversely impact humans or Earth's environment.


(3) Substantial construction projects expected to result in significant effect(s) on the quality of the human and natural environment when such construction and its effects are not within the scope of an existing master plan.
