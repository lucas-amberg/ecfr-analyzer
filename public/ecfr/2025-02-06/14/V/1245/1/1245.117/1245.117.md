# § 1245.117   March-in and waiver revocation procedures.

(a) The exercise of march-in procedures shall be in conformance with 35 U.S.C. 203 and the applicable provisions of 37 CFR 401.6, entitled “Exercise of march-in rights for inventions made by nonprofit organizations and small business firms.”


(b) Whenever NASA receives information that it believes might warrant the exercise of march-in rights, before initiating any march-in proceeding, it shall notify the waiver recipient in writing of the information and request informal written or oral comments from the waiver recipient as well as information relevant to the matter. In the absence of any comments from the waiver recipient within 30 days, NASA may, at its discretion, proceed with the procedures set forth in 37 CFR 401.6. If a comment is received within 30 days, or later if NASA has not initiated the procedures, then NASA shall, within 60 days after it receives the comment, either initiate the procedures or notify the waiver recipient, in writing, that it will not pursue march-in rights on the basis of the available information.


(c) If march-in procedures are to be initiated, the Administrator of NASA, or designee, shall undertake or refer the matter for fact finding to the NASA Board of Contract Appeals (BCA) and its Chairperson.


(d) Fact-finding shall be conducted by the NASA BCA and its Chairperson in accordance with its procedures that are consistent with the procedures set forth in 37 CFR 401.6. Any portion of the march-in proceeding, including a fact-finding hearing that involves testimony or evidence relating to the utilization or efforts at obtaining utilization that are being made by the waiver recipient, its assignee, or licensees shall be closed to the public, including potential licensees. In accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), NASA shall not disclose any such information obtained during a march-in proceeding to persons outside the Government except when such release is authorized by the waiver recipient (assignee or licensee).


(e) The preparation of written findings of fact and recommended determination by the Chairperson of the NASA BCA and the determination by the Administrator, or designee, of NASA shall be in accordance with 37 CFR 401.6.


(f) NASA may, at any time, terminate a march-in proceeding if it is satisfied that it does not wish to exercise march-in rights.
