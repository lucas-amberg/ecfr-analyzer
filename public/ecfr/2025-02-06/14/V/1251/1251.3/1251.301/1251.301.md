# § 1251.301   Existing facilities.

(a) *Accessibility.* A recipient shall operate each program or activity to which his part applies so that when each part is viewed in its entirety it is readily accessible to individuals with disabilities. This paragraph does not require a recipient to make each of its existing facilities or every part of a facility accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.


(b) *Methods.* A recipient may comply with the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section through such means as redesign of equipment; reassignment of classes or other services to accessible buildings; assignment of aides to beneficiaries; home visits; delivery of health, welfare, or other social services at alternate accessible sites; alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities in conformance with the requirements of § 1251.302; or any other methods that result in making its program or activity accessible to individuals with disabilities. A recipient is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall give priority to those methods that serve to individuals with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate.


(c) *Time period.* A recipient shall comply with the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section within 60 days of the effective date of this part except that where structural changes in facilities are necessary, such changes shall be made within 3 years of the effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.


(d) *Transition plan.* In the event that structural changes to facilities are necessary to meet the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall develop, within 6 months of the effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The plan shall be developed with the assistance of interested persons, including individuals with disabilities or organizations representing individuals with disabilities. A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum:


(1) Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that limit the accessibility of its program or activity to individuals with disabilities;


(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;


(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve full accessibility under paragraph (a) of this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than 1 year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and


(4) Indicate the person responsible for implementation of the plan.


(e) *Safe harbor.* For the purposes of complying with this section, elements that have not been altered in existing facilities on or after January 23, 2017, and that comply with the corresponding technical and scoping specifications for those elements in the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS), Appendix A to 41 CFR part 101-19.6, 49 FR 31528, app. A (Aug. 7, 1984), are not required to be modified to be brought into compliance with the requirements set forth in the 2010 Standards.


(f) *Notice of location of accessible facilities*—(1) *General.* The recipient shall adopt and implement procedures to ensure that interested individuals, including individuals with vision or hearing disabilities, can obtain information as to the existence and location of services, activities, and facilities that are accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.


(2) *Signs at primary entrances.* The recipient shall provide signs at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to an accessible facility or a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each accessible entrance to a facility.
