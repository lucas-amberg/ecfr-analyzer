# ยง 1261.401   Definitions.

(a) *Claim and debt.* The terms denote a civil claim arising from the activities of NASA for an amount of money, or return or value of property (see 4 CFR 101.5), owing to the United States from any person, organization, or entity, except another Federal agency. The words *claim* and *debt* have been used interchangeably and are considered synonymous.


(b) *Delinquent debt.* The debt is *delinquent* if it has not been paid by the date specified in the initial written notification (e.g., ยง 1261.407) or applicable contractual agreement, unless other acceptable (to NASA) payment arrangements have been made by that date, or if, at any time thereafter, the debtor fails to satisfy an obligation under the payment agreement.


(c) *Referral for litigation.* Referral through the NASA installation's legal counsel to the Department of Justice (Main Justice or the United States Attorney, as appropriate) for legal proceedings.
