# ยง 1262.103   Proceedings covered.

(a) The Act applies to the following adversary adjudications conducted by the Agency:


(1) Adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of NASA or any other agency of the United States, or any component of an agency, is presented by an attorney or other representative who enters an appearance and participates in the proceedings;


(2) Appeals of decisions made pursuant to section 6 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 605) before the Board of Contract Appeals (BCA) as provided in Section 8 of that Act (41 U.S.C. 607);


(3) Any hearing conducted under Chapter 38 of Title 31 (31 U.S.C. 3801, *et seq.,* as amended); and


(4) Adjudications under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb).


(b) The Act does not apply to:


(1) Any proceeding in which this Agency may prescribe a lawful present or future rate;


(2) Proceedings to grant or renew licenses (note, however, that proceedings to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses are covered if they are otherwise adversary adjudications); and


(3) Proceedings which are covered by a compromise or settlement agreement, unless specifically consented to in such agreement.


(c) NASA may also designate a proceeding as an adversary adjudication for purposes of the Act by so stating in an order initiating the proceeding or designating the matter for hearing. The Agency's failure to designate a proceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filling of an application by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the Act; whether the proceeding is covered will then be an issue for resolution in proceedings on the application.


(d) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include only fees and expenses related to covered issues.
