# ยง 1263.103   Procedure when a demand is issued in a legal proceeding not involving the United States.

Whenever an employee or former employee of the Agency receives a demand for production or disclosure of official information in a legal proceeding not involving the United States, the employee shall immediately notify the General Counsel or designate. In addition, the party causing the demand to be issued shall furnish the Office of General Counsel a written, detailed statement of the information sought and its relevance to the proceeding in connection with which it is requested. The General Counsel or designate may waive the requirement that a written summary be furnished where he/she deems it unnecessary. The election to waive the requirement of a written summary in no way constitutes a waiver of any other requirements set forth in this section.
