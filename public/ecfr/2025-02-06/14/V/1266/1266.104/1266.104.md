# § 1266.104   Cross-waiver of liability for launch agreements for science or space exploration activities unrelated to the International Space Station.

(a) The purpose of this section is to implement a cross-waiver of liability between the parties to agreements for NASA's science or space exploration activities that are not related to the International Space Station (ISS) but involve a launch. It is intended that the cross-waiver of liability be broadly construed to achieve this objective.


(b) For purposes of this section:


(1) The term “Party” means a party to a NASA agreement for science or space exploration activities unrelated to the ISS that involve a launch.


(2) (i) The term “related entity” means:


(A) A contractor or subcontractor of a Party at any tier;


(B) A user or customer of a Party at any tier; or


(C) A contractor or subcontractor of a user or customer of a Party at any tier.


(ii) The terms “contractor” and “subcontractor” include suppliers of any kind.


(iii) The term “related entity” may also apply to a State or an agency or institution of a State, having the same relationship to a Party as described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) through (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section, or otherwise engaged in the implementation of Protected Space Operations as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.


(3) The term “damage” means:


(i) Bodily injury to, or other impairment of health of, or death of, any person;


(ii) Damage to, loss of, or loss of use of any property;


(iii) Loss of revenue or profits; or


(iv) Other direct, indirect, or consequential damage.


(4) The term “launch vehicle” means an object, or any part thereof, intended for launch, launched from Earth, or returning to Earth which carries payloads or persons, or both.


(5) The term “payload” means all property to be flown or used on or in a launch vehicle.


(6) The term “Protected Space Operations” means all launch or transfer vehicle activities and payload activities on Earth, in outer space, or in transit between Earth and outer space in implementation of an agreement for launch services. Protected Space Operations begins at the signature of the agreement and ends when all activities done in implementation of the agreement are completed. It includes, but is not limited to:


(i) Research, design, development, test, manufacture, assembly, integration, operation, or use of launch or transfer vehicles, payloads, or instruments, as well as related support equipment and facilities and services; and


(ii) All activities related to ground support, test, training, simulation, or guidance and control equipment and related facilities or services. The term “Protected Space Operations” excludes activities on Earth that are conducted on return from space to develop further a payload's product or process for use other than for the activities within the scope of an agreement for launch services.


(7) The term “transfer vehicle” means any vehicle that operates in space and transfers payloads or persons or both between two different space objects, between two different locations on the same space object, or between a space object and the surface of a celestial body. A transfer vehicle also includes a vehicle that departs from and returns to the same location on a space object.


(c)(1) Cross-waiver of liability: Each Party agrees to a cross-waiver of liability pursuant to which each Party waives all claims against any of the entities or persons listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this section based on damage arising out of Protected Space Operations. This cross-waiver shall apply only if the person, entity, or property causing the damage is involved in Protected Space Operations and the person, entity, or property damaged is damaged by virtue of its involvement in Protected Space Operations. The cross-waiver shall apply to any claims for damage, whatever the legal basis for such claims, against:


(i) Another Party;


(ii) A party to another NASA agreement that includes flight on the same launch vehicle;


(iii) A related entity of any entity identified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this section; or


(iv) The employees of any of the entities identified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iii) of this section.


(2) In addition, each Party shall extend the cross-waiver of liability, as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, to its own related entities by requiring them, by contract or otherwise, to:


(i) Waive all claims against the entities or persons identified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this section; and


(ii) Require that their related entities waive all claims against the entities or persons identified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this section.


(3) For avoidance of doubt, this cross-waiver of liability includes a cross-waiver of claims arising from the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, which entered into force on September 1, 1972, where the person, entity, or property causing the damage is involved in Protected Space Operations and the person, entity, or property damaged is damaged by virtue of its involvement in Protected Space Operations.


(4) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, this cross-waiver of liability shall not be applicable to:


(i) Claims between a Party and its own related entity or between its own related entities;


(ii) Claims made by a natural person, his/her estate, survivors, or subrogees (except when a subrogee is a Party to the agreement or is otherwise bound by the terms of this cross-waiver) for bodily injury to, or other impairment of health of, or death of, such person;


(iii) Claims for damage caused by willful misconduct;


(iv) Intellectual property claims;


(v) Claims for damages resulting from a failure of a Party to extend the cross-waiver of liability to its related entities, pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section; or


(vi) Claims by a Party arising out of or relating to another Party's failure to perform its obligations under the agreement.


(5) Nothing in this section shall be construed to create the basis for a claim or suit where none would otherwise exist.


(6) This cross-waiver shall not be applicable when 49 U.S.C. Subtitle IX, Chapter 701 is applicable.
