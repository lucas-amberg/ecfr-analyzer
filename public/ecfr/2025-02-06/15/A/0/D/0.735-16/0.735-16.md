# § 0.735-16   Indebtedness.

(a) An employee shall pay each just financial obligation in a proper and timely manner, especially one imposed by law such as Federal, State, or local taxes. For purposes of this section, “a just financial obligation” means one acknowledged by the employee or reduced to judgment by a court, and “in a proper and timely manner” means in a manner which, in the view of the Department, does not, under the circumstances, reflect adversely on the Government as his employer. 


(b) In the event of dispute between an employee and an alleged creditor, this section does not require the Department to determine the validity or amount of the disputed debt.
