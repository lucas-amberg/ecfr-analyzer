# ยง 0.735-18   General conduct prejudicial to the Government.

(a) *General policy.* Officers and employees of the Federal Government are servants of the people. Because of this, their conduct must, in many instances, be subject to more restrictions and to higher standards than may be the case in certain private employments. They are expected to conduct themselves in a manner which will reflect favorably upon their employer. Although the Government is not particularly interested in the private lives of its employees, it does expect them to be honest, reliable, trustworthy, and of good character and reputation. They are expected to be loyal to the Government, and to the department or agency in which they are employed. 


(b) *Specific policy.* An employee shall not engage in criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral, or notoriously disgraceful conduct, or other conduct prejudicial to the Government. 


(c) *Regulations applicable to public buildings and grounds.* Each employee is responsible for knowing and complying with regulations of the General Services Administration and of the Department of Commerce applicable to public buildings and grounds.
