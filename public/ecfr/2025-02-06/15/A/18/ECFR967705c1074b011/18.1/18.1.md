# § 18.1   Purpose of these rules.

The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called “the Act” in this part), provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative proceedings (called “adversary adjudications”) before the Department of Commerce (the word Department includes its component agencies). An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over the Department, unless the Department's position in the proceeding was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this part describe the parties that are eligible for awards and the Department's proceedings that are covered by the Act. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the Department will use to make them.
