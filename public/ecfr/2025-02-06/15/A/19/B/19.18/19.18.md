# ยง 19.18   How does a debtor request a special review based on a change in circumstances such as catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability?

(a) *Material change in circumstances.* A debtor who owes a Commerce debt may, at any time, request a special review by the applicable Commerce entity of the amount of any offset, administrative wage garnishment, or voluntary payment, based on materially changed circumstances beyond the control of the debtor such as, but not limited to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability.


(b) *Inability to pay.* For purposes of this section, in determining whether an involuntary or voluntary payment would prevent the debtor from meeting essential subsistence expenses (e.g., costs incurred for food, housing, clothing, transportation, and medical care), the debtor shall submit a detailed statement and supporting documents for the debtor, his or her spouse, and dependents, indicating:


(1) Income from all sources;


(2) Assets;


(3) Liabilities;


(4) Number of dependents;


(5) Expenses for food, housing, clothing, and transportation;


(6) Medical expenses;


(7) Exceptional expenses, if any; and


(8) Any additional materials and information that the Commerce entity may request relating to ability or inability to pay the amount(s) currently required.


(c) *Alternative payment arrangement.* If the debtor requests a special review under this section, the debtor shall submit an alternative proposed payment schedule and a statement to the Commerce entity collecting the Commerce debt, with supporting documents, showing why the current offset, garnishment or repayment schedule imposes an extreme financial hardship on the debtor. The Commerce entity will evaluate the statement and documentation and determine whether the current offset, garnishment, or repayment schedule imposes extreme financial hardship on the debtor. The Commerce entity shall notify the debtor in writing of such determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset, garnishment, or payment schedule. If the special review results in a revised offset, garnishment, or repayment schedule, the Commerce entity will notify the appropriate Federal agency or other persons about the new terms.
