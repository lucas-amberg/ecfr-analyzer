# ยง 8.2   Application of this part.

(a) This part applies to any program for which Federal financial assistance is authorized under a law administered by the Department, including the types of Federal financial assistance listed in Appendix A to this part and as said Appendix may be amended. It applies to money paid, property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance extended after January 9, 1965, pursuant to an application approved prior to such effective date. 


(b) This part does not apply to (1) any Federal financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty contracts, (2) money paid, property transferred, or other assistance extended before January 9, 1965, except where such assistance was subject to the title VI regulations of this Department or of any other agency whose responsibilities are now exercised by this Department, (3) any assistance to any individual who is the ultimate beneficiary under any such program, or (4) any employment practice, under any such program, of any employer, employment agency, or labor organization except to the extent described in ยง 8.4(c). The fact that a type of Federal financial assistance is not listed in Appendix A shall not mean, if title VI of the Act is otherwise applicable, that a program is not covered. Other types of Federal financial assistance under statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to the list by notice published in the _Federal Register._
