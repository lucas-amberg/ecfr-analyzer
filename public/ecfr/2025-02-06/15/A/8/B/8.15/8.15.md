(a) *Effect on other laws.* All regulations, orders, or like directions heretofore issued by any officer of the Department which impose requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination against individuals on the ground of race, color, or national origin under any program to which this part applies, and which authorizes the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance to any recipient or other party subject to this part of such assistance for failure to comply with such requirements, are hereby superseded to the extent that such discrimination is prohibited by this part, except that nothing in this part shall be deemed to relieve any one of any obligations assumed or imposed under any such superseded regulation, order, instruction, or like direction prior to January 9, 1965. Nothing in this part, however, shall be deemed to supersede any of the following (including future amendments thereof):


(1) Executive Order 11246 and regulations issued thereunder, or


(2) Executive Order 11063 and regulations issued thereunder, or any other regulations or instructions, insofar as such order, regulations, or instructions prohibit discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in any program or situation to which this part is inapplicable, or prohibit discrimination on any other ground. 


(b) *Forms and instructions.* Each responsible Department official shall issue and promptly make available to interested parties forms and detailed instructions and procedures for effectuating this part as applied to programs to which this part applies and for which he is responsible. 


(c) *Supervision and coordination.* The Secretary may from time to time assign to officials of the Department, or to officials of other departments or agencies of the Government with the consent of such departments or agencies, responsibilities in connection with the effectuation of the purposes of title VI of the Act and this part (other than responsibility for final decision as provided in ยง 8.13), including the achievement of effective coordination and maximum uniformity within the Department and within the executive branch of the government in the application of title VI and this part to similar programs and in similar situations. Any action taken, determination made, or requirement imposed by an official of another Department or agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility under this paragraph shall have the same effect as though such action had been taken by the responsible official of this Department.
