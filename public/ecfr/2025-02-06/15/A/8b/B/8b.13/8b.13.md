# ยง 8b.13   Employment criteria.

(a) A recipient may not make use of any employment test or other selection criterion that screens out or tends to screen out handicapped individuals or any class of handicapped individuals unless;


(1) The test score or other selection criterion, as used by the recipient, is shown to be job-related for the position in question; and


(2) Alternative job-related tests or criteria that do not screen out or tend to screen out as many handicapped individuals are not shown by the Secretary to be available.


(b) A recipient shall select and administer tests concerning employment so as best to ensure that, when administered to an applicant or employee who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately to reflect the applicant's or employee's job skills aptitude, or whatever factor the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the applicant's or employee's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).
