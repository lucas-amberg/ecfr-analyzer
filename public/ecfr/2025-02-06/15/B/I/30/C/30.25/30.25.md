# § 30.25   Values for certain types of transactions.

Special procedures govern the values to be reported for shipments of the following unusual types:


(a) *Subsidized exports of agricultural products.* Where provision is made for the payment to the USPPI for the exportation of agricultural commodities under a program of the Department of Agriculture, the value required to be reported for EEI is the selling price paid by the foreign buyer minus the subsidy.


(b) *General Services Administration (GSA) exports of excess personal property.* For exports of GSA excess personal property, the value to be shown in the EEI will be “fair market value,” plus charges when applicable, at which the property was transferred to GSA by the holding agency. These charges include packing, rehabilitation, inland freight, or drayage. The estimated “fair market value” may be zero, or it may be a percentage of the original or estimated acquisition costs. (Bill of lading, air waybill, and other commercial loading documents for such shipments will bear the notation “Excess Personal Property, GSA Regulations 1-III, 303.03.”)


(c) *Goods rejected after entry.* For imported goods that are cleared by CBP but subsequently rejected, an EEI must be filed to export the goods. The value to be reported in the AES is the declared import value of the goods.
