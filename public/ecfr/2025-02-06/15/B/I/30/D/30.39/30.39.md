# ยง 30.39   Special exemptions for shipments to the U.S. Armed Services.

Except as noted in ยง 30.2 (a)(1)(iv), filing of EEI is not required for any and all commodities, whether shipped commercially or through government channels, consigned to the U.S. Armed Services for their exclusive use, including shipments to armed services exchange systems. This exemption does not apply to articles that are on the USML and thus controlled by the ITAR and/or shipments that are not consigned to the U.S. Armed Services, regardless of whether they may be for their ultimate and exclusive use.
