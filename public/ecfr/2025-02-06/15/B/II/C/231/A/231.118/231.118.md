*Semiconductors critical to national security* means:


(a) Semiconductors utilizing nanomaterials, including 1D and 2D carbon allotropes such as graphene and carbon nanotubes;


(b) Compound and wide- and ultra-wide bandgap semiconductors;


(c) Radiation-hardened by process (RHBP) semiconductors;


(d) Fully depleted silicon on insulator (FD-SOI) semiconductors, other than with regard to semiconductor packaging operations with respect to such semiconductors of a 28-nonometerer generation or older;


(e) Silicon photonic semiconductors;


(f) Semiconductors designed for quantum information systems;


(g) Semiconductors designed for operation in cryogenic environments (at or below 77 Kelvin); and


(h) Any other semiconductors that the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence, determines is critical to national security and issues a public notice of that determination.
