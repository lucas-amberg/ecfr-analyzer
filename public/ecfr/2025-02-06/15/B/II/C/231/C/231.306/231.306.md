# § 231.306   Mitigation of national security risks.

If the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence, determines that a covered entity or member of the affiliated group is planning to undertake or has undertaken a significant transaction that violates or would violate § 231.202, the Secretary may seek to take measures in connection with the transaction to mitigate the risk to national security. Such measures may include the negotiation of an amendment to the required agreement (a “mitigation agreement”) with the covered entity to mitigate the risk to national security in connection with the transaction. The Secretary has discretion to waive, in whole or part, recovery of the Federal financial assistance provided to the covered entity for violation of § 231.305(d) in circumstances where an appropriate mitigation agreement has been entered into and complied with by the covered entity. If a covered entity fails to comply with the mitigation agreement or if other conditions in the mitigation agreement are violated, the Secretary may recover the full amount of the Federal financial assistance provided to the covered entity.
