# § 240.6   Tolerances.

(a) When lime is packed in barrels the tolerance to be allowed on the large barrel or the small barrel of lime shall be 5 pounds in excess or in deficiency on any individual barrel: *Provided, however,* That the average error on 10 barrels of the same nominal weight and packed by the same manufacturer shall in no case be greater than 2 pounds in excess or in deficiency. In case all the barrels available are not weighed, those which are weighed shall be selected at random.

In case all the containers available are not weighed, those which are weighed shall be selected at random.


(c) When lime in bulk is sold, charged for, or purported to be delivered as a definite number of large or small barrels, the tolerance to be allowed in excess or in deficiency on such amounts of lime shall be 15 pounds per 1,800 pounds (10 small barrels), or 25 pounds per 2,800 pounds (10 large barrels).
