# ยง 280.212   Matter protected against disclosure.

(a) *Protective measures.* The administrative law judge may limit discovery or introduction of evidence or issue such protective or other orders as in the ALJ's judgment may be needed to prevent undue disclosure of classified or sensitive documents or information. Where the administrative law judge determines that documents containing the classified or sensitive matter need to be made available to a party to avoid prejudice, the ALJ may direct that an unclassified and/or nonsensitive summary or extract of the documents be prepared. The administrative law judge may compare the extract or summary with the original to ensure that it is supported by the source document and that it omits only so much as must remain undisclosed. The summary or extract may be admitted as evidence in the record. 


(b) *Arrangements for access.* If the administrative law judge determines that this procedure is unsatisfactory and that classified or otherwise sensitive matter must form part of the record in order to avoid prejudice to a party, the administrative law judge may provide the parties an opportunity to make arrangements that permit a party or a representative to have access to such matter without compromising sensitive information. Such arrangements may include obtaining security clearances or giving counsel for a party access to sensitive information and documents subject to assurances against further disclosure, including a protective order, if necessary.
