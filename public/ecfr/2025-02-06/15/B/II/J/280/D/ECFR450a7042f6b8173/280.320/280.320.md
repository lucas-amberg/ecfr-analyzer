(a) Certificates of recordal remain in an active status for five years and may be maintained in an active status for subsequent five-year periods running consecutively from the date of issuance of the certificate of recordal upon compliance with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. 


(b) Maintenance applications shall be required only if the holder of the certificate of recordal is a manufacturer at the time the maintenance application is required. 


(c) Certificates of recordal will be designated as inactive unless, within six months prior to the expiration of each five-year period running consecutively from the date of issuance, the certificate holder files the prescribed maintenance fee and the maintenance application. The maintenance application must be in the English language and must include the following: 


(1) The name of the manufacturer; 


(2) The address of the manufacturer; 


(3) The entity, domicile, and state of incorporation, if applicable, of the manufacturer; 


(4) A copy of manufacturer's certificate of recordal;

(8) A verification stating that the person signing declares under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America that the information and statements included in the application are true and correct; and 


(9) The maintenance application fee. 


(d) Where no maintenance application is timely filed, a certificate of recordal will be designated inactive. However, such certificate may be designated active if the certificate holder files the prescribed maintenance fee and application and the additional surcharge within six months following the expiration of the certificate of recordal. 


(e) After the six-month period following the expiration of the certificate of recordal, the certificate of recordal shall be deemed active only if the certificate holder files a new application for recordal with the prescribed fee for obtaining a fastener insignia and attaches a copy of the expired certificate of recordal. 


(f) A separate maintenance application and fee must be filed and paid for each recorded insignia.
