# ยง 296.21   Evaluation criteria.

A proposal must be determined to be competitive against the Evaluation Criteria set forth in this section to receive funding under the Program. Additionally, no proposal will be funded unless the Program determines that it has scientific and technical merit and that the proposed research has strong potential for meeting identified areas of critical national need.


(a)(1) The proposer(s) adequately addresses the scientific and technical merit and how the research may result in intellectual property vesting in a United States entity including evidence that:


(i) The proposed research is novel;


(ii) The proposed research is high-risk, high-reward;


(iii) The proposer(s) demonstrates a high level of relevant scientific/technical expertise for key personnel, including contractors and/or informal collaborators, and have access to the necessary resources, for example research facilities, equipment, materials, and data, to conduct the research as proposed;


(iv) The research result(s) has the potential to address the technical needs associated with a major societal challenge not currently being addressed; and


(v) The proposed research plan is scientifically sound with tasks, milestones, timeline, decision points and alternate strategies.


(2) Total weight of (a)(1)(i) through (v) is 50%.


(b)(1) The proposer(s) adequately establishes that the proposed research has strong potential for advancing the state-of-the-art and contributing significantly to the United States science and technology knowledge base and to address areas of critical national need through transforming the Nation's capacity to deal with a major societal challenge(s) that is not currently being addressed, and generate substantial benefits to the Nation that extend significantly beyond the direct return to the proposer including an explanation in the proposal:


(i) Of the potential magnitude of transformational results upon the Nation's capabilities in an area;


(ii) Of how and when the ensuing transformational results will be useful to the Nation; and


(iii) Of the capacity and commitment of each award participant to enable or advance the transformation to the proposed research results (technology).


(2) Total weight of (b)(1)(i) through (iii) is 50%.
