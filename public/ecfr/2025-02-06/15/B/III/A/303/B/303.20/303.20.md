(a) Territorial jewelry producers are entitled to duty refund certificates only for jewelry that they produce which is provided for in heading 7113, HTSUS, is a product of a territory and otherwise meets the requirements for duty-free entry under General Note 3 (a)(iv), HTSUS, and 19 CFR 7.3.


(1) An article of jewelry is considered to be a product of a territory if:


(i) The article is wholly the growth or product of the territory; or


(ii) The article became a new and different article of commerce as a result of production or manufacture performed in the territories.


(2) Eighteen month exemption. Any article of jewelry provided for in HTSUS heading 7113, assembled in the insular possessions by a new entrant jewelry manufacturer shall be treated as a product of the insular possessions if such article is entered into the customs territory of the United States no later than 18 months after such producer commences jewelry manufacturing or jewelry assembly operations in the insular possessions.


(b) *Calculation of the value of the mid-year production incentive certificates.* (1) The value of each producer's certificate shall equal the producer's average creditable wage per unit shipped during the first six months of the calendar year multiplied by the sum of:


(i) The number of units shipped up to 300,000 units times a factor of 90%; plus


(ii) Incremental units shipped up to 3,533,334 units times a factor of 85%; plus


(iii) Incremental units shipped up to 6,766,667 units times a factor of 80%; plus


(iv) Incremental units shipped up to 10,000,000 units times a factor of 75%.

This amount would then be adjusted by deducting the amount of the mid-year duty-refund already issued.


(i) The number of units shipped up to 300,000 units times a factor of 90%; plus


(ii) Incremental units shipped up to 3,533,334 units times a factor of 85%; plus
