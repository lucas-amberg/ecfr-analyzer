# § 400.54   Information.

(a) *Request for information.* The Executive Secretary, on behalf of the Board, may request submission of any information, including business proprietary information, and written argument necessary or appropriate to the proceeding.


(b) *Public information.* Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the Board shall consider all information submitted in a proceeding to be public information, and if the person submitting the information does not agree to its public disclosure, the Board shall return the information and not consider it in the proceeding. Information to meet the basic requirements of §§ 400.21-400.25 is inherently public information to allow meaningful public evaluation pursuant to those sections and § 400.32.


(c) *Business proprietary information.* Persons submitting business proprietary information and requesting that it be protected from public disclosure shall mark the cover page, as well as the top of each page on which such information appears, “business proprietary.” Any business proprietary document submitted for a proceeding other than pursuant to § 400.45 shall contain brackets at the beginning and end of each specific piece of business proprietary information contained in the submission. Any such business proprietary submission shall also be accompanied by a public version that contains all of the document's contents except the information bracketed in the business proprietary version, with the cover page and the top of each additional page marked “public version.” Any information for which business proprietary treatment is claimed must be ranged (*i.e.,* presented as a number or upper and lower limits that approximate the specific business proprietary figure) or summarized in the public version. If a submitting party maintains that certain information is not susceptible to summarization or ranging, the public version must provide a full explanation specific to each such piece of information regarding why summarization or ranging is not feasible.


(d) *Disclosure of information.* Disclosure of public information shall be governed by 15 CFR part 4.


(e) *Availability of information.* Public information in the official record shall be available at the Office of the Executive Secretary, Foreign-Trade Zones Board, U.S. Department of Commerce Building, 1401 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230 and may also be available electronically over the Internet via *http://www.trade.gov/ftz* (or a successor Internet address).
