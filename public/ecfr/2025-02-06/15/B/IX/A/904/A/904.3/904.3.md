In cases where a document or paper described in paragraph (a) of this section is returned unclaimed, service will be considered effective if the U.S. Postal Service provides an affidavit stating that the party was receiving mail at the same address during the period when certified service was attempted.


(d) Any documents and other papers filed or served must be signed:


(1) By the person or persons filing the same;


(2) By an officer thereof if a corporation;
