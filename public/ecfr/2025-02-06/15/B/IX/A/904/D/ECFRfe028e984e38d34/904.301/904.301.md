# ยง 904.301   Bases for permit sanctions or denials.

(a) Unless otherwise specified in a settlement agreement, or otherwise provided by statutes or in this subpart, NOAA may sanction any permit issued under the statutes cited in ยง 904.1(c). The bases for an action to sanction or deny a permit include the following:


(1) Violation of any statute administered by NOAA, including violation of any regulation promulgated or permit condition or restriction prescribed thereunder, by the permit holder/applicant or with the use of a permitted vessel;


(2) The failure to pay a civil penalty imposed under any marine resource law administered by NOAA;


(3) The failure to pay a criminal fine imposed or to satisfy any other liability incurred in a judicial proceeding under any of the statutes administered by NOAA; or


(4) The failure to pay any amount in settlement of a civil forfeiture imposed on a vessel or other property.


(b) A sanction may be applied to a permit involved in the underlying violation, as well as to any permit held or sought by the permit holder/applicant, including permits for other vessels. (See, e.g., 16 U.S.C. 1858(g)(1)(i)).


(c) A permit sanction may not be extinguished by sale or transfer. A vessel's permit sanction is not extinguished by sale or transfer of the vessel, nor by dissolution or reincorporation of a vessel owner corporation, and shall remain with the vessel until lifted by NOAA.
