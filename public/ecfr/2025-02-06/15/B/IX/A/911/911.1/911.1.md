# ยง 911.1   Purpose.

These regulations set forth the procedural, informational and technical requirements for use of the NOAA Data Collection Systems (DCS). In addition, they establish the criteria NOAA will employ when making determinations as to whether to authorize the use of its space-based DCS. The regulations are intended to facilitate the collection of environmental data as well as other such data which the Government is interested in collecting. In those instances where space-based commercial systems do not meet users' requirements, the intent is to not disadvantage the development of the commercial space-based services in this sector. Obtaining a system use agreement to operate data collection platforms pursuant to these regulations does not affect related licensing requirements of other Federal agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission.
