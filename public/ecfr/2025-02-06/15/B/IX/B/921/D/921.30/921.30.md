# § 921.30   Designation of National Estuarine Research Reserves.

(a) The Under Secretary may designate an area proposed for designation by the Governor of the state in which it is located, as a National Esturaine Research Reserve if the Under Secretary finds:


(1) The area is a representative estuarine ecosystem that is suitable for long-term research and contributes to the biogeographical and typological balance of the System;


(2) Key land and water areas of the proposed Reserve, as identified in the management plan, are under adequate state control sufficient to provide long-term protection for reserve resources to ensure a stable environment for research;


(3) Designation of the area as a Reserve will serve to enhance public awareness and understanding of estuarine areas, and provide suitable opportunities for public education and interpretation;


(4) A final management plan has been approved by NOAA;


(5) An MOU has been signed between the state and NOAA ensuring a long-term commitment by the state to the effective operation and implementation of the area as a National Estuarine Research Reserve;


(6) All MOU's necessary for reserve management (*i.e.,* with relevant Federal, state, and local agencies and/or private organizations) have been signed; and 


(7) The coastal state in which the area is located has complied with the requirements of subpart B.


(b) NOAA will determine whether the designation of a National Estuarine Research Reserve in a state with a federally approved coastal zone management program directly affects the coastal zone. If the designation is found to directly affect the coastal zone, NOAA will make a consistency determination pursuant to § 307(c)(1) of the Act, 16 U.S.C. 1456, and 15 CFR part 930, subpart C. See § 921.4(b). The results of this consistency determination will be published in the _Federal Register_ when the notice of designation is published. See § 921.30(c).


(c) NOAA will publish the notice of designation of a National Estuarine Research Reserve in the _Federal Register._ The state shall be responsible for having a similar notice published in the local media.


(d) The term *state control* in § 921.30(a)(3) does not necessarily require that key land and water areas be owned by the state in fee simple. Acquisition of less-than-fee simple interests e.g., conservation easements) and utilization of existing state regulatory measures are encouraged where the state can demonstrate that these interests and measures assure adequate long-term state control consistent with the purposes of the research reserve (see also §§ 921.13(a)(7); 921.21(g)). Should the state later elect to purchase an interest in such lands using NOAA funds, adequate justification as to the need for such acquisition must be provided to NOAA.
