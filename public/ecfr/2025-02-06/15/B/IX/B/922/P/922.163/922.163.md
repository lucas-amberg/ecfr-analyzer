Amendments of authorizations in existence on the effective date of these regulations constitute authorizations issued after the effective date of these regulations.


(d)(1) All military activities shall be carried out in a manner that avoids to the maximum extent practical any adverse impacts on Sanctuary resources and qualities.

(2) In the event of threatened or actual destruction of, loss of, or injury to a Sanctuary resource or quality resulting from an untoward incident, including but not limited to spills and groundings caused by the Department of Defense, the cognizant component shall promptly coordinate with the Director for the purpose of taking appropriate actions to prevent, respond to or mitigate the harm and, if possible, restore or replace the Sanctuary resource or quality.

(1) Those contained in paragraph (a)(4) of this section only as it pertains to discharges of sewage incidental to vessel use and generated by a marine sanitation device approved in accordance with section 312 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), as amended, 33 U.S.C. 1322 *et seq.;* and


(2) Those contained in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.


(f) In no event may the Director issue a certification, authorization, or permit under §§ 922.10, 922.163(c), and 922.166 and subpart D of this part, respectively, authorizing, or otherwise approving, the exploration for, leasing, development, or production of minerals or hydrocarbons within the Sanctuary, the disposal of dredged material within the Sanctuary other than in connection with beach renourishment or Sanctuary restoration projects, or the discharge of untreated or primary treated sewage, and any purported authorizations issued by other authorities for any of these activities within the Sanctuary shall be invalid.

Any fishery regulations in the Sanctuary shall not take effect in Florida State waters until established by the Florida Marine Fisheries Commission.
