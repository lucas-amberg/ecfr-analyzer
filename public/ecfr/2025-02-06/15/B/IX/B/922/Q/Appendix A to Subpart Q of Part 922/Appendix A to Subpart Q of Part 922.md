# Appendix A to Subpart Q of Part 922—Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale, National Marine Sanctuary Boundary Description and Coordinates of the Lateral Boundary Closures and Excluded Areas.


Appendix A provides a text and pictoral (see Figures 1-3) description of the Sanctuary boundary with specific lateral closure points and exclusion areas. The lateral extents (bounds) of each boundary area are closed by straight lines defined by at least two points. It may be necessary to extend these lines beyond the defining points to intersect the actual 100 fathom contour or the shoreline. Each point corresponds to a bounds number indicated in Figure 2. Digital files of the Sanctuary boundary (available in three common formats, ESRI Shape File, MapInfo Table, and an ASCII Exchange Format) are available from the Sanctuary office in Kihei, Maui, at the address listed above or by calling (808) 879-2818. These digital geographies are the best available representation of the verbal legal delineation and were derived from: the Hawaiian shoreline as supplied by State of Hawaii through the Office of Planning GIS Office, the NOAA and State of Hawaii agreed upon lateral boundary and exclusion areas, and the 100 fathom isobath digitized from the following 1:80,000 scale NOAA nautical charts-19327—West Coast of Hawaii (9th ED, 4/29/89),


For the portion of the Lanai region of the HIHWNMS west of Chart 19351,[157°42.8′ west] the 100 fathom contour was derived from the 1:250,000 chart 19340—Hawaii to Oahu (24th ED, 1/09/1993).


All digital geography data have been referenced to WGS84 (NAD83) and have been converted to geographic (latitude and longitude) coordinates.


A. As defined by the specific lateral boundaries in B, and except for excluded areas described in paragraph C of this section, the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary consists of the submerged lands and waters off the coast of the Hawaiian Islands seaward from the shoreline, cutting across the mouths of rivers and streams (see Figure 1):


1. To the 100-fathom (183 meter) isobath from Kailiu Point eastward to Mokolea Point, Kauai;


2. To the 100-fathom (183 meter) isobath from Puaena Point eastward to Mahie Point, and from the Kapahulu Groin in Waikiki eastward to Makapuu Point, Oahu;


3. To the 100-fathom (183 meter) isobath from Cape Halawa, Molokai, south and westward to Ilio Point, Molokai; southwestward to include Penguin Banks; eastward along the east side of Lanai; to the waters seaward of the three nautical mile limit north of Kahoolawe, to the Hanamanoia Lighthouse on Maui, and northward along the shoreline to Lipoa Point, Maui;


4. To the deep water area of Pailolo Channel from Cape Halawa, Molokai, to Lipoa Point, Maui, and southward;


5. To the 100-fathom (183 meter) isobath from Upolu Point southward to Keahole Point, Hawaii.


B. Lateral Closure Bounds for the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary Boundary (see Figure 2).
