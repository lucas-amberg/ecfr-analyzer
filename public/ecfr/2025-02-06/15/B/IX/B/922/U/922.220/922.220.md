Lake Ontario National Marine Sanctuary consists of an area of approximately 1,300 square nautical miles (1,722 square miles) of Lake Ontario waters within New York State and the submerged lands thereunder; over, around, and under the submerged underwater cultural and historical resources in Lake Ontario. The precise boundary coordinates are listed in appendix A to this subpart. The western boundary of the sanctuary begins at approximately the border between Wayne County and Monroe County where the shoreline (defined here and throughout the remainder of this boundary description as the low water datum) intersects the line segment formed between Point 1 and Point 2. From this intersection the sanctuary boundary continues north into Lake Ontario to Point 2 and then to each successive point in numerical order to Point 7. From Point 7 the sanctuary boundary continues east to each successive point in numerical order to Point 10. From Point 10 the boundary continues roughly to the northeast to Point 11 and then to Point 12 just southeast of Wolfe Island, ON, Canada and the end of 5th Line Road. From Point 12 the boundary continues roughly southeast towards Point 13 until it intersects the shoreline at the low water datum at Tibbetts Point near the Tibbetts Point Lighthouse southwest of Cape Vincent, New York. From this intersection the boundary follows the shoreline roughly to the southeast around Tibbetts Point and then continues roughly to the southeast around Wilson Point and Dablon Point until it intersects the line segment formed between Point 14 and Point 15 at the Rt. 6 bridge at the upper end of Mud Bay. From this intersection the boundary continues towards Point 15 until it intersects the shoreline at approximately the mouth of Kents Creek. From this intersection the boundary follows the shoreline to the southwest around Baird Point continuing roughly southeast cutting across the mouths of creeks and streams around Point Peninsula and along western and then northern Chaumont Bay until it intersects the line segment formed between Point 16 and Point 17. From this intersection the boundary continues across the Chaumont River towards Point 17 until it intersects the shoreline near the eastern side of the West Main Street bridge. From this intersection the boundary follows the shoreline around eastern Chaumont Bay, Point Salubrious, and Guffin Bay cutting across the mouths of rivers, streams, and creeks and then around Pillar Point and Everleigh Point and up the western side of Black River Bay until it intersects the line segment formed between Point 18 and Point 19 at approximately the mouth of Black River. From this intersection the boundary continues across the Black River towards Point 19 until it intersects the shoreline. From this intersection the boundary follows the shoreline roughly southwest along the eastern side of Black River Bay and then southwest along the eastern side of Henderson Bay continuing around Stony Point and then roughly south cutting across the mouths of rivers, streams, creeks, and ponds until it intersects the line segment formed between Point 20 and Point 21 at the mouth of the Salmon River near Port Ontario. From this intersection the boundary continues to Point 21 and each successive point in numerical order to Point 24. From Point 24 the boundary continues towards Point 25 until it intersects the shoreline. From this intersection the boundary follows the shoreline south and then west around Mexico Bay cutting across the mouths of rivers, streams, creeks, and ponds until it intersects the line segment formed between Point 26 and Point 27 just east of Oswego Harbor. From this intersection the boundary continues towards Point 27 until it intersects the shoreline at the eastern breakwater of Oswego Harbor. From this intersection the boundary follows the lakeward shoreline northwest along the breakwater until it intersects the line segment formed between Point 28 and Point 29. From this intersection the boundary continues across the mouth of Oswego Harbor to Point 29 and each successive point in numerical order to Point 34. From Point 34 the boundary continues towards Point 35 until it intersects the shoreline at the end of the western breakwater of Oswego Harbor. From this intersection the boundary follows the lakeward shoreline roughly to the southwest cutting across the mouths of rivers, streams, creeks, and ponds until it intersects the line segment formed between Point 36 and Point 37 on the eastern side of the mouth of The Pond. From this intersection the boundary continues across the mouth of The Pond towards Point 37 until it intersects the shoreline on the western side. From this intersection the boundary follows the shoreline west and then north to the intersection of the line segment formed between Point 38 and Pont 39 at the northern end of the eastern breakwater of Little Sodus Bay. From this intersection the boundary continues across the mouth of Little Sodus Bay to Point 39 and each successive point in numerical order to Point 42. From Point 42 the boundary continues towards Point 43 until it intersects the shoreline at the northern end of the western breakwater of Little Sodus Bay. From this intersection the boundary follows the lakeward shoreline roughly west until it intersects the line segment formed between Point 44 and Point 45 on the eastern side of the mouth of Blind Sodus Bay. From this intersection the boundary continues to the intersection of the shoreline and the line segment formed between Point 46 and Point 47 on the western side of the mouth of Blind Sodus Bay. From this intersection the boundary follows the shoreline roughly southwest cutting across the mouths of rivers, streams, creeks, and ponds until it intersects the line segment formed between Point 48 and the intersection of the shoreline and the line segment formed between Point 49 and Point 50 on the eastern side of the mouth of Port Bay. From this intersection on the eastern side of the mouth of Port Bay the boundary continues to the intersection of the shoreline and the line segment formed between Point 49 and 50 on the western side of the mouth of Port Bay. From this intersection the boundary follows the shoreline roughly west until it intersects the line segment formed between Point 51 and the intersection of the shoreline and the line segment formed between Point 52 and Point 53 on the eastern side of the mouth of East Bay. From this intersection on the eastern side of the mouth of East Bay the boundary continues to the intersection of the shoreline and the line segment formed between Point 52 and Point 53 on the western side of the mouth of East Bay. From this intersection the boundary follows the shoreline roughly west until it interests the line segment formed between Point 54 and Point 55 at the northern end of the eastern breakwater of Sodus Bay. From this intersection the boundary continues across the mouth of Sodus Bay to Point 55 and each successive point in numerical order to Point 61. From Point 61 the boundary continues towards Point 62 until it intersects the shoreline at the northern end of the western breakwater of Sodus Bay. From this intersection the boundary follows the shoreline roughly west cutting across the mouths of rivers, streams, creeks, and ponds until it intersects the line segment formed between Point 63 and Point 64 south of the mouth of Salmon Creek near Pultneyville, NY. From this intersection the boundary continues to Point 64 and each successive point in numerical order to Point 69. From Point 69 the boundary continues towards Point 70 until it intersects the shoreline north of the mouth of Salmon Creek. From this intersection the boundary follows the shoreline roughly west until it intersects the line segment formed between Point 71 and Point 72 at the eastern side of the R.E. Ginna Nuclear Power Plant water outfall. From this intersection the boundary continues towards Point 72 until it intersects the shoreline on the western side of the R.E. Ginna Nuclear Power Plant water outfall. From this intersection the boundary follows the shoreline west cutting across the mouths of rivers, streams, creeks, and ponds until it intersects the line segment formed between Point 73 and Point 74 where it ends. The inner landward sanctuary boundary is defined by and follows the shoreline as defined by the low water datum where not already specified in the boundary description above. The Tibbetts Point Anchorage Area is excluded from the sanctuary area described above, and its boundary begins at Point TPAA1 and continues to each successive point in numerical order until ending at Point TPAA7.
