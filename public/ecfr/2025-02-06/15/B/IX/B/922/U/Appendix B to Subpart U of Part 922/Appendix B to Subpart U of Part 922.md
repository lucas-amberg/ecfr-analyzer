# Appendix B to Subpart U of Part 922—Lake Ontario National Marine Sanctuary Terms of Designation


Under the authority of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, as amended (the “Act” or “NMSA”), 16 U.S.C. 1431 *et seq.,* 1,300 nmi
2 (1,722 mi
2) of Lake Ontario off the coast of New York's coastal counties of Wayne, Cayuga, Oswego, and Jefferson are hereby designated as a National Marine Sanctuary for the purpose of providing long-term protection and management of the cultural and historical resources and the recreational, research, educational, and aesthetic qualities of the area.


The NMSA authorizes the issuance of such regulations as are necessary and reasonable to implement the designation, including managing and protecting the cultural and historical resources and the recreational, research, and educational qualities of Lake Ontario National Marine Sanctuary (the “Sanctuary”). Section 1 of Article IV of this Designation Document lists those activities that may have to be regulated on the effective date of designation, or at some later date, in order to protect Sanctuary resources and qualities. Listing an activity does not necessarily mean that it will be regulated. However, if an activity is not listed it may not be regulated, except on an emergency basis, unless Section 1 of Article IV is amended by the same procedures by which the original Sanctuary designation was made.


Lake Ontario National Marine Sanctuary covers approximately 1,300 nmi
2 (1,722 mi
2) in eastern Lake Ontario. The boundary coordinates are defined by regulation (15 CFR 922.220).


Over 1,000 years ago, the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga and Seneca Nations were united into the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, under the Gayanashagowa, the Great Law of Peace. The Tuscarora later joined the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. Portions of the original homelands of the Onondaga Nation, Cayuga Nation, Seneca Nation, and Oneida Nation lie within the boundaries of the sanctuary. This area was their homeland and they developed a deep understanding of, and had a strong connection to, the land and to the water.


Eastern Lake Ontario represents a diverse array of important events in our Nation's history, including military conflicts, maritime innovation, and American expansion to the west. This area has been a critical nexus of maritime trade and transportation for centuries, beginning with canoes and boats of early Indigenous peoples. During the colonial period, Lake Ontario was a strategic theater of conflict among European powers and the young American republic. Military actions occurred in the region during the French and Indian War, Revolutionary War, and the War of 1812. Later, this region was critical to the development of the American West and the Nation's industrial core.


Well-preserved by cold, fresh water, the shipwrecks and other underwater cultural and historical resources in the sanctuary possess exceptional historical, archaeological and recreational value. Vessels that historically plied Lake Ontario's waters often met with treacherous conditions, which resulted in numerous wrecking events. The area contains a total of 41 known shipwrecks and one aircraft, including one shipwreck (*St. Peter*) that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and one wreck (*David Mills)* that is a New York State Submerged Cultural Preserve and Dive Site. This area may also include approximately 19 potential shipwreck sites (shipwrecks that may exist, but additional research is needed to locate and describe these shipwrecks), three aircraft, and several other underwater archaeological sites. Represented in the collection are commercial and military vessels from colonial wars and the War of 1812, as well as submerged battlefields at Oswego and Sackets Harbor. Other shipwrecks represent the earliest maritime commerce on the Great Lakes, including the nearly intact sloop *Washington* built in 1797.


The following activities are subject to regulation under the NMSA. Such regulation may include prohibitions to ensure the protection and management of the conservation, recreational, historical, scientific, educational, cultural, archaeological, or aesthetic resources and qualities of the area. Listing an activity in the Terms of Designation does not mean that such activity is being or will be regulated. Listing an activity here means that Secretary of Commerce can regulate the activity, after complying with all applicable regulatory laws, without going through the designation procedures required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 304 of the NMSA, 16 U.S.C. 1434(a) and (b).


*Activities Subject to Regulation:*

• Injuring or disturbing sanctuary resources;


• Possessing, transporting, or engaging in commerce of any sanctuary resource;


• Grappling into or anchoring on shipwreck sites;


• Deploying tethered underwater mobile systems at shipwreck sites;


• Interfering with an investigation in connection with enforcement of the NMSA.


Where necessary to prevent or minimize the destruction of, loss of, or injury to a Sanctuary resource or quality; or minimize the imminent risk of such destruction, loss, or injury, any activity and all activities, including those not listed in Section 1, are subject to immediate temporary regulation, including prohibition. An emergency regulation shall not take effect without the approval of the Governor of New York or her/his designee or designated agency.


The terms of designation, as defined under Section 304(a)(4) of the Act, may be modified only by the same procedures by which the original designation is made, including public hearings, consultations with interested Federal, Tribal, State, regional, and local authorities and agencies, review by the appropriate Congressional committees, and approval by the Secretary of Commerce, or his or her designee.
