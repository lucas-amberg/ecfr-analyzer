# § 922.234   Certification of preexisting leases, licenses, permits, approvals, other authorizations, or other rights to conduct a prohibited activity.

(a) To obtain a certification of an activity that is specifically authorized by a valid Federal, State, or local lease, permit, license, approval, other authorization or right of subsistence use or access (hereafter in this subsection “permit or right”) in existence on the effective date of Sanctuary designation (Nov. 30, 2024) and within the sanctuary designated area, pursuant to §§ 922.10 and 922.232(g), the holder of such permit or right shall:


(1) Notify the Director, in writing, within 120 days of the effective date of Sanctuary designation (Nov. 30, 2024) of the existence and location of such permit or right and requests certification of such permit or right; and


(2) Comply with any terms and conditions on the exercise of such permit or right imposed as a condition of certification, by the Director, to achieve the purposes for which the Sanctuary was designated.


(3) Address any requests for certifications to: West Coast Regional Office, Office of National Marine Sanctuaries; ATTN: Superintendent, Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, 99 Pacific Street, Suite 100F, Monterey, CA 93940, or send by electronic means as defined in the instructions for the ONMS permit application. A copy of the permit or right must accompany the request.


(b) A holder requesting certification of a permit or right described in § 922.232(g) may continue to conduct the activity without being in violation of Sanctuary prohibitions pending the Director's review of and decision regarding the holder's certification request, provided the holder is otherwise in compliance with this section.


(c) The Director may request additional information from the holder requesting certification as the Director deems reasonably necessary to condition appropriately the exercise of the certified permit or right to achieve the purposes for which the Sanctuary was designated. The Director must receive the information requested within 45 days of the date of the Director's request for information. Failure to provide the requested information within this time frame may be grounds for denial by the Director of the certification request.


(d) In considering whether to impose appropriate conditions when issuing a certification, the Director may seek and consider the views of any other person or entity.


(e) Upon completion of review of the permit or right and information received with respect thereto, the Director shall communicate, in writing, any decision to impose appropriate conditions on a certification request or any action taken with respect to any certification made under this section, in writing, to both the holder of the certified permit, or right, and the issuing agency, and shall set forth the reason(s) for the decision or action taken.


(f) The Director may amend, suspend, or revoke any certification issued under this section whenever continued operation would otherwise be inconsistent with any terms or conditions of the certification, or whenever the underlying permit or right on which the certification was issued has been amended, suspended or revoked. Any such action shall be forwarded in writing to both the certification holder and the agency that issued the underlying permit or right, and shall set forth reason(s) for the action taken.


(g) The holder may appeal any action conditioning a certification, or after issuance of a certification, amending, suspending, or revoking any certification in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 922.37.


(h) Any time limit prescribed in or established under this section may be extended by the Director for good cause.


(i) It is unlawful for any person to violate any terms and conditions in a certification issued under this section.
