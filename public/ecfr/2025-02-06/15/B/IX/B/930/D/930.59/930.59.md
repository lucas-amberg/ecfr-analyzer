# § 930.59   Multiple permit review.

(a) Applicants shall, to the extent practicable, consolidate related federal license or permit activities affecting any coastal use or resource for State agency review. State agencies shall, to the extent practicable, provide applicants with a “one-stop” multiple permit review for consolidated permits to minimize duplication of effort and to avoid unnecessary delays. 


(b) A State agency objection to one or more of the license or permit activities submitted for consolidated review shall not prevent the applicant from receiving Federal agency approval for those license or permit activities found to be consistent with the management program.
