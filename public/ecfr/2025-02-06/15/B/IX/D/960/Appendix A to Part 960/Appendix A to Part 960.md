6. Ground Components


a. Location of Mission Control Center(s) with the ability to operate the system, including where commands are generated:


b. Location of other Ground Station components of the system, meaning facilities that communicate commands to the instrument or receive unenhanced data from it, and facilities that conduct data preprocessing:


c. If any entity or individual other than the Applicant will own, control, or manage any *mission control center(s)* with the ability to operate the System


i. Identity and contact information of that entity or individual:


ii. Relationship to Applicant (*i.e.,* operating under Applicant's instructions under a contract):


7. Information Applicable to Multi-Spectral Imaging (MSI) and/or Hyper-Spectral Imaging (HSI). Applicants must complete this section only if the response in Part B section 2.a. is “MSI” and/or “HSI.”

8. Noise Equivalent Target (NET). Applicants must complete this section only if the response in Part B 2.c. is 5 meters or less, and the answer in Part B section 2.a. is neither “SAR” nor “LIDAR.” NET is the primary parameter used by the U.S. Government to describe an Electro Optical sensor's light sensitivity performance for a target at the same distance from the sensor as is specified as the minimum operating altitude in Part B section 4.d.i. If NET cannot be calculated, simply report the expected minimum detectable ground target radiance in watts:

g. Squint and Graze angles (include maximum and minimum), or other parameters that determine the size and shape of the area of regard of the sensor collection footprint at the ground:


11. Information Applicable to Thermal Infrared (TIR). TIR is defined as collecting in the spectral range of 3.0-5.0 and/or 8.0-12.0-micrometers. Applicants must complete this section only if the response in Part B section 2.a. is “TIR.”


a. Estimated relative thermometric accuracy in degrees Kelvin (± × degrees of actual):


b. Noise Equivalent Differential Temperature (NEDT), or if NEDT cannot be calculated, simply provide the expected temperature sensitivity in terms of minimum resolvable temperature difference in degrees

Standard license conditions are listed at §§ 960.8. 960.9, and 960.10 for Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 systems, respectively. If requesting that any of these be waived or adjusted, please identify the specific standard license condition and explain why one of the following circumstances applies:


1. The requirement is not applicable due to the nature of the Applicant or the proposed system;


2. The Applicant will achieve the goal in a different way; or


3. There is other good cause to waive or adjust the condition.


*Optional:* You may submit evidence of the availability of unenhanced data that is substantially the same as unenhanced data you propose to produce with your system. The Secretary will take any such evidence into account, in addition to other evidence of availability, when determining the appropriate tier for your system under § 960.6.
