# Appendix C to Part 960—License Template


1. The Secretary determines that [licensee name], as described in Part C, will comply with the requirements of the Act, the regulations at this part, and the conditions in this license.


2. Accordingly, the Secretary hereby grants [licensee name] (hereinafter “Licensee”), as described in Part C, this license to operate [system name] (hereinafter “the System”), as described in Part D, subject to the terms and conditions of this license. This license is valid until its term ends in accordance with § 960.15. The Licensee must request and receive approval for a license modification before taking any action that would contradict a material fact listed in Part C or D of this license.


3. The Secretary makes this determination, and grants this license, under the Secretary's authority in 51 U.S.C. 60123 and regulations at this part. This license does not authorize the System's use of spectrum for radio communications or the conduct of any non-remote sensing operations that are proposed to be undertaken by the Licensee. This license is not alienable and creates no property right in the Licensee.


The Licensee (Operator) must, at all times:


[Depending upon the categorization of the application as Tier 1, 2, or 3, Commerce will insert the applicable standard license conditions, found at § 960.8, § 960.9, and/or § 960.10, and, for a Tier 3 license, any applicable temporary conditions resulting from the process in § 960.10, in this part of the license.]


Every term below constitutes a material fact. You must request and receive approval of a license modification before taking any action that would contradict a material fact.
