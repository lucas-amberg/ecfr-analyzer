(i) *Government assistance in resolving international conflicts.* If, by October 26 1982, the applicants have not resolved, or agreed in writing to a specified binding procedure to resolve, an original international conflict, or new international conflict, the Administrator, the Secretary of State of the United States, and appropriate officials of the government of the reciprocating state to which the other applicant involved in the conflict applied will use their good offices to assist the applicants to resolve the conflict. After November 16, 1982, any unresolved international conflicts will be resolved in accordance with paragraph (k) of this section.


(j) *Unresolved domestic conflict*—(1) *Procedure.* (i) In the case of an original domestic conflict or a new domestic conflict, the applicants will be allowed until April 15, 1983, to resolve the conflict or agree in writing to submit the conflict to a specified binding conflict resolution procedure. If, by April 15, 1983, all applicants involved in an original or new domestic conflict have not resolved that conflict, or agreed in writing to submit the conflict to a specified binding conflict resolution procedure, the conflict will be resolved in a formal hearing held in accordance with subpart I of 15 CFR part 971, except that: 


(A) The General Counsel of NOAA will not, as a matter of right, be a party to the hearing; however, the General Counsel may be admitted to the hearing by the administrative law judge as a party or as an interested person pursuant to 15 CFR 971.901 (f)(2) or (f)(3); and 


(B) The administrative law judge will take such actions as he deems necessary and appropriate to conclude the hearing and transmit a recommended decision to the Administrator in an expeditious manner.


(ii) Notwithstanding the above, at any time on or after November 17, 1982, and on or before April 14, 1983, the applicants involved in the conflict may, by agreement, request the Administrator to resolve the conflict in a formal hearing as described above.


(2) *Decision principles for NOAA formal conflict resolution.* (i) The Administrator shall determine which applicant involved in a conflict between or among pre-enactment explorer applications or amendments shall be awarded all or part of each area in conflict.


(ii) The determination of the Administrator shall be based on the application of principles of equity which take into consideration, with respect to each applicant involved in the conflict, the following factors:


(A) The continuity and extent of activities relevant to each area in conflict and the application area of which it is a part;


(B) The date on which each applicant involved in the conflict, or predecessor in interest or component organization thereof, commenced activities at sea in the application area;


(C) The financial cost of activities relevant to each area in conflict and to the application area of which it is a part, measured in constant dollars;


(D) The time when the activities were carried out, and the quality of the activities; and


(E) Such additional factors as the Administrator determines to be relevant, but excluding consideration of the future work plans of the applicants involved in any conflict.


(iii) For the purposes of this paragraph (j) of this section, the word *activities* means the undertakings, commitments of resources investigations, findings, research, engineering development and other activities relevant to the identification, discovery, and systematic analysis and evaluation of hard mineral resources and to the determination of the technical and economic feasibility of commercial recovery.


(iv) When considering the factors specified in paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section, the Administrator shall hear, and shall (except for purposes of apportionment pursuant to paragraph (j)(2)(v) of this section) limit his consideration to, all evidence based on the activities specified in paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section which were conducted on or before January 1, 1982, *Provided, however,* That an applicant must prove at-sea activities in the area in conflict prior to June 28, 1980, as a pre-condition to presentation of further evidence to the Administrator regarding activities in the area in conflict.


(v) In making his determination, the Administrator may award the entire area in conflict to one applicant involved in the conflict, or he may apportion the area among any or all of the applicants involved in the conflict. If, after applying the principles of equity, the Administrator determines that the area in conflict should be apportioned, the Administrator shall (to the maximum extent practicable consistent with the Administrator's application of the principles of equity) apportion the area in a manner designed to satisfy the plan of work set forth in the application of each applicant which is awarded part of the area.


(vi) Each applicant involved in the conflict must file an amendment to its application if necessary to implement the determination made by the Administrator.


(k) *Unresolved international conflicts.* (1) If, by November 17, 1982, all applicants involved in an original or new international conflict have not resolved that conflict, or agreed in writing to submit the conflict to a specified binding conflict resolution procedure, the applicants shall proceed in accordance with the conflict resolution procedures agreed to between the United States and its reciprocating states pursuant to section 118 of the Act.


(2) Each applicant whose application is involved in an international conflict shall be responsible for actions required in the conduct of the conflict resolution procedures, including bearing a proportional cost of implementing the procedures, representing himself in any proceedings, and assisting in the selection of arbitrators if necessary.


(l) *Continued opportunity for voluntary resolutions.* Each applicant may resolve any conflict by voluntary procedures at any time while that conflict persists.


(m) *Effect on priorities of new entrants.* (1) A pre-enactment explorer is entitled to a priority of right over a new entrant for any area in which the pre-enactment explorer has engaged in exploration prior to June 28, 1980 if, with respect to that area, the pre-enactment explorer files an application in accordance with this part on or after January 25, 1982 and on or before the closing date for pre-enactment explorer applications established under § 970.301(b).


(2) Any amendment which is filed by a pre-enactment explorer on or before October 15, 1982, relates back to the date of filing of the original application and shall give the pre-enactment explorer priority of right over all new entrants if the amendment is accorded a pre-enactment explorer priority of right under paragraph (g) of this section.
