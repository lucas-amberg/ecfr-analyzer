# § 970.500   General.

(a) *Proposal.* After certification of an application pursuant to Subpart D of this part, the Administrator will proceed with a proposal to issue or transfer a license for the exploration activities described in the application. 


(b)(1) *Terms, conditions and restrictions.* Within 180 days (or such longer period as the Administrator may establish for good cause shown in writing) after certification, the Administrator will propose terms and conditions for, and restrictions on, the proposed exploration which are consistent with the provisions of the Act and this part as set forth in §§ 970.517 through 970.524. Proposed and final terms, conditions and restrictions will be uniform in all licenses, except to the extent that differing physical and environmental conditions require the establishment of special terms, conditions and restrictions for the conservation of natural resources, protection of the environment, or the safety of life and property at sea. The Administrator will propose these in writing to the applicant. Also, public notice thereof will be provided pursuant to § 970.501, and they will be included with the draft of the EIS on the issuance of a license which is required by section 109(d) of the Act.


(2) If the Administrator does not propose terms, conditions and restrictions within 180 days after certification, he will notify the applicant in writing of the reasons for the delay and will indicate the approximate date on which the proposed terms, conditions and restrictions will be completed.


(c) *Findings.* Before issuing or transferring an exploration license, the Administrator must make written findings in accordance with the requirements of §§ 970.503 through 970.507. These findings will be made after considering all information submitted with respect to the application and proposed issuance or transfer. He will make a final determination on issuance or transfer of a license, and will publish a final EIS on that action, within 180 days (or such longer period of time as he may establish for good cause shown in writing) following the date on which proposed terms, conditions and restrictions, and the draft EIS, are published.
