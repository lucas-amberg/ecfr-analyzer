(c) Within 90 days after receipt of the notice of objection, the Administrator will act on the objection and publish in the _Federal Register,_ as well as provide to the licensee, written notice of his decision.


(d) If, after the Administrator takes final action on an objection, the licensee demonstrates that a dispute remains on a material issue of fact, the Administrator will provide for a formal hearing which will proceed in accordance with subpart I of 15 CFR part 971.


(e) Any final determination by the Administrator on an objection to terms, conditions or restrictions in a license after the formal hearing provided in paragraph (d) of this section is subject to judicial review as provided in chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code.
