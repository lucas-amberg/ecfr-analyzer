(a) The Administrator may:


(1) In addition to, or in lieu of, the imposition of any civil penalty under subpart J of 15 CFR part 971, or in addition to the imposition of any fine under subpart J, suspend or revoke any license issued under this part, or suspend or modify any particular activities under such a license, if the licensee substantially fails to comply with any provision of the Act, this part, or any term, condition or restriction of the license; and 


(2) Suspend or modify particular activities under any license, if the President determines that such suspension or modification is necessary:


(i) To avoid any conflict with any international obligation of the United States established by any treaty or convention in force with respect to the United States; or


(ii) To avoid any situation which may reasonably be expected to lead to a breach of international peace and security involving armed conflict.


(b) Any action taken by the Administrator in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) will proceed pursuant to the procedures in 15 CFR 971.1003. Any action taken in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) will proceed pursuant to paragraphs (c) through (i) of this section, other than paragraph (h)(2).


(c) Prior to taking any action specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section the Administrator will publish in the _Federal Register,_ and send to the licensee, written notice of the proposed action. The notice will include:


(1) The basis of the proposed action; and


(2) If the basis for the proposed action is a deficiency which the Administrator believes the licensee can correct:


(i) The action believed necessary to correct the deficiency; and


(ii) The time within which any correctable deficiency must be corrected (this period of time may not exceed 180 days except as specified by the Administrator for good cause).


(d) The Administrator will take the proposed action:


(1) On the 30th day after the date the notice is sent to the licensee, under paragraph (c) of this section, unless before such 30th day the licensee files with the Administrator a written request for an administrative review of the proposed action; or


(2) On the last day of the period established under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section in which the licensee must correct the deficiency, if such deficiency has not been corrected before such day and an administrative review requested pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section is not pending or in progress.


(e) If a timely request for administrative review of the proposed action is made by the licensee under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Administrator will promptly begin a formal hearing in accordance with subpart I of 15 CFR part 971. If the proposed action is the result of a correctable deficiency, the administrative review will proceed concurrently with any attempt to correct the deficiency, unless the parties agree otherwise or the administrative law judge orders differently. 


(f) The Administrator will serve on the licensee, and publish in the _Federal Register,_ written notice of the action taken including the reasons therefor.


(g) Any final determination by the Administrator to take the proposed action is subject to judicial review as provided in chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code.


(h) The issuance of any notice of proposed action under this section will not affect the continuation of exploration activities by a licensee, except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section.


(i) The provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (h) of this section will not apply when:


(1) The President determines by Executive Order that an immediate suspension of a license, or immediate suspension or modification of particular activities under such license, is necessary for the reasons set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section; or


(2) The Administrator determines that immediate suspension of such a license, or immediate suspension or modification of particular activities under a license, is necessary to prevent a significant adverse effect on the environment or to preserve the safety of life or property at sea, and the Administrator issues an emergency order in accordance with ยง 971.1003(d)(4).


(j) The Administrator will immediately rescind the emergency order as soon as he has determined that the cause for the order has been removed.
