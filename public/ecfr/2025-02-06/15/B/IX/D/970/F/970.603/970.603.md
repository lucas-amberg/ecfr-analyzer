# ยง 970.603   Conservation of resources.

(a) With respect to the exploration phase of seabed mining, the requirement for the conservation of natural resources, encompassing due regard for the prevention of waste and the future opportunity for the commercial recovery of the unrecovered balance of the hard mineral resources in the area to which the license applies, may not be particularly relevant. Thus, since the Act requires such terms, conditions and restrictions only as needed, exploration licenses will require such provisions only as the Administrator deems necessary. 


(b) NOAA views license phase mining system tests as an opportunity to examine, with industry, the conservation implications of any mining patterns used. Thus, in order to develop information needed for future decisions during commercial recovery, NOAA will include with a license a requirement for the submission of collector track and nodule production data. Only if information submitted reflects that the integrated system tests are resulting in undue waste or threatening the future opportunity for commercial recovery of the unrecovered balance of hard mineral resources will the Administrator modify the terms, conditions or restrictions pertaining to the conservation of natural resources, in order to address such problems.


(c) If the Administrator so modifies such terms, conditions and restrictions relating to conservation of resources, he will employ a balancing process in the consideration of the state of the technology being developed, the processing system utilized and the value and potential use of any waste, the environmental effects of the exploration activities, economic and resource data, and the national need for hard mineral resources.
