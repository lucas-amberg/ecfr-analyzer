# § 971.400   General.

(a) *Proposal.* After certification of an application pursuant to subpart C of this part, the Administrator will proceed with a proposal to issue or transfer a permit for the commercial recovery activities described in the application.


(b) *Terms conditions and restrictions.* (1) Within 180 days after certification (or such longer period as the Administrator may establish for good cause shown in writing), the Administrator will propose terms and conditions for, and restrictions on, the proposed commercial recovery which are consistent with the provisions of the Act and this part as set forth in §§ 971.418 through 971.430. Proposed and final TCRs will be uniform in all permits, except to the extent that differing physical and environmental conditions and/or mining methods require the establishment of special TCRs for the conservation of natural resources, protection of the environment, or the safety of life and property at sea. The Administrator will propose TCRs in writing to the applicant, and public notice thereof will be provided pursuant to § 971.401. The proposed TCRs will be included with the draft of the EIS on permit issuance.


(2) If the Administrator does not propose TCRs within 180 days after certification, the Administrator will notify the applicant in writing of the reasons for delay and of the approximate date on which the proposed TCRs will be completed.


(c) *Findings.* Before issuing or transferring a commercial recovery permit, the Administrator must make written findings in accordance with the requirements of § 971.403 through § 971.408. These findings will be made after considering all information submitted with respect to the application and proposed issuance or transfer. The Administrator will make a final determination of issuance or transfer of a permit, and will publish a final EIS on that action, within 180 days (or such longer period of time as the Administrator may establish for good cause shown in writing) following the date on which proposed TCRs and the draft EIS are published.
