# ยง 971.408   Processing outside the United States.

(a) Before issuing or transferring a commercial recovery permit which authorizes processing outside the U.S., the Administrator must find, after the opportunity for an agency hearing required by ยง 971.212(b), that:


(1) The processing of the quantity concerned of hard mineral resource at a place other than within the United States is necessary for the economic viability of the commercial recovery activities of the permittee; and


(2) Satisfactory assurances have been given by the permittee that such resources, after processing, to the extent of the permittee's ownership therein, will be returned to the United States for domestic use, if the Administrator so requires after determining that the national interest necessitates such return.


(b) At or after permit issuance the Administrator may determine, or revise a prior determination, that the national interest necessitates return to the U.S. of a specified amount of hard mineral resource recovered pursuant to the permit and authorized to be processed outside the United States. Considerations in making this determination may include:


(1) The national interest in an adequate supply of minerals;


(2) The foreign policy interests of the United States; and


(3) The multi-national character of deep seabed mining operations.


(c) As appropriate, TCRs will incorporate provisions to implement the decision of the Administrator made pursuant to this section.


(d) Environmental considerations of the proposed activity will be addressed in accordance with ยง 971.606(c).
