# § 971.412   Changes in permits and permit terms, conditions, and restrictions.

(a) During the duration of a commercial recovery permit, changes in the permit or its associated commercial recovery plan may be initiated by either the permittee or the Administrator.


(b) A significant change is one which, if approved, would result in:


(1) An increase of more than five percent in the size of the commercial recovery area; or


(2) A change in the location of five percent or more of the commercial recovery area.


(c) A major change is one affecting one or more of:


(1) The bases for certifying the original application pursuant to § 971.301;


(2) The bases for issuing or transferring the permit pursuant to § 971.403 through § 971.408;


(3) The TCRs issued as part of the permit pursuant to §§ 971.418 through 971.430; or


(4) The ownership of a permittee (or the membership of the joint venture, partnership or other entity on whose behalf the permit was issued); and which change is sufficiently broad in scope to raise a question as to:


(i) The permittee's ability to meet the requirements of the sections cited in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section;


(ii) The sufficiency of the TCRs to accomplish their intended purpose; or 


(iii) The antitrust characteristic of the permittee.


(d) A minor change is one that is clearly more modest in scope than the changes described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.


(e) A permittee may not implement a significant or major change, as defined in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, until an application for revision of the permit or its associated commercial recovery plan has been approved by the Administrator. However, advance notice of proposed major changes in a permittee's corporate membership or legal structure is not required, unless practicable, but the Administrator expects prompt notification of the occurrence of such a major change.


(f) A proposed significant or major change, as defined in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, may trigger the need for additional review, under the Federal consistency provisions of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended.
