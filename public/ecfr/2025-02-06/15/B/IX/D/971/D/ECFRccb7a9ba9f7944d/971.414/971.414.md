# ยง 971.414   Modification of permit terms, conditions, and restrictions.

(a) After issuance or transfer of any permit, the Administrator, after consultation with appropriate Federal agencies and the permittee, may modify the TCRs in a permit for the following purposes:


(1) To avoid unreasonable interference with the interests of other nations in their exercise of the freedoms of the high seas, as recognized under general principles of international law. This determination will take into account the considerations listed in ยง 971.403;


(2) If relevant data and information (including, but not limited to, data resulting from activities under a permit) indicate that modification is required to protect the quality of the environment or to promote the safety of life and property at sea; 


(3) To avoid a conflict with any international obligation of the United States, established by any treaty or convention in force with respect to the United States, as determined in writing by the President; or 


(4) To avoid any situation which may reasonably be expected to lead to a breach of international peace and security involving armed conflict, as determined in writing by the President.


(b) A proposal by the Administrator to modify the TCRs in a permit is significant and must be followed by the full application procedures in this part, including a public hearing, if it would result in either of the changes identified in ยง 971.412(b).


(c) All proposed modifications other than those described in paragraph (b) of this section will be acted on after the Administrator provides:


(1) Written notice of the proposal to the permittee; and


(2) Publication of this proposal in the _Federal Register_ with a 60-day opportunity for comment.


(d)(1) The Administrator will effect a modification of the TCRs if the Administrator finds in writing that the proposed modification will comply with the requirements of the Act and this part.


(2) Upon adopting a TCR modification, the Administrator shall issue to the permittee an amended permit including the modified TCRs, and shall publish notice of issuance in the _Federal Register._

(3) The procedures for objection to modification of the TCRs are the same as those for objection to a TCR under ยง 971.411 of this part.
