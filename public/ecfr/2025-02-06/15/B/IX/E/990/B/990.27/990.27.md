(iii) Model-based procedures, including type A procedures identified in 43 CFR part 11, subpart D, and compensation formulas/schedules; and


(iv) Literature-based procedures.


(2) Trustees may use the assessment procedures in paragraph (b)(1) of this section alone, or in any combination, provided that the standards in paragraph (a) of this section are met, and there is no double recovery.


(c) *Selecting assessment procedures.* (1) When selecting assessment procedures, trustees must consider, at a minimum:


(i) The range of procedures available under paragraph (b) of this section;


(ii) The time and cost necessary to implement the procedures;

(iv) The potential restoration actions for the injury; and
