# ยง 990.42   Determination to conduct restoration planning.

(a) *Determination on restoration planning.* If trustees determine that there is jurisdiction to pursue restoration under OPA, trustees must determine whether: 


(1) Injuries have resulted, or are likely to result, from the incident; 


(2) Response actions have not adequately addressed, or are not expected to address, the injuries resulting from the incident; and 


(3) Feasible primary and/or compensatory restoration actions exist to address the potential injuries. 


(b) *Proceeding with preassessment.* If the conditions listed in paragraph (a) of this section are met, trustees may proceed under ยง 990.44 of this part. If one of these conditions is not met, trustees may not take additional action under this part, except action to finalize this determination. However, trustees may recover all reasonable assessment costs incurred up to this point.
