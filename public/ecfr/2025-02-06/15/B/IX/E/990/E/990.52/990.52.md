# § 990.52   Injury assessment—quantification.

(a) *General.* In addition to determining whether injuries have resulted from the incident, trustees must quantify the degree, and spatial and temporal extent of such injuries relative to baseline. 


(b) *Quantification approaches.* Trustees may quantify injuries in terms of: 


(1) The degree, and spatial and temporal extent of the injury to a natural resource; 


(2) The degree, and spatial and temporal extent of injury to a natural resource, with subsequent translation of that adverse change to a reduction in services provided by the natural resource; or 


(3) The amount of services lost as a result of the incident. 


(c) *Natural recovery.* To quantify injury, trustees must estimate, quantitatively or qualitatively, the time for natural recovery without restoration, but including any response actions. The analysis of natural recovery may consider such factors as: 


(1) The nature, degree, and spatial and temporal extent of injury; 


(2) The sensitivity and vulnerability of the injured natural resource and/or service; 


(3) The reproductive and recruitment potential; 


(4) The resistance and resilience (stability) of the affected environment; 


(5) The natural variability; and 


(6) The physical/chemical processes of the affected environment.
