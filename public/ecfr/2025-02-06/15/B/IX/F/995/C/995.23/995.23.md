# § 995.23   Acquisition of data.

(a) CED or CEVAD shall obtain official NOAA ENC ® files only by directly downloading them from an official NOAA ENC site on the Internet.


(b)(1) After downloading NOAA ENC files, CED or CEVAD shall uncompress the files and compute a CRC checksum value for each NOAA ENC file and verify that it matches the CRC checksum value contained in the CATALOG.031 file provided with the NOAA ENC files by NOAA. This is to ensure that no NOAA ENC files have been corrupted during the download process.


(2) In the event that said CRC checksum value does not match that in the CATALOG.031 file, CED or CEVAD agrees to:


(i) Repeat the download process;


(ii) In the event that said CRC checksum value for the repeat download does not match that in the CATALOG.031 file, immediately notify the NOAA ENC Production Manager at *enc.chartproduction@noaa.gov*, and;


(iii) Not redistribute any NOAA ENC that does not have a valid CRC checksum.
