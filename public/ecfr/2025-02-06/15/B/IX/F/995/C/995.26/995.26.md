# § 995.26   Conversion of NOAA ENC ® files to other formats.

(a) *Conversion of NOAA ENC files to other formats*—(1) *Content.* CEVAD may provide NOAA ENC data in forms other than that provided by NOAA. However, CEVAD shall not change the information content provided by the NOAA ENC. This means that all features and their associated attribution must be preserved in the CEVADs data files without degradation to positional accuracy or informational content.


(2) *Software certification.* Conversion of NOAA ENC data to other formats must be accomplished within the constraints of IHO Technical Resolution A3.11: “ENC/SENC Distribution Option” (incorporated by reference, see § 995.2)—in particular, paragraph three:


Distributors who are to supply the SENC service must operate under the regulations of the issuing authority. The onshore ENC to SENC conversion must be performed using type-approved software.


(3) *Error reporting.* Any errors detected during the conversion process shall be logged and investigated prior to releasing the data in which the errors occurred. Any errors that apparently originate in the NOAA ENC files shall be immediately reported to NOAA.


(4) *Format check.* CEVAD shall ensure that the converted data conforms to the CEVAD's own format specifications and shall test load the converted data to ensure that it will correctly load and display on the intended equipment.


(b) [Reserved]
