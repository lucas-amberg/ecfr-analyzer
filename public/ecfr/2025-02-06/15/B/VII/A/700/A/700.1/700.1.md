This part implements the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) that is administered by the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security. The DPAS implements the priorities and allocations authority of the Defense Production Act (50 U.S.C. 4501 *et seq.*), delegated to the Department of Commerce under Executive Order 13603, including use of that authority to support emergency preparedness activities pursuant to Title VI of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 *et seq.*), and the priorities authority of the Selective Service Act and related statutes, all with respect to industrial resources. The DPAS establishes procedures for the placement, acceptance, and performance of priority rated contracts and orders (other than contracts of employment) and for the allocation of materials, services, and facilities for approved programs. The guidance and procedures in this part are generally consistent with the guidance and procedures provided in other regulations issued under Executive Order 13603 authority.
