# § 700.71   Audits and investigations.

(a) Audits and investigations are official actions involving the examination of books, records, documents, other writings, and information to ensure that the provisions of the Defense Production Act, the Selective Service Act and related statutes, and this part have been properly followed. An audit or investigation may also include interviews and a systems evaluation to detect problems or failures in the implementation of this part.


(b) When undertaking an audit, investigation, or other inquiry, the Department of Commerce shall:


(1) Define the scope and purpose in the official action given to the person under investigation, and


(2) Have ascertained that the information sought or other adequate and authoritative data are not available from any Federal or other responsible agency.


(c) In administering this part, the Department of Commerce may issue the following documents, which constitute official actions:


(1) *Administrative subpoenas.* An administrative subpoena requires a person to appear as a witness before an official designated by the Department of Commerce to testify under oath on matters of which that person has knowledge relating to the enforcement or the administration of the Defense Production Act, the Selective Service Act and related statutes, or this part. An administrative subpoena may also require the production of books, papers, records, documents and physical objects or property.


(2) *Demand for information.* A demand for information requires a person to furnish to a duly authorized representative of the Department of Commerce any information necessary or appropriate to the enforcement or the administration of the Defense Production Act, the Selective Service Act, or this part.


(3) *Inspection authorizations.* An inspection authorization requires a person to permit a duly authorized representative of the Department of Commerce to interview the person's employees or agents, to inspect books, records, documents, other writings and information in the person's possession or control at the place where that person usually keeps them, and to inspect a person's property when such interviews and inspections are necessary or appropriate to the enforcement or the administration of the Defense Production Act, the Selective Service Act, or this part.


(d) The production of books, records, documents, other writings and information will not be required at any place other than where they are usually kept if, prior to the return date specified in the administrative subpoena or demand for information, a duly authorized official of the Department of Commerce is furnished with copies of such material that are certified under oath to be true copies. As an alternative, a person may enter into a stipulation with a duly authorized official of the Department of Commerce as to the content of the material.


(e) An administrative subpoena, demand for information, or inspection authorization shall include the name, title or official position of the person to be served, the evidence sought to be adduced, and its general relevance to the scope and purpose of the audit, investigation, or other inquiry. If employees or agents are to be interviewed; if books, records, documents, other writings, or information are to be produced; or if property is to be inspected; the administrative subpoena, demand for information, or inspection authorization will describe them with particularity.


(f) Service of documents shall be made in the following manner:


(1) Service of a demand for information or inspection authorization shall be made personally, or by certified mail—return receipt requested at the person's last known address. Service of an administrative subpoena shall be made personally. Personal service may also be made by leaving a copy of the document with someone at least 18 years of age at the person's last known dwelling or place of business.


(2) Service upon other than an individual may be made by serving a partner, corporate officer, or a managing or general agent authorized by appointment or by law to accept service of process. If an agent is served, a copy of the document shall be mailed to the person named in the document.


(3) Any individual 18 years of age or older may serve an administrative subpoena, demand for information, or inspection authorization. When personal service is made, the individual making the service shall prepare an affidavit as to the manner in which service was made and the identity of the person served, and return the affidavit, and in the case of subpoenas, the original document, to the issuing officer. In case of failure to make service, the reasons for the failure shall be stated on the original document.
