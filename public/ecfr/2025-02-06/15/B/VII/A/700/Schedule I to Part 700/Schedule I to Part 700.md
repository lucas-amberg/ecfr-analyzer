# Schedule I to Part 700—Approved Programs and Delegate Agencies




Schedule I provides a list of approved programs. They have equal preferential status. Use of this part in support of an approved program requires written authorization by the Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce has authorized the delegate agencies listed in the third column to use this part in support of those programs assigned to them, as indicated below. The Department of Commerce is also listed as an agency in the third column for programs where its authorization in writing is necessary to place rated orders (see § 700.51 for information on how to request priority rating authority).


The Department of Commerce has authorized Delegate Agencies to place priority ratings on contracts and orders for industrial resources needed to implement any approved program that has been authorized for priorities support by the appropriate Resource Department. The program identification symbol used on priority rated contracts and orders authorized by the appropriate Resource Department to support the approved program must also be used on rated orders for industrial resources needed to implement the approved program. However, any rated order for industrial resources placed to implement an approved program that has been authorized for priorities support by a Resource Department remains subject to the provisions of this part. The program identification symbols for these approved programs are found under the “Other Programs” section of Schedule I.
