# § 705.5   Request or application for an investigation.

(a) A request or application for an investigation shall be in writing. The original, 1 copy and an electronic version of the report in the form of a Portable Document Format (PDF) file shall be filed with the Director, Office of Technology Evaluation, Room H-1093, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, with the PDF version being submitted to *DIBPrograms@bis.doc.gov.* An application for an investigation from an interested party that includes information submitted in confidence in accordance with the procedures of § 705.6 must also include a public version in written and electronic form containing all non-confidential information and public summaries of business confidential information as provided below. For persons seeking to submit business confidential information (trade secrets, commercial or financial information, or any other information considered sensitive or privileged), the public version of the application must contain a summary of the business confidential information in sufficient detail to permit a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information. Generally, numerical data will be considered adequately summarized if grouped or presented in terms of indices or figures within 10 percent of the actual figure. If an individual portion of the numerical data is voluminous (*e.g.,* 5 pages of numerical data), at least one percent of the numerical data, representative of that portion, must be summarized. If the submitter claims that summarization is not possible, the claim must be accompanied by a full explanation of the reason(s). In order to submit business confidential information that is not for public release or classified national security information as a separate submission to the U.S. Department of Commerce, applicants must follow the procedures specified in § 705.6.




(b) When a request, application or motion is under investigation, or when an investigation has been completed pursuant to § 705.10 of this part, any subsequently filed request or application concerning imports of the same or related article that does not raise new or different issues may be either consolidated with the investigation in progress as provided in § 705.7(e) of this part, or rejected. In either event, an explanation for taking such action shall be promptly given to the applicant. If the request or application is rejected, it will not be returned unless requested by the applicant.


(c) Requests or applications shall describe how the quantity, availability, character, and uses of a particular imported article, or other circumstances related to its import, affect the national security, and shall contain the following information to the fullest extent possible:


(1) Identification of the applicant;


(2) A precise description of the article;


(3) Description of the domestic industry affected, including pertinent information regarding companies and their plants, locations, capacity and current output of the industry;


(4) Pertinent statistics on imports and domestic production showing the quantities and values of the article;


(5) Nature, sources, and degree of the competition created by imports of the article;


(6) The effect that imports of the article may have upon the restoration of domestic production capacity in the event of national emergency;


(7) Employment and special skills involved in the domestic production of the article;


(8) Extent to which the national economy, employment, investment, specialized skills, and productive capacity is or will be adversely affected;


(9) Revenues of Federal, State, or local Governments which are or may be adversely affected;


(10) National security supporting uses of the article including data on applicable contracts or sub-contracts, both past and current; and


(11) Any other information or advice relevant and material to the subject matter of the investigation.


(d) Statistical material presented should be, if possible, on a calendar-year basis for sufficient periods of time to indicate trends. Monthly or quarterly data for the latest complete years should be included as well as any other breakdowns which may be pertinent to show seasonal or short-term factors.
