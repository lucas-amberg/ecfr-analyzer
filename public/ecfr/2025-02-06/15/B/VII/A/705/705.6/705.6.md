# § 705.6   Confidential information.

(a) This paragraph (a) specifies the requirements for submission of classified national security information, business confidential information, and the treatment of United States Government communications during an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (a “Section 232 investigation”), or as part of a request or application for an investigation.


(1) *Classified national security information.* Any information or material, which the applicant or any other party desires to submit in confidence at any stage of the investigation or as part of an application for an investigation, that is classified national security information (“classified information”) within the meaning of Executive Order 13526 shall be marked and submitted to the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in accordance with the guidelines set forth in 32 CFR part 2001 regarding the handling of classified information. Before sending classified information, the applicant or any other party wishing to submit classified information must contact BIS for any additional handling instructions or submission requirements that may be applicable by contacting the Director, Office of Technology Evaluation, Room H-1093, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230. Any information or material submitted that is identified as classified information must be accompanied at the time of submission by a statement indicating the degree of classification, the authority for the classification, and the identity of the classifying entity. Classified national security information described in this paragraph (a)(1) does not require a public version.


(2) *Business confidential information.* Any information or material submitted electronically, which the applicant or any other party desires to submit in confidence at any stage of the investigation or as part of an application for an investigation, that is business confidential information (trade secrets, commercial or financial information, or any other information considered sensitive or privileged) should be contained within a file beginning its name with the characters “BC”. Any page containing business confidential information must be clearly marked “BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL” on the top of that page, and any pages not containing confidential information should not be so marked. By submitting information or material identified as business confidential information, the applicant or other party represents that the information is exempted from public disclosure, either by the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552 *et seq.*) or by some other specific statutory exemption. Any request for business confidential treatment must be accompanied at the time of filing by a statement justifying non-disclosure and referring to the specific legal authority claimed. The public summary version required under § 705.5 must be clearly marked “PUBLIC”. When submitted electronically, the file name of the non-confidential version should begin with the character “P”. The “P” should be followed by the name of the person or entity submitting the information or material. All filers should name their files using the name of the person or entity submitting the comments.


(3) *United States Government communications.* Communications from agencies of the United States Government, including but not limited to requests for investigation submitted pursuant to § 705.5, will generally not be made available to the public.


(b) The Department may refuse to accept as business confidential any information or material it considers not intended to be protected under the legal authority claimed by the applicant, or under other applicable legal authority. Any such information or material so refused shall be promptly returned to the submitter and will not be considered. However, such information or material may be resubmitted as non-confidential in which case it will be made part of the public record.
