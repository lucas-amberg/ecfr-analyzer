# Supplement No. 2 to Part 705â€”General Approved Exclusions (GAEs) for Steel Articles Under the Section 232 Exclusions Process




This supplement identifies steel articles that have been approved for import under a General Approved Exclusion (GAE). The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, the United States Trade Representative, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and other senior Executive Branch officials as appropriate, makes these determinations that certain steel articles may be authorized under a GAE consistent with the objectives of the 232 Exclusions Process as outlined in supplement no. 1 to this part. The GAEs described in this supplement may be used by any importer. GAEs do not include quantity limits. Each GAE identifier will be effective fifteen calendar days after publication of a _Federal Register_ notice either adding or revising a specific GAE identifier. There is no retroactive relief for GAEs. Relief is only available to steel articles that are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the effective date of a GAE included in supplement no. 2 to this part. In order to use a GAE, the importer must include the GAE identifier in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) system that corresponds to the steel articles being imported. These GAEs are indefinite in length, but the Department of Commerce on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce may at any time issue a _Federal Register_ notice removing, revising or adding to an existing GAE in this supplement as warranted to align with the objectives of the 232 exclusions process as described in supplement no. 1 to this part. The Department of Commerce on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce may periodically publish notices of inquiry in the _Federal Register_ soliciting public comments on potential removals, revisions or additions to this supplement.




*Note to Supplement No. 2:**Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) Classifications are identified by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) through its web version of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. The list of the HTSUS Classifications referenced in this table of GAEs is drawn from the HTSUS and ITC Change Records for HTSUS Classifications (compiled at https://hts.usitc.gov/) and will be amended when the ITC publishes subsequent Change Records. If there are any discrepancies between the list of the HTSUS Classifications in this table and the HTSUS Classifications identified by the ITC in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States and the associated Change Records, the ITC's list of HTSUS Classifications shall be controlling. Therefore, if an HTSUS Classification defining a GAE is split or otherwise modified by the ITC in the HTSUS, GAEs are extended to the newly-created HTSUS Classification(s), so long as the new 'child' HTSUS Classification(s) contain products falling entirely within the scope of the old 'parent' HTSUS classification. These types of 'inherited' GAEs are effective from the effective date of the change to the HTSUS, even prior to a Commerce rule being published to add the new HTSUS number to the GAE list under supplement no. 2. During the period after the effective date of the change to the HTSUS and before the GAE is updated, ACE will reject entries claiming the exclusion with the new HTSUS number and importers will have to make entry without the exclusion. In order for importers to preserve their rights, if any, to the exclusion with the new HTSUS number during this period, importers are advised to seek extensions of liquidation of the affected entries with CBP until Commerce is able to update and publish a revised GAE list under this supplement no. 2.*
