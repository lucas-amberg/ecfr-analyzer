# § 711.8   How to request authorization from BIS to make electronic submissions of declarations or reports.

(a) *Scope.* This section provides an optional method of submitting declarations or reports. Specifically, this section applies to the electronic submission of declarations and reports required under the CWCR. If you choose to submit declarations and reports by electronic means, all such electronic submissions must be made through the Web-Data Entry System for Industry (Web-DESI), which can be accessed on the CWC web site at *www.cwc.gov.*

(b) *Authorization.* If you or your company has a facility, plant site, or trading company that has been assigned a U.S. Code Number (USC Number), you may submit declarations and reports electronically, once you have received authorization from BIS to do so. An authorization to submit declarations and reports electronically may be limited or withdrawn by BIS at any time. There are no prerequisites for obtaining permission to submit electronically, nor are there any limitations with regard to the types of declarations or reports that are eligible for electronic submission. However, BIS may direct, for any reason, that any electronic declaration or report be resubmitted in writing, either in whole or in part.


(1) *Requesting approval to submit declarations and reports electronically.* To submit declarations and reports electronically, you or your company must submit a written request to BIS at the address identified in § 711.6 of the CWCR. Both the envelope and letter must be marked, “ATTN: Electronic Declaration or Report Request.” Your request should be on company letterhead and must contain your name or the company's name, your mailing address at the company, the name of the facility, plant site or trading company and its U.S. Code Number, the address of the facility, plant site or trading company (this address may be different from the mailing address), the list of persons who are authorized to view, edit, and/or submit declarations and reports on behalf of your company, and the telephone number and name and title of the owner, operator, or senior management official responsible for certifying that each person listed in the request is authorized to view, edit, and/or submit declarations and reports on behalf of you or your company (*i.e.*, the certifying official). Additional information required for submitting electronic declarations and reports may be found on BIS's Web site at *www.cwc.gov.* Once you have completed and submitted the necessary certifications, BIS will review your request for authorization to view, edit, and/or submit declarations and reports electronically. BIS will notify you if additional information is required and/or upon completion of its review.


(2) *Assignment and use of passwords for facilities, plant sites and trading companies (USC password) and Web-DESI user accounts (user name and password).* (i) Each person, facility, plant site or trading company authorized to submit declarations and reports electronically will be assigned a password (USC password) that must be used in conjunction with the U.S.C. Number. Each person authorized by BIS to view, edit, and/or submit declarations and reports electronically for a facility, plant site or trading company will be assigned a Web-DESI user account (user name and password) telephonically by BIS. A Web-DESI user account will be assigned to you only if your company has certified to BIS that you are authorized to act for it in viewing, editing, and/or submitting electronic declarations and reports under the CWCR.


(ii) Your company may reveal the facility, plant site or trading company password (USC password) only to Web-DESI users with valid passwords, their supervisors, and employees or agents of the company with a commercial justification for knowing the password.


(iii) If you are an authorized Web-DESI account user, you may not:


(A) Disclose your user name or password to anyone;


(B) Record your user name or password, either in writing or electronically;


(C) Authorize another person to use your user name or password; or


(D) Use your user name or password following termination, either by BIS or by your company, of your authorization or approval for Web-DESI use.


(iv) To prevent misuse of the Web-DESI account:


(A) If Web-DESI user account information (i.e., user name and password) is lost, stolen or otherwise compromised, the company and the user must report the loss, theft or compromise of the user account information, immediately, by calling BIS at (202) 482-1001. Within two business days of making the report, the company and the user must submit written confirmation to BIS at the address provided in § 711.6 of the CWCR.


(B) Your company is responsible for immediately notifying BIS whenever a Web-DESI user leaves the employ of the company or otherwise ceases to be authorized by the company to submit declarations and reports electronically on its behalf.


(v) No person may use, copy, appropriate or otherwise compromise a Web-DESI account user name or password assigned to another person. No person, except a person authorized access by the company, may use or copy the facility, plant site or trading company password (USC password), nor may any person steal or otherwise compromise this password.


(c) *Electronic submission of declarations and reports*—(1) *General instructions.* Upon submission of the required certifications and approval of the company's request to use electronic submission, BIS will provide instructions on both the method for transmitting declarations and reports electronically and the process for submitting required supporting documents, if any. These instructions may be modified by BIS from time to time.


(2) *Declarations and reports.* The electronic submission of a declaration or report will constitute an official document as required under parts 712 through 715 of the CWCR. Such submissions must provide the same information as written declarations and reports and are subject to the recordkeeping provisions of part 720 of the CWCR. The company and Web-DESI user submitting the declaration or report will be deemed to have made all representations and certifications as if the submission were made in writing by the company and signed by the certifying official. Electronic submission of a declaration or report will be considered complete upon transmittal to BIS.


(d) *Updating.* A company approved for electronic submission of declarations or reports under Web-DESI must promptly notify BIS of any change in its name, ownership or address. If your company wishes to have a person added as a Web-DESI user, your company must inform BIS and follow the instructions provided by BIS. Your company should conduct periodic reviews to ensure that the company's designated certifying official and Web-DESI users are persons whose current responsibilities make it necessary and appropriate that they act for the company in either capacity.
