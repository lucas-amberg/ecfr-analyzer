# § 713.3   Annual declaration and reporting requirements for exports and imports of Schedule 2 chemicals.

(a) *Declarations and reports of exports and imports of Schedule 2 chemicals*—(1) *Declarations.* A Schedule 2 plant site that is declared because it produced, processed or consumed a Schedule 2 chemical at one or more plants above the applicable threshold set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, and also exported from or imported to the plant site that same Schedule 2 chemical above the applicable threshold, must submit export and import information as part of its declaration.


(2) *Reports.* The following persons must submit a report if they individually exported or imported a Schedule 2 chemical above the applicable threshold indicated in paragraph (b) of this section:


(i) A declared plant site that exported or imported a Schedule 2 chemical that was different than the Schedule 2 chemical produced, processed or consumed at one or more plants at the plant site above the applicable declaration threshold;


(ii) An undeclared plant site;


(iii) A trading company; or


(iv) Any other person subject to the CWCR.


(b) *Quantities of exports or imports that trigger a declaration or reporting requirement.* (1) You have a declaration or reporting requirement and must complete the forms specified in paragraph (d) of this section if you exported or imported a Schedule 2 chemical in excess of the following threshold quantities:


(i) 1 kilogram of chemical BZ: 3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate (See Schedule 2, paragraph A.3 included in supplement no. 1 to this part);


(ii) 100 kilograms of chemical PFIB: 1,1,3,3,3-Pentafluoro-2(trifluoromethyl)-1-propene or 100 kilograms of Amiton: O,O Diethyl S-[2(diethylamino)ethyl] phosphorothiolate *and* corresponding alkylated or protonated salts (see Schedule 2, paragraphs A.1 and A.2 included in supplement no.1 to this part); or


(iii) 1 metric ton of any chemical listed in Schedule 2, Part B (see supplement no.1 to this part).








(2) *Mixtures containing a Schedule 2 chemical*—(i) *Mixtures that must be counted.* The quantity of each Schedule 2 chemical contained in a mixture must be counted for the declaration or reporting of an export or import, in the following circumstances:


(A) *Schedule 2A chemicals in mixtures.* The concentration of each Schedule 2A chemical in the mixture is 10% or more by volume or weight, whichever yields the lesser percentage;


(B) *Schedule 2B chemicals in mixtures.* The concentration of each Schedule 2B chemical in the mixture is 30% or more by volume or weight, whichever yields the lesser percentage.


(ii) *How to count the quantity of each Schedule 2 chemical in a mixture.* You must count, separately, the quantity of each Schedule 2A or Schedule 2B chemical in a mixture when determining the total quantity of a Schedule 2 chemical that was exported from or imported to a declared plant site, or individually exported or imported, above the applicable threshold set forth in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. Do not count the total weight of a mixture.


(iii) *Mixture concentration thresholds apply only for declaration and reporting purposes.* The concentration thresholds for Schedule 2A and Schedule 2B chemical mixtures set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section apply only for the declaration and reporting purposes described in the CWCR. These thresholds do not apply for purposes of determining whether the export of your mixture to a non-State Party requires an End-Use Certificate. Nor do they apply for purposes of determining whether you need to obtain an export license from BIS (see § 742.2, § 742.18 and § 745.2 of the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR parts 730 through 774)) or from the Department of State (see the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR parts 120 through 130)).


(c) *Declaration and reporting requirements*—(1) *Annual declaration on past activities.* A plant site described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section that has an annual declaration requirement for the production, processing, or consumption of a Schedule 2 chemical for the previous calendar year also must declare the export and/or import of that same Schedule 2 chemical if the amount exceeded the applicable threshold set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The plant site must declare such export or import information as part of its annual declaration of past activities.


(2) *Annual report on exports and imports.* Declared plant sites described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, and undeclared plant sites, trading companies or any other person (described in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section) subject to the CWCR that exported or imported a Schedule 2 chemical in a previous calendar year in excess of the applicable thresholds set forth in paragraph (b) of this section must submit an annual report on such exports or imports.


(d) *Types of declaration and reporting forms to be used*—(1) *Annual declaration on past activities.* If you are a declared Schedule 2 plant site, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you must complete Form 2-3B, in addition to the forms required by § 713.2(b)(1) of the CWCR, for each declared Schedule 2 chemical exported or imported above the applicable threshold in the previous calendar year.


(2) *Annual report on exports and imports.* (i) If you are a declared plant site, as described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, you may fulfill your annual reporting requirements by:


(A) Submitting, *with* your annual declaration on past activities, a Form 2-3B for each Schedule 2 chemical you exported or imported above the applicable threshold. Attach Form A, as appropriate; Form B is optional; or


(B) Submitting, *separately from* your annual declaration on past activities, a Certification Form, Form 2-1, and Form 2-3B for each Schedule 2 chemical you exported or imported above the applicable threshold. Attach Form A, as appropriate; Form B is optional.


(ii) If you are an undeclared plant site, trading company or any other person subject to the CWCR, you must complete the Certification Form, Form 2-1, and Form 2-3B for each Schedule 2 chemical you exported or imported above the applicable threshold. Attach Form A, as appropriate; Form B is optional.


(e) *Quantities to be declared*—(1) *Calculations.* If you exported from or imported to your plant site, trading company, or other location more than the applicable threshold of a Schedule 2 chemical in the previous calendar year, you must declare or report all exports and imports of that chemical by country of destination or country of origin, respectively, and indicate the total amount exported to or imported from each country.


(2) *Rounding.* For purposes of declaring or reporting exports and imports of a Schedule 2 chemical, you must total all exports and imports per calendar year per recipient or source and then round as follows: For the chemical BZ, the total quantity for each country of destination or country of origin (source) should be reported to the nearest hundredth of a kilogram (10 grams); for PFIB and Amiton and corresponding alkylated or protonated salts, the quantity for each destination or source should be reported to the nearest 1 kilogram; and for all other Schedule 2 chemicals, the total quantity for each destination or source should be reported to the nearest 10 kilograms.
