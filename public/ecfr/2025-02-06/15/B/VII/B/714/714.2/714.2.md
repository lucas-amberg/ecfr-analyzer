# § 714.2   Annual reporting requirements for exports and imports in excess of 30 metric tons of Schedule 3 chemicals.

(a) Any person subject to the CWCR that exported from or imported into the United States in excess of 30 metric tons of any single Schedule 3 chemical during the previous calendar year has a reporting requirement under this section.


(1) *Annual report on exports and imports.* Declared plant sites, undeclared plant sites, trading companies, or any other person subject to the CWCR that exported from or imported into the United States in excess of 30 metric tons of any single Schedule 3 chemical during the previous calendar year must submit an annual report on exports and imports.


(2) *Mixtures containing a Schedule 3 chemical.* The quantity of a Schedule 3 chemical contained in a mixture must be counted for reporting an export or import only if the concentration of the Schedule 3 chemical in the mixture is 80% or more by volume or by weight, whichever yields the lesser percent. For reporting purposes, only count the weight of the Schedule 3 chemical in the mixture, not the entire weight of the mixture.


(b) *Types of forms to be used*—(1) *Declared Schedule 3 plant sites.* (i) If your plant site is declared for production of a Schedule 3 chemical (and has completed questions 3-3.1 and 3-3.2 on Form 3-3) and you also exported from or imported to your plant site in excess of 30 metric tons of that same Schedule 3 chemical, you must report the export or import by either:


(A) Completing question 3-3.3 on Form 3-3 on your declaration for that same Schedule 3 chemical; or


(B) Submitting, separately from your declaration, a Certification Form, Form 3-1, and a Form 3-3 for each Schedule 3 chemical to be reported, completing only question 3-3.3. Attach Form A, as appropriate; Form B is optional.


(ii) If your plant site is declared for production of a Schedule 3 chemical and you exported or imported in excess of 30 metric tons of a different Schedule 3 chemical, you must report the export or import by either:


(A) Submitting, along with your declaration, a Form 3-3 for each Schedule 3 chemical to be reported, completing only question 3-3.3. Attach Form A, as appropriate; Form B is optional; or


(B) Submitting, separately from your declaration, a Certification Form, Form 3-1 and a Form 3.3 for each Schedule 3 chemical to be reported, completing only question 3-3.3. Attach Form A, as appropriate; Form B is optional.


(2) If you are an undeclared plant site, a trading company, or any other person subject to the CWCR, you must submit a Certification Form, Form 3-1, and a Form 3-3 for each Schedule 3 chemical to be reported, completing only question 3-3.3. Attach Form A, as appropriate; Form B is optional.


(c) *Quantities to be reported*—(1) *Calculations.* If you exported from or imported to your plant site or trading company more than 30 metric tons of a Schedule 3 chemical in the previous calendar year, you must report all exports and imports of that chemical by country of destination or country of origin, respectively, and indicate the total amount exported to or imported from each country.


(2) *Rounding.* For purposes of reporting exports and imports of a Schedule 3 chemical, you must total all exports and imports per calendar year per recipient or source and then round to the nearest 0.1 metric tons.
