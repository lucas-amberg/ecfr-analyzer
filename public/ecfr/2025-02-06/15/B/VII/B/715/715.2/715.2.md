(3) Aggregate amount of production (by production range) of UDOCs produced by all plants at the declared plant site;


(4) Exact number of plants at the declared plant site that individually produced more than 30 metric tons of a single PSF chemical; and

(2) *Change in ownership of company or plant site.* If you sold or purchased a declared plant site, you must submit an amended declaration to BIS, either before the effective date of the change or within 30 days after the effective date of the change. The amended declaration must include the following information.


(i) Information that must be submitted to BIS by the company selling a declared plant site:


(A) Name of seller (i.e., name of company selling a declared plant site);


(B) Name of declared plant site name and U.S. Code Number for that plant site;

(D) Date of ownership transfer or change;


(E) Additional details on the sale of the declared plant site relevant to ownership or operational control over any portion of the declared plant site (e.g., whether the entire plant site or only a portion of the declared plant site has been sold to a new owner); and


(F) Details regarding whether the new owner will submit the declaration for the entire calendar year during which the ownership change occurred, or whether the previous owner and new owner will submit separate declarations for the periods of the calendar year during which each owned the plant site.


(*1*) If the new owner is responsible for submitting the declaration for the entire current year, it must have in its possession the records for the period of the year during which the previous owner owned the plant site.


(*2*) If the previous owner and new owner will submit separate declarations for the periods of the calendar year during which each owned the plant site, and, if at the time of transfer of ownership, the previous owner's activities are not above the declaration thresholds set forth in § 715.1(a)(1) of the CWCR, the previous owner and the new owner must still submit declarations to BIS with the below threshold quantities indicated.


(*3*) If the part-year declarations submitted by the previous owner and the new owner are not, when combined, above the declaration threshold set forth in § 715.1(a)(1) of the CWCR, BIS will return the declarations without action as set forth in § 715.3 of the CWCR.


(ii) Information that must be submitted to BIS by the company purchasing a declared plant site:


(A) Name of purchaser (i.e., name of individual or company purchasing a declared plant site);

(c) *Inspection-related amendments.* If, following completion of an inspection (see part 716 or 717 of the CWCR), you are required to submit an amended declaration based on the final inspection report, BIS will notify you in writing of the information that will be required pursuant to §§ 716.10 and 717.5 of the CWCR. You must submit an amended declaration to BIS no later than 45 days following your receipt of BIS's post-inspection letter.


(d) *Non-substantive changes.* If, subsequent to the submission of your declaration to BIS, you discover one or more non-substantive typographical errors in your declaration, you are not required to submit an amended declaration to BIS. Instead, you may correct these errors in a subsequent declaration.
