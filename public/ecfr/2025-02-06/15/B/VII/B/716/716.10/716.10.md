# § 716.10   Post-inspection activities.

BIS will forward a copy of the final inspection report to the inspected facility for their review upon receipt from the OPCW. Facilities may submit comments on the final inspection report to BIS, within the time-frame specified by BIS (*i.e.*, at least 7 working days from receipt of the report), and BIS will consider them, to the extent possible, when commenting on the final report. BIS will also send facilities a post-inspection letter detailing the issues that require follow-up action, e.g., amended declaration requirement (see §§ 712.7(d), 713.5(d), 714.4(d), and 715.2(c) of the CWCR), information on the status of the draft facility agreement, if applicable, and the date on which the report on inspection-related costs (see § 716.9 of the CWCR) is due to BIS.
