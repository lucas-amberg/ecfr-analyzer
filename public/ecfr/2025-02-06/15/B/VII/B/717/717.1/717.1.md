# ยง 717.1   Clarification procedures; challenge inspection requests pursuant to Article IX of the Convention.

(a) Article IX of the Convention sets forth procedures for clarification, between States Parties, of issues about compliance with the Convention. States Parties may attempt to resolve such issues through consultation between themselves or through the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). A State Party may also request the OPCW to conduct an on-site challenge inspection of any facility or location in the territory or in any other place under the jurisdiction or control of any other State Party. Such an on-site challenge inspection request shall be for the sole purpose of clarifying and resolving any questions concerning possible non-compliance with the Convention.


(b) In the event that BIS receives a request for clarification, pursuant to Article IX of the Convention, concerning possible non-compliance with the CWC, any person or facility subject to the CWCR (parts 710 through 729 of this subchapter) that receives an official written request from BIS for clarification must, within five working days from receipt of such request, provide BIS with any relevant information required to respond to the OPCW or the State Party(ies) who requested clarification under Article IX. BIS will contact the person or facility subject to the Article IX clarification, as early as practicable, prior to issuing an official written request for clarification to the person or facility.
