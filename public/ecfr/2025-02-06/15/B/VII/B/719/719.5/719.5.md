# ยง 719.5   Initiation of administrative proceedings.

(a) *Letter of intent to charge.* The Director of the Office of Export Enforcement, Bureau of Industry and Security, may notify a respondent by letter of the intent to charge. This letter of intent to charge will advise a respondent that BIS has conducted an investigation and intends to recommend that the Secretary of State issue a Notice of Violation and Assessment (NOVA). The letter of intent to charge will be accompanied by a draft NOVA and proposed order, and will give the respondent a specified period of time to contact BIS to discuss settlement of the allegations set forth in the draft NOVA. An administrative enforcement proceeding is not initiated by a letter of intent to charge. If the respondent does not contact BIS within the specified time, or if the respondent requests it, BIS will make its request for initiation of an administrative enforcement proceeding to the Secretary of State in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) *Request for Notice of Violation and Assessment (NOVA).* The Director of the Office of Export Enforcement, Bureau of Industry and Security, may request that the Secretary of State initiate an administrative enforcement proceeding under this ยง 719.5 and 22 CFR 103.7. If the request is in accordance with applicable law, the Secretary of State will initiate an administrative enforcement proceeding by issuing a NOVA. The Office of Chief Counsel shall serve the NOVA as directed by the Secretary of State.


(c) *Content of NOVA.* The NOVA shall constitute a formal complaint, and will set forth the basis for the issuance of the proposed order. It will set forth the alleged violation(s) and the essential facts with respect to the alleged violation(s), reference the relevant statutory, regulatory or other provisions, and state the amount of the civil penalty to be assessed. The NOVA will inform the respondent of the right to request a hearing pursuant to ยง 719.6 of the CWCR, inform the respondent that failure to request such a hearing shall result in the proposed order becoming final and unappealable on signature of the Secretary of State, and provide payment instructions. A copy of the regulations that govern the administrative proceedings will accompany the NOVA.


(d) *Proposed order.* A proposed order shall accompany every NOVA, letter of intent to charge, and draft NOVA. It will briefly set forth the substance of the alleged violation(s) and the statutory, regulatory or other provisions violated. It will state the amount of the civil penalty to be assessed.


(e) *Notice.* Notice of the intent to charge or of the initiation of formal proceedings shall be given to the respondent (or respondent's agent for service of process, or attorney) by sending relevant documents, via first class mail, facsimile, or by personal delivery.
