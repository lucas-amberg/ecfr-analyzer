# § 719.8   Filing and service of papers other than the NOVA.

(a) *Filing.* All papers to be filed with the ALJ shall be addressed to “CWC Administrative Enforcement Proceedings” at the address set forth in the NOVA, or such other place as the ALJ may designate. Filing by United States mail (first class postage prepaid), by express or equivalent parcel delivery service, via facsimile, or by hand delivery, is acceptable. Filing from a foreign country shall be by airmail or via facsimile. A copy of each paper filed shall be simultaneously served on all parties.


(b) *Service.* Service shall be made by United States mail (first class postage prepaid), by express or equivalent parcel delivery service, via facsimile, or by hand delivery of one copy of each paper to each party in the proceeding. The Department of State is a party to cases under the CWCR, but will be represented by the Office of Chief Counsel. Therefore, service on the government party in all proceedings shall be addressed to Office of Chief Counsel for Industry and Security, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Room H-3839, Washington, DC 20230, or sent via facsimile to (202) 482-0085. Service on a respondent shall be to the address to which the NOVA and proposed order was sent, or to such other address as the respondent may provide. When a party has appeared by counsel or other representative, service on counsel or other representative shall constitute service on that party.


(c) *Date.* The date of filing or service is the day when the papers are deposited in the mail or are delivered in person, by delivery service, or by facsimile. Refusal by the person to be served, or by the person's agent or attorney, of service of a document or other paper will be considered effective service of the document or other paper as of the date of such refusal.


(d) *Certificate of service.* A certificate of service signed by the party making service, stating the date and manner of service, shall accompany every paper, other than the NOVA and proposed order, filed and served on the parties.


(e) *Computation of time.* In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this part, the day of the act, event, or default from which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included. The last day of the period so computed is to be included unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday (as defined in Rule 6(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure), in which case the period runs until the end of the next day which is neither a Saturday, a Sunday, nor a legal holiday. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are excluded from the computation when the period of time prescribed or allowed is 7 days or less.
