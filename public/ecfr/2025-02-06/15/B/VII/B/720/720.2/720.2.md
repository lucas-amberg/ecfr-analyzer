(a) *Notice.* BIS will notify any person convicted under Section 229, Title 18, United States Code, of BIS's intent to deny that person's export privileges. The notification letter shall reference the person's conviction, specify the number of years for which BIS intends to deny export privileges, set forth the statutory and regulatory authority for the action, state whether the denial order will be standard or non-standard pursuant to supplement no. 1 to part 764 of the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR parts 730 through 774), and provide that the person may request a hearing before the Administrative Law Judge within 30 days from the date of the notification letter.
