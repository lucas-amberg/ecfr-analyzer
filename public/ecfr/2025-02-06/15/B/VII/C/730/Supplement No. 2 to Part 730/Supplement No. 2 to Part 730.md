# Supplement No. 2 to Part 730—Technical Advisory Committees


(a) *Purpose.* The purpose of this supplement is to describe the procedures and criteria for the establishment and operation of Technical Advisory Committees.


(b) *Technical advisory committees.* Any producer of articles, materials, or supplies, including technology, software, and other information, that are subject to export controls, or are being considered for such controls because of their significance to the national security of the United States, may request the Secretary of Commerce to establish a technical advisory committee, under the provisions of section 5(h) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA) to advise and assist the Department of Commerce and other appropriate U.S. Government agencies or officials with respect to questions involving technical matters; worldwide availability and actual utilization of production technology; licensing procedures that affect the level of export controls applicable to a clearly defined grouping of articles, materials, or supplies, including technology, software, or other information; and exports and reexports subject to all controls that the United States maintains including proposed revisions of any such controls. If producers of articles, materials, or supplies, including technology, software, and other information, that are subject to export controls because of their significance to the national security of the United States, wish a trade association or other representative to submit a written request on their behalf for the appointment to a TAC, such request shall be submitted in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this supplement.


(1) *Form and substance of requests.* Each request for the appointment of a TAC shall be submitted in writing to: Assistant Secretary for Export Administration, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230.


The request shall include:


(i) A description of the articles, materials, or supplies including technology and software, in terms of a clear, cohesive grouping (citing the applicable Export Control Classification Numbers where practical);


(ii) A statement of the reasons for requesting the appointment of a TAC; and


(iii) Any information in support of any contention that may be made that the request meets the criteria described in paragraph (b)(2) of this supplement.


(2) *Consideration of request for establishment of a TAC.* The Department of Commerce will review all requests for the establishment of a TAC to determine if the following criteria are met:


(i) That a substantial segment of the industry producing the specified articles, materials, or supplies including technology desires such a committee; and


(ii) That the evaluation of such articles, materials, or supplies including technology and software for export control purposes is difficult because of questions involving technical matters, worldwide availability and actual utilization of production and software technology, or licensing procedures.


(3) *Requests by a substantial segment of an industry.* In determining whether or not a substantial segment of any industry has requested the appointment of a TAC, the Department of Commerce will consider:


(i) The number of persons or firms requesting the establishment of a TAC for a particular grouping of commodities, software and technology in relation to the total number of U.S. producers of such items; and


(ii) The volume of annual production by such persons or firms of each item in the grouping in relation to the total U.S. production. Generally, a substantial segment of an industry (for purposes of this supplement) shall consist of:


(A) Not less than 30 percent of the total number of U.S. producers of the items concerned; or


(B) Three or more U.S. producers who produce a combined total of not less than 30 percent of the total U.S. annual production, by dollar value of the items concerned; or


(C) Not less than 20 percent of the total number of U.S. producers of the items concerned, provided that the total of their annual production thereof is not less than 20 percent of the total U.S. annual production, by dollar value.


(iii) If it is determined that a substantial segment of the industry concerned has requested the establishment of a TAC concerning a specific grouping of items that the Department of Commerce determines difficult to evaluate for export control purposes, BIS will establish and use the TAC requested.


(4) *Requests from trade associations or other representatives.* Requests from trade associations or other representatives of U.S. producers for the establishment of a TAC must comply with the provisions of paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of this supplement. In addition, in order to assist BIS in determining whether the criteria described in paragraph (b)(3) of this supplement have been met, a trade association or other representative submitting a request for the establishment of a TAC should include the following information:


(i) The total number of firms in the particular industry;


(ii) The total number of firms in the industry that have authorized the trade association or other representative to act in their behalf in this matter;


(iii) The approximate amount of total U.S. annual production by dollar value of the items concerned produced by those firms that have authorized the trade association or other representative to act in their behalf; and


(iv) A description of the method by which authorization to act on behalf of these producers was obtained.


(5) *Nominations for membership on TACs.* When the Department of Commerce determines that the establishment of a TAC is warranted, it will request nominations for membership on the committee among the producers of the items and from any other sources that may be able to suggest well-qualified nominees.


(6) *Selection of industry members of committee.* Industry members of a TAC will be selected by the Department of Commerce from a list of the nominees who have indicated their availability for service on the committee. To the extent feasible, the Department of Commerce will select a committee balanced to represent all significant facets of the industry involved, taking into consideration such factors as the size of the firms, their geographical distribution, and their product lines. No industry representative shall serve on a TAC for more than four consecutive years. The membership of a member who is absent from four consecutive meetings shall be terminated.


(7) *Government members.* Government members of a TAC will be selected by the Department of Commerce from the agencies having an interest in the subject matter concerned.


(8) *Invitation to serve on committee.* Invitations to serve on a TAC will be sent by letter to the selected nominees.


(9) *Election of Chair.* The Chair of each TAC shall be elected by a vote of the majority of the members of the committee present and voting.


(c) *Charter.* (1) No TAC established pursuant to this supplement shall meet or take any action until an advisory committee charter has been filed with the Assistant Secretary for Export Administration of the Department of Commerce and with the standing committees of the Senate and of the House of Representatives having legislative jurisdiction over the Department. Such charter shall contain the following information:

(2) No TAC may meet except at the call of its Chair.


(3) Each meeting of a TAC shall be conducted in accordance with an agenda approved by a designated Federal government employee.


(4) No TAC shall conduct a meeting in the absence of a designated Federal government employee who shall be authorized to adjourn any advisory committee meeting, whenever the Federal government employee determines adjournment to be in the public interest.


(e) *Public notice.* Notice to the public of each meeting of a TAC will be issued at least 20 days in advance and will be published in the _Federal Register._ The notice will include the time and place of the meeting and the agenda.

A committee may establish procedures requiring such persons to obtain advance approval for such participation.

A determination that a meeting or portion thereof be closed to the public may be made if all or a specific portion of a meeting of a TAC is concerned with matters described in section 552(b) of Title 5, U.S.C.


(4) Participation by members of the public in open TAC meetings or questioning of committee members or other participants shall not be permitted except in accordance with procedures established by the committee.


(5) Every effort will be made to accommodate all members of the public who wish to attend.

TACs may be extended or terminated only after consultation with the committee.
