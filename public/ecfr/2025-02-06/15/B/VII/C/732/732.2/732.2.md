# § 732.2   Steps regarding scope of the EAR.

Steps 1 though 6 are designed to aid you in determining the scope of the EAR. A flow chart describing these steps is contained in supplement no. 2 to part 732. 


(a) *Step 1: Items subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of another Federal agency.* This step is relevant for both exports and reexports. Determine whether your item is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of another Federal Agency as provided in § 734.3 of the EAR.


(1) If your item is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of another Federal agency, comply with the regulations of that agency. You need not comply with the EAR and may skip the remaining steps.


(2) If your item is not subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of another federal agency, then proceed to Step 2 in paragraph (b) of this section.




(b) *Step 2: Publicly available technology and software.* This step is relevant for both exports and reexports. Determine if your technology or software is publicly available as defined and explained at part 734 of the EAR. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) website at *https://www.bis.doc.gov* contains several practical examples describing publicly available technology and software that are outside the scope of the EAR under the FAQ section of the website. See the FAQs under the heading, EAR Definitions, Technology and Software, Fundamental Research, and Patents FAQs at *https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/compliance-training/export-administrationregulations-training/1554-ear-definitions-faq/file.* The examples are illustrative, not comprehensive. Note that encryption software classified under ECCN 5D002 on the Commerce Control List (refer to supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) is subject to the EAR even if publicly available, except for publicly available encryption object code software classified under ECCN 5D002 when the corresponding source code meets the criteria specified in § 740.13(e) of the EAR. The following also remains subject to the EAR: “Software” or “technology” for the production of a firearm, or firearm frame or receiver, controlled under ECCNs 0A501, 0A506, 0A507, or 0A509, as referenced in § 734.7(c) of the EAR.








(1) If your technology or software is publicly available, and therefore outside the scope of the EAR, you may proceed with the export or reexport if you are not a U.S. person subject to General Prohibition Seven. If you are a U.S. person, go to Step 15 at § 732.3(j) of this part. If you are a U.S. person and General Prohibition Seven concerning proliferation activity of U.S. persons does not apply, then you may proceed with the export or reexport of your publicly available technology or software. Note that all U.S. persons are subject to the provisions of General Prohibition Seven.


(2) If your technology or software is not publicly available and you are exporting from the United States, skip to the Step 7 in § 732.3(b) of this part concerning the general prohibitions.


(3) If you are exporting items from a foreign country, you should then proceed to Step 3 in paragraph (c) of this section and the other steps concerning the scope of the EAR.


(c) *Step 3: Reexport of U.S.-origin items.* This step is appropriate only for reexporters. For an item in a foreign country, you should determine whether the item is of U.S. origin. If it is of U.S.-origin, skip to Step 7 in § 732.3(b) of this part. If it is not of U.S. origin, then proceed to Step 4 in paragraph (d) of this section.


(d) *Step 4: Foreign-made items incorporating controlled U.S.-origin items.* This step is appropriate only for items that are made outside the United States and not currently located in the United States. Special requirements and restrictions apply to foreign-made items that incorporate U.S.-origin encryption items (see § 734.4(a)(2), (b), and (g) of the EAR).


(1) Determining whether your foreign made item is subject to the EAR. Using the guidance provided in supplement no. 2 to part 734 of the EAR, determine whether controlled U.S.-origin items are incorporated into the foreign-made item and are above the *de minimis* level set forth in § 734.4 of the EAR.


(2) If no U.S.-origin controlled items are incorporated or if the percentage of incorporated U.S.-origin controlled items are equal to or below the *de minimis* level described in § 734.4 of the EAR, then the foreign-made item is not subject to the EAR by reason of the *de minimis* rules, and you should go on to consider Step 6 regarding the foreign-produced direct product rule.


(3) If the foreign-made item incorporates more than the *de minimis* level of U.S.-origin items, then that item is subject to the EAR and you should skip to Step 7 at § 732.3 of this part and consider the steps regarding all other general prohibitions, license exceptions, and other requirements to determine applicability of these provisions to the foreign-made item.


(e) [Reserved]


(f) *Step 6: Direct product rule.* Foreign items that are the direct product of U.S. technology, software, or plant or major component of a plant made from U.S. technology or software may be subject to the EAR if they meet the conditions of General Prohibition Three in § 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR. Direct products that are subject to the EAR may require a license to be exported from abroad or reexported to certain countries.


(1) *Subject to the EAR.* If your foreign item is captured by the direct product rule (General Prohibition Three), then the item is subject to the EAR and its export from abroad or reexport may require a license. You should next consider the steps regarding all other general prohibitions, license exceptions, and other requirements. If the item is not captured by General Prohibition Three, then you have completed the steps necessary to determine whether the item is subject to the EAR, and you may skip the remaining steps. As described in part 734 of the EAR, items outside the U.S. are subject to the EAR when they are:


(i) U.S.-origin commodities, software, or technology, unless controlled for export exclusively by another U.S. Federal agency or unless publicly available;


(ii) Foreign-origin commodities, software, or technology that are within the scope of General Prohibition Two (*De minimis* rules), or General Prohibition Three (Direct Product rule). However, such foreign-origin items are also outside the scope of the EAR if they are controlled for export exclusively by another U.S. Federal Agency or, if technology or software, are publicly available as described in paragraph (b) of this section.


(2) [Reserved]
