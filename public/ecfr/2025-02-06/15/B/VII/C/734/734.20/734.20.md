(a) *Authorized Release of “technology” or source code.* Release of “technology” or source code by an entity outside the United States to a foreign person of a country other than the foreign country where the release takes place if:


(1) The entity is authorized to receive the “technology” or source code at issue, whether by a license, license exception, or situation where no license is required under the EAR for such “technology” or source code; and


(2) The entity has “knowledge” that the foreign national's most recent country of citizenship or permanent residency is that of a country to which export from the United States of the “technology” or source code at issue would be authorized by the EAR either under a license exception or in situations where no license under the EAR would be required.


(b) *Release to Country Group A:5 nationals.* Without limiting the scope of paragraph (a), release of “technology” or source code by an entity outside the United States to a foreign person of a country other than the foreign country where the release takes place if:


(1) The entity is authorized to receive the “technology” or source code at issue, whether by a license, license exception, or through situations where no license is required under the EAR;


(2) The foreign person is a *bona fide* 'permanent and regular employee' of the entity and is not a proscribed person (see § 772.1 for definition of proscribed person);


(3) Such employee is a national exclusively of a country in Country Group A:5; and


(4) The release of “technology” or source code takes place entirely within the physical territory of any such country, or within the United States.


(c) *Release to other than Country Group A:5 nationals.* Without limiting the scope of paragraph (a), release of “technology” or source code by an entity outside the United States to a foreign person of a country other than the foreign country where the release takes place if:

(3) The release takes place entirely within the physical territory of the country where the entity is located, conducts official business, or operates, or within the United States;


(4) The entity has effective procedures to prevent diversion to destinations, entities, end users, and end uses contrary to the EAR; and
