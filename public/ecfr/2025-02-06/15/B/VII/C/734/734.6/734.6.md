# § 734.6   Assistance available from BIS for determining licensing and other requirements.

(a) If you are not sure whether a commodity, software, technology, or activity “subject to the EAR” is subject to licensing or other requirements under the EAR, you may ask BIS for an advisory opinion or a commodity classification determination. In order to determine whether an item is “subject to the ITAR,” you should review the ITAR's United States Munitions List (see 22 CFR 120.3, 120.6 and 121.1). You may also submit a request to the Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, for a formal jurisdictional determination regarding the commodity, software, technology, or activity at issue; or in ITAR terms, the defense article, technical data or defense service at issue (see 22 CFR 120.4).


(b) As the agency responsible for administering the EAR, BIS is the only agency that has the responsibility for determining whether an item or activity is subject to the EAR and, if so, what licensing or other requirements apply under the EAR. Such a determination only affects EAR requirements, and does not affect the applicability of any other regulatory programs.


(c) If you need help in determining BIS licensing or other requirements you may ask BIS for help by following the procedures described in § 748.3 of the EAR.
