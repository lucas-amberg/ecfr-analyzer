# Supplement No. 1 to Part 736—General Orders








(a) General Order No. 1:


General Order No. 1 of September 16, 1998; Establishing a 24-month validity period on reexport authorizations issued without a validity period and revoking those exceeding that period.


(1) Reexport authorizations issued within 24-months of the General Order. All reexport authorizations issued with no validity period within the 24-months preceding September 16, 1998 shall be deemed to have an expiration date which shall be the date 24-months from the date of issuance of the reexport authorization or November 16, 1998, whichever is longer.


(2) Reexport authorizations issued before the 24-month period preceding the General Order. For reexport authorizations issued with no validity period before the 24-month period preceding September 16, 1998:


(i) Effective September 16, 1998, all such outstanding reexport authorizations for terrorist-supporting countries (see parts 742 and 746 of the EAR) are revoked.


(ii) Effective November 16, 1998, all other such outstanding reexport authorizations are revoked.


(3) Extensions. If necessary, you may request extensions of such authorizations according to procedures set forth in § 750.7(g) of the EAR.


(4) Specific Notice from BIS. If you have received, or should you receive, specific notice from BIS with regard to a reexport authorization covered by this General Order, informing you of a revocation, suspension, or revision (including validity period) of any such reexport authorization, then the terms of that specific notice will be controlling.


(5) Definition of “authorization”. The term “authorization” as used in this General Order encompasses the range of reexport authorizations granted by BIS, which includes licenses, individual letters, and other types of notifications.


(b) General Order No. 2:


General Order No. 2; section 5(b) of the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003 (SAA) gives the President authority to waive the application of certain prohibitions set forth in the SAA if the President determines that it is in the national security interest of the United States to do so. The President made such a determination in Executive Order 13338, finding that it was “in the national security interest of the United States to waive application of subsection 5(a)(1) and 5(a)(2)(A) of the SAA so as to permit the exportation or reexportation of certain items as specified in the Department of Commerce's General Order No. 2.” The President's reference to General Order No. 2 addresses applications to export and reexport the following items, which are considered on a case-by-case basis as opposed to the general policy of denial set forth in section 746.9 of the Regulations: Items in support of activities, diplomatic or otherwise, of the United States Government (to the extent that regulation of such exportation or reexportation would not fall within the President's constitutional authority to conduct the nation's foreign affairs); medicine (on the CCL) and medical devices (both as defined in part 772 of the EAR); parts and components intended to ensure the safety of civil aviation and the safe operation of commercial passenger aircraft; aircraft chartered by the Syrian Government for the transport of Syrian Government officials on official Syrian Government business; telecommunications equipment and associated computers, software and technology; items in support of United Nations operations in Syria; and items necessary for the support of the Syrian people, including, but not limited to, items related to water supply and sanitation, agricultural production and food processing, power generation, oil and gas production, construction and engineering, transportation, and educational infrastructure. The total dollar value of each approved license for aircraft parts for flight safety normally will be limited to no more than $2 million over the 24-month standard license term, except in the case of complete overhauls.


(c) General Order No. 3:


General Order No. 3 of July 22, 2015. Certain licenses issued by BIS prior to July 22, 2015 contain conditions that restrict the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) to or within Country Group E:1 as specified in supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR. At the time those license were issued, Cuba was in Country Group E:1. Many of those restrictions were intended to apply to Cuba, not only as a State Sponsor of Terrorism but also as a country subject to unilateral embargo. However, BIS did not always list both Country Groups E:1 and E:2 in license conditions because, at the time, doing so would have been redundant. However, with the rescission of Cuba's designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism and resultant removal from Country Group E:1, continuing those conditions with respect to Cuba is consistent with the embargo. Accordingly, all conditions that apply to Country Group E:1 on licenses issued prior to July 22, 2015 that are in effect on that date, are revised to apply to Country Groups E:1 and E:2 as specified in supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR. Licensees who seek authorization for transactions that are affected by this General Order No. 3 may submit license applications that refer to General Order No. 3 and explain the reason for the request in Block 24 of the application. All license applications involving Cuba are reviewed pursuant to the licensing policy in § 746.2(b) of the EAR. The request should provide any available information in support of the argument that the transaction would be consistent with the licensing policy in § 746.2(b) of the EAR.






(d) General Order No. 4. Exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) authorized under the Temporary General Licenses (TGL) specified under paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this supplement must also comply with the terms and conditions under paragraphs (d)(3) through (5) of this supplement.

(2) *TGL—Advanced computing items.* This TGL only overcomes the license requirements described in § 742.6(a)(6)(iii) of the EAR when the criteria in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and either (d)(2)(ii)(A) or (d)(2)(ii)(B) are met.


(i) *Product scope.* The items subject to the EAR are specified in, either:


(A) ECCNs 3A001.z; 3A090.a and 3A090.b; 3D001 (for “software” for commodities controlled by 3A001.z, 3A090.a and 3A090.b); 3E001 (for “technology” for commodities controlled by 3A001.z, 3A090.a and .b); 4A003.z; 4A004.z; 4A005.z; 4A090; 4D001 (for “software” for commodities controlled by 4A003.z, 4A004.z, and 4A005.z); 4D090; 4E001 (for “technology” for commodities controlled by 4A003.z, 4A004.z, 4A005.z, 4A090 or “software” specified by 4D001 (for 4A003.z, 4A004.z, and 4A005.z); 4D090; 5A002.z; 5A004.z; 5A992.z; 5D002.z; 5D992.z; 5E002 (for “technology” for commodities controlled by 5A002.z or 5A004.z or “software” specified by 5D002 (for 5A002.z or 5A004.z commodities)); or 5E992 (for “technology” for commodities controlled by 5A992.z or “software” controlled by 5D992.z) of the Commerce Control List (CCL); or


(B) ECCN 3A090.c.


(ii) *End-use scope*—(A) *For all items under paragraph (d)(2)(i).* Any item identified under the paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this supplement, may be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) to or within a destination specified in Country Groups D:1, D:4, or D:5 (and not specified in Country Groups A:5 or A:6) or for 3A090.c to or within Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5 when either of the following apply:


(*1*) The end user is located in, but is not headquartered in, or whose ultimate parent company is not headquartered in, Macau or Country Group D:5 and the end use is to continue or engage in the following activities: integration, assembly (mounting), inspection, testing, quality assurance, and distribution of items covered by items specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i); *and*

(*2*) The ultimate end user of these items is located outside of destinations specified in Country Groups D:1, D:4, or D:5 (and not specified in Country Groups A:5 or A:6) by entities not headquartered in or whose ultimate parent company is not headquartered in Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5.


(B) *Additional permitted ultimate end use for 3A090.c.* ECCN 3A090.c commodities are authorized under this paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this General Order No. 4 for use in any destination if the 3A090.c commodity is incorporated into another commodity, provided that the higher-level commodity is not identified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this General Order No. 4. If the higher-level commodity is identified under paragraph (d)(2)(i), of this General Order No. 4, then the ultimate end use of these items is authorized under this paragraph (d)(2)(ii) for destinations other than those specified in Country Groups D:1, D:4, or D:5 (and not specified in Country Groups A:5 or A:6) by entities not headquartered in, or whose ultimate parent company is not headquartered in, Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5. Any subsequent export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of a 3A090.c commodity (regardless of whether it was incorporated into a higher-level commodity) would also need to comply with any other applicable EAR license requirements such as those based on the classification (including, if relevant, the higher-level commodity) and the end use and parties to the transaction.


(3) *Validity date* follows:


(i) Paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) expires on December 31, 2026;

(4) *End-use and end-user restrictions*—(i) *Restrictions related to part 744 of the EAR.* The TGL under paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this supplement does not overcome the license requirements of § 744.11 or § 744.21 of the EAR when an entity listed in supplements no. 4 or 7 to part 744 is a party to the transaction as described in § 748.5(c) through (f) of the EAR, or when there is knowledge of any other prohibited end use or end user (other than the § 744.23 provisions specified above in the TGL).


(ii) *Indigenous production.* (A) The TGL under paragraph (d)(1) of this supplement cannot be used for the indigenous “development” or “production” of Category 3B tools in either Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5, *i.e.,* where the “part,” “component,” or “equipment” is “developed” or “produced” at the direction of an entity that is headquartered in, or whose ultimate parent company is headquartered in, either Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5.

(5) *Recordkeeping requirement.* All exports, reexports, transfer (in-country), and exports from abroad shipped under the authorization of this TGL are subject to the recordkeeping requirements of part 762 of the EAR. The records subject to this recordkeeping requirement include but are not limited to directives to the parties that are eligible to use this TGL and a list of the parties that have received directives. Each party that issues or acts upon a directive is responsible for keeping a record of that directive.
















(e) General Order No. 5:


General Order No. 5 of April 16, 2013; Authorization for Items the President Determines No Longer Warrant Control under the United States Munitions List (USML).


(1) *Continued use of DDTC approvals from the Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) for items that become subject to the EAR.* Items the President has determined no longer warrant control under the USML will become subject to the EAR as published final rules that transfer the items to the CCL become effective. DDTC licenses, agreements, or other approvals that contain items transitioning from the USML to the CCL and that are issued prior to the effective date of the final rule transferring such items to the CCL may continue to be used in accordance with the Department of State's final rule, *Amendments to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations: Initial Implementation of Export Control Reform,* published on April 16, 2013 in the _Federal Register._

(2) *BIS authorization.*

(i) Where continued use of DDTC authorization is not or is no longer an available option, or a holder of an existing DDTC authorization returns or terminates that authorization, any required authorization to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) a transitioned item on or after the effective date of the applicable final rule must be obtained under the EAR. Following the publication date and prior to the effective date of a final rule moving an item from the USML to the CCL, applicants may submit license applications to BIS for authorization to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) the transitioning item. BIS will process the license applications in accordance with § 750.4 of the EAR, hold the license application without action (HWA) if necessary, and issue a license, if approved, to the applicant no sooner than the effective date of the final rule transitioning the items to the CCL.


(ii) Following the effective date of a final rule moving items from the USML to the CCL, exporters, reexporters, and transferors of such items may return DDTC licenses in accordance with § 123.22 of the ITAR or terminate Technical Assistance Agreements, Manufacturing License Agreements, or Warehouse and Distribution Agreements in accordance with § 124.6 of the ITAR and thereafter export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) such items under applicable provisions of the EAR, including any applicable license requirements. No transfer (in-country) may be made of an item exported under a DDTC authorization containing provisos or other limitations without a license issued by BIS unless (i) the transfer (in-country) is authorized by an EAR license exception and the terms and conditions of the License Exception have been satisfied, or (ii) no license would otherwise be required under the EAR to export or reexport the item to the new end user.


(3) *Prior commodity jurisdiction determinations.* If the U.S. State Department has previously determined that an item is not subject to the jurisdiction of the ITAR and the item was not listed in a then existing “018” series ECCN (for purposes of the “600 series” ECCNs, or the 0x5zz ECCNs) or in a then existing ECCN 9A004.b or related software or technology ECCN (for purposes of the 9x515 ECCNs), then the item is per se not within the scope of a “600 series” ECCN, a 0x5zz ECCN, or a 9x515 ECCN. If the item was not listed elsewhere on the CCL at the time of such determination (*i.e.,* the item was designated EAR99), the item shall remain designated as EAR99 unless specifically enumerated by BIS or DDTC in an amendment to the CCL or to the USML, respectively.


(4) *Voluntary Self-Disclosure.* Parties to transactions involving transitioning items are cautioned to monitor closely their compliance with the EAR and the ITAR. Should a possible or actual violation of the EAR, or of any license or authorization issued thereunder, be discovered, the person or persons involved are strongly encouraged to submit a Voluntary Self-Disclosure to the Office of Export Enforcement, in accordance with § 764.5 of the EAR. Permission from the Office of Exporter Services, in accordance with § 764.5(f) of the EAR, to engage in further activities in connection with that item may also be necessary. Should a possible or actual violation of the ITAR, or of any license or authorization issued thereunder, be discovered, the person or persons involved are strongly encouraged to submit a Voluntary Disclosure to DDTC, in accordance with § 127.12 of the ITAR. For possible or actual violations of both the EAR and ITAR, the person or persons involved are strongly encouraged to submit disclosures to both BIS and DDTC, indicating to each agency that they also have made a disclosure to the other agency.




(f) *General Order No. 6.* General Order No. 6 of September 6, 2024.


(1) *GAAFET exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country).* This General License (GL) authorizes the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of GAAFET “technology” specified in ECCN 3E905 for the “development” or “production” of integrated circuits to end users located in a destination specified in Country Group A:5 or A:6 of supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR when that “development” or “production” began to be performed on or prior to September 6, 2024.


(2) *GAAFET grandfather clause for deemed exports and deemed reexports.* This GL authorizes deemed exports or deemed reexports of GAAFET “technology” specified in ECCN 3E905 (including for future advancements or versions of the same “technology”) to foreign person employees or contractors already employed by entities as of September 6, 2024 whose most recent country of citizenship or permanent residency is a destination specified in Country Group D:1 or D:5, and who are not prohibited persons under part 744 of the EAR, *e.g.,* not listed on the Entity List (supplement no. 4 to part 744), Unverified List (supplement no. 6 to part 744), Military End-User List (supplement no. 7 to part 744), or listed on the Denied Persons List (*https://www.bis.gov*). BIS notes that for purposes of §§ 742.4(a)(5) and 742.6(a)(10), the employee need not be a permanent and regular employee as that term is defined in § 734.20(d), *e.g.,* they may be newly hired.


(3) *Quantum deemed exports and deemed reexports.* This GL authorizes deemed exports or deemed reexports of quantum “technology” and “software” in ECCNs 3D901 (for “software” for quantum items in ECCNs 3A901.b, 3B904), 3E901 (for “technology” for quantum items in 3A901, 3A904, 3B904, 3C907, 3C908, 3C909), and “technology” for quantum items in ECCNs 4D906 or 4E906, to foreign persons whose most recent country of citizenship or permanent residency is a destination specified in Country Group D:1 or D:5 and who are not prohibited persons under part 744 of the EAR, *e.g.,* not listed on the Entity List (supplement no. 4 to part 744), Unverified List (supplement no. 6 to part 744), Military End-User List (supplement no. 7 to part 744), or listed on the Denied Persons List (*https://www.bis.gov*). BIS notes that for purposes of §§ 742.4(a)(5) and 742.6(a)(10), the employee need not be a permanent and regular employee as that term is defined in § 734.20(d), *e.g.,* they may be newly hired.


(4) *Reporting requirements.* Exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country), including deemed exports and deemed reexports, under this GL are subject to annual reporting requirements in accordance with § 743.7 of the EAR for GAAFET items in paragraph (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this general order and § 743.8 for quantum items in paragraph (f)(3) of this general order.


(5) *End-use and end-user restrictions*—(i) *Restrictions related to part 744 of the EAR.* The GL under paragraph (f) of this supplement does not overcome the license requirements of § 744.11 or § 744.21 of the EAR when an entity listed in supplements no. 4 or 7 to part 744 of the EAR is a party to the transaction as described in § 748.5(c) through (f) of the EAR, or when there is knowledge of any other prohibited end use or end user (other than the provisions of § 744.23 of the EAR).


(ii) *End-user restriction.* The GL under paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this supplement cannot be used for the “development” or “production” of any item identified under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this supplement where the “part,” “component,” or “equipment” is “developed” or “produced” at the direction of an entity that is headquartered in, or whose ultimate parent company is headquartered in a destination specified in Country Group D:1 or D:5 in supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR.


(6) *Recordkeeping requirement.* All exports, reexports, transfer (in-country), and exports from abroad shipped under the authorization of this GL, including deemed exports and deemed reexports of “technology” and “software,” are subject to the recordkeeping requirements of part 762 of the EAR.
