# § 740.1   Introduction.

In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C.


(a) *Scope.* A “License Exception” is an authorization contained in this part that allows you to export or reexport under stated conditions, items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) that would otherwise require a license under General Prohibition One, Two, Three, or Eight, as indicated under one or more of the Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs) in the Commerce Control List (CCL) in supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR and items subject to the EAR that would require a license based on the embargo policies described in part 746 of the EAR. If your export or reexport is subject to General Prohibition Six for embargoed destinations, refer to part 746 of the EAR to determine the availability of any License Exceptions. Special commodity controls apply to short supply items. License Exceptions for items listed on the CCL as controlled for Short Supply reasons are found in part 754 of the EAR. If your export or reexport is subject to General Prohibition Five, consult part 744 of the EAR. If your export or reexport is subject to General Prohibitions Four, Seven, Nine, or Ten, then no License Exceptions apply. Any license exception authorizing reexports also authorizes in-country transfers, provided the terms and conditions for reexports under that license exception are met.


(b) *Certification.* By using any of the License Exceptions you are certifying that the terms, provisions, and conditions for the use of the License Exception described in the EAR have been met. Please refer to part 758 of the EAR for clearance of shipments and documenting the use of License Exceptions.


(c) *License Exception symbols.* Each License Exception bears a three letter symbol that will be used for export clearance purposes (see paragraph (d) of this section).


(d) *Electronic Export Information (EEI) filing.* You must enter on any required EEI filing the correct License Code that corresponds to the appropriate license exception symbol (e.g., LVS, GBS, CIV) and the correct Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) (e.g., 4A003, 5A002) for all exports of items under a license exception. Items temporarily in the United States meeting the provisions of License Exception TMP, under § 740.9(b)(3), are excepted from this requirement. See § 758.1 of the EAR and 15 CFR part 30 of the FTR for EEI requirements.


(e) *Destination Control Statement.* You may be required to enter an appropriate Destination Control Statement on commercial documents in accordance with Destination Control Statement requirements of § 758.6 of the EAR.


(f) *Recordkeeping.* Records of transactions involving exports under any of the License Exceptions must be maintained in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements of part 762 of the EAR.
