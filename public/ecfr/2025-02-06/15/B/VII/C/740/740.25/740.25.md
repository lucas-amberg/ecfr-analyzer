(A) The packaging site must confirm in writing to the producer of the chips that the 3A090.c item was packaged and exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) to the specified designer of the co-packaged commodity.

(B) The finished, co-packaged commodities must not exceed the technical thresholds in ECCN 3A090, unless packaging the item is permitted under the Temporary General License (TGL) specified in paragraph (d) of General Order No. 4 in of supplement no. 1 to part 736.

(A) Upon receipt of the finished, co-packaged commodities, the exporter, reexporter, transferor must confirm the number of 3A090.c units contained within the finished, co-packaged chips received from the packaging site matches the number of 3A090.c items exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) to the packaging site.
