(i) Is aware that [INSERT GENERAL DESCRIPTION AND APPLICABLE ECCN(S) OF ITEMS TO BE SHIPPED (*e.g.,* Boards classified under ECCN 4A090.a)) will be shipped pursuant to License Exception Artificial Intelligence Authorization (AIA) of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 CFR parts 730-774;


(ii) Agrees not to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) these items to any end use or end user prohibited pursuant to Part 744 of the EAR without BIS authorization;


(iii) Agrees items received under this license exception are not, without prior authorization from the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), to be used to provide Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) access for training AI models specified in ECCN 4E091 for entities headquartered or located outside of, or whose ultimate parent company is headquartered outside of destinations listed in paragraph (a) of Supplement No. 5 to part 740;

(v) Inserts [NAME(S), SIGNATURE(S), AND TITLE(S) OF PERSON(S) AUTHORIZED TO SIGN THIS DOCUMENT ON BEHALF OF THE ULTIMATE CONSIGNEE, AND DATE(S) DOCUMENT IS SIGNED].


(3) *Notification to ultimate consignee of AIA shipment.* With each shipment under License Exception AIA, the exporter (or reexporter or transferor as applicable), must notify the ultimate consignee in writing that the shipment is made pursuant to License Exception AIA. The notice must either specify which items are subject to License Exception AIA or state that the entire shipment is made pursuant to License Exception AIA. The notice must clearly identify the shipment to which it applies. The written notice may be conveyed by paper documents or by electronic methods such as facsimile or email.


(c) *Reporting requirement.* Once the exporter, reexporter, or transferor obtains the certification from the ultimate consignee for items identified in paragraph (a)(1) only, prior to the initial export, reexport or transfer (in-country), the exporter, reexporter, or transferor must submit the certification to *EARReports@bis.doc.gov,* with the subject line: AIA Certification. Following submission of the certification, exporters, reexporters and in-country transferors are not required to sign or provide a subsequent certification if the notification described in (b)(4) is provided to the ultimate consignee. This reporting requirement is only applicable if the ultimate consignee is receiving items identified in paragraph (a)(1) with a cumulative total processing performance (TPP) of 253,000,000.
