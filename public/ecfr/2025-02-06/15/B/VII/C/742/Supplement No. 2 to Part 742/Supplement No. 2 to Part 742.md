# Supplement No. 2 to Part 742—Anti-Terrorism Controls: North Korea, Syria Contract Sanctity Dates and Related Policies 


(a) *Terrorist-supporting countries.* The Secretary of State has designated North Korea, and Syria as countries whose governments have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism under section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act (EAA).


(b) *Items controlled under EAA sections 6(j) and 6(a).* Whenever the Secretary of State determines that an export or reexport to any of these countries could make a significant contribution to the military potential of such country, including its military logistics capability, or could enhance the ability of such country to support acts of international terrorism, the item is subject to mandatory control under EAA section 6(j) and the Secretaries of Commerce and State are required to notify appropriate Committees of the Congress 30 days before a license for such an item may be issued.


(1) On December 28, 1993, the Secretary of State determined that the export to North Korea, or Syria of items described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this Supplement, if destined to military, police, intelligence or other sensitive end-users, are controlled under EAA section 6(j). Therefore, the 30-day advance Congressional notification requirement applies to the export or reexport of these items to sensitive end-users in any of these countries.


(2) License applications for items controlled to designated terrorist-supporting countries under EAA section 6(a) will also be reviewed to determine whether the Congressional notification requirements of EAA section 6(j) apply.


(3) Items controlled for anti-terrorism reasons under section 6(a) to North Korea, and Syria are:


(i) Items described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) to non-sensitive end-users, and 


(ii) The following items to all end-users: for North Korea, items in paragraph (c)(6) through (c)(45) of this Supplement; and for Syria, items in paragraphs (c)(6) through (c)(8), (c)(10) through (c)(14), (c)(16) through (c)(19), and (c)(22) through (c)(44) of this Supplement.


(c) The license requirements and licensing policies for items controlled for anti-terrorism reasons to Syria and North Korea are generally described in §§ 742.9 and 742.19 of this part, respectively.
