(11) With respect to your company's encryption products, do they incorporate encryption components produced or furnished by non-U.S. sources or vendors? Enter 'YES', 'NO', or if necessary, 'N/A' (250 characters or less).


(12) With respect to your company's encryption products, are any of them manufactured in non-U.S. locations?” If yes, list the non-U.S. manufacturing locations by city and country. If necessary, enter 'NONE' or 'N/A' (250 characters or less).


(b) *File format requirements.* (1) The information described in paragraph (a) of this supplement must be provided in tabular or spreadsheet form, as an electronic file in comma separated values format (.csv), only. No file formats other than .csv will be accepted, as your encryption self-classification report must be directly convertible to tabular or spreadsheet format, where each row (and all entries within a row) properly correspond to the appropriate encryption item.


(2) Each line of your encryption self-classification report (.csv file) must consist of twelve entries as further described in this supplement.


(3) The first line of the .csv file must consist of the following twelve entries (*i.e.,* match the following) without alteration or variation: PRODUCT NAME, MODEL NUMBER, MANUFACTURER, ECCN, AUTHORIZATION TYPE, ITEM TYPE, SUBMITTER NAME, TELEPHONE NUMBER, E-MAIL ADDRESS, MAILING ADDRESS, NON-U.S. COMPONENTS, NON-U.S. MANUFACTURING LOCATIONS.


(4) Each subsequent line of the .csv file must correspond to a single encryption item (or a distinguished series of products) as described in paragraph (c) of this supplement.


(5) Each line must consist of six entries as described in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6) of this supplement. No entries may be left blank. Each entry must be separated by a comma (,). Certain additional instructions are as follows:


(i) Line entries (a)(1) (‘PRODUCT NAME’) and (a)(4) (‘ECCN’) must be completed with relevant information.


(ii) For entries (a)(2) (‘MODEL NUMBER’) and (a)(3) (‘MANUFACTURER’), if these entries do not apply to your item or situation you may enter ‘NONE’ or ‘N/A’.


(iii) For entries (a)(5) (‘AUTHORIZATION TYPE’), if none of the provided choices apply to your situation, you may enter ‘OTHER’.


(6) Because of .csv file format requirements, the only permitted use of a comma is as the necessary separator between line entries. You may not use a comma for any other reason in your encryption self-classification report.


(c) *Other instructions.* (1) The information provided in accordance with this supplement and §§ 740.17(b)(1) and 740.17(e)(3) of the EAR must identify product offerings as they are typically distinguished in inventory, catalogs, marketing brochures and other promotional materials.


(2) For families of products where all the information described in paragraph (a) of this supplement is identical except for the model/series/part number (entry (a)(2)), you may list and describe these products with a single line in your .csv file using an appropriate model/series/part number identifier (*e.g.,* ‘300’ or ‘3xx’) for entry (a)(2), provided each line in your .csv file corresponds to a single product series (or product type) within an overall product family.


(3) For example, if Company A produces, markets and sells both a ‘100’ (‘1xx’) and a ‘300’ (‘3xx’) series of product, in its encryption self-classification report (.csv file) Company A must list the ‘100’ product series in one line (with entry (a)(2) completed as ‘100’ or ‘1xx’) and the ‘300’ product series in another line (with entry (a)(2) completed as ‘300’ or ‘3xx’), even if the other required information is common to all products in the ‘100’ and ‘300’ series.


(4) Only products self-classified by the exporter or reexporter must be reported. Products submitted for classification by the Bureau of Industry and Security for which a CCATS is issued do not need to be reported.
