(ii) ECCN 3E001 (for 3A090, except for 3A090.c) “technology” when it meets all of the following:






(A) The technology is developed by an entity headquartered in, or whose ultimate parent company is headquartered in, either Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5;


(B) The “technology” is subject to the EAR pursuant to the foreign direct product rule in § 734.9(h)(1)(i)(B)(*1*) and (h)(2)(ii) of the EAR;


(C) The “technology” is for reexport or transfer (in-country) from or within a destination specified in Country Group D:1, D:4, D:5, excluding any destination also specified in Country Groups A:5 or A:6, to any destination worldwide; and

(B) The “development” or “production” is by an entity headquartered in, or whose ultimate parent is headquartered in, Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5.


(5) *Back-end exclusion.* For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the term “production” does not apply to back-end steps such as assembly, test, or packaging that do not alter the integrated circuit technology level. If there is a question at the time of export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) about whether a manufacturing stage is back-end or whether a back-end activity alters the technology level, you may submit an Advisory Opinion request to BIS pursuant to § 748.3(c) of the EAR for clarification.


(b) *Additional prohibition on persons informed by BIS.* BIS may inform persons, either individually by specific notice or through amendment to the EAR published in the _Federal Register,_ that a license is required for a specific export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of any item subject to the EAR to a certain end-user, because there is an unacceptable risk of use in, or diversion to, the end uses specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section. Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration or the Deputy Assistant Secretary's designee. However, the absence of any such notification does not excuse persons from compliance with the license requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.


(c) *License exceptions.* No license exceptions may overcome the prohibition described in paragraph (a) of this section, except the prohibitions in paragraphs (a)(4) and (a)(3)(i) of this section may be overcome by license exceptions in § 740.2(a)(9)(i) or (ii) of the EAR, respectively.


(d) *License review standards.* License review will consider several factors including technology level, customers, compliance plans, and contract sanctity.


(1) *Presumption of denial.* Applications will be reviewed with a presumption of denial for Macau and destinations specified in Country Group D:5 and any entity headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5, unless either paragraph (d)(2) or (3) applies.


(2) *Presumption of approval.* Applications will be reviewed with a presumption of approval for end users headquartered in the United States or a destination specified in Country Group A:5 or A:6, that are not majority-owned by an entity headquartered in either Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5.


(3) *Case-by-case.* There is a case-by-case license review policy for license applications that meet one of the following conditions:


(i) For items specified in ECCN 3A090, 4A090, 3A001.z, 4A003.z, 4A004.z, 4A005.z, 5A002.z, 5A004.z, 5A992.z, 5D002.z, or 5D992.z, except for items designed or marketed for use in a datacenter and meeting the parameters of 3A090.a;


(ii) For items subject to the license requirements of this section where there is a foreign-made item that is not subject to the license requirements of this section and performs the same function as an item subject to the EAR license requirements of this section; or


(iii) For all other applications not specified in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) or (d)(3)(i) or (ii).
