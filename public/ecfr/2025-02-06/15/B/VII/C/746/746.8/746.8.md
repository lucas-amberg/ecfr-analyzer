# § 746.8   Sanctions against Russia and Belarus.

(a) *License requirements.* Except as described in the exclusions in paragraph (a)(12), and in addition to license requirements specified on the Commerce Control List (CCL) in supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR and in other provisions of the EAR, including part 744 and other sections of part 746, a license is required as specified under paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section. These license requirements follow an order of review, which provides guidance on the relationship between the different license requirements and which ones take precedence for certain items. For purposes of paragraphs (a)(5) through (7) of this section, a license is not required for any item that is listed in supplement nos. 4, 5 or 6 to this part that is also classified under an Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) on the Commerce Control List (CCL) in supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR. *See* paragraph (a)(1) of this section and part 742 for license requirements for exports, reexports, and transfers to or within Russia or Belarus for items classified in ECCNs, as well as part 744 for end-use and end-user controls that may apply to your transaction. Paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, are also used for determining license requirements for exports, reexports, and transfers to or within Russia or Belarus of any item that is listed in supplement nos. 4, 5, or 6 to this part and is classified in an ECCN on the CCL in supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR. License requirements in paragraph (a)(4) of this section that apply to exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) involved in certain end uses should be reviewed only after license requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) and (5) through (8) of this section are reviewed.


(1) *Items classified in any ECCN on the CCL.* A license is required to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) to or within Russia or Belarus any item subject to the EAR and specified in any Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) on the CCL.


(2) *Russia/Belarus/Temporarily occupied Crimea region of Ukraine foreign “direct product” (FDP) rule.* A license is required to reexport, export from abroad, or transfer (in-country) to any destination any foreign-produced item subject to the EAR under the Russia/Belarus/Temporarily occupied Crimea region of Ukraine under the FDP rule described in § 734.9(f) of the EAR.

 




(3) *Russia/Belarus-Military End User and Procurement FDP rule.* A license is required to reexport, export from abroad, or transfer (in-country) to or within any destination or to any end user or party any foreign-produced item subject to the EAR under § 734.9(g) of the EAR.

Such items include, but are not limited to, drilling rigs, parts for horizontal drilling, drilling and completion equipment, subsea processing equipment, Arctic-capable marine equipment, wireline and down hole motors and equipment, drill pipe and casing, software for hydraulic fracturing, high pressure pumps, seismic acquisition equipment, remotely operated vehicles, compressors, expanders, valves, and risers.


(ii) *Additional prohibition on those informed by BIS.* BIS may inform persons, either individually by specific notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required for a specific export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) or for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of specified items to a certain end-user or end-use, because there is an unacceptable risk of use in, or diversion to, the activities specified in this section in Russia or Belarus. Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Strategic Trade and Technology Security or the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Strategic Trade. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two working days signed by either the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Strategic Trade and Technology Security or the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Strategic Trade. However, the absence of any such notification does not excuse persons from compliance with the license requirements of this section.


(5) *Industrial Goods.* A license is required to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) any item subject to the EAR listed in supplement no. 4 to this part to or within Russia or Belarus.


(6) *Itemized Items.* A license is required to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) any item subject to the EAR listed in supplement no. 6 to this part to or within Russia or Belarus.

(9)-(11) [Reserved]


(12) *Exclusions from license requirements and scope of U.S.-origin controlled content.* Paragraphs (a)(12)(i), (ii), and (iii)(A) of this section exclude certain exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) from the scope of the license requirements of this section. Paragraph (a)(12)(iii)(B) excludes certain items from the scope of U.S.-origin content for purposes of *de minimis* calculations from certain destinations.


(i) *Deemed exports and deemed reexports.* The license requirements in paragraph (a) do not apply to deemed exports or reexports. However, the exclusion for deemed exports and deemed reexports is limited to the license requirements specified only in this section of the EAR. Any deemed export or deemed reexport to a Russian or Belarusian national must be made in accordance with all other applicable EAR license requirements, such as CCL-based license requirements. For example, the release of NS1 controlled technology to a Russian or Belarusian national in the United States or in a third country would require a CCL-based deemed export or deemed reexport license (as applicable). Consequently, authorization (in the form of a deemed export or deemed reexport license, or license exception eligibility) would be required under the EAR notwithstanding the exclusion in this paragraph (b).


(ii) *Mass market encryption commodities and software, and software designated EAR99.* Commodities specified under ECCN 5A991, and commodities and software classified under ECCNs 5A992.c or 5D992.c that have been 'classified in accordance with § 740.17,' as well as software designated EAR99 and identified in paragraph (a)(8)(ii) of this section do not require a license to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) to or within Russia or Belarus for the following civil end-users:

(iii) *Global Export Control Coalition (GECC).* The countries listed in supplement no. 3 to this part have committed to implementing substantially similar export controls on Russia, Belarus, and the temporarily occupied Crimea region of Ukraine under their domestic laws. Therefore, exports or reexports from the countries listed in supplement no. 3 to this part or transfers (in-country) within the countries listed in this supplement are not subject to the following license requirements in paragraph (a) of this section unless a limit to the exclusion is described in the Scope column in supplement no. 3 to this part:


(A) *Foreign direct product rules.* The license requirement described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section;


(B) *De minimis.* For purposes of determining U.S.-origin controlled content under supplement no. 2 to part 734 of the EAR, when making a *de minimis* calculation for reexports and exports from abroad to Russia or Belarus, the license requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(4) through (7) of this section are not used to determine controlled U.S.-origin content in a foreign-made item, provided the criteria of paragraphs (a)(12)(B)(*1*) and (*2*) of this section are met:


(*1*) The U.S.-origin content is described in an Anti-Terrorism (AT)-only ECCN or is designated EAR99. For purposes of this paragraph, AT-only items mean any ECCN that only specifies either only AT in the reason for control paragraph of the ECCN or is classified under ECCN 9A991; *and*

(*2*) The foreign made item will be reexported or exported from abroad from a destination described in supplement no. 3 to this part.


(iv) *Software designated EAR99.* Software that is subject to the EAR and designated EAR99 is excluded from the license requirement in paragraph (a)(8) when destined to entities engaged exclusively in the agriculture or medical industries.


(b) *Licensing policy.* (1) License applications required under paragraph (a)(3) of this section will be reviewed under a policy of denial in all cases.


(2) Applications for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of any item pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section that require a license for Russia or Belarus will be reviewed under a policy of denial when for use directly or indirectly for exploration or production from deepwater (greater than 500 feet), Arctic offshore, or shale projects in Russia or Belarus that have the potential to produce oil or gas.


(3) Applications for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of any item pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (a)(5) through (8) of this section will be reviewed under a policy of denial.
