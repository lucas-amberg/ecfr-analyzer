# Supplement No. 2 to Part 746—Russian and Belarusian Industry Sector Sanction List Pursuant to § 746.8(

(a) The source for the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS)-6 codes and descriptions in this list comes from the United States International Trade Commission (USITC's) Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (2023). The items described in supplement no. 2 to part 746 include any modified or designed “components,” “parts,” “accessories,” and “attachments” therefor regardless of the HTS Code or HTS Description of the “components,” “parts,” “accessories,” and “attachments,” apart from any “part” or minor “component” that is a fastener (*e.g.,* screw, bolt, nut, nut plate, stud, insert, clip, rivet, pin), washer, spacer, insulator, grommet, bushing, spring, wire, or solder. The exclusion of fasteners from this control does not apply to fasteners that are designated under an HTS Code under this supplement. Although generally fasteners (*e.g.,* screws, bolts, nuts, nut plates, studs, inserts, clips, rivets, pins), and washers, spacers, insulator, grommets, bushings, springs, wires, and solders are excluded from the scope of this supplement, certain part 744 license requirements for Russia and Belarus extend to all items “subject to the EAR,” and would therefore not exclude these items from the license requirements under that part (*e.g.,* § 744.21 of the EAR and the Entity List license requirements, which in most cases extend to all items “subject to the EAR”). This supplement includes two columns consisting of the HTS Codes and HTS Descriptions to assist exporters, reexporters, and transferors in identifying the products in this supplement. For information on HTS codes in general, you may contact a local import specialist at U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the nearest port. HTS-6 codes 730424, 731100, 761300, 841350, 841360, 841382, 841392, 842139, 843049, 843139, 843143, 847989, and 870520 are listed in both this supplement and supplement no. 4 to this part, so exporters, reexporters, and transferors must comply with the license requirements under both § 746.8(a)(4) and (5) as applicable.






(b) The items identified in the HTS-6 Code column of this supplement are subject to the license requirement under § 746.8(a)(4). The other column—HTS Description—is intended to assist exporters with their Automated Export System (AES) filing responsibilities. The other column—HTS Description—is intended to assist exporters with their Automated Export System (AES) filing responsibilities. The license requirements apply to HTS Codes at the 8 and 10 digit level (HTS-8 and HTS-10 Codes, respectively) when such longer HTS codes begin with the HTS-6 Codes as their first 6 numbers.
