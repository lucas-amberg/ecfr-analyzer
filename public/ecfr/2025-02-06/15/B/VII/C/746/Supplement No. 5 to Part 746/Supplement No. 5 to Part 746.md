(a) The source for the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS)-6 codes and descriptions in this list is the United States International Trade Commission (USITC)'s Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (2023). The items described in supplement no. 5 to part 746 include any modified or designed “components,” “parts,” “accessories,” and “attachments” therefor regardless of the HTS Code or HTS Description of the “components,” “parts,” “accessories,” and “attachments,” apart from any “part” or minor “component” that is a fastener (*e.g.,* screw, bolt, nut, nut plate, stud, insert, clip, rivet, pin), washer, spacer, insulator, grommet, bushing, spring, wire, or solder. The exclusion of fasteners from this control does not apply to fasteners that are designated under an HTS Code under this supplement. Although generally fasteners (*e.g.,* screws, bolts, nuts, nut plates, studs, inserts, clips, rivets, pins), and washers, spacers, insulators, grommets, bushings, springs, wires, and solder are excluded from the scope of this supplement, see part 744 of the EAR for license requirements for Russia and Belarus that apply to all items “subject to the EAR,” *e.g.,* § 744.21 and the Entity List license requirements, which in most cases extend to all items “subject to the EAR.” This supplement includes two columns consisting of the HTS Code and HTS Description and Per Unit Wholesale Price in the U.S. if applicable to assist exporters, reexporters, and transferors in identifying the products in this supplement.

(b) The items identified in the HTS-6 Code column of this supplement are subject to the license requirement under § 746.8(a)(7). The other column—HTS Description—is intended to assist exporters with their AES filing responsibilities. The license requirements extend to HTS Codes at the 8 and 10 digit level (HTS-8 and HTS-10 codes, respectively) when such longer HTS Codes begin with the HTS-6 Codes as their first 6 numbers. When a description mentions parts related to one or more numerical headings, this means parts related to any HS codes that begin with the digits in the range specified. For example, 'headings 8524 to 8528' means any HS code, HTS code, or Schedule B which has 8524, 8525, 8526, 8527, or 8528 as the first four digits.
