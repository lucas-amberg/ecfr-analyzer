# § 748.11   Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser.

(a) *Requirement to obtain document*—(1) *General requirement for all countries excluding the People's Republic of China (PRC).* Unless an exception in § 748.9(c) or paragraph (a)(3) of this section applies, a Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser is required if the license application includes “600 Series Major Defense Equipment” (600 series MDE) requiring a license for any reason on the Commerce Control List and such items are destined for a country other than the PRC.


(2) *Permissive substitute of Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser in place of PRC End-User Statement.* The requirement to obtain a support document for license applications involving the PRC is generally determined by § 748.10(a) of the EAR. However, a Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser may be substituted in place of a PRC End-User Statement when the commodities to be exported (*i.e.,* replacement parts and components) are valued at $75,000 or less and are for servicing previously exported commodities.


(3) *Exception to general requirement.* The general requirement described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply if the applicant is the same person as the ultimate consignee, provided the required statements are contained in Block 24 on the license application. This exemption does not apply, however, where the applicant and consignee are separate entities, such as parent and subsidiary, or affiliated or associated firms.


(b) *Obtaining the document.* (1) The ultimate consignee and purchaser must complete either a statement on company letterhead, or Form BIS-711, Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser, as described in paragraph (c) of this section. Unless otherwise specified, any reference in this section to “Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser” applies to both the statement on company letterhead and to Form BIS-711.


(2) If the consignee and purchaser elect to complete the statement on letterhead and both the ultimate consignee and purchaser are the same entity, only one statement is necessary.


(3) If the ultimate consignee and purchaser are separate entities, separate statements must be prepared and signed.


(4) If the ultimate consignee and purchaser elect to complete Form BIS-711, only one Form BIS-711 (containing the signatures of the ultimate consignee and purchaser) need be completed.


(5) Whether the ultimate consignee and purchaser sign a written statement or complete Form BIS-711, the following constraints apply:


(i) Responsible officials representing the ultimate consignee or purchaser must sign the statement. “Responsible official” is defined as someone with personal knowledge of the information included in the statement, and authority to bind the ultimate consignee or purchaser for whom they sign, and who has the power and authority to control the use and disposition of the licensed items.


(ii) The authority to sign the statement may not be delegated to any person (agent, employee, or other) whose authority to sign is not inherent in his or her official position with the ultimate consignee or purchaser for whom he or she signs. The signing official may be located in the United States or in a foreign country. The official title of the person signing the statement must also be included.


(iii) The consignee and/or purchaser must submit information that is true and correct to the best of their knowledge and must promptly send a new statement to the applicant if changes in the facts or intentions contained in their statement(s) occur after the statement(s) have been forwarded to the applicant. Once a statement has been signed, no corrections, additions, or alterations may be made. If a signed statement is incomplete or incorrect in any respect, a new statement must be prepared, signed and forwarded to the applicant.


(c) *Content of the document.* See supplement no. 3 to this part for the information necessary to complete a statement on company letterhead or on Form BIS-711.


(d) *Procedures for using document with license application*—(1) *Validity period.* (i) If a Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser is obtained prior to submission of the license application and the Statement is required to support one or more license applications, an applicant must submit the first license application within one year from the date the statement was signed.


(ii) All subsequent license applications supported by the same Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser must be submitted within four years of signature by the consignee or purchaser, whichever was last.


(2) [Reserved]
