(1) Facts relating to the grade, form, concentration, mixture(s), or ingredients as may be necessary to identify the item accurately, and;


(2) The Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) numbers, if they exist, must be identified.


(b) *Communications intercepting devices.* If you are required to submit a license application under § 742.13 of this part, you must enter the words “Communications Intercepting Device(s)” in Block 9. The item you are requesting to export or reexport must be specified by name in Block 22(j).


(c) *Computers, telecommunications, information security items, and related equipment.* If your license application includes items controlled by both Category 4 and Category 5, your license application must be submitted under Category 5 of the Commerce Control List (§ 774.1 of the EAR)—see Category 5 Part 1 Notes 1 and 2 and Part 2 Note 1. License applications including computers controlled by Category 4 must identify an “Adjusted Peak Performance” (“APP”) in Block 22(b). If the principal function is telecommunications, an APP is not required. Computers, related equipment, or software performing telecommunication or local area network functions will be evaluated against the telecommunications performance characteristics of Category 5 Part 1, while information security commodities, software and technology will be evaluated against the information security performance characteristics of Category 5 Part 2.


(1) Requirements for license applications that include computers. If you are submitting a license application to export or reexport computers or equipment containing computers to destinations in Country Group D:1 (See supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR), or to upgrade existing computer installations in those countries, you must also include technical specifications and product brochures to corroborate the data supplied in your license application, in addition to the APP in Block 22(b).


(2) *Security Safeguard Plan requirement.* The United States requires security safeguards for exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of High Performance Computers (HPCs) to ensure that they are used for peaceful purposes. If you are submitting a license application for an export, reexport, or in-country transfer of a high performance computer to or within a destination in Computer Tier 3 (see § 740.7(c)(1) of the EAR) or to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, or Syria you must include with your license application a security safeguard plan signed by the end-user, who may also be the ultimate consignee. This requirement also applies to exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of components or electronic assemblies to upgrade existing “computer” installations in those countries. A sample security safeguard plan is posted on BIS's Web page at *http://www.bis.doc.gov/hpcs/SecuritySafeguardPlans.html.*

(3) *Purchase orders for Artificial Intelligence commodities.* License applications for items controlled under ECCNs 3A090.a, 4A090.a, 3A001.z, 4A003.z, 4A004.z, 4A005.z, 5A002.z, 5A004.z, or 5A992.z require the submission of a purchase order or equivalent contractual agreement with the submission of the license application. The purchase order may be contingent on approval of the license. Upon approving a license for these items, BIS will generally limit the licensed quantity to the quantity specified on the purchase order.


(4) *License applications for Artificial Intelligence commodities.* Applicants are required to submit the total aggregated TPP value of each export item on their license application. This information should be included in block 22(j) in SNAP-R. If applicants are submitting a license for items destined to a country that is subject to a per-country TPP allocation, the applicant must fill out an individual license for each country and calculate the TPP per individual country. Applicants are encouraged to include information to support their TPP calculation in their Letter of Explanation (LOE). Calculate the aggregate TPP for each export item by adding the TPP for each integrated circuit. For additional information on calculating TPP, please refer to the Technical Notes to 3A090.

Applicants should use the reexport designation on the SNAP-R form and include in the “Additional Information” section of the license application that a license is required for the transaction under § 744.6 of the EAR. In the special purpose field, specify the specific activities the “U.S. person” is engaged. The applicant should provide, as relevant: the ECCN of the technology or item or, if unknown, use the EAR99 designation (regardless of whether the items being dealt with are subject to the EAR); and a complete explanation of the activity in supplemental documentation.

(A) Provide the following statement to U.S. Customs and Border Protection: “This shipment is being temporarily imported in accordance with the EAR. This shipment will be exported in accordance with and under the authority of BIS license number (provide the license number) (15 CFR 750.7(a) and 758.4);”


(B) Provide to U.S. Customs and Border Protection an invoice or other appropriate import-related documentation (or electronic equivalents) that includes a complete list and description of the firearms being temporarily imported, including their model, make, caliber, serial numbers, quantity, and U.S. dollar value; and

(ii) In addition to the export clearance requirements of part 758 of the EAR, the exporter or its agent must provide the import documentation related to paragraph (z)(2)(i)(B) of this supplement to U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the time of export.


(aa) *Exports of other firearms, certain shotguns, and related commodities.* (1) *Semi-automatic* firearms controlled under *0A506 and 0A507.* For export license applications that require prior notifications to congress of exports of semi-automatic firearms controlled under ECCNs 0A506 and 0A507 under the criteria of § 743.6, the exporter must include a copy of the signed contract or, if there is no contract, a written explanation from the applicant (including a statement of the value of the firearms controlled by ECCNs 0A506 and 0A507 to be exported). License applications for semi-automatic firearms controlled by ECCNs 0A506 and 0A507 may include other non-automatic firearms, shotguns, other 0x5zz items, or other items subject to the EAR, but the applicant must clearly identify the semi-automatic firearms controlled by ECCNs 0A506 and 0A507.


(2) *Purchase orders for certain commodities controlled under ECCNs 0A501, 0A502, 0A505, 0A506, 0A507, 0A508, and 0A509.* License applications for items controlled under ECCNs 0A501 (except 0A501.y), 0A502, 0A505 (except 0A505.c, 0A505.d, and 0A505.e), 0A506, 0A507, 0A508, or 0A509 to destinations other than Country Group A:1 require the submission of purchase documentation (*e.g.,* a purchase order, request for proposals, or other appropriate documentation) with the submission of the license application, dated within one year of submission with the license application. Upon approving a license for these items, BIS will generally limit the licensed quantity to the quantity specified on the purchase order. However, applicants may request up to a 10% variance in quantity from the purchase order amount, which will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Additionally, exporters may export various model types under the approved license, so long as the items remain consistent with the ECCN and ECCN item paragraph specified on the approved application.


(3) *Passport or other national identity card information.* License applications for items controlled under ECCNs 0A501 (except 0A501.y), 0A502, 0A505 (except 0A505.c, 0A505.d, and 0A505.e), 0A506, 0A507, 0A508, or 0A509 to destinations other than Country Group A:1 require the submission of passport or other national identity card information when the end user is an individual person.
