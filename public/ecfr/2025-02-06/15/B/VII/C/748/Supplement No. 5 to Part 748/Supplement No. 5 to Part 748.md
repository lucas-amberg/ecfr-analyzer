# Supplement No. 5 to Part 748—U.S. Import Certificate and Delivery Verification Procedure


The United States participates in an Import Certificate/Delivery Verification procedure. Under this procedure, U.S. importers are sometimes required to provide their foreign suppliers with an U.S. International Import Certificate that is validated by the U.S. Government. This certificate tells the government of the exporter's country that the items covered by the certificate will be imported into the U.S. Economy and will not be reexported except as authorized by U.S. export control regulations. In addition, in some cases, the exporter's government may require a delivery verification. Under this procedure, the U.S. Customs Service validates a certificate confirming that the items have entered the U.S. economy. The U.S. importer must return this certificate to the foreign exporter.


This supplement establishes the procedures and requirements of BIS with respect to both of these programs. Paragraph (a) of this supplement contains the requirements and procedures of the U.S. International Import Certificate procedure. Paragraph (b) of this supplement contains the requirements and procedures of the Delivery Verification procedure.


(a) U.S. International Import Certificates. If you are a U.S. importer, a foreign supplier may request you to obtain a U.S. import certificate. The reason for this request is that the exporter's government requires a U.S. import certificate as a condition to issuing an export license. To obtain such a certificate you will have to fill in and execute the U.S. International Import Certificate form (Form BIS-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53) and submit it to the U.S. government agency that has jurisdiction over the items you are importing. In doing so, you will be making a representation to the United States Government that you will import the items described in the certificate into the United States or if not so imported, you will not divert, transship or reexport them to another destination with the explicit approval of the U.S. government agency that has jurisdiction over those items. (Representations that items will be entered into the U.S. do not preclude the temporary unloading of items in a foreign trade zone for subsequent entry into the economy of the U.S.) If the items described in the certificate are subject to U.S. Department of Commerce jurisdiction, the Department will validate the certificate and return it to you. You may then send the certificate to your foreign supplier. In this way the government of the exporting country is assured that the items will become subject to the export control laws of the United States.


(1) Items for which the U.S. Department of Commerce issues U.S. International Import Certificates and forms to use. The Department of Commerce issues U.S. International Import Certificates for the following types of items.


(i) Items controlled for National Security reasons. Items under the export licensing jurisdiction of BIS that are identified as controlled for national security reasons on the Commerce Control List (supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR). You will need to submit in triplicate a completed Form BIS-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53;


(ii) Nuclear equipment and materials. Items subject to the export licensing jurisdiction of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for nuclear equipment and materials. (see 10 CFR part 110). You will need to submit in quadruplicate a completed Form BIS-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53; and


(iii) Munitions Items. Items listed on the U.S. Munitions List (see 22 CFR part 121) that do not appear on the more limited U.S. Munitions Import List (27 CFR 47.21). You will need to submit in triplicate a completed Form BIS-645P. For triangular transactions (See paragraph (a)(5) of this supplement) involving items on the U.S. Munitions List, you must contact the Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and use Form BIS-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53. You should contact the Treasury Department, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for items appearing on the U.S. Munitions Import List. You will need to use Form ATF-4522.


(2) Where to submit forms. U.S. International Import Certificates and requests to amend certificates may be presented for validation either in person or by mail at the following locations.


(i) By courier to the Bureau of Industry and Security, Room 2099B, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20230, Attn: Import Certificate Request; or


(ii) In person or by mail at one of the following Department of Commerce U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service District Offices:


(3) U.S. International Import Certificate validity periods. The U.S. International Import Certificate must be submitted to the foreign government within six months from the date of certification by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The expiration of this six-month period in no way affects the responsibility of the importer to fulfill the commitments made in obtaining the certificate. If the certificate is not presented to the government of the exporting country before the expiration of its validity period, the exporter must apply for a new certificate. The original unused U.S. International Import Certificate must be returned to BIS at the address specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this supplement.


(4) Statements on the certificate or amendments are representations to the U.S. Government which continue in effect.


(i) All statements and representations made in a U.S. International Import Certificate or an amendment thereto, will be deemed to be continuing in nature until the transaction described in the certificate is completed and the items are delivered into the economy of the importing country.


(ii) Any change of fact or intention in regard to the transaction described in the certificate shall be promptly disclosed to BIS by the U.S. importer by presentation of an amended certificate. The amended certificate must describe all of the changes and be accompanied by the original certificate bearing the certification of BIS. If the original certificate has been transferred to the foreign exporter, you must, where possible, attempt to obtain the original certificate prior to applying for an amendment. If the original certificate is unobtainable because the foreign exporter has submitted it to the appropriate foreign government, or for any other reason, then you must submit a written statement with your amendment giving the reasons for your failure to submit the original certificate.


(5) Certificates for Triangular transaction (items will not enter the U.S. or applicant is not sure that they will enter the United States).


(i) In accordance with international practice, BIS will, upon request, stamp the certificate with a triangular symbol as notification to the government of the exporting country that the U.S. importer is uncertain whether the items will be imported into the U. S. or knows that the items will not be imported into the U.S., but that, in any case, the items will not be delivered to any other destination except in accordance with the EAR.


(ii) The triangular symbol on a certificate U.S. International Import Certificate is not, in and of itself, an approval by BIS to transfer or sell items to a foreign consignee. Note that a triangular Certificate will not be issued covering foreign excess property sold abroad by the U.S. Department of Defense.


(6) Approval to export items to a foreign consignee prior to delivery under a U.S. International Import Certificate. The written approval of BIS is required before items covered by a U.S. International Import Certificate (whether or not bearing a triangular symbol) may be shipped to a destination other than the U.S. or Canada or sold to a foreign purchaser, and before title to or possession of such items may be transferred to a foreign transferee. This requirement does not apply after the items have been delivered in accordance with the undertaking set forth in the Certificate or if at the time of such shipment, sale, passage of possession or passage of title, a License Exception or a NLR provision of the EAR would authorize the transaction.


(i) If prior approval is required, a letter requesting authorization to release the shipment shall be submitted to BIS at the address listed in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this supplement.


(ii) The letter must contain the certificate number; date issued; location of the issuing office; names, addresses, and identities of all parties to the complete transaction; and the quantity, dollar value, and description of the items. The letter must be accompanied by the U.S. International Import Certificate, and all other documentation required by the EAR for the item and country of ultimate destination, as identified in part 748 of the EAR. If requirements stated in part 748 of the EAR do not apply to your transaction, you must identify the intended end-use of the items in your letter.


(iii) Where the letter request is approved and is supported by a foreign import certificate, no further approval from BIS is required for the purchaser or transferee to resell or again transfer the items. However, where BIS approves a request that was not supported by a foreign import certificate, the person to whom approval is granted is required to inform the purchaser or transferee, in writing, that the items are to be shipped to the approved destination only and that no other disposition of the items is permitted without the approval of BIS.


(iv) If the transaction is approved, a validated letter of approval will be sent to the U.S. purchaser for retention in his records. Where a DV or other official government confirmation of delivery is required, the letter will so indicate.


(v) If the items covered by a certificate have been imported into a destination other than the U.S. and the foreign exporter of the items requests a Delivery Verification, the person who obtained the certificate must obtain a DV from the person to whom the items were delivered in the actual importing country. (If a DV is unobtainable, other official government confirmation of delivery must be obtained.) The DV or other official government confirmation of delivery must be submitted to BIS together with an explanatory letter giving the U.S. International Import Certificate number, date issued, and location of issuing office. BIS will then issue Form ITA-6008, Delivery Compliance Notice, in two copies, the original of which must be forwarded to the country of origin in order to serve as evidence to the exporting country that the requirements of the U.S. Government have been satisfied with respect to delivery of the items.


(vi) Delivery, sale, or transfer of items to another U.S. purchaser.


(A) Items covered by a U.S. International Import Certificate may not be sold, and title to or possession of such items may not be transferred, to another U.S. purchaser or transferee before the items are delivered to the U.S. (or to an approved foreign destination, as provided by paragraph (a)(5) of this supplement), except in accordance with the provisions described in paragraph (a)(6) of this supplement. The provisions of this paragraph do not apply after the items have been delivered in accordance with the undertaking set forth in the certificate.


(B) Resale or transfer to another U.S. purchaser or transferee requires the prior approval of BIS only in cases where the buyer or transferee is listed in supplement no. 1 to part 766 of the EAR. However, you, as the person who obtained the certificate are required to notify BIS of any change in facts or intentions relating to the transaction, and in all cases you will be held responsible for the delivery of the items in accordance with the EAR. You are required in all cases to secure, prior to sale or transfer, and to retain in your files in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions contained in part 762 of the EAR, written acceptance by the purchaser or transferee of:


(*1*) All obligations undertaken by, and imposed under the EAR, upon the holder of the certificate; and


(*2*) An undertaking that all subsequent sales or transfers will be made subject to the same conditions.


(C) The responsibility of the certificate holder for obtaining a DV also applies to those cases where the items are resold to a U.S. purchaser (See paragraph (b)(1) of this supplement.


(vii) Reexport or transshipment of items after delivery to U.S. Items imported into the U.S. under the provisions of a U.S. International Import Certificate may not be reexported to any destination under the *intransit* provisions of License Exception TMP (see § 740.9(b)(1) of the EAR). However, all other provisions of the EAR applicable to items of domestic origin shall apply to the reexport of items of foreign origin shipped to the U.S. under a U.S. International Import Certificate. 


(viii) Lost or destroyed U.S. International Import Certificates. If a U.S. International Import Certificate is lost or destroyed, a duplicate copy may be obtained by the person in the U.S. who executed the original U.S. International Import Certificate by submitting to any of the offices listed in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this supplement new Form BIS-645P/ATF-4522/DSP-53 in the same way as an original request, except that the forms shall be accompanied by a letter detailing the circumstances under which the original certificate was lost or destroyed and certifying:


(A) That the original U.S. International Import Certificate No. ______, dated ______, issued to (name and address of U.S. importer) for import from (foreign exporter's name and address) has been lost or destroyed; and


(B) That if the original U.S. International Import Certificate is found, the applicant agrees to return the original or duplicate of the certificate to the Bureau of Industry and Security.


(ix) Unused U.S. International Import Certificates. If the transaction will not be completed and the U.S. International Import Certificate will not be used, return the certificate for cancellation to BIS at the address listed in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this supplement.


(b) Delivery Verification Certificate. U.S. importers may be requested by their foreign suppliers to furnish them with a certified Form BIS-647P, Delivery Verification Certificate, covering items imported into the U.S. These requests are made by foreign governments to assure that strategic items shipped to the U.S. are not diverted from their intended destination. In these instances, the issuance of an export license by the foreign country is conditioned upon the subsequent receipt of a Delivery Verification Certificate from the U.S. importer. Accordingly, your compliance with your foreign exporter's request for a Delivery Verification is necessary to ensure your foreign exporter fulfills its government obligations and is able to participate in future transactions with you. Failure to comply may subject your exporter to penalties that may prevent future trade.


(1) The responsibility of a person or firm executing a U.S. International Import Certificate for providing the foreign exporter with confirmation of delivery of the items includes instances where the items are resold or transferred to another U.S. person or firm prior to actual delivery to the U.S. or to an approved foreign destination. The person who executed the U.S. International Import Certificate shall secure in writing from the U.S. purchaser or transferee, and retain in your files in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions stated in part 762 of the EAR:


(i) Acceptance of the obligation to provide the purchaser or transferee with either the Delivery Verification (or other official government confirmation of delivery if a Delivery Verification is unobtainable) or assurance that this document was submitted to BIS; and


(ii) An undertaking that each succeeding U.S. transferee or purchaser will assume the same obligation or assurance. In each case the seller or transferor must transmit to the U.S. purchaser or transferee the U.S. International Import Certificate number covering the export from the foreign country and request that they pass it on to any other U.S. purchasers or transferees.


(2) Completion and certification of Delivery Verification Certificates. If you are requested by your foreign exporter to provide a Delivery Verification, you must obtain Form BIS-647P from a U.S. customs office or one of the offices listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this supplement and complete all blocks (except those below the line titled “To be completed by U.S. Customs Service”) on the form. The language used in the block titled “Description of Goods” must describe the items in the same terms as those shown on the applicable U.S. International Import Certificate. Upon completion Form BIS-647P must be presented, in duplicate, to a U.S. customs office. The U.S. customs office will certify Form BIS-647P only where the import is made under a warehouse or consumption entry.


(3) Disposition of certified Delivery Verification Certificates. The importer must send the original certified Delivery Verification Certificate to the foreign exporter or otherwise dispose of it in accordance with the instructions of the exporting country. The duplicate copy will be retained by the U.S. customs office.


(4)(i) Issuance of a U.S. Delivery Compliance Notice in lieu of a Delivery Verification Certificate. If you are requested to provide a Delivery Verification Certificate but do not wish to disclose the name of your customer to the foreign exporter (e.g., in the event that the items are resold or transferred to another person or firm before the items enter the U.S.), you may submit an originally completed Form BIS-647P together with an explanatory letter requesting a Delivery Compliance Notice, to BIS at the address listed in (a)(2)(i) of this supplement.


(ii) BIS will provide you with a notice signifying that the items were imported into the U.S. and that a satisfactory DV has been submitted to BIS. You must then forward the original notice to your foreign exporter for submission to the foreign government. A copy of the notice should be retained in your files in accordance with the recordkeeping provisions stated in part 762 of the EAR.


(5)(i) Lost or destroyed Delivery Verification Certificate. When a Delivery Verification Certificate is lost or destroyed, the U.S. importer must submit a letter to BIS at the address listed in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this supplement certifying that:


(A) The original Delivery Verification Certificate has been lost or destroyed;


(B) The circumstances under which it was lost or destroyed;


(C) The type of customs entry (warehouse or consumption), entry number, and date of entry; and


(D) The number and date of the related U.S. International Import Certificate.


(ii) BIS will, in applicable cases, notify the exporting government that a Delivery Verification Certificate been issued.


(c) Penalties and sanctions for violations. The enforcement provisions of part 764 and supplement no. 2 to part 736 of the EAR apply to transactions involving imports into the U.S. covered by this supplement and to both foreign and U.S. parties involved in a violation of this supplement. Any provisions of part 764 and supplement no. 2 to part 736 of the EAR which, by their terms, relate to “exports” or “exports from the U.S.” are also deemed to apply and extend to imports into the U.S., applications for U.S. International Import Certificates (Forms BIS-645P presented to U.S. Department of Commerce for certification), U.S. International Import Certificates, and Delivery Verification Certificates, described in this supplement. (Applications the documents described in this supplement, are included within the definition of export control documents provided in part 772 of the EAR.) Refer to § 764.3 of the EAR for more information.
