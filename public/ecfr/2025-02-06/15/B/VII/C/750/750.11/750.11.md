# ยง 750.11   Shipping tolerances.

Under some circumstances, you may use a license issued for the export of items from the United States to export more than the value shown on that license. This additional amount is called a shipping tolerance. This section tells you, as the licensee, when you may take advantage of a shipping tolerance and the amount of shipping tolerance you are permitted to use.


(a) If you have already shipped the full quantity of items approved on your license, you may not use this shipping tolerance provision. No further shipment may be made under the license.


(b) If you have not shipped the full quantity of items approved on the license, the value of all of your shipments under one license, up to the full quantity approved on the license, may exceed the total dollar value stated on that license by up to 10%, unless;


(1) Your license stipulates a specific shipping tolerance; or


(2) Your item is controlled for short supply reasons and a different tolerance has been established. (See part 754 of the EAR).
