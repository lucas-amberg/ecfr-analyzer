(3) Accurate EEI filings have been made for exports as required by this part, the FTR, and other federal regulations; and


(4) The activities of U.S. persons, wherever located, which are subject to a license requirement pursuant to § 744.6 of the EAR, are authorized by and comply with the terms of a BIS license.

(1) *Inspection, search, and detention of items*—(i) *Purpose of inspection, search, and detention.* All items subject to export laws and regulations administered or enforced by the Secretary that have been, are being, or are about to be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) are subject to inspection, search, and detention. The scope of inspection may include, but is not limited to, item identification; technical appraisal (analysis) or both; verifying the accuracy of the EEI filing, or if there is no EEI filing, the air waybill, bill of lading or other loading document covering the item about to be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country); and verifying the value and quantity of such item.


(ii) *Place of inspection, search, and detention.* Inspection, search, and detention may take place at any location inside or outside of the United States, to include, but not limited to, the borders of the United States, all ports of exit, the premises of freight forwarders, bonded warehouses, foreign trade zones, and manufacturing, transportation, and storage facilities.


(iii) *Technical identification.* Where, in the judgment of the official making the inspection, the item cannot be properly identified, a sample may be taken for more detailed examination or for laboratory analysis.


(A) *Obtaining samples.* The sample will be obtained by the official making the inspection in accordance with the provisions for sampling imported merchandise. The size of the sample will be the minimum representative amount necessary for identification or analysis. This will depend on such factors as the physical condition of the material (whether solid, liquid, or gas) and the size and shape of the container.


(B) *Notification.* When a sample is taken, the exporter, reexporter, or transferor, or their agent(s), and the ultimate consignee will be notified by letter from an OEE official, documenting the port of export, reexport, or other place of inspection, date of sampling, BIS license number (if any) or other authorization, invoice number, quantity of sample taken, description of item, marks and packing case numbers, and manufacturer's number for the item. A copy of the letter will be placed in the container that had been opened by the inspecting official, and a copy will be retained by the inspecting official's office.


(C) *Disposal of samples.* Samples will be disposed of in accordance with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection procedure for imported commodities.


(2) *Inspection and production of books, records, and other information.* OEE officials are authorized to require any person subject to export laws and regulations administered or enforced by the Secretary, including, but not limited to, exporters, reexporters, transferors, or their agent(s), and owners and operators of carriers or their agents, as well as intermediate consignees, ultimate consignees, and end users, and their agent(s) to produce for inspection and copying any books, records and other information, including, but not limited to, invoices, orders, letters of credit, inspection reports, technical documentation, packing lists, shipping documents and instructions, and correspondence.


(3) *Questioning of individuals.* OEE officials are authorized to question any person, including, but not limited to, the owner or operator of a carrier and the carrier's agent(s), as well as the exporter, reexporter, transferor (in-country), or their agent(s).


(4) *Prohibiting lading.* OEE officials may prevent the lading of items on a conveyance.


(5) *Inspection, search, and detention of conveyance.* OEE officials are authorized to inspect, search, and detain any conveyance at any time to determine whether items have been, are being, or are about to be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country). Inspection, search, and detention of a conveyance may take place at any location inside or outside of the United States, to include, but not limited to, the borders of the United States, all ports of exit, the premises of freight forwarders, bonded warehouses, foreign trade zones, and manufacturing, transportation, and storage facilities.


(6) *Seizure of property.* OEE officials are authorized to seize any property, tangible or intangible, when there is probable cause to believe that such property is subject to administrative forfeiture (nonjudicial civil forfeiture or summary forfeiture), civil judicial forfeiture, or criminal forfeiture. Seizures of property subject to forfeiture may take place at any location inside or outside of the United States, to include, but not limited to, the borders of the United States, all ports of exit, the premises of freight forwarders, bonded warehouses, foreign trade zones, and manufacturing, transportation, and storage facilities.


(7) *Administrative forfeiture authority.* OEE is authorized to initiate administrative forfeiture (nonjudicial civil forfeiture or summary forfeiture) proceedings and forfeit property in accordance with the procedures set forth in 18 U.S.C. 981(d) and the Customs laws (19 U.S.C. 1602 *et seq*).


(8) *Enforcement activity.* (i) All BIS actions taken to implement, administer, and enforce the authorities granted to the Secretary shall be conducted pursuant to the U.S. Constitution and all applicable laws and regulations, including judicially recognized exceptions to the requirement for a search warrant under the Fourth Amendment, for example, consent of the person to be searched, exigent circumstances, searches incident to a lawful arrest, and border searches.


(ii) BIS may enter into any such agreements (*e.g.,* memoranda of understanding) with other Federal agencies as deemed necessary by BIS to execute the authorities set forth in this part in a lawful and orderly manner.


(iii) BIS shall issue additional guidance as necessary to ensure the lawful and orderly execution of the Secretary's authorities.
