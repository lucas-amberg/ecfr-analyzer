(a) *Where to report.* If a person learns that an export control violation of the EAR has occurred or may occur, that person may notify:

(c) *Reporting requirement distinguished.* The reporting provisions in paragraph (a) of this section are not “reporting requirements” within the meaning of § 764.2(i) of this part.
