# Supplement No. 1 to Part 764—Standard Terms of Orders Denying Export Privileges


(a) *General.* (1) Orders denying export privileges may be “standard” or “non-standard.” This Supplement specifies terms of the standard order denying export privilege with respect to denial orders issued after March 25, 1996. Denial orders issued prior to March 25, 1996 are to be construed, insofar as possible, as having the same scope and effect as the standard denial order. All denial orders are published in the _Federal Register._ The failure by any person to comply with any denial order is a violation of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (see § 764.2(k) of this part). BIS provides a list of persons currently subject to denial orders on its Web site at *http://www.bis.doc.gov.*

(2) Each denial order shall include:


(i) The name and address of any denied persons and any related persons subject to the denial order; 


(ii) The basis for the denial order, such as final decision following charges of violation, settlement agreement, section 11(h) of the EAA, or temporary denial order request; 


(iii) The period of denial, the effective date of the order, whether and for how long any portion of the denial of export privileges is suspended, and any conditions of probation; and 


(iv) Whether any or all outstanding licenses issued under the EAR to the person(s) named in the denial order or in which such person(s) has an interest, are suspended or revoked. 


Denial orders issued prior to March 25, 1996, are to be construed, insofar as possible, as having the same scope and effect as the standard denial order.


The introduction to each denial order shall be specific to that order, and shall include: (1) The name and address of any denied persons and any related persons subject to the denial order; (2) the basis for the denial order, such as final decision following charges of violation, settlement agreement, § 11(h) of the EAA, or temporary denial order request; (3) the period of denial, the effective date of the order, whether and for how long any portion of the denial of export privileges is suspended, and any conditions of probation; and (4) whether any or all outstanding licenses issued under the EAR to the person(s) named in the denial order or in which such person(s) has an interest, are suspended or revoked.


(b) *Standard denial order terms.* The following are the standard terms for imposing periods of export denial. Some orders also contain other terms, such as those that impose civil penalties, or that suspend all or part of the penalties or period of denial.


“It is therefore ordered:


First, that [the denied person(s)] may not, directly or indirectly, participate in any way in any transaction involving any commodity, software or technology (hereinafter collectively referred to as “item”) exported or to be exported from the United States that is subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), or in any other activity subject to the EAR, including, but not limited to:


A. Applying for, obtaining, or using any license, license exception, or export control document;


B. Carrying on negotiations concerning, or ordering, buying, receiving, using, selling, delivering, storing, disposing of, forwarding, transporting, financing, or otherwise servicing in any way, any transaction involving any item exported or to be exported from the United States that is subject to the EAR, or in any other activity subject to the EAR; or


C. Benefiting in any way from any transaction involving any item exported or to be exported from the United States that is subject to the EAR, or in any other activity subject to the EAR.


Second, that no person may, directly or indirectly, do any of the following:


A. Export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) to or on behalf of the denied person any item subject to the EAR;


B. Take any action that facilitates the acquisition or attempted acquisition by a denied person of the ownership, possession, or control of any item subject to the EAR that has been or will be exported from the United States, including financing or other support activities related to a transaction whereby a denied person acquires or attempts to acquire such ownership, possession or control;


C. Take any action to acquire from or to facilitate the acquisition or attempted acquisition from the denied person of any item subject to the EAR that has been exported from the United States;


D. Obtain from the denied person in the United States any item subject to the EAR with knowledge or reason to know that the item will be, or is intended to be, exported from the United States; or


E. Engage in any transaction to service any item subject to the EAR that has been or will be exported from the United States and which is owned, possessed or controlled by a denied person, or service any item, of whatever origin, that is owned, possessed or controlled by a denied person if such service involves the use of any item subject to the EAR that has been or will be exported from the United States. For purposes of this paragraph, servicing means installation, maintenance, repair, modification or testing.


Third, that, after notice and opportunity for comment as provided in § 766.23 of the EAR, any person, firm, corporation, or business organization related to the denied person by affiliation, ownership, control, or position of responsibility in the conduct of trade or related services may also be made subject to the provisions of this order.


This order, which constitutes the final agency action in this matter, is effective [DATE OF ISSUANCE].”
