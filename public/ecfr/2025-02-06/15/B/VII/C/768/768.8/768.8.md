(b) BIS will initiate an eligibility evaluation:


(1) On its own initiative;


(2) On receipt of a FAS; or

(2) The item must be of a quality similar to that of the U.S.-controlled item; and


(3) The item must be available-in-fact to the specified non-controlled country without effective restrictions.


(e) Within 30 days of initiation of the evaluation, the Secretary of Commerce will make a determination of foreign availability on the basis of the BIS evaluation and recommendation, taking into consideration the evidence the Secretaries of Defense, State, and other interested agencies provide to BIS and any other information that the Secretary considers relevant.


(f) Within 30 days of the receipt of the FAS or TAC certification, BIS will publish the Secretary's determination in the _Federal Register,_ that the item will or will not be eligible for expedited licensing procedures to the stated countries and, where appropriate, amend supplement no. 2 to part 768.


(g) Following completion of a self-initiated evaluation, BIS will be notified of the Secretary's determination and, where appropriate, supplement no. 2 to part 768 will be amended.
