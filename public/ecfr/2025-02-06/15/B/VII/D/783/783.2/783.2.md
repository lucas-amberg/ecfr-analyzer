Use Form AP-1, and any applicable report forms indicated for the activities identified in § 783.1(a) of the APR, to prepare your *Amended Report.* Submit your *Amended Report* to BIS, as provided in § 782.6 of the APR.

(2) *Change in ownership of organization.* You must submit an *Amended Report* to BIS if you sold a reportable location or if your reportable location went out of business since submitting your most recent *Initial Report, Annual Update Report,* or *No Changes Report* to BIS. You must also submit an *Amended Report* to BIS if you purchased a reportable location that submitted an *Initial Report, Annual Update Report,* or *No Changes Report* to BIS for the most recent reporting period, as specified in § 783.1(a) and (b) of the APR. Submit your *Amended Report* to BIS, as provided in § 782.6 of the APR, either before the effective date of the change in ownership or within 30 calendar days after the effective date of the change.


(i) The following information must be included in an *Amended Report* submitted to BIS by an organization that is selling or that has sold a reportable location (use Forms AP-1 and AP-16 to prepare your *Amended Report*—address specific details regarding the sale of a reportable location in Form AP-16):

(B) Reporting Code (this code will be assigned to your location and reported to you by BIS after receipt of your *Initial Report*);


(C) Name of purchaser (i.e., name of the new organization/owner purchasing a reportable location) and name and address of contact person for the purchaser, if known;


(D) Date of ownership transfer or change;


(E) Additional details on the sale of the reportable location relevant to ownership or operational control over any portion of the reportable location (e.g., whether the entire location or only a portion of the reportable location has been sold to a new owner); and


(F) Details regarding whether the new owner of a reportable location will submit the next report for the entire calendar year in which the ownership change occurred, or whether the previous owner and new owner will submit separate reports for the periods of the calendar year during which each owned the reportable location.


(ii) The following information must be included in an *Amended Report* submitted to BIS by an organization that is purchasing or that has purchased a reportable location (use Forms AP-1 and AP-2 to prepare your *Amended Report*):


(A) Name of purchaser (i.e., name of the new organization/owner purchasing a reportable location) and name and address of contact person for the purchaser;


(B) Details on the purchase of the reportable location relevant to ownership or operational control over any portion of the reportable location (e.g., whether the purchaser intends to purchase and to maintain operational control over the entire location or only a portion of the reportable location); and

(iii) If the new owner of a reportable location is responsible for submitting a report that covers the entire calendar year in which the ownership change occurred, the new owner must obtain and maintain possession of the location's records covering the entire year, including those records for the period of the year during which the previous owner still owned the property.


(c) *Non-substantive changes.* If you discover one or more non-substantive typographical errors in your *Initial Report* or *Annual Update Report,* after submitting the report to BIS, you are not required to submit an *Amended Report* to BIS.
