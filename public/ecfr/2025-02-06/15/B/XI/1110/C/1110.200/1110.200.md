# § 1110.200   Imposition of penalty.

(a) *General.* (1) Any Person certified under this part who receives Limited Access DMF, and who:


(i) Discloses Limited Access DMF to any person other than a person who meets the requirements of § 1110.102(a)(1) through (3);


(ii) Discloses Limited Access DMF to any person who uses the Limited Access DMF for any purpose other than a legitimate fraud prevention interest or a legitimate business purpose pursuant to a law, governmental rule, regulation, or fiduciary duty;


(iii) Discloses Limited Access DMF to any person who further discloses the Limited Access DMF to any person other than a person who meets the requirements of § 1110.102(a)(1) through (3); or


(iv) Uses any such Limited Access DMF for any purpose other than a legitimate fraud prevention interest or a legitimate business purpose pursuant to a law, governmental rule, regulation, or fiduciary duty; and


(2) Any Person to whom such Limited Access DMF is disclosed, whether or not such Person is certified under this part, who further discloses or uses such Limited Access DMF as described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section, shall pay to the General Fund of the United States Department of the Treasury a penalty of $1,000 for each such disclosure or use, and, if such Person is certified, shall be subject to having such Person's certification revoked.


(b) *Limitation on penalty.* The total amount of the penalty imposed under this part on any Person for any calendar year shall not exceed $250,000, unless such Person's disclosure or use is determined to be willful or intentional. For the purposes of this part, a disclosure or use is willful when it is a “voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty.”


(c) *Disclosure to a Certified Person.* No penalty shall be imposed under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section on a first Certified Person who discloses, to a second Certified Person, Limited Access DMF, where the sole basis for imposition of penalty on such first Certified Person is that such second Certified Person has been determined to be subject to penalty under this part.
