# § 2004.7   What will our response to your FOIA request include?

(a) *In general.* We will notify you in writing of our determination regarding your request. To the extent practicable, we will communicate with you electronically.


(b) *Acknowledgement of requests.* We will acknowledge your request in writing, including a brief description of the records you are seeking, and assign an individualized tracking number. If we think that we will be unable to make a determination on your request within twenty days, we will send an acknowledgment within ten days and we may ask you to clarify your request or arrange for a longer period for processing.


(c) *Granting requests.* If we decide to grant your request in full or in part, our response will include the records we are disclosing unless we have assessed fees under § 2004.9. If your request involves a voluminous amount of material or searches in multiple locations, we may provide interim responses, releasing the records on a rolling basis. If we assessed fees, we will disclose the records promptly upon payment. If you need assistance, you can contact our FOIA Public Liaison at *FOIA@ustr.eop.gov,* or OGIS at *OGIS@nara.gov.*

(d) *Adverse determinations of requests*—(1) *What is an adverse determination?* Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: the requested record is exempt in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing.


(2) *Our response.* If we make an adverse determination denying your request in any respect, our response will include:


(i) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the determination;


(ii) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption(s) we applied;


(iii) An estimate of the volume of any records or information we withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;


(iv) Information about our FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services provided by OGIS; and


(iv) Your right to appeal our decision under § 2004.8.


(3) *Markings on released documents.* If technically feasible, we will clearly mark records that we are disclosing in part to indicate the location and show the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption.
