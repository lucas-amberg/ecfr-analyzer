# ยง 2011.203   Issuance of specialty sugar certificates.

(a) Specialty sugars imported into the United States from specialty sugar source countries may be entered only if such specialty sugars are accompanied by a certificate issued by the Certifying Authority.


(b) A certificate may be issued to an importer who complies with the provisions of this part. The certificate may contain such conditions, limitations or restrictions as the Certifying Authority, in his discretion, deems necessary. The Certifying Authority will issue a certificate if sufficient evidence has been provided to permit the Certifying Authority to make a reasonable determination that the sugar proposed to be imported under the certificate fits the definition of specialty sugars in this subpart. 


(c) Subject to quota availability, an unlimited number of complying shipments may enter under a given certificate and a given certificate may cover more than one type of specialty sugar. Issuance of a certificate does not guarantee the entry of any specific shipment of specialty sugar, but only permits entry of such sugar if the amount allocated to the specialty sugar source country is not already filled.
