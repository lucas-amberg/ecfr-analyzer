# ยง 1.8   Nature, authority, and use of trade regulation rules.

(a) For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Commission is empowered to promulgate trade regulation rules, which define with specificity acts or practices that are unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. Trade regulation rules may include requirements prescribed for the purpose of preventing such acts or practices. A violation of a rule constitutes an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of section 5(a)(1) of that Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1)), unless the Commission otherwise expressly provides in its rule. The respondents in an adjudicative proceeding may show that the alleged conduct does not violate the rule or assert any other defense to which they are legally entitled.


(b) The Commission at any time may conduct such investigations, make such studies, and hold such conferences as it may deem necessary. All or any part of any such investigation may be conducted under the provisions of part 2, subpart A of this chapter.
