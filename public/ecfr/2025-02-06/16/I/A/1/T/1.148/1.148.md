# § 1.148   Stay of proceedings.

(a) *In general.* Review by an Administrative Law Judge or by the Commission under this subpart will not operate as a stay of a final civil sanction of the Authority unless the Administrative Law Judge or the Commission orders such a stay.


(b) *Application for a stay*—(1) *Before the Administrative Law Judge.* A person subject to a final civil sanction imposed by the Authority may apply to the Administrative Law Judge for a stay of all or part of that sanction pending review by the Administrative Law Judge. Any application for a stay is limited to 1,000 words, must be filed concurrently with the application for review of the sanction, and must be served on the Authority in accordance with the provisions of 16 CFR 4.4(b) that are applicable to service in review proceedings under this part. The Authority may file an opposition, limited to 1,000 words, within 7 days of being served with the application for a stay. The Administrative Law Judge must resolve the stay application within 10 days of the date on which the Authority's opposition is due.


(2) *Before the Commission*—(i) *Expedited application for a stay.* The party aggrieved by the sanction and denied a stay by the Administrative Law Judge under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may file an expedited application for a stay with the Commission within 3 days of the Administrative Law Judge's denial. An expedited application for a stay is limited to 1,000 words and must be served on the Authority in accordance with the provisions of 16 CFR 4.4(b) that are applicable to service in review proceedings under this part. The Authority may file an opposition, limited to 1,000 words, within 3 days of service of the expedited application. The application and opposition should address the factors in paragraph (d) of this section the Commission considers in resolving a stay application. The Commission will issue its decision on the stay application as soon as practicable.


(ii) *Application for a stay after the Commission decides to review the Administrative Law Judge's decision.* If the Commission grants the application for review of the decision of the Administrative Law Judge, or orders review of the decision on its own motion, the person subject to the sanction may apply to the Commission for a stay of the sanction pending the Commission's decision. In this circumstance, the aggrieved person may seek a stay of the sanction before the Commission a second time under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) even if the person was previously denied an expedited application for a stay under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. The application for a stay, limited to 1,000 words, must be filed within 7 days of the Commission's order granting the application for review or ordering review under § 1.147(a), and must be served on the Authority in accordance with the provisions of 16 CFR 4.4(b) that are applicable to service in review proceedings under this part. The Authority may file an opposition, limited to 1,000 words, within 7 days of being served with the stay application.


(c) *Content of stay application and opposition.* An application for a stay of the sanction, and any opposition to the application, must provide the reasons a stay is or is not warranted by addressing the factors described in paragraph (d) of this section, and the facts relied upon, and may include supporting affidavits or other sworn statements, and a copy of the relevant portions of the record.


(d) *Factors considered in deciding a stay application.* The parties, the Administrative Law Judge, and the Commission must address the following factors, in advocating for or against, or in resolving, a stay application:


(1) The likelihood of the applicant's success on review;


(2) Whether the applicant will suffer irreparable harm if a stay is not granted;


(3) The degree of injury to other parties or third parties if a stay is granted; and


(4) Whether the stay is in the public interest.
