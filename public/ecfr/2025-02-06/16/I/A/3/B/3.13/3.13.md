# ยง 3.13   Adjudicative hearing on issues arising in rulemaking proceedings under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act.

(a) *Notice of hearing.* When the Commission, acting under ยง 1.26(g) of this chapter, determines that objections which have been filed are sufficient to warrant the holding of an adjudicative hearing in rulemaking proceedings under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, or when the Commission otherwise determines that the holding of such a hearing would be in the public interest, a hearing will be held before an Administrative Law Judge for the purpose of receiving evidence relevant and material to the issues raised by such objections or other issues specified by the Commission. In such case the Commission will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ containing a statement of:


(1) The provisions of the rule or order to which objections have been filed;


(2) The issues raised by the objections or the issues on which the Commission wishes to receive evidence;


(3) The time and place for hearing, the time to be at least thirty (30) days after publication of the notice; and


(4) The time within which, and the conditions under which, any person who petitioned for issuance, amendment, or repeal of the rule or order, or any person who filed objections sufficient to warrant the holding of the hearing, or any other interested person, may file notice of intention to participate in the proceeding.


(b) *Parties.* Any person who petitions for issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule or order, and any person who files objections sufficient to warrant the holding of a hearing, and who files timely notice of intention to participate, shall be regarded as a party and shall be individually served with any pleadings filed in the proceeding. Upon written application to the Administrative Law Judge and a showing of good cause, any interested person may be designated by the Administrative Law Judge as a party.
