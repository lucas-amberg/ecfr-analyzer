# ยง 4.16   Privilege against self-incrimination.

Section 2.11 of Pub. L. 91-462 specifically repeals paragraph 7 of section 9 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Title 18, section 6002, of the United States Code provides that whenever a witness refuses, on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or provide other information in a proceeding before or ancillary to:


(a) A court or grand jury of the United States,


(b) An agency of the United States, or


(c) Either House of Congress, a joint committee of the two Houses, or a committee or a subcommittee of either House, and the person presiding over the proceeding communicates to the witness an order issued under section 6004, the witness may not refuse to comply with the order on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination; but no testimony or other information compelled under the order (or any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or other information) may be used against the witness in any criminal case, except a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or otherwise failing to comply with the order. Title 18, section 6004, of the United States Code provides that: 


(1) In the case of any individual who has been or who may be called to testify or provide other information at any proceeding before an agency of the United States, the agency may, with the approval of the Attorney General, issue, in accordance with subsection (b) of section 6004, an order requiring the individual to give testimony or provide other information which he refused to give or provide on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination, such order to become effective as provided in title 18, section 6002, of the United States Code; 


(2) An agency of the United States may issue an order under subsection (a) of section 6004 only if in its judgment 


(i) The testimony or other information from such individual may be necessary to the public interest; and 


(ii) Such individual has refused or is likely to refuse to testify or provide other information on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination.
