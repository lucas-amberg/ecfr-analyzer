# § 254.1   Definitions.

(a) *Accredited.* A school or program of instruction that has been evaluated and found to meet established criteria by an accrediting agency or association recognized for such purposes by the U.S. Department of Education.


(b) *Approved.* A school or program of instruction that has been recognized by a State or Federal agency as meeting educational standards or other related qualifications as prescribed by that agency for the school or program of instruction to which the term is applied. The term is not and should not be used interchangeably with “Accredited.” The term “Approved” is not justified by the mere grant of a corporate charter to operate or license to do business as a school and should not be used unless the represented “approval” has been affirmatively required or authorized by State or Federal law.


(c) *Industry member.* Industry Members are the persons, firms, corporations, or organizations covered by these Guides, as explained in § 254.0(a).
