# ยง 260.8   Degradable claims.

(a) It is deceptive to misrepresent, directly or by implication, that a product or package is degradable, biodegradable, oxo-degradable, oxo-biodegradable, or photodegradable. The following guidance for degradable claims also applies to biodegradable, oxo-degradable, oxo-biodegradable, and photodegradable claims.


(b) A marketer making an unqualified degradable claim should have competent and reliable scientific evidence that the entire item will completely break down and return to nature (*i.e.,* decompose into elements found in nature) within a reasonably short period of time after customary disposal.


(c) It is deceptive to make an unqualified degradable claim for items entering the solid waste stream if the items do not completely decompose within one year after customary disposal. Unqualified degradable claims for items that are customarily disposed in landfills, incinerators, and recycling facilities are deceptive because these locations do not present conditions in which complete decomposition will occur within one year.


(d) Degradable claims should be qualified clearly and prominently to the extent necessary to avoid deception about:


(1) The product's or package's ability to degrade in the environment where it is customarily disposed; and


(2) The rate and extent of degradation.
