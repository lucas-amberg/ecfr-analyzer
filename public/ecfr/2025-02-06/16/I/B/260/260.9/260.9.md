# ยง 260.9   Free-of claims.

(a) It is deceptive to misrepresent, directly or by implication, that a product, package, or service is free of, or does not contain or use, a substance. Such claims should be clearly and prominently qualified to the extent necessary to avoid deception.


(b) A truthful claim that a product, package, or service is free of, or does not contain or use, a substance may nevertheless be deceptive if:


(1) The product, package, or service contains or uses substances that pose the same or similar environmental risks as the substance that is not present; or


(2) The substance has not been associated with the product category.


(c) Depending on the context, a free-of or does-not-contain claim is appropriate even for a product, package, or service that contains or uses a trace amount of a substance if:


(1) The level of the specified substance is no more than that which would be found as an acknowledged trace contaminant or background level 
47;


(2) The substance's presence does not cause material harm that consumers typically associate with that substance; and


(3) The substance has not been added intentionally to the product.
