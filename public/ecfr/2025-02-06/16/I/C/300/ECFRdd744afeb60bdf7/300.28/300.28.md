# § 300.28   Undetermined quantities of reclaimed fibers.

(a) Where a wool product is composed in part of various man-made fibers recovered from textile products containing underdetermined qualities of such fibers, the percentage content of the respective fibers recovered from such products may be disclosed on the required stamp, tag, or label, in aggregate form as “man-made fibers” followed by the naming of such fibers in the order of their predominance by weight, as for example:


(b) Where a wool product is composed in part of wool, or recycled wool and in part of unknown and, for practical purposes, undeterminable non-woolen fibers reclaimed from any spun, woven, knitted, felted, braided, bonded or otherwise manufactured or used product, the required fiber content disclosure may, when truthfully applicable, in lieu of the fiber content disclosure otherwise required by the Act and regulations, set forth (1) the percentages of wool or recycled wool, and (2) the generic names and the percentages of all other fibers whose presence is known or practically ascertainable and (3) the percentage of the unknown and undeterminable reclaimed fibers, designating such reclaimed fibers as “unknown reclaimed fibers” or “undetermined reclaimed fibers,” as for example:


(c) The terms *unknown recycled fibers* and *undetermined recycled fibers* may be used in describing the unknown and undeterminable reclaimed fibers referred to in paragraph (b) of this rule in lieu of the terms specified therein, provided, however, That the same standard is used in determining the applicability of the term *recycled* as is used in defining “recycled wool” in section 2(c) of the Act.


(d) For purposes of this rule undetermined or unascertained amounts of wool or recycled wool may be classified and designated as recycled wool.


(e) Nothing contained in this rule shall excuse a full and accurate disclosure of fiber content with correct percentages if the same is known or practically ascertainable, or permit a deviation from the requirements of section 4(a)(2)(A) of the Act with respect to products not labeled under the provisions of this rule or permit a higher classification of wool or recycled wool than that provided by Section 2 of the Act.
