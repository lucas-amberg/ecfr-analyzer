The required records, other than the permanent marking or label on the electric vehicle fuel dispensing system, may be kept at the retail outlet or at a reasonably close location. The records, including the permanent marking or label on each electric vehicle fuel dispensing system, must be available for inspection by Federal Trade Commission staff members or by persons authorized by FTC.
