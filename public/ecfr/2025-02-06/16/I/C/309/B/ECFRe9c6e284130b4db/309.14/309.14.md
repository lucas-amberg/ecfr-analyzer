You must keep for one year any delivery tickets, letters of certification, or other paper on which you based your fuel rating certifications for non-liquid alternative vehicle fuels (other than electricity) and for electric vehicle fuel dispensing systems. You also must keep for one year records of any fuel rating determinations you made according to ยง 309.10.
