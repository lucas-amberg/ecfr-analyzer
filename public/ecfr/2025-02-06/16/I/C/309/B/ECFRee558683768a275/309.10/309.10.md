# § 309.10   Alternative vehicle fuel rating.

(a) If you are an importer, producer, or refiner of non-liquid alternative vehicle fuel (other than electricity), you must determine the fuel rating of all non-liquid alternative vehicle fuel (other than electricity) before you transfer it. You can do that yourself or through a testing lab. To determine fuel ratings, you must possess a reasonable basis, consisting of competent and reliable evidence, for the minimum percentage of the principal component of the non-liquid alternative vehicle fuel (other than electricity) that you must disclose, and for the minimum percentages of other components that you choose to disclose. For the purposes of this section, fuel ratings for the minimum percentage of the principal component of compressed natural gas are to be determined in accordance with test methods set forth in American Society for Testing and Materials (“ASTM”) D 1945-91, “Standard Test Method for Analysis of Natural Gas by Gas Chromatography.” For the purposes of this section, fuel ratings for the minimum percentage of the principal component of hydrogen gas are to be determined in accordance with test methods set forth in ASTM D 1946-90, “Standard Practice for Analysis of Reformed Gas by Gas Chromatography.” This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies of D 1945-91 and D 1946-90 may be obtained from the American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103, or may be inspected at the Federal Trade Commission, Public Reference Room, room 130, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC, or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

(b) If you are a manufacturer of electric vehicle fuel dispensing systems, you must determine the fuel rating of the electric charge delivered by the electric vehicle fuel dispensing system before you transfer such systems. To determine the fuel rating of the electric vehicle fuel dispensing system, you must possess a reasonable basis, consisting of competent and reliable evidence, for the following output information you must disclose: kilowatt (“kW”) capacity, voltage, whether the voltage is alternating current (“ac”) or direct current (“dc”), amperage, and whether the system is conductive or inductive.
