(b) A seller or telemarketer may keep the records required by paragraph (a) of this section in the same manner, format, or place as they keep such records in the ordinary course of business. The format for records required by paragraph (a)(2)(vii) of this section, and any other records that include a time or telephone number, must also comply with the following:


(1) The format for domestic telephone numbers must comport with the North American Numbering plan;


(2) The format for international telephone numbers must comport with the standard established in the International Telecommunications Union's Recommendation ITU-T E.164: Series E: Overall Network Operation, Telephone Service, Service Operation and Human Factors, published 11/2010 (incorporated by reference, see paragraph (g)(1) of this section);

(4) Time must be recorded in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).


(c) Failure to keep each record required by paragraph (a) of this section in a complete and accurate manner, and in compliance with paragraph (b) of this section, as applicable, is a violation of this part.


(d) For records kept pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the seller or telemarketer will not be liable for failure to keep complete and accurate records pursuant to this part if it can demonstrate, with documentation, that as part of its routine business practice:


(1) It has established and implemented procedures to ensure completeness and accuracy of its records;


(2) It has trained its personnel, and any entity assisting it in its compliance, in such procedures;


(3) It monitors compliance with and enforces such procedures, and maintains records documenting such monitoring and enforcement; and


(4) Any failure to keep complete and accurate records was temporary, due to inadvertent error, and corrected within 30 days of discovery.


(e) The seller and the telemarketer calling on behalf of the seller may, by written agreement, allocate responsibility between themselves for the recordkeeping required by this section. When a seller and telemarketer have entered into such an agreement, the terms of that agreement will govern, and the seller or telemarketer, as the case may be, need not keep records that duplicate those of the other. If by written agreement the telemarketer bears the responsibility for the recordkeeping requirements of this section, the seller must establish and implement practices and procedures to ensure the telemarketer is complying with the requirements of this section. These practices and procedures include retaining access to any record the telemarketer creates under this section on the seller's behalf. If the agreement is unclear as to who must maintain any required record(s), or if no such agreement exists, both the telemarketer and the seller are responsible for complying with this section.


(f) In the event of any dissolution or termination of the seller's or telemarketer's business, the principal of that seller or telemarketer must maintain all records required under this section. In the event of any sale, assignment, or other change in ownership of the seller's or telemarketer's business, the successor business must maintain all records required under this section.
