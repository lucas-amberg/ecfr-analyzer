# § 425.2   Definitions.

*Billing Information* means any data that enables any person to access a consumer's account, such as a credit card, checking, savings, share or similar account, utility bill, mortgage loan account, or debit card.


*Charge, Charged,* or *Charging* means any attempt to collect money or other consideration from a consumer, including but not limited to causing Billing Information to be submitted for payment, including against the consumer's credit card, debit card, bank account, telephone bill, or other account.


*Clear and Conspicuous* means that a required disclosure is easily noticeable (*i.e.,* difficult to miss) and easily understandable by ordinary consumers, including in all of the following ways:


(1) In any communication that is solely visual or solely audible, the disclosure must be made through the same means through which the communication is presented. In any communication made through both visual and audible means, such as a television advertisement, the disclosure must be presented simultaneously in both the visual and audible portions of the communication even if the representation requiring the disclosure is made in only one means.


(2) A visual disclosure, by its size, contrast, location, the length of time it appears, and other characteristics, must stand out from any accompanying text or other visual elements so that it is easily noticed, read, and understood.


(3) An audible disclosure, including by telephone or streaming video, must be delivered in a volume, speed, and cadence sufficient for ordinary consumers to easily hear and understand it.


(4) In any communication using an Interactive Electronic Medium, such as the internet, mobile application, or software, the disclosure must be unavoidable.


(5) The disclosure must use diction and syntax understandable to ordinary consumers and must appear in each language in which the representation that requires the disclosure appears.


(6) The disclosure must comply with these requirements in each medium through which it is received, including all electronic devices and face-to-face communications.


(7) The disclosure must not be contradicted or mitigated by, or inconsistent with, anything else in the communication.


(8) When the representation or sales practice targets a specific audience, such as children, older adults, or the terminally ill, “ordinary consumers” includes members of that group.


*Interactive Electronic Medium* is any electronic means of communicating (except via telephone calls), including internet, mobile application, text, chat, instant message, email, software, or any online service.


*Material* means likely to affect a person's choice of, or conduct regarding, goods or services.


*Negative Option Feature* is a provision of a contract under which the consumer's silence or failure to take affirmative action to reject a good or service or to cancel the agreement is interpreted by the negative option seller as acceptance or continuing acceptance of the offer, including, but not limited to:


(1) An automatic renewal;


(2) A continuity plan;


(3) A free-to-pay conversion or fee-to-pay conversion; or


(4) A pre-notification negative option plan.
