# § 432.4   Optional disclosures.

Other operating characteristics and technical specifications not required in § 432.2 may be disclosed. *Provided,* that:


(a) Any other power output is rated by the manufacturer, expressed in minimum watts per channel, and clearly and conspicuously labeled “This rating was not tested under the FTC standard” without the use of a footnote, asterisk, or similar notation to make the representation;


(b) All disclosures or representations made under this section are less conspicuously and prominently made than any rated power output disclosure required in § 432.2. Any disclosure or representation bold faced or more than two-thirds the height of any rated power output disclosure required in § 432.2 is not less prominent; and


(c) The rating and testing methods or standards used in determining such representations are well known and generally recognized by the industry at the time the representations or disclosures are made, are neither intended nor likely to deceive or confuse consumers, and are not otherwise likely to frustrate the purpose of this part.
