# ยง 456.2   Separation of examination and dispensing.

It is an unfair act or practice for an ophthalmologist or optometrist to:


(a)(1) Fail to provide to the patient one copy of the patient's prescription immediately after the refractive eye examination is completed and before offering to sell the patient ophthalmic goods, whether or not the prescription is requested by the patient. Such prescription shall be provided:


(i) On paper; or


(ii) In a digital format that can be accessed, downloaded, and printed by the patient, after obtaining verifiable affirmative consent, pursuant to ยง 456.3.


(2) Provided: An ophthalmologist or optometrist may refuse to give the patient a copy of the patient's prescription until the patient has paid for the refractive eye examination, but only if that ophthalmologist or optometrist would have required immediate payment from that patient had the examination revealed that no ophthalmic goods were required. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the presentation of proof of insurance coverage for that service shall be deemed to be a payment;


(b) Condition the availability of a refractive eye examination to any person on a requirement that the patient agree to purchase any ophthalmic goods from the ophthalmologist or optometrist;


(c) Charge the patient any fee in addition to the ophthalmologist's or optometrist's refractive eye examination fee as a condition to releasing the prescription to the patient. Provided: An ophthalmologist or optometrist may charge an additional fee for verifying ophthalmic goods dispensed by another seller when the additional fee is imposed at the time the verification is performed; or


(d) Place on the prescription, or require the patient to sign, or deliver to the patient a form or notice waiving or disclaiming the liability or responsibility of the ophthalmologist or optometrist for the accuracy of the refractive eye examination or the accuracy of the ophthalmic goods and services dispensed by another seller.
