# § 703.2   Duties of warrantor.

(a) The warrantor shall not incorporate into the terms of a written warranty a Mechanism that fails to comply with the requirements contained in §§ 703.3 through 703.8 of this part. This paragraph (a) shall not prohibit a warrantor from incorporating into the terms of a written warranty the step-by-step procedure which the consumer should take in order to obtain performance of any obligation under the warranty as described in section 102(a)(7) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 2302(a)(7), and required by part 701 of this subchapter.


(b) The warrantor shall disclose clearly and conspicuously at least the following information on the face of the written warranty:


(1) A statement of the availability of the informal dispute settlement mechanism;


(2) The name and address of the Mechanism, or the name and a telephone number of the Mechanism which consumers may use without charge;


(3) A statement of any requirement that the consumer resort to the Mechanism before exercising rights or seeking remedies created by Title I of the Act; together with the disclosure that if a consumer chooses to seek redress by pursuing rights and remedies not created by Title I of the Act, resort to the Mechanism would not be required by any provision of the Act; and


(4) A statement, if applicable, indicating where further information on the Mechanism can be found in materials accompanying the product, as provided in § 703.2(c) of this section.


(c) The warrantor shall include in the written warranty or in a separate section of materials accompanying the product, the following information:


(1) Either 


(i) A form addressed to the Mechanism containing spaces requesting the information which the Mechanism may require for prompt resolution of warranty disputes; or 


(ii) A telephone number of the Mechanism which consumers may use without charge;


(2) The name and address of the Mechanism;


(3) A brief description of Mechanism procedures;


(4) The time limits adhered to by the Mechanism; and


(5) The types of information which the Mechanism may require for prompt resolution of warranty disputes.


(d) The warrantor shall take steps reasonably calculated to make consumers aware of the Mechanism's existence at the time consumers experience warranty disputes. Nothing contained in paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section shall limit the warrantor's option to encourage consumers to seek redress directly from the warrantor as long as the warrantor does not expressly require consumers to seek redress directly from the warrantor. The warrantor shall proceed fairly and expeditiously to attempt to resolve all disputes submitted directly to the warrantor.


(e) Whenever a dispute is submitted directly to the warrantor, the warrantor shall, within a reasonable time, decide whether, and to what extent, it will satisfy the consumer, and inform the consumer of its decision. In its notification to the consumer of its decision, the warrantor shall include the information required in § 703.2 (b) and (c) of this section.


(f) The warrantor shall:


(1) Respond fully and promptly to reasonable requests by the Mechanism for information relating to disputes;


(2) Upon notification of any decision of the Mechanism that would require action on the part of the warrantor, immediately notify the Mechanism whether, and to what extent, warrantor will abide by the decision; and


(3) Perform any obligations it has agreed to.


(g) The warrantor shall act in good faith in determining whether, and to what extent, it will abide by a Mechanism decision.


(h) The warrantor shall comply with any reasonable requirements imposed by the Mechanism to fairly and expeditiously resolve warranty disputes.
