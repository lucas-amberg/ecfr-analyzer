# § 801.10   Value of voting securities, non-corporate interests and assets to be acquired.

Except as provided in § 801.13, the value of voting securities and assets to be acquired shall be determined as follows:


(a) *Voting securities.* (1) If the security is traded on a national securities exchange or is authorized to be quoted in an interdealer quotation system of a national securities association registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission—


(i) And the acquisition price has been determined, the value shall be the market price or the acquisition price, whichever is greater; or if


(ii) The acquisition price has not been determined, the value shall be the market price.


(2) If paragraph (a)(1) of this section is inapplicable—


(i) But the acquisition price has been determined, the value shall be the acquisition price; or if


(ii) The acquisition price has not been determined, the value shall be the fair market value.


(b) *Assets.* The value of assets to be acquired shall be the fair market value of the assets, or, if determined and greater than the fair market value, the acquisition price.


(c) For purposes of this section and § 801.13(a)(2):


(1) *Market price.* (i) For acquisitions subject to § 801.30, the market price shall be the lowest closing quotation, or, in an interdealer quotation system, the lowest closing bid price, within the 45 calendar days prior to the receipt of the notice required by § 803.5(a) or prior to the consummation of the acquisition.


(ii) For acquisitions not subject to § 801.30, the market price shall be the lowest closing quotation, or, in an interdealer quotation system, the lowest closing bid price, within the 45 or fewer calendar days which are prior to the consummation of the acquisition but not earlier than the day prior to the execution of the contract, agreement in principle or letter of intent to merge or acquire.


(iii) When the security was not traded within the period specified by this paragraph, the last closing quotation or closing bid price preceding such period shall be used. If such closing quotations are available in more than one market, the person filing notification may select any such quotation.


(2) *Acquisition price.* The acquisition price shall include the value of all consideration for such voting securities, non-corporate interests or assets to be acquired.


(3) *Fair market value.* The fair market value shall be determined in good faith by the board of directors of the ultimate parent entity included within the acquiring person, or, if unincorporated, by officials exercising similar functions; or by an entity delegated that function by such board or officials. Such determination must be made as of any day within 60 calendar days prior to the filing of the notification required by the act, or, if such notification has not been filed, within 60 calendar days prior to the consummation of the acquisition.


(d) *Value of interests in an unincorporated entity.* In an acquisition of non-corporate interests that confers control of either an existing or a newly-formed unincorporated entity, the value of the non-corporate interests held as a result of the acquisition is the sum of the acquisition price of the interests to be acquired (provided the acquisition price has been determined), and the fair market value of any of the interests in the same unincorporated entity held by the acquiring person prior to the acquisition; or, if the acquisition price has not been determined, the fair market value of interests held as a result of the acquisition.
