# § 910.2   Unfair methods of competition.

(a) *Unfair methods of competition*—(1) *Workers other than senior executives.* With respect to a worker other than a senior executive, it is an unfair method of competition for a person:


(i) To enter into or attempt to enter into a non-compete clause;


(ii) To enforce or attempt to enforce a non-compete clause; or


(iii) To represent that the worker is subject to a non-compete clause.


(2) *Senior executives.* With respect to a senior executive, it is an unfair method of competition for a person:


(i) To enter into or attempt to enter into a non-compete clause;


(ii) To enforce or attempt to enforce a non-compete clause entered into after the effective date; or


(iii) To represent that the senior executive is subject to a non-compete clause, where the non-compete clause was entered into after the effective date.


(b) *Notice requirement for existing non-compete clauses*—(1) *Notice required.* For each existing non-compete clause that it is an unfair method of competition to enforce or attempt to enforce under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the person who entered into the non-compete clause with the worker must provide clear and conspicuous notice to the worker by the effective date that the worker's non-compete clause will not be, and cannot legally be, enforced against the worker.


(2) *Form of notice.* The notice to the worker required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section must:


(i) Identify the person who entered into the non-compete clause with the worker;


(ii) Be on paper delivered by hand to the worker, or by mail at the worker's last known personal street address, or by email at an email address belonging to the worker, including the worker's current work email address or last known personal email address, or by text message at a mobile telephone number belonging to the worker.


(3) *Exception.* If a person that is required to provide notice under paragraph (b)(1) of this section has no record of a street address, email address, or mobile telephone number, such person is exempt from the notice requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to such worker.


(4) *Model language.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the following model language constitutes notice to the worker that the worker's non-compete clause cannot legally be enforced and will not be enforced against the worker.



(5) *Safe harbor.* A person complies with the requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the person provides notice to a worker pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section.


(6) *Optional notice in additional languages.* In addition to providing the notice required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section in English, a person is permitted to provide such notice in a language (or in languages) other than English or to include internet links to translations in additional languages. If providing optional notice under this paragraph (b)(6), a person may use any Commission-provided translation of the model language in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
