(a) Availability of transcripts, recordings or minutes. The Agency shall make available to the public the transcript, recording or minutes of Commission meetings. However, unless the Commission finds that the public interest requires otherwise, any portion of the transcript, recording or minutes of a closed Commission meeting which is determined to contain information which may properly be withheld from the public on the basis of paragraphs (b) (1) through (10) of ยง 1013.4 need not be made available to the public.


(b) Procedures for making available transcripts, recordings or meeting minutes. Meeting records will be made available for inspection, or copies will be furnished, as requested, in accordance with the following procedures.


(1) *Requests.* Requests for inspection or copies shall be in writing addressed to the Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, D.C. 20207. A request must reasonably describe the Commission meeting, or portion thereof, including the date and subject matter or any other information which may help to identify the requested material.


(2) *Responses to requests.* The responsibility for responding to requests for meeting records is vested in the Secretary of the Commission. In any case where the Secretary or his or her designee, in his or her discretion, determines that a request for an identifiable meeting record should be initially determined by the Commission, the Secretary or his or her designee may certify the matter to the Commission for decision. In that event, the Commission decision shall be made within the time limits set forth in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section and shall be final.


(3) *Time limitations on responses to requests.* The Secretary or his or her designee shall respond to all written requests for copies of meeting records within ten (10) working days. The time limitations on responses to requests shall begin to run as of the time a request for records is received and date stamped by the Office of the Secretary.


(4) *Responses. Form and content.* When a requested meeting record has been identified and is available for disclosure the requester shall either be informed as to where and when the records will be made available for inspection or be supplied with a copy. A response denying a written request for a meeting record of a closed Commission meeting shall be in writing signed by the Secretary and shall include:


(i) A reference to the specific exemptions under the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. 552b(c)) authorizing the denial; and


(ii) A statement that the denial may be appealed to the Commission pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section.


(5) *Appeals to the Commissioners.* (i) When the Secretary or his or her designee has denied a request for records in whole or in part, the requester may, within 30 days of its receipt, appeal the denial to the Commissioners of the Consumer Product Safety Commission by writing to the attention of the Chairman, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, D.C. 20207.


(ii) The Commission will act upon an appeal within 20 working days of its receipt. The time limitations on an appeal begin to run as of the time an appeal is received by the Office of the Chairman and date stamped.


(iii) The Commission's action on appeal shall be in writing, signed by the Chairman of the Commission if the appeal is denied and shall identify the Commissioners who voted for a denial. A denial in whole or in part of a request on appeal for records of a closed meeting shall set forth the exemption relied on and a brief explanation (without disclosing exempt information) of how the exemption applies to the records withheld. A denial in whole or in part shall also inform the requester of his or her right to seek judicial review as specified in 5 U.S.C. 552b(h).


(6) *Fees.* (i) Fees shall be charged for copies of transcriptions of recording or minutes in accordance with the schedule contained in paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section.


(ii) There shall be no fee charged for services rendered in connection with production or disclosure of meeting records unless the charges, calculated according to the schedule below, exceed the sum of $25.00. Where the charges are calculated to be an amount in excess of $25.00, the fee charged shall be the difference between $25.00 and the calculated charges.


(iii) The schedule of charges for furnishing copies of meeting records is as follows:


(A) Reproduction, duplication or copying of transcripts or minutes: 10 cents per page.
