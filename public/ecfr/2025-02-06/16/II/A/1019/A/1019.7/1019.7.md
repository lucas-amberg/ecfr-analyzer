# ยง 1019.7   Commission notification of foreign governments.

After receiving notification from the exporter, or any changes in notification, the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance shall inform on a priority basis the appropriate government agency of the country to which the noncomplying goods are to be sent of the exportation and the basis on which the goods are banned or fail to comply with Commission standards, regulations, or statutes, and shall send all information supplied by the exporter in accordance with ยง 1019.4(d). The Assistant Executive Director shall also enclose any information supplied in accordance with ยง 1019.4(e), but he or she may also state that the Commission disagrees with or takes no position on its content, including its relevance or accuracy. The Assistant Executive Director shall take whatever other action is necessary to provide full information to foreign countries and shall also work with and inform the U.S. State Department and foreign embassies and international organizations, as appropriate. The Assistant Executive Director shall also seek acknowledgment of the notification from the foreign government. Foreign governments intending to prohibit entry of goods that are the subject of a notification from the Commission should initiate action to prevent such entry and should notify the exporter directly of that intent.
