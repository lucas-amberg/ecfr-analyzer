# § 1019.31   Purpose and scope.

(a) This subpart B of this part 1019 states the policy of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and its interpretation of the Consumer Product Safety Act and the Federal Hazardous Substances Act with regard to exportation of products which have been sold, offered for sale, or distributed in commerce for use in the United States which:


(1) Fail to comply with an applicable consumer product safety standard or banning rule issued under provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2051 *et seq.*); or


(2) Are “misbranded hazardous substances” or “banned hazardous substances” as those terms are used in the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261 *et seq.*).


(b) The policy expressed in this subpart B of part 1019 does not apply to any of the following products:


(1) Products which could be regulated only under provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act but which are not subject to a consumer product safety standard or banning rule issued under that Act.


(2) Consumer products which are subject to and fail to comply with an applicable standard or banning rule issued under provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act but which have never been distributed in commerce for use in the United States. See section 18(b) of the Consumer Product Safety Act 15, U.S.C. 2067(b), and subpart A of this part 1019 for requirements governing export of such products.)


(3) Products which could be regulated under one or more sections of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act but which are neither “misbranded hazardous substances” nor “banned hazardous substances” as those terms are used in the Act. 


(4) Products which are “misbranded hazardous substances” or “banned hazardous substances” as those terms are used in the Federal Hazardous Substances Act but which have never been sold or offered for sale in domestic commerce. (See sections 5(b) and 14(d) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1264(b) and 1273(d) and subpart A of this part 1019 for requirements governing export of such products.)


(5) Products for which the Commission has granted an exemption from an applicable standard, ban, or labeling requirement under the CPSA, FHSA, or FFA, in accordance with provisions of 16 CFR 1009.9. (These products remain subject to the notification requirements of subpart A of this part 1019.)


(6) Products which fail to comply with an applicable standard of flammability issued under provisions of the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. 1191 *et seq.*). The Commission's policy regarding export of such products is set forth in the Commission's Memorandum Decision and Order *In the Matter of Imperial Carpet Mills, Inc.,* CPSC Docket No. 80-2, July 7, 1983, and allows export without regard to whether the products have been distributed in domestic commerce. (See section 15 of the Flammable Fabrics Act, 15 U.S.C. 1202, and subpart A of this part 1019 for requirements governing export of such products.)
