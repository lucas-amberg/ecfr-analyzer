# § 1051.9   Factors the Commission considers in granting or denying petitions.

(a) The major factors the Commission considers in deciding whether to grant or deny a petition regarding a product include the following items:


(1) Whether the product involved presents an unreasonable risk of injury.


(2) Whether a rule is reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce the risk of injury.


(3) Whether failure of the Commission to initiate the rulemaking proceeding requested would unreasonably expose the petitioner or other consumers to the risk of injury which the petitioner alleges is presented by the product.


(4) Whether, in the case of a petition to declare a consumer product a “banned hazardous product” under section 8 of the CPSA, the product is being or will be distributed in commerce and whether a feasible consumer product safety standard would adequately protect the public from the unreasonable risk of injury associated with such product.


(b) In considering these factors, the Commission will treat as an important component of each one the relative priority of the risk of injury associated with the product about which the petition has been filed and the Commission's resources available for rulemaking activities with respect to that risk of injury. The CPSC Policy on Establishing Priorities for Commission Action, 16 CFR 1009.8, sets forth the criteria upon which Commission priorities are based.
