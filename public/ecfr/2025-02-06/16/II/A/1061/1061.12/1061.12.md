# ยง 1061.12   Commission consideration on merits.

(a) If the Commission proposes to grant an application for exemption it will, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, publish a notice of that fact in the _Federal Register,_ including a proposed exemption regulation, and provide an opportunity for written and oral comments on the proposed exemption by any interested party.


(b) The Commission will evaluate all timely written and oral submissions received from interested parties, as well as any other available and relevant information on the proposal.


(c) The Commission's evaluation will focus on:


(1) Whether the State or local requirement provides a significantly higher degree of protection than the Commission statute or regulation from the risk of injury or illness that they both address.


(2) Whether the State or local requirement would unduly burden interstate commerce if the grant of the exemption from preemption allows it to go into effect. The Commission will evaluate these factors in accordance with the Commission's statutory preemption provisions and their legislative history.


(3) Whether compliance with the State or local requirements would not cause the product to be in violation of the applicable Commission statute, standard, or regulation.


(d) If, after evaluating the record, the Commission determines to grant an exemption, it will publish a final exemption regulation, including the findings required by the statutory preemption provisions, in the _Federal Register._

(e) If the Commission denies an application, whether or not published for comment, it will publish its reasons for doing so in the _Federal Register._
