# ยง 1061.3   Statutory considerations.

(a) The Commission's statutory preemption provisions provide, generally, that whenever consumer products are subject to certain Commission statutes, standards, or regulations, a State or local requirement applicable to the same product is preempted, i.e., superseded and made unenforceable, if both are designed to protect against the same risk of injury or illness, unless the State or local requirement is identical to the Commission's statutory requirement, standard, or regulation. A State or local requirement is not preempted if the product it is applicable to is for the State or local government's own use and the requirement provides a higher degree of protection than the Commission's statutory requirement, standard, or regulation.


(b) The Commission's statutory preemption provisions provide, generally, that if a State or local government wants to enforce its own requirement that is preempted, the State or local government must seek an exemption from the Commission before any such enforcement. The Commission may, by regulation, exempt a State or local requirement from preemption if it finds that the State or local requirement affords a significantly higher degree of protection than the Commission's statute, standard, or regulation, and that it does not unduly burden interstate commerce. Such findings must be included in any exemption regulation.
