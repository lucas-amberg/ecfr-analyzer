# § 1101.34   Reasonable steps to assure information release is “reasonably related to effectuating the purposes of the Acts” the Commission administers.

(a) The steps set forth below are the steps the Commission has determined are reasonable to take to assure that the disclosure of information to the public effectuates the purposes of the Acts it administers.


(1) *Purposes of the CPSA.* The Commission will review information to determine whether disclosure would be reasonably related to effectuating one or more of the specific purposes of the CPSA, as set forth in sections 2(b) and 5, 15 U.S.C. 2051(b) and 2054.


(2) *Purposes of the FHSA, FFA, PPPA and RSA.* The Commission will also review information concerning products subject to the transferred acts it administers and to the Commission's specific functions under those acts to determine whether disclosure of information would be reasonably related to effectuating the purposes of those acts.


(3) *Purposes of the FOIA.* FOIA requests will be reviewed to determine whether disclosure of the information is reasonably related to effectuating one or more of the purposes of the acts administered by the Commission. In the event of a close question on this issue, the Commission will defer to the purposes of the FOIA. The FOIA establishes a general right of the public to have access to information in the Commission's possession, particularly information that reveals whether the Commission is meeting its statutory responsibilities or information upon which the Commission bases a decision that affects the public health and safety.


(b) In reviewing proposed information disclosures, the Commission will consider disclosing the material on the basis of whether release of the information, when taken as a whole, was prepared or is maintained in the course of or to support an activity of the Commission designed to accomplish one or more of the statutory purposes.
