# ยง 1112.39   What records should a third party conformity assessment body retain regarding an audit?

A third party conformity assessment body must retain all records related to an audit that it receives from an accreditation body regarding a reassessment and all records pertaining to the third party conformity assessment body's resolution of, or plans for, resolving nonconformities identified through a reassessment by an accreditation body or through an examination by the CPSC. A third party conformity assessment body also must retain such records related to the last three reassessments (or however many reassessments have been conducted, if the third party conformity assessment body has been reassessed less than three times) and make such records available to the CPSC, upon request.
