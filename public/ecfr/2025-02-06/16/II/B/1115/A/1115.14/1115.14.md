# ยง 1115.14   Time computations.

(a) *General.* Weekends and holidays are excluded from the computation of the time periods in this part.


(b) *Imputing knowledge.* In evaluating whether or when a firm should have reported, the Commission shall impute to the subject firm knowledge of product safety related information received by an official or employee of a subject firm capable of appreciating the significance of the information. Under ordinary circumstances, 5 days should be the maximum reasonable time for information to reach the Chief Executive Officer or the official or employee responsible for complying with the reporting requirements of section 15(b) of the CPSA. The Commission will impute knowledge possessed by the Chief Executive Officer or by the official or employee responsible for complying with the reporting requirements of section 15(b) of the CPSA simultaneously to the subject firm.


(c) *Time when obligation to report arises.* The obligation to report under section 15(b) of the CPSA may arise upon receipt by a subject firm of the first information regarding a noncompliance, or a potential hazard presented by a product defect, or an unreasonable risk. Information giving rise to a reporting obligation may include, but is not limited to, complaints, injury reports, quality control and engineering data. A subject firm should not await complete or accurate risk estimates before reporting under section 15(b) of CPSA. However, if information is not clearly reportable, a subject firm may spend a reasonable time for investigation and evaluation. (See ยง 1115.14(d).)


(d) *Time for investigation and evaluation.* A subject firm may conduct a reasonably expeditious investigation in order to evaluate the reportability of a death or grievous bodily injury or other information. This investigation and evaluation should not exceed 10 days unless a firm can demonstrate that a longer period is reasonable. The Commission will deem that, at the end of 10 days, a subject firm has received and considered all information which would have been available to it had a reasonable, expeditious, and diligent investigation been undertaken.


(e) *Time to report.* Immediately, that is, within 24 hours, after a subject firm has obtained information which reasonably supports the conclusion that its consumer product fails to comply with an applicable consumer product safety rule or voluntary consumer product safety standard, contains a defect which could create a substantial risk of injury to the public, or creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death, the firm should report. (See ยง 1115.13.) If a firm elects to conduct an investigation in order to evaluate the existence of reportable information, the 24-hour period begins when the firm has information which reasonably supports the conclusion that its consumer product fails to comply with an applicable consumer product safety rule or voluntary consumer product safety standard upon which the Commission has relied under section 9, contains a defect which could create a substantial product hazard, or creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death. Thus, a firm could report to the Commission before the conclusion of a reasonably expeditious investigation and evaluation if the reportable information becomes known during the course of the investigation. In lieu of the investigation, the firm may report the information immediately.
