# ยง 1117.3   Reportable information.

A subject firm shall report any information it obtains which reasonably supports the conclusion that a reportable incident occurred. Generally, firms should report any information provided to the company, orally or in writing, which states that a child choked on a marble, small ball, latex balloon, or on a marble, small ball, latex balloon or other small part contained in a toy or game *and,* as a result of that incident the child died, suffered serious injury, ceased breathing for any length of time, or was treated by a medical professional. Subject firms must not wait until they have investigated the incident or conclusively resolved whether the information is accurate or whether their product was involved in the incident. Firms shall not wait to determine conclusively the cause of the death, injury, cessation of breathing or necessity for treatment. An allegation that such a result followed the choking incident is sufficient to require a report.
