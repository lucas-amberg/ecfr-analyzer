(1) The degree and nature of the risk of injury the rule is designed to eliminate or reduce;


(2) The approximate number of consumer products, or types or classes thereof, subject to such rule;


(3) The need of the public for the consumer products subject to such rule, and the probable effect of such rule, upon the utility, cost, or availability of such products to meet such need; and


(4) Any means of achieving the objective of the order while minimizing adverse effects on competition or disruption or dislocation of manufacturing and other commercial practices consistent with the public health and safety


(b) The CPSA, 15 U.S.C. 2058(f)(3), also requires the Commission to make the following findings before it promulgates a rule, and to include such findings in the rule:


(1) That the rule (including its effective date) is reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce an unreasonable risk of injury associated with such product;


(2) That the promulgation of the rule is in the public interest;


(3) That the benefits expected from the rule bear a reasonable relationship to its costs; and


(4) That the rule imposes the least burdensome requirement that prevents or adequately reduces the risk of injury for which the rule is being promulgated.


(c) The required findings are included as appendix A to this part 1212.
