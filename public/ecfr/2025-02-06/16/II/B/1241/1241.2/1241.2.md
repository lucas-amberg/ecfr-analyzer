(i) 6.2.3.5 The test mattress sheet shall be placed on the mattress such that each sheet edge is wrapped fully around and under the mattress.


(ii) 6.2.3.6 Repeat step 6.2.3.2. Then measure the shortest gap between the mattress and the projected crib corner after the dimensions of the mattress have been recorded. The projected crib corner is located 53 in. ± 
1/8 in. (1346 mm ± 3.2 mm) from Wall C and 28
5/8 in. ± 
1/8 in. (727 mm ± 3.2 mm) from Wall D, as shown in Fig. 2. The mattress shall not be moved during measurement. This shall be the corner gap measurement.


(iii) 6.2.3.7 Rotate the mattress 180° such that the opposing corner is adjacent to Walls C and D, then repeat 6.2.3.6.


(13) Instead of complying with section 6.2.2 of ASTM F2933-21, comply with the following:


(i) 6.2.2 *Test Equipment-Mattress Sheet:*

(ii) 6.2.2.1 The mattress sheet shall be 100% cotton and fitted for the mattress to be tested.


(iii) 6.2.2.2 The mattress sheet shall be washed in hot water (50 °C [122 °F] or higher) and dried a minimum of two times on the highest setting using household textile laundering units. This shall be the test mattress sheet.


(14) Add the following paragraphs as section 6.3 of ASTM F2933-21.


(i) 6.3 Mattress Firmness.


(ii) 6.3.1 *Test Fixture:*

(iii) 6.3.1.1 The fixture, as shown in Fig. 3, shall be a rigid, robust object with a round footprint of diameter 203 mm ± 1 mm, and an overall mass of 5200 g ± 20 g. The lower edge of the fixture shall have a radius not larger than 1 mm. Overhanging the footprint by 40 mm ± 2 mm shall be a flexible, flat bar of width 12 mm ± 0.2 mm with square-cut ends. This bar may be fashioned from a shortened hacksaw blade. The bar shall rest parallel to the bottom surface of the fixture and shall be positioned at a height of 15 mm ± 0.2 mm above the bottom surface of the fixture. The bar shall lay directly over a radial axis of the footprint (*i.e.,* such that a longitudinal centerline of the bar would pass over the center of the footprint).


(iv) 6.3.1.2 Included on the fixture, but not overhanging the footprint, shall be a linear level that is positioned on a plane parallel to the bar, and in a direction parallel to the bar.


(v) 6.3.1.3 Other parts of the fixture, including any handle arrangement and any clamping arrangement for the bar, shall not comprise more that 30% of the total mass of the fixture, and shall be mounted as concentric and as low as possible.


(vi) 6.3.2 *Test Method:*

(vii) 6.3.2.1 Mattresses that are supplied with a product shall be tested when positioned on that product. Mattresses sold independent of a product, shall be tested on a flat, rigid, horizontal support. After-market mattresses for play yards and non-full-size cribs shall be tested with each brand and model of product it is intended to replace.


(viii) 6.3.2.2 Where a user of a mattress could possibly position either side face up, even if this is not an intended use, then both sides of the mattress shall be tested.


(ix) 6.3.2.3 Before testing each mattress, the following steps shall be followed:


(A) Verify there is no excess moisture in the mattress, beyond reasonable laboratory humidity levels.


(B) Allow sufficient time per the manufacturer's instructions to fully inflate, if shipped in a vacuum sealed package.


(C) Shake and or agitate the mattress in order to fully aerate and distribute all internal components evenly.


(D) Place the mattress in the manufacturer's recommended use position if there is one, in the supplied product, or on a flat, rigid, horizontal support.


(E) Let the mattress rest for at least 5 minutes.


(F) Mark a longitudinal centerline on the mattress sleep surface, and divide this line in half. This point will be the first test location. Then further divide the two lines on either side of the first test location into halves. These will be the second and third test locations.


(x) 6.3.2.4. Position the test fixture on each of the test locations, with the footprint of the fixture centered on the location, with the bar extending over the centerline and always pointing at the same end of the mattress sleep surface.


(A) At each test location in turn, rotate the bar to point in the required direction, and gently set the fixture down on the mattress sleep surface, ensuring that the footprint of the fixture does not extend beyond the edge of the mattress. The fixture shall be placed as horizontal as possible, using the level to verify. If the bar makes contact with the top of the mattress sleep surface, even slightly, the mattress is considered to have failed the test.


(B) Repeat Step (A) at the remaining locations identified in 6.3.2.3(F).


(C) Repeat Step (A) at a location away from the centerline most likely to fail (*e.g.* a very soft spot on the sleep surface or at a raised portion of the sleep surface). In the case of testing a raised portion of a sleep surface, position center of the fixture such that the bar is over the raised portion, to simulate the position of an infant's nose.


(D) In the event that the fixture is not resting in a nearly horizontal orientation, repeat the test procedure at that location by beginning again from paragraph (b)(14)(x)(A). However, if the test produces a fail even with the device tilted back away from the bar so as to raise it, then a fail can be recorded.


(15) Add the following paragraphs as section 6.4 of ASTM F2933-21:


(i) 6.4 Coil Spring Test.


(ii) 6.4.1 General—This test consists of dropping a specified weight repeatedly onto the mattress. The test assists in evaluating the structural integrity of a mattress with coil springs.


(iii) 6.4.2 Test Fixture:


(iv) 6.4.2.1 A guided free-fall impacting system machine (which keeps the upper surface of the impact mass parallel to the horizontal surface on which the crib is secured) (See Fig. 4).


(v) 6.4.2.2 A 30-lb (13.6-kg) impact mass (see Fig. 5 and Fig. 6).


(vi) 6.4.2.3 A 6-in. (150-mm) long gauge.


(vii) 6.4.2.4 An enclosed frame measuring 29 inches by 53 inches (737 mm by 1346 mm) for the purpose of restricting mattress movement. When testing full-size mattresses, a full-size crib meeting the requirements of ASTM F1169-19 would suffice.


(viii) 6.4.2.5 A 
3/4″ piece of plywood or oriented strand board (OSB) that is rigidly supported along the perimeter.


(ix) 6.4.3 *Test Method:*

(x) 6.4.3.1 Place the mattress on the wooden support and inside the enclosed frame.


(xi) 6.4.3.2 Position geometric center of the impact mass above the geometric center of the test mattress.


(xii) 6.4.3.3 Adjust the distance between the top surface of the mattress and bottom surface of the impact mass to 6 in. (150 mm) (using the 6-in. (150-mm) long gauge, per 6.4.2.3) when the impact mass is in its highest position. Lock the impactor mechanism at this height and do not adjust the height during impacting to compensate for any change in distance as a result of the mattress compressing or the mattress support deforming or moving during impacting.


(xiii) 6.4.3.4 Allow the 30-lb (13.6-kg) impact mass to fall freely 250 times at the rate of one impact every 4 s. Load retraction shall not begin until at least 2 s after the start of the drop.


(xiv) 6.4.3.5 Repeat the step described in 6.4.3.4 at the other test locations shown in Fig. 7.


(xv) 6.4.4 The coil spring test shall be repeated on each surface of the mattress. The test shall not be repeated using a mattress that has been previously tested with the coil spring test.
