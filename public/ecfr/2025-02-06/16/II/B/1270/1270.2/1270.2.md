(B) If the line on the face of the 4.7 in (120 mm) end of the cone is at or below the highest point of the uncompressed mattress, as shown in Figure 2 to this paragraph (b)(15)(i), the space fails the test.

(ii) [Reserved]


(18) Instead of complying with section 9.2.5 of ASTM F3186-17, comply with the following:
