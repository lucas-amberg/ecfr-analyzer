# ยง 1305.1   Scope and application.

In this part 1305 the Consumer Product Safety Commission declares that artificial emberizing materials (ash and embers) containing respirable free-form asbestos generally packaged in an emberizing kit for use in fireplaces, and designed for use in such a manner that the asbestos fibers can become airborne under reasonably foreseeable conditions of use are banned hazardous products under sections 8 and 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) (15 U.S.C. 2057 and 2058). This ban applies to artificial emberizing materials available in separate kits or with artificial fireplace logs for use in fireplaces and sprinkled or coated by consumers on the artificial logs to simulate live embers and ashes and give a glowing appearance when subjected to high temperatures. Bags of material containing asbestos that are sold separately to be sprinkled on and under artificial logs to simulate burning and glowing ashes also come within the scope of this ban.
