# § 1500.126   Substances determined to be “special hazards.”

Whenever the Commission determines that for a particular hazardous substance intended or packaged in a form suitable for use in the household or by children, the requirements of section 2(p) of the act (repeated in § 1500.3(b)(14)) are not adequate for the protection of the public health and safety because of some special hazard, the Commission, by an appropriate order in the _Federal Register,_ shall specify such reasonable variations or additional label requirements that it finds are necessary for the protection of the public health and safety. Such order shall specify a date that is not less than 90 days after the order is published (unless emergency conditions stated in the order specify an earlier date) after which any such hazardous substance intended, or packaged in a form suitable, for use in the household or by children that fails to bear a label in accordance with such order shall be deemed to be a misbranded hazardous substance.
