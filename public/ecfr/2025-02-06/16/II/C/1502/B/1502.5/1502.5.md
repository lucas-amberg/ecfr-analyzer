(a) The _Federal Register_ notice promulgating the final regulation will describe how to submit objections and requests for hearing.


(b) On or before the 30th day after the date of publication of a final regulation in the _Federal Register,_ a person may file written objections, with or without a request for a hearing, with the Commission.
