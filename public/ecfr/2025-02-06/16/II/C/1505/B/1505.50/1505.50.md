# § 1505.50   Stalled motor testing.

(a) § 1505.6(e)(4)(ii) requires that a motor-operated toy be tested with the motor stalled if the construction of the toy is such that any person can touch moving parts associated with the motor from outside the toy. The performance of the toy shall be considered unacceptable if, during the test, temperatures higher than those specified in § 1505.8 are attained or if temperatures higher than those specified for Type C surfaces in § 1505.7 are attained on any accessible surface of the motor.


(b) To determine if a moving part associated with the motor can be touched from outside the toy, the Commission staff will use a 
1/4-inch diameter rod, as referenced in § 1505.4(h)(1). If the rod, when inserted into openings in the toy, can touch any moving part associated with the motor, the toy will be tested with the motor stalled.


(c) The requirement that temperatures higher than those specified in § 1505.8 not be attained applies to those internal components which are described in § 1505.8. Additionally, temperatures of accessible surfaces shall not exceed those specified for Type C surfaces in § 1505.7.
