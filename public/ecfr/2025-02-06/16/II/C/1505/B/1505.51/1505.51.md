# § 1505.51   Hot surfaces.

(a) *Test probe.* Section 1505.6(g)(2) defines accessibility, for certain paragraphs, as the ability to reach a heated surface with a 
1/4-inch-diameter rod 3 inches long. To test for accessibility using this test probe, it shall be inserted no more than 3 inches into any opening in the toy. Unless the probe contacts a surface within 3 inches of the plane of the toy's opening, that surface is not accessible.


(b) *Accessibility of Type C and C-marked surfaces.* Under § 1505.6(g)(2) (iii) and (iv), touching by casual contact or without employing the aid of a common household tool shall be determined by use of the accessibility test probe described in §§ 1505.6(g)(2) and 1505.51(a).
