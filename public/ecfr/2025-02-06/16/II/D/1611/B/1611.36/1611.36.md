Any person who fails to maintain such records or to furnish such invoice or other paper shall be deemed to have engaged in the marketing or handling of such products for purposes subject to the requirements of the act and such person and the products shall be subject to the provisions of sections 3, 6, 7, and 9 of the act.


(b) Fabrics intended or sold for use in those hats, gloves, and footwear which are excluded under the definition of articles of wearing apparel in section 2(d) of the act shall not be subject to the provisions of section 3 of the act: *Provided,* That an invoice or other paper covering the marketing or handling of such fabrics is given which specifically designates their intended use in such products: *And provided further,* That with respect to fabrics which under the provisions of section 4 of the act, as amended, are so highly flammable as to be dangerous when worn by individuals, any person marketing or handling such fabrics maintains records which show the acquisition, disposition, and intended end use of such fabrics, and any person manufacturing hats, gloves, or footwear containing such fabrics maintains records which show the acquisition, end use and disposition of such fabrics.

(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, handkerchiefs not exceeding a finished size of twenty-four (24) inches on any side or not exceeding five hundred seventy-six (576) square inches in area are not deemed “articles of wearing apparel” as that term is used in the act.


(d) Handkerchiefs or other articles affixed to, incorporated in, or sold as a part of articles of wearing apparel as decoration, trimming, or for any other purpose, are considered an integral part of such articles of wearing apparel, and the articles of wearing apparel and all parts thereof are subject to the provisions of the act. Handkerchiefs or other articles intended or sold to be affixed to, incorporated in or sold as a part of articles of wearing apparel as aforesaid constitute “fabric” as that term is defined in section 2(e) of the act and are subject to the provisions of the act which such handkerchiefs or other articles constitute textile fabrics as the term “textile fabric” is defined in § 1611.31(f).


(e) Where an article of wearing apparel has a raised-fiber surface which is intended for use as a covered or unexposed part of the article of wearing apparel but the article of wearing apparel is, because of its design and construction, capable of being worn with the raised-fiber surface exposed, such raised-fiber surface shall be considered to be an uncovered or exposed part of the article of wearing apparel. Examples of the type of products referred to in this paragraph are athletic shirts or so-called “sweat shirts” with a raised fiber inner side.


(f) *Multilayer fabric and wearing apparel with a film or coating on the uncovered or exposed surface.* Plastic film or plastic-coated fabric used, or intended for use, as the outer layer of disposable diapers is exempt from the requirements of the standard, provided that a full thickness of the assembled article passes the test in the standard otherwise applicable to the outer fabric or film when the flame is applied to the exposed or uncovered surface.
