(3) Each mattress or mattress pad subject to the Standard shall bear a permanent, accessible, and legible label containing the month and year of manufacture and the location of the manufacturer. (See § 1632.1(i) of the Amended Standard.)


(4) The information required on labels by this section shall be set forth separately from any other information appearing on such label. Other information, representations, or disclosures, appearing on labels required by this section or elsewhere on the item, shall not interfere with, minimize, detract from, or conflict with the required information.

(8) Photograph (color or black and white) of the bare surface of each mattress or mattress pad tested in accordance with § 1632.7, with the prototype identification number of the mattress or mattress pad and a clear designation as to which part of the mattress or mattress pad was sheeted and which part was tested bare.


(9) Details of any approved alternate laundering procedure used in laundering mattress pads required by the Standard to be laundered during testing.


(10) Identification, composition, and details of the application of any flame retardant treatments employed relative to mattress pads or mattress pad components.


(11) Disposition of all failing or rejected prototype mattress or mattress pads. Such records must demonstrate that the items were retested and reworked in accordance with the Standard prior to sale or distribution and that such retested or reworked mattresses or mattress pads comply with the Standard, or must otherwise show the disposition of such items.


(12) The records required by this paragraph shall be maintained for as long as the prototype is in production, the ticking is being used on the mattresses or mattress pad prototype, and/or the tape edge material is being used on the mattress or mattress pad prototype, and shall be retained for 3 years thereafter.


(d) *Tests for guaranty purposes.* Reasonable and representative tests for the purpose of issuing a guaranty under section 8 of the Act for mattress or mattress pads subject to the Standard shall be those prototype and substitution tests performed, pursuant to the requirements of the Standard.
