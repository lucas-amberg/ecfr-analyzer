# § 1633.5   Prototype pooling and confirmation testing requirements.

(a) *Prototype pooling.* One or more manufacturers may rely on a qualified prototype produced by another manufacturer or prototype developer provided that:


(1) The prototype meets the requirements of § 1633.4;


(2) The mattress sets being produced are the same as the qualified prototype with respect to materials, components, design and methods of assembly; and


(3) The manufacturer producing mattress sets in reliance on a qualified prototype has performed a confirmation test on at least one (1) Specimen of the mattress set it produces in accordance with § 1633.7. The tested specimen must meet the criteria under § 1633.3(b) before any mattress sets based on the qualified prototype may be sold or introduced into commerce.


(b) *Confirmation test failure.* (1) If the confirmation test specimen fails to meet the criteria of § 1633.3(b), the manufacturer thereof shall not sell any mattress set based on the same qualified prototype until that manufacturer takes corrective measures, tests a new specimen, and the new specimen meets the criteria of § 1633.3(b).


(2) If a confirmation test specimen fails to meet the criteria of § 1633.3(b), the manufacturer thereof must notify the manufacturer of the prototype of the test failure.
