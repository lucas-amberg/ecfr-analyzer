# § 1750.5   Detailed requirements.

(a) *Releasing forces.* As determined by the tests prescribed by § 1750.6, the device:


(1) Shall permit the refrigerator door to be opened on the application of a force equivalent to one which, if directed perpendicularly to the plane of the door and applied anywhere along the latch edge of the inside of the closed door, shall not exceed 66.7 newtons (15 pounds);


(2) Shall permit the refrigerator door to be opened on the application of clockwise or counterclockwise turning moment of not more than 0.57 newton-meter (5 inch-pounds) to a knob on the door through an angle of rotation of 45° ±15° in either direction; or


(3) Shall function automatically to permit the door to be opened with a force of 66.7 newtons (15 pounds) or less applied as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section whenever space(s) exist(s) or is (are) created with dimensions and volumes exceeding the dimensions and volumes imposed by § 1750.3.


(b) *Description and location of knob(s).* The knob(s) shall resemble a conventional doorknob in shape and size and shall be mounted near the latch side of the door extending into the cabinet at least 6.3 millimeters (
1/4 inch) beyond any inner door surface within a 15.2-centimeter (6-inch) radius of the knob center. The knob(s) shall be mounted in such a manner that there is a minimum of 19.0-millimeter (
3/4-inch) clearance between the inner periphery of the knob(s) and adjacent inner door surfaces. The knob(s) shall be located so as to provide the accessibility required by § 1750.3.


(c) *Wear.* The device shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section after 300,000 cycles of operation of the door as determined by the tests prescribed by § 1750.6.


(d) *Protection against adverse effects from spillage, cleaning, defrosting, and condensation.* Devices shall be designed so that spillage of foods or beverages, cleaning or defrosting in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations, or normal condensation will not so adversely affect the operation of the device as to result in its failure to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, as determined by the tests prescribed by § 1750.6.


(e) *Devices which permit door to be opened as a result of forces or turning moments applied to movable components inside the refrigerator.* Those components of a device upon which the safety features of the device depend shall not break, crack, permanently deform, nor show other visible damage when subjected to forces and moments specified in the tests under § 1750.6(c). The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall be satisfied after the device has been subjected to the tests under § 1750.6(c).


(f) *Power supply.* The device shall operate in accordance with the requirements of this standard with the electric, gas, or other fuel supply either on or off.
