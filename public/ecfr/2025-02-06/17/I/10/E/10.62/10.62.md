(2) A failure to appear at a hearing shall not constitute a waiver of a party's right to propose findings of fact based on the record in the proceeding, to propose conclusions of law or to submit briefs, in the manner provided in ยง 10.82, if the non-appearing party submits prior to the scheduled hearing or within three days thereafter, a notice of appearance indicating his intent to continue to participate in the proceeding. Otherwise, his failure to appear will constitute a default, and a default order may be sought in accordance with procedures set forth in ยง 10.93 of these rules.
