# § 12.22   Default proceedings.

(a) *Institution of a default proceeding.* Failure timely to respond to a complaint or a counterclaim, as required by §§ 12.16 and 12.20 of these rules, or, if applicable, to pay a filing fee required by § 12.25(b) or (c), shall be treated as an admission of the allegations of the complaint or counterclaim by the non-responding party, shall constitute a waiver by such party of any decisional procedure afforded by these Rules on the facts set forth in the complaint or counterclaim, and shall result in the institution of a default proceeding.


(b) *Default procedure.* Upon a party's failure to respond timely to a complaint or counterclaim as prescribed in §§ 12.16 and 12.20, or timely to comply with § 12.25(b) or (c), the Director of the Office of Proceedings shall forward the pleadings, and other materials then of record, to an Administrative Judge or Administrative Law Judge who may thereafter enter findings and conclusions concerning the questions of violations and damages and, if warranted, enter a reparation award against the non-responding party. If the facts which are treated as admitted are considered insufficient to support a violation or the amount of reparations sought, the Administrative Judge or Administrative Law Judge may order production of supplementary evidence from the party not in default and may enter a default order and an award based thereon.


(c) *Finality.* A default order issued pursuant to this rule, or pursuant to any other provisions of these part 12 Reparation Rules, shall become the final decision and order of the Commission thirty (30) days after service thereof, unless the order is set aside pursuant to § 12.23(a) of these rules, or unless the Commission takes review of such order on its own motion on or before the thirtieth day.
