Any party may file a response to a motion to supplement the pleadings within ten (10) days after the date of service upon that party of the motion.


(c) *Pleadings to conform to the evidence.* When issues not raised by the pleadings but reasonably within the scope of a formal decisional proceeding are tried with the express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.
