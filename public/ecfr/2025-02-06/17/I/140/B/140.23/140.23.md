(b) *Determination of need-to-know.* A person is not entitled to receive classified information solely by virtue of having been granted a security clearance. A person must also have a need for access to the particular classified information sought in connection with the performance of official government duties or contractual obligations. The determination of that need shall be made by officials having responsibility for the classified information.
