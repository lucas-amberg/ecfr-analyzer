# § 145.5   Disclosure of nonpublic records.

The Commission shall withhold information in “nonpublic records,” as defined in § 145.0(c), only if the Commission reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption described in paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section, or if disclosure is prohibited by law. The Commission shall consider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever the Commission determines that a full disclosure of the requested record is not possible. The Commission shall take reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information in “nonpublic records” subject to a request under § 145.7 if those portions do not fall within an exemption described in paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section.

(b) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Commission or any other agency of the Government of the United States, including operation rules, guidelines, and manuals of procedure for investigators, auditors, and other employees (other than those rules and practices which establish legal requirements to which members of the public are expected to conform);


(c) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, including:


(1) Data and information which would separately disclose the business transactions or market positions of any person and trade secrets or names of customers; and


(2) Any data or information concerning or obtained in connection with any pending investigation of any person;
