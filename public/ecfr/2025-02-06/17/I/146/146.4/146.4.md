When a request for information or for access to records has been made pursuant to § 146.3, before information is given or access is granted pursuant to § 146.5 of these rules the Commission shall require reasonable identification of the person making the request to insure that information is given and records are disclosed only to the proper person.

(1) Submitting with his request for information or for access a photocopy of two pieces of identification bearing his name and signature, one of which shall bear his current home or business address; or


(2) Appearing at any office of the Commission (located at the addresses set forth in § 145.6 of these rules) during the regular working hours for that office and presenting either:


(i) One piece of identification containing a photograph and signature, such as a drivers license or passport or


(ii) Two pieces of identification bearing his name and signature, one of which shall bear his current home or business address; or


(3) Providing such other proof of identity as the Commission deems satisfactory in the circumstances of a particular request.


(b) If the General Counsel or other designated Commission official determines that the data in a requested record is so sensitive that unauthorized access could cause harm or embarrassment to the person whose 71818, produce satisfactory evidence of identity under paragraph (a) of this section, the individual making the request may be required to submit a notarized statement attesting to their identity and that they are familiar with and understand the criminal penalties provided under section 1001 of title 18 of the U.S. Code for making false statements to a Government agency and under the Privacy Act, section 552a(i)(3) of title 5 of the U.S. Code, for obtaining records under false pretenses.

(d) Nothing in this section shall preclude the Commission from requiring additional identification before granting access to the records if there is reason to believe that the person making the request may not be the individual to whom the record pertains, or where the sensitivity of the data warrants it.
