(3) *Timing of application.* (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, a person seeking relief in accordance with this section must apply to the Commission and receive a notice of approval of such application prior to the date that the position for which the application was submitted would be in excess of the applicable Federal speculative position limit set forth in § 150.2;


(ii) Due to demonstrated sudden or unforeseen increases in its bona fide hedging needs, a person may apply for recognition of a bona fide hedging transaction or position within five business days after the person established the position that exceeded the applicable Federal speculative position limit.

(C) If an application filed pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section is denied, the Commission will not pursue an enforcement action for a position limits violation for the person holding the position during the period of the Commission's review nor once the Commission has issued its determination so long as the application was submitted in good faith and the person brings its position within the Federal speculative position limits within a commercially reasonable time in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.


(4) *Commission determination.* After a review of any application submitted under paragraph (b) of this section and any supplemental information provided by the applicant, the Commission will determine, with respect to the transaction or position for which the application is submitted, whether to recognize all or a specified portion of such transaction or position as a bona fide hedging transaction or position or whether to exempt all or a specified portion of such spread transaction, as applicable. The Commission shall notify the applicant of its determination, and an applicant may exceed Federal speculative position limits set forth in § 150.2, or in the case of applications filed pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the applicant may rely upon the Commission's determination, upon receiving a notice of approval.

This notification shall briefly specify the nature of the issues raised and the specific provisions of the Act or the Commission's regulations with which the position or application is, or appears to be, inconsistent.


(c) *Previously-granted risk management exemptions.* To the extent that exemptions previously granted under § 1.47 of this chapter or by a designated contract market or a swap execution facility are for the risk management of positions in financial instruments, including but not limited to index funds, such exemptions shall no longer apply as of January 1, 2023.


(d) *Recordkeeping.* (1) Persons who avail themselves of exemptions under this section shall keep and maintain complete books and records concerning all details of each of their exemptions, including relevant information about related cash, forward, futures contracts, option on futures contracts, and swap positions and transactions (including anticipated requirements, production, merchandising activities, royalties, contracts for services, cash commodity products and by-products, cross-commodity hedges, and records of bona fide hedging swap counterparties) as applicable, and shall make such books and records available to the Commission upon request under paragraph (e) of this section.
