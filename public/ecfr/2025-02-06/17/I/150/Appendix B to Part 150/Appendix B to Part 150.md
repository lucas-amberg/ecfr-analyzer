# Appendix B to Part 150—Guidance on Gross Hedging Positions and Positions Held During the Spot Period


(a) *Guidance on gross hedging positions.* (1) A person's gross hedging positions may be deemed in compliance with the bona fide hedging transaction or position definition in § 150.1, whether enumerated or non-enumerated, *provided that* all applicable regulatory requirements are met, including that the position is economically appropriate to the reduction of risks in the conduct and management of a commercial enterprise and otherwise satisfies the bona fide hedging definition in § 150.1, and *provided further that:*

(i) The manner in which the person measures risk is consistent and follows historical practice for that person;


(ii) The person is not measuring risk on a gross basis to evade the speculative position limits in § 150.2 or the aggregation rules in § 150.4; and


(iii) The person is able to demonstrate compliance with paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this appendix, including by providing justifications for measuring risk on a gross basis, upon the request of the Commission and/or of a designated contract market, including by providing information regarding the entities with which the person aggregates positions.


(b) *Guidance regarding positions held during the spot period.* The regulations governing exchange-set speculative position limits and exemptions therefrom under § 150.5(a)(2)(ii)(D) provide that designated contract markets and swap execution facilities (“exchanges”) may impose restrictions on bona fide hedging transaction or position exemptions to require the person to exit any such positions in excess of limits during the lesser of the last five days of trading or the time period for the spot month in such physical-delivery contract, or otherwise limit the size of such position. This guidance is intended to provide factors the Commission believes exchanges should consider when determining whether to impose a five-day rule or similar restriction but is not intended to be used as a mandatory checklist. The exchanges may consider whether:


(1) The position complies with the bona fide hedging transaction or position definition in § 150.1, whether enumerated or non-enumerated;


(2) There is an economically appropriate need to maintain such position in excess of Federal speculative position limits during the spot period for such contract, and such need relates to the purchase or sale of a cash commodity; and


(3) The person wishing to exceed Federal position limits during the spot period:


(i) Intends to make or take delivery during that time period;


(ii) Has the ability to take delivery for any long position at levels that are economically appropriate (*i.e.,* the delivery comports with the person's demonstrated need for the commodity and the contract is the most economical source for that commodity);


(iii) Has the ability to deliver against any short position (*i.e.,* has inventory on hand in a deliverable location and in a condition in which the commodity can be used upon delivery and that delivery against futures contracts is economically appropriate, as it is the best sales option for that inventory).
