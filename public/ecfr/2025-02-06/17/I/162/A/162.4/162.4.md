# § 162.4   Scope and duration of opt out.

(a) *Scope of opt-out election*—(1) *In general.* The consumer's election to opt out prohibits any covered affiliate subject to the scope of the opt-out notice from using eligibility information received from another affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer.


(2) *Continuing relationship*—(i) *In general.* If the consumer establishes a continuing relationship with a covered affiliate or its affiliate, an opt-out notice may apply to eligibility information obtained in connection with—


(A) A single continuing relationship or multiple continuing relationships that the consumer establishes with a covered affiliate or its affiliates, including continuing relationships established subsequent to delivery of the opt-out notice, so long as the notice adequately describes the continuing relationships covered by the opt out; or


(B) Any other transaction between the consumer and the covered affiliate or its affiliates as described in the notice.


(ii) *Examples of a continuing relationship.* A consumer has a continuing relationship with a covered affiliate or its affiliate if:


(A) The covered affiliate is a futures commission merchant through whom a consumer has opened an account, or that carries the consumer's account on a fully-disclosed basis, or that effects or engages in commodity interest transactions with or for a consumer, even if the covered affiliate does not hold any assets of the consumer;


(B) The covered affiliate is an introducing broker that solicits or accepts specific orders for trades;


(C) The covered affiliate is a commodity trading advisor with whom a consumer has a contract or subscription, either written or oral, regardless of whether the advice is standardized, or is based on, or tailored to, the commodity interest or cash market positions or other circumstances or characteristics of the particular consumer;


(D) The covered affiliate is a commodity pool operator, and accepts or receives from the consumer, funds, securities, or property for the purpose of purchasing an interest in a commodity pool;


(E) The covered affiliate is a major swap participant that holds securities or other assets as collateral for a loan made to the consumer, even if the covered affiliate did not make the loan or do not affect any transactions on behalf of the consumer; or


(F) The covered affiliate is a swap dealer that regularly effects or engages in swap transactions with or for a consumer even if the covered affiliate does not hold any assets of the consumer.


(3) *No continuing relationship*—(i) *In general.* If there is no continuing relationship between a consumer and the covered affiliate or its affiliate, and the covered affiliate or its affiliate obtain eligibility information about a consumer in connection with a transaction with the consumer, such as an isolated transaction or a credit application that is denied, an opt-out notice provided to the consumer only applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with that transaction.


(ii) *Examples of no continuing relationship.* A consumer does not have a continuing relationship with a covered affiliate or its affiliate if:


(A) The covered affiliate has acted solely as a “finder” for a futures commission merchant, and the covered affiliate does not solicit or accept specific orders for trades; or


(B) The covered affiliate has solicited the consumer to participate in a pool or to direct his or her account and he or she has not provided the covered affiliate with funds to participate in a pool or entered into any agreement with the covered affiliate to direct his or her account.


(4) *Menu of alternatives.* A consumer may be given the opportunity to choose from a menu of alternatives when electing to prohibit solicitations, such as by electing to prohibit solicitations from certain types of affiliates covered by the opt-out notice but not other types of affiliates covered by the notice, electing to prohibit solicitations based on certain types of eligibility information but not other types of eligibility information, or electing to prohibit solicitations by certain methods of delivery but not other methods of delivery. However, one of the alternatives must allow the consumer to prohibit all solicitations from all of the affiliates that are covered by the notice.


(5) *Special rule for a notice following termination of all continuing relationships.* A consumer must be given a new opt-out notice if, after all continuing relationships with the covered affiliate or its affiliate(s) are terminated, the consumer subsequently establishes another continuing relationship with the covered affiliate or its affiliate(s) and the consumer's eligibility information is to be used to make a solicitation. The new opt-out notice must apply, at a minimum, to eligibility information obtained in connection with the new continuing relationship. Consistent with paragraph b of this section, the consumer's decision not to opt out after receiving the new opt-out notice would not override a prior opt-out election by the consumer that applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with a terminated relationship, regardless of whether the new opt-out notice applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with the terminated relationship.


(b) *Duration of opt-out election.* An opt-out election must be effective for a period of at least five years beginning when the consumer's opt-out election is received and implemented, unless the consumer subsequently revokes the opt-out election in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically. An opt-out election may be established for a period of more than five years or for an indefinite period unless revoked.


(c) *Time period in which a consumer can opt out.* A consumer may opt out at any time.


(d) *No effect on opt-out period.* An opt-out period may not be shortened by sending a renewal notice to the consumer before expiration of the opt-out period, even if the consumer does not renew the opt out.
