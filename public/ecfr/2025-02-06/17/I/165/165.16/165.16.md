# ยง 165.16   No immunity.

The Commodity Whistleblower Incentives and Protections provisions set forth in Section 23(h) of Commodity Exchange Act and this part 165 do not provide individuals who provide information to the Commission with immunity from prosecution. The fact that an individual may become a whistleblower and assist in Commission investigations and enforcement actions does not preclude the Commission from bringing an action against the whistleblower based upon the whistleblower's own conduct in connection with violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and the Commission's regulations. If such an action is determined to be appropriate, however, the Commission's Division of Enforcement will take the whistleblower's cooperation into consideration in accordance with its sanction recommendations to the Commission.
