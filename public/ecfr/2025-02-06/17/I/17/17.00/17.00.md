Except as otherwise authorized by the Commission or its designee, such report shall be made pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section. The report shall show each futures position, separately for each reporting market and for each future, and each put and call options position separately for each reporting market, expiration and strike price in each special account as of the close of market on the day covered by the report and, in addition, the number of futures and options contracts bought and sold, the quantity of exchanges of futures or options for commodities or for derivatives positions, the number of delivery notices issued for each such account by the clearing organization of a reporting market and the number stopped by the account, the number of long and short options expired and exercised, the number of long and short futures assigned, and the number of long and short transfers sent and received. The report shall also show all positions in all contract months and option expirations of that same commodity on the same reporting market for which the special account is reportable.


























(2) A report covering the first day upon which a special account is no longer reportable shall also be filed showing the information specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(1) *Accounts of eligible entities*—Accounts of eligible entities as defined in § 150.1 of this chapter that are traded by an independent account controller shall, together with other accounts traded by the independent account controller or in which the independent controller has a financial interest, be considered a single account.

(3) Positions in multiple accounts subject to trading control by the same trader; and


(4) Positions in omnibus accounts.


(f) *Omnibus accounts.* If the total open long positions or the total open short positions for any future of a commodity carried in an omnibus account is a reportable position, the omnibus account is in Special Account status and shall be reported by the futures commission merchant or foreign broker carrying the account in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.


(g) *Media and file characteristics.* Except as otherwise approved by the Commission or its designee, all of the applicable data elements set forth in appendix C to this part shall be included in a report required by paragraph (a) of this section and shall be submitted together in a single file.
