(4) To stay the effective date of a decision of the National Futures Association in a disciplinary, membership denial or registration action, or a decision relating to such actions issued by the Commission pursuant to these rules, for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 10 days, when such a stay is necessary to allow the Commission to consider a petition to stay the effective date of such a decision or a motion for similar relief;


(5) To decline to accept any document which has not been filed or perfected as specified in these rules;
