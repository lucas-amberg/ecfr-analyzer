(b)(1) Any swap dealer or major swap participant that offers to enter or enters into a swap with a Special Entity, other than a Special Entity defined in § 23.401(c)(3), shall have a reasonable basis to believe that the Special Entity has a representative that:

(2) Any swap dealer or major swap participant that offers to enter or enters into a swap with a Special Entity as defined in § 23.401(c)(3) shall have a reasonable basis to believe that the Special Entity has a representative that is a fiduciary as defined in Section 3 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1002).


(c) *Independent.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, a representative of a Special Entity will be deemed to be independent of the swap dealer or major swap participant if:


(1) The representative is not and, within one year of representing the Special Entity in connection with the swap, was not an associated person of the swap dealer or major swap participant within the meaning of Section 1a(4) of the Act;


(2) There is no principal relationship between the representative of the Special Entity and the swap dealer or major swap participant;


(3) The representative:

(ii) Complies with policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage and mitigate such material conflicts of interest;


(4) The representative is not directly or indirectly, through one or more persons, controlled by, in control of, or under common control with the swap dealer or major swap participant; and


(5) The swap dealer or major swap participant did not refer, recommend, or introduce the representative to the Special Entity within one year of the representative's representation of the Special Entity in connection with the swap.


(d) *Safe harbor.* (1) A swap dealer or major swap participant shall be deemed to have a reasonable basis to believe that the Special Entity, other than a Special Entity defined in § 23.401(c)(3), has a representative that satisfies the applicable requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, provided that:


(i) The Special Entity represents in writing to the swap dealer or major swap participant that it has complied in good faith with written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that it has selected a representative that satisfies the applicable requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, and that such policies and procedures provide for ongoing monitoring of the performance of such representative consistent with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section; and


(ii) The representative represents in writing to the Special Entity and swap dealer or major swap participant that the representative:


(A) Has policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that it satisfies the applicable requirements of paragraph (b) of this section;


(B) Meets the independence test in paragraph (c) of this section; and


(C) Is legally obligated to comply with the applicable requirements of paragraph (b) of this section by agreement, condition of employment, law, rule, regulation, or other enforceable duty.


(2) A swap dealer or major swap participant shall be deemed to have a reasonable basis to believe that a Special Entity defined in § 23.401(c)(3) has a representative that satisfies the applicable requirements in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, provided that the Special Entity provides in writing to the swap dealer or major swap participant the representative's name and contact information, and represents in writing that the representative is a fiduciary as defined in Section 3 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1002).

(f) *Chief compliance officer review.* If a swap dealer or major swap participant initially determines that it does not have a reasonable basis to believe that the representative of a Special Entity meets the criteria established in this section, the swap dealer or major swap participant shall make a written record of the basis for such determination and submit such determination to its chief compliance officer for review to ensure that the swap dealer or major swap participant has a substantial, unbiased basis for the determination.


(g) Before the initiation of a swap, a swap dealer or major swap participant shall disclose to the Special Entity in writing:


(1) The capacity in which it is acting in connection with the swap; and


(2) If the swap dealer or major swap participant engages in business with the Special Entity in more than one capacity, the swap dealer or major swap participant shall disclose the material differences between such capacities.


(h) This section shall not apply with respect to a transaction that is:


(1) Initiated on a designated contract market or swap execution facility; and


(2) One in which the swap dealer or major swap participant does not know the identity of the counterparty to the transaction prior to execution.
