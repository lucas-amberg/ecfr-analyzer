# § 3.64   Procedure to lift or modify conditions or restrictions.

(a) *Petition.* The registrant and his sponsor or supervising floor broker may file a petition with the Proceedings Clerk and serve a copy of the petition on the Division of Enforcement to lift or modify conditions or restrictions on the registrant's registration.


(1) The petition may be filed after the period specified in the order imposing the conditioned or restricted registration.


(2) In the petition, the registrant and his or her sponsor, supervising employer or floor broker, or supervising registrant, principal, contract market, or swap execution facility shall be limited to a showing, by affidavit, that the conditions or restrictions have been satisfied pursuant to the order which imposed them. The affidavit must be sworn to by a person with actual knowledge of the registrant's activities on behalf of the sponsor, supervising employer or floor broker, or supervising registrant, principal, contract market or swap execution facility.


(b) *Response.* (1) Within thirty days of receipt of the petition, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the Division of Enforcement shall file a response with the Proceedings Clerk. The response must include a recommendation by the Division of Enforcement as to whether to continue the conditions or restrictions, modify the conditions or restrictions, or to allow for a full registration.


(2) If the Division of Enforcement agrees with the petitioner's request to lift or modify conditions or restrictions on the petitioner's registration, it shall so recommend to the Commission. Such recommendation will only be deemed accepted upon issuance by the Commission of an order lifting or modifying conditions or restrictions on the petitioner's registration. Such order shall be so noted on the docket by the Proceedings Clerk.


(c) *Oral presentation.* If the Division of Enforcement requests a continuation, or a modification other than in accordance with the terms of the petition, of the restrictions or conditions on the registration, the Administrative Law Judge shall, within thirty days of the date that the response is filed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, determine whether an oral presentation is appropriate to the reliable resolution of the registrant's petition.


(1) If the Administrative Law Judge determines that an oral presentation is appropriate, he shall notify the parties of his determination and shall schedule and conduct an oral hearing in accordance with §§ 10.61 through 10.81 of this chapter. Following the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge shall issue a written decision or an order.


(2) If the Administrative Law Judge concludes that an oral presentation is unnecessary, he shall notify the parties and issue a written decision or an order.


(d) *Effect of the Administrative Law Judge's determination.* The Administrative Law Judge's written determination shall become the final decision of the Commission thirty days following the date the Proceedings Clerk serves the determination on the registrant, the registrant's sponsor, supervising employer or floor broker, or supervising registrant, principal or contract market, and the Division of Enforcement unless one or more of the parties files a timely notice of appeal in accordance with § 10.102 of this chapter.


(e) *Appeal.* Following the filing of a notice of appeal, the rules of appellate procedure set forth in §§ 10.102, 10.103, 10.104, 10.106, 10.107 and 10.109 of this chapter shall apply to any proceeding brought under this section.
