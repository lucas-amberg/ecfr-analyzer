# Appendix B to Part 30—Interpretative Statement With Respect to the Secured Amount Requirement Set Forth in § 30.7


1. Rule 30.7 requires FCMs who accept money, securities or property from foreign futures and foreign options customers to maintain in a separate account or accounts such money, securities and property in an amount at least sufficient to cover or satisfy all of its current obligations to those customers. 
1 This amount is denominated as the “foreign futures or foreign options secured amount” and that term is defined in § 1.3. The separate accounts must be maintained under an account name that clearly identifies the funds as belonging to foreign futures and foreign options customers at a depository that meets the requirements of Rule 30.7(c). Further, each FCM must obtain and retain in its files for the period provided in Rule 1.31 an acknowledgment from the depository that the depository was informed that such money, securities or property are held for or on behalf of foreign futures and foreign options customers and are being held in accordance with the provisions of these regulations.


2. In a series of orders issued pursuant to Rule 30.10, the Commission required that certain foreign firms exempt from registration as FCMs essentially comply with the standards of Rule 30.7. 
2 Specifically, the Commission stated that “[the secured amount] requirement is intended to ensure that funds provided by U.S. customers for foreign futures and options transactions, whether held at a U.S. FCM under Rule 30.7(c) or a firm exempted from registration as an FCM under CFTC Rule 30.10, will receive equivalent protection at *all* intermediaries and exchange clearing organizations.” 
3 The Commission further interpreted Rule 30.7 to require each FCM and Rule 30.10 firm to take appropriate action (*i.e.*, set aside funds in a “mirror” account) in the event that it becomes aware of facts leading it to conclude that foreign futures and foreign options customer funds are not being handled consistent with the requirements of Commission rules or relevant order for relief by any subsequent intermediary or exchange clearing organization.


3. Upon further analysis and reconsideration of this matter, the Commission has determined to revise its prior interpretation of the Rule 30.7 secured amount requirement. The Commission notes that the initial depository's ability to identify customer funds affords foreign futures and foreign options customers a measure of protection in the event that the intermediating FMC or foreign firm becomes insolvent. Moreover, Rule 30.6(a) requires that foreign futures and foreign options customers receive a Rule 1.55 written disclosure explaining that the treatment of customer funds outside the U.S. may not afford the same level of protection offered in the U.S. These protections exist whetehr the intermediating firm is a U.S. FCM or a firm exempt from such registration under Rule 30.10.

4. The Commission further notes, however, that, in February 1998, Rule 30.6 was amended to permit an FCM to open a commodity account for a foreign futures or foreign options customer without providing the Rule 1.55 risk disclosure statement or obtaining an acknowledgment of receipt of such statement, provided that the customer is, at the time at which the account is opened, one of several types of sophisticated customers enumerated in Rule 1.55(f) (“Rule 1.55(f) customers”). 
5 While the amendment to Rule 30.6(a) extinguished the obligation to provide a standardized risk disclosure statement to Rule 1.55(f) customers at the time of the account opening, the Commission stated that FCMs have obligations to these customers independent of such a duty that would be material in the circumstances of a given transactions.

5. After careful consideration of the issue, the Commission has determined that intermediaries should advise all customers (regardless of their level of sophistication) to consider making appropriate inquiries relating to the treatment of customer funds by depositories located outside the jurisdiction of the intermediating firm. Accordingly, the Commission has determined that an FCM, at a minimum, must provide each foreign futures or foreign option customer with a written disclosure tracking the language in either: (1) Rule 1.55(b)(7), 
7 or (2) Paragraphs 6 and 8 of appendix A to Rule 1.55(c). 
8 Rule 30.10 firms must provide each foreign futures or foreign options customer with a written disclosure tracking the language in either Rule 1.55(b)(7) or paragraphs 6 and 8 of appendix A to Rule 1.55(c), or a comparable disclosure statement prescribed by the firm's home country regulator. The Commission further encourages all firms, whether domestic or foreign, to provide a Rule 1.55 written risk disclosure to all customers, regardless of each customer's respective level of experience. The Commission notes that, in any instance where a firm provides a Rule 1.55(f) customer with a written disclosure, it is not necessary for the firm to obtain an acknowledgment of receipt. In addition, those FCMs that already have provided customers with a disclosure tracking either Rule 1.55(b)(7) or paragraphs 6 and 8 of appendix A to Rule 1.55(c) (or in the case of Rule 30.10 firm, a comparable disclosure statement prescribed by its home country regulatory) need not provide those same customers with an additional written disclosure.


6. For the reasons set forth above, the Commission is revising its interpretation of the secured amount requirement set forth in Rule 30.7. The Commission believes that the Rule 30.7 acknowledgment required of FCMs, or other appropriate acknowledgment required by Rule 30.10 firms, only applies to the maintenance of the account or accounts containing foreign futures and foreign options customer funds by the initial depository, and not to the manner in which any subsequent depository holds or subsequently transmits those funds. If an FCM receives from the initial depository the acknowledgment described in Rule 30,7, furnishes to each foreign futures or foreign options customer a written disclosure statement tracking the language set forth in Rule 1.55(b)(7) or paragraphs 6 and 8 of appendix A of Rule 1.55(c) and otherwise complies with the provisions of Rule 30.7, then it may include all funds maintained in the separate account or accounts in calculating its secured amount requirement. A Rule 30.10 firm must satisfy the same requirements, except that it may provide each foreign futures or foreign options customer with a comparable disclosure statement prescribed by is home regulator.


7. IF an FCM or Rule 30.10 firm fails to receive the required acknowledgment from the initial depository or provide the above written disclosure statement (and in certain circumstances, receive from customers and acknowledgment of receipt), then it must set aside funds with an acceptable depository and receive from such depository the required acknowledgment.


8. The Commission's interpretation of the Rule 30.7 secured amount requirement will apply to all regulated activities with all new and existing foreign futures and foreign options customers as of October 11, 2000. The Commission's interpretation does not alter any other requirement set forth in Rule 30.7 or any other section of part 30.
