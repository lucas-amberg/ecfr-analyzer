(a) Each person registered as a leverage transaction merchant or who files an application for registration as a leverage transaction merchant, who knows or should have known that its adjusted net capital at any time is less than the minimum required by § 31.9, or that its cover at any time is less than the minimum required by § 31.8, or that the amount of leverage customer funds in segregation is less than is required by § 31.12 or by the capital, cover or segregation rules of any designated self-regulatory organization to which such person is subject, if any, must:


(1) Give telegraphic notice as set forth in § 1.12(g) of this chapter that such applicant's or registrant's adjusted net capital is less than is required by § 31.9, or its cover is less than is required by § 31.8, or the amount of leverage customer funds in segregation is less than is required by § 31.12 or by such other capital, cover or segregation rule, identifying the applicable capital, cover or segregation rule. This notice must be given within 24 hours after such applicant or registrant knows or should have known that its adjusted net capital or its cover or the amount of leverage customer funds in segregation is less than is required by any of the aforesaid rules to which such applicant or registrant is subject; and


(2) Within 24 hours after giving such notice file a statement of financial condition, a statement of the computation of the minimum capital requirements pursuant to § 31.9 (computed in accordance with the applicable capital rule), a schedule of coverage requirements and coverage provided, and a schedule of segregation requirements and funds on deposit in segregation, all as of the date such applicant's or registrant's adjusted net capital or its cover or the amount of leverage customer funds in segregation became less than the minimum required.


(b) Each person registered as a leverage transaction merchant, or who files an application for registration as a leverage transaction merchant, who knows or should have known that its adjusted net capital at any time is less than 120 percent of the amount required by § 31.9 must file written notice to that effect as set forth in § 1.12(g) of this chapter within five business days of such event. Such applicant or registrant must also file a Form 2-FR or such other financial statement designated by the Commission and/or the designated self-regulatory organization, if any, as of the close of business for the month during which such event takes place and as of the close of business for each month thereafter until three successive months have elapsed during which the applicant's or registrant's adjusted net capital is at all times equal to or in excess of the minimums set forth in this paragraph (b). Each financial report required by this paragraph (b) must be filed within 30 calendar days after the end of the month for which such report is being made.


(c) The requirements of §§ 1.12(c), 1.12(d), 1.12(e) and 1.12(g) of this chapter shall apply to registered leverage transaction merchants and to persons who have applied for registration as leverage transaction merchants, as if in those paragraphs the term “leverage transaction merchant or applicant therefor” were substituted for the phrase “applicant or registrant.”
