# ยง 37.6   Enforceability.

(a) A transaction executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility shall not be void, voidable, subject to rescission, otherwise invalidated, or rendered unenforceable as a result of:


(1) A violation by the swap execution facility of the provisions of section 5h of the Act or this part;


(2) Any Commission proceeding to alter or supplement a rule, term, or condition under section 8a(7) of the Act or to declare an emergency under section 8a(9) of the Act; or


(3) Any other proceeding the effect of which is to:


(i) Alter or supplement a specific term or condition or trading rule or procedure; or


(ii) Require a swap execution facility to adopt a specific term or condition, trading rule or procedure, or to take or refrain from taking a specific action.


(b) A swap execution facility shall provide each counterparty to a transaction that is executed on or pursuant to the rules of the swap execution facility with a written record of all of the terms of the transaction which shall legally supersede any conflicting terms of a previous agreement and serve as a confirmation of the transaction. The confirmation of all terms of the transaction shall take place as soon as technologically practicable after execution; provided that specific customer identifiers for accounts included in bunched orders involving swaps need not be included in confirmations provided by a swap execution facility if the applicable requirements of ยง 1.35(b)(5) of this chapter are met.


(1) For a confirmation of an uncleared swap transaction, the swap execution facility may satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (b) by incorporating by reference terms from underlying, previously negotiated agreements governing such transaction between the counterparties, without obtaining such incorporated agreements except as otherwise necessary to fully perform its operational, risk management, governance, or regulatory functions, or any requirements under this part.


(2) [Reserved]
