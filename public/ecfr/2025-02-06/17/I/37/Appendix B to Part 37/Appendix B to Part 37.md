# Appendix B to Part 37—Guidance on, and Acceptable Practices in, Compliance with Core Principles


1. This appendix provides guidance on complying with core principles, both initially and on an ongoing basis, to maintain registration under section 5h of the Act and this part 37. Where provided, guidance is set forth in paragraph (a) following the relevant heading and can be used to demonstrate to the Commission compliance with the selected requirements of a core principle of this part 37. The guidance for the core principle is illustrative only of the types of matters a swap execution facility may address, as applicable, and is not intended to be used as a mandatory checklist. Addressing the issues set forth in this appendix would help the Commission in its consideration of whether the swap execution facility is in compliance with the selected requirements of a core principle; provided however, that the guidance is not intended to diminish or replace, in any event, the obligations and requirements of applicants and swap execution facilities to comply with the regulations provided under this part 37.


2. Where provided, acceptable practices meeting selected requirements of core principles are set forth in paragraph (b) following the guidance. Swap execution facilities that follow specific practices outlined in the acceptable practices for a core principle in this appendix will meet the selected requirements of the applicable core principle; provided however, that the acceptable practice is not intended to diminish or replace, in any event, the obligations and requirements of applicants and swap execution facilities to comply with the regulations provided under this part 37. The acceptable practices are for illustrative purposes only and do not state the exclusive means for satisfying a core principle.


(A) *In general.* To be registered, and maintain registration, as a swap execution facility, the swap execution facility shall comply with—the core principles described in section 5h of the Act; and any requirement that the Commission may impose by rule or regulation pursuant to section 8a(5) of the Act.


(B) *Reasonable discretion of swap execution facility.* Unless otherwise determined by the Commission by rule or regulation, a swap execution facility described in paragraph (A) shall have reasonable discretion in establishing the manner in which the swap execution facility complies with the core principles described in section 5h of the Act.


(a) *Guidance.* [Reserved]


(b) *Acceptable Practices.* [Reserved]


A swap execution facility shall:


(A) Establish and enforce compliance with any rule of the swap execution facility, including the terms and conditions of the swaps traded or processed on or through the swap execution facility and any limitation on access to the swap execution facility;


(B) Establish and enforce trading, trade processing, and participation rules that will deter abuses and have the capacity to detect, investigate, and enforce those rules, including means to provide market participants with impartial access to the market and to capture information that may be used in establishing whether rule violations have occurred;


(C) Establish rules governing the operation of the facility, including rules specifying trading procedures to be used in entering and executing orders traded or posted on the facility, including block trades; and


(D) Provide by its rules that when a swap dealer or major swap participant enters into or facilitates a swap that is subject to the mandatory clearing requirement of section 2(h) of the Act, the swap dealer or major swap participant shall be responsible for compliance with the mandatory trading requirement under section 2(h)(8) of the Act.


(a) *Guidance.* (1) *Investigations and investigation reports—Warning letters.* The rules of a swap execution facility may authorize its compliance staff to issue a warning letter to a person or entity under investigation or to recommend that a disciplinary panel take such an action.


(2) *Additional rules required.* A swap execution facility should adopt and enforce any additional rules that it believes are necessary to comply with the requirements of § 37.203.


(3) *Enforcement staff.* A swap execution facility's enforcement staff should not include either members of the swap execution facility or persons whose interests conflict with their enforcement duties. A member of the enforcement staff should not operate under the direction or control of any person or persons with trading privileges at the swap execution facility. A swap execution facility's enforcement staff may operate as part of the swap execution facility's compliance department.


(4) *Notice of charges.* If compliance staff authorized by a swap execution facility or a swap execution facility disciplinary panel determines, based upon reviewing an investigation report pursuant to § 37.203(f)(3), that a reasonable basis exists for finding a violation and adjudication is warranted, it should direct that the person or entity alleged to have committed the violation be served with a notice of charges and should proceed in accordance with this guidance. A notice of charges should adequately state the acts, conduct, or practices in which the respondent is alleged to have engaged; state the rule, or rules, alleged to have been violated (or about to be violated); advise the respondent that it is entitled, upon request, to a hearing on the charges; and prescribe the period within which a hearing on the charges may be requested. If the rules of the swap execution facility so provide, a notice may also advise:


(i) That failure to request a hearing within the period prescribed in the notice, except for good cause, may be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing; and


(ii) That failure to answer or to deny expressly a charge may be deemed to be an admission of such charge.


(5) *Right to representation.* Upon being served with a notice of charges, a respondent should have the right to be represented by legal counsel or any other representative of its choosing in all succeeding stages of the disciplinary process, except by any member of the swap execution facility's board of directors or disciplinary panel, any employee of the swap execution facility, or any person substantially related to the underlying investigations, such as a material witness or respondent.


(6) *Answer to charges.* A respondent should be given a reasonable period of time to file an answer to a notice of charges. The rules of a swap execution facility governing the requirements and timeliness of a respondent's answer to a notice of charges should be fair, equitable, and publicly available.


(7) *Admission or failure to deny charges.* The rules of a swap execution facility may provide that if a respondent admits or fails to deny any of the charges, a disciplinary panel may find that the violations alleged in the notice of charges for which the respondent admitted or failed to deny any of the charges have been committed. If the swap execution facility's rules so provide, then:


(i) The disciplinary panel should impose a sanction for each violation found to have been committed;


(ii) The disciplinary panel should promptly notify the respondent in writing of any sanction to be imposed pursuant to paragraph (7)(i) of this guidance and shall advise the respondent that it may request a hearing on such sanction within the period of time, which shall be stated in the notice;


(iii) The rules of a swap execution facility may provide that if a respondent fails to request a hearing within the period of time stated in the notice, the respondent will be deemed to have accepted the sanction.


(8) *Denial of charges and right to hearing.* In every instance where a respondent has requested a hearing on a charge that is denied, or on a sanction set by the disciplinary panel, the respondent should be given an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the rules of the swap execution facility.


(9) *Settlement offers.* (i) The rules of a swap execution facility may permit a respondent to submit a written offer of settlement at any time after an investigation report is completed. The disciplinary panel presiding over the matter may accept the offer of settlement, but may not alter the terms of a settlement offer unless the respondent agrees.


(ii) The rules of a swap execution facility may provide that, in its discretion, a disciplinary panel may permit the respondent to accept a sanction without either admitting or denying the rule violations upon which the sanction is based.


(iii) If an offer of settlement is accepted, the panel accepting the offer should issue a written decision specifying the rule violations it has reason to believe were committed, including the basis or reasons for the panel's conclusions, and any sanction to be imposed, which should include full customer restitution where customer harm is demonstrated, except where the amount of restitution or to whom it should be provided cannot be reasonably determined. If an offer of settlement is accepted without the agreement of the enforcement staff, the decision should adequately support the disciplinary panel's acceptance of the settlement. Where applicable, the decision should also include a statement that the respondent has accepted the sanctions imposed without either admitting or denying the rule violations.


(iv) The respondent may withdraw his or her offer of settlement at any time before final acceptance by a disciplinary panel. If an offer is withdrawn after submission, or is rejected by a disciplinary panel, the respondent should not be deemed to have made any admissions by reason of the offer of settlement and should not be otherwise prejudiced by having submitted the offer of settlement.


(10) *Hearings.* (i) The swap execution facility need not apply the formal rules of evidence for a hearing; nevertheless, the procedures for the hearing may not be so informal as to deny a fair hearing. No member of the disciplinary panel for the matter may have a financial, personal, or other direct interest in the matter under consideration.


(ii) In advance of the hearing, the respondent should be entitled to examine all books, documents, or other evidence in the possession or under the control of the swap execution facility. The swap execution facility may withhold documents that: Are privileged or constitute attorney work product; were prepared by an employee of the swap execution facility but will not be offered in evidence in the disciplinary proceedings; may disclose a technique or guideline used in examinations, investigations, or enforcement proceedings; or disclose the identity of a confidential source.


(iii) The swap execution facility's enforcement and compliance staffs should be parties to the hearing, and the enforcement staff should present their case on those charges and sanctions that are the subject of the hearing.


(iv) The respondent should be entitled to appear personally at the hearing, should be entitled to cross-examine any persons appearing as witnesses at the hearing, and should be entitled to call witnesses and to present such evidence as may be relevant to the charges.


(v) The swap execution facility should require persons within its jurisdiction who are called as witnesses to participate in the hearing and produce evidence. The swap execution facility should make reasonable efforts to secure the presence of all other persons called as witnesses whose testimony would be relevant.


(vi) The rules of a swap execution facility may provide that a sanction may be summarily imposed upon any person within its jurisdiction whose actions impede the progress of a hearing.


(11) *Right to appeal.* The rules of a swap execution facility may permit the parties to a proceeding to appeal promptly an adverse decision of a disciplinary panel in all or in certain classes of cases. Such rules may require a party's notice of appeal to be in writing and to specify the findings, conclusions, or sanctions to which objection are taken. If the rules of a swap execution facility permit appeals, then both the respondent and the enforcement staff should have the opportunity to appeal and the swap execution facility should provide for the following:


(i) The swap execution facility should establish an appellate panel that should be authorized to hear appeals of respondents. In addition, the rules of a swap execution facility may provide that the appellate panel may, on its own initiative, order review of a decision by a disciplinary panel within a reasonable period of time after the decision has been rendered.


(ii) The composition of the appellate panel should be consistent with part 40 of this chapter, and should not include any members of the swap execution facility's compliance staff or any person involved in adjudicating any other stage of the same proceeding. The rules of a swap execution facility should provide for the appeal proceeding to be conducted before all of the members of the appellate panel or a panel thereof.


(iii) Except for good cause shown, the appeal or review should be conducted solely on the record before the disciplinary panel, the written exceptions filed by the parties, and the oral or written arguments of the parties.


(iv) Promptly following the appeal or review proceeding, the appellate panel should issue a written decision and should provide a copy to the respondent. The decision issued by the appellate panel should adhere to all the requirements of § 37.206(d) to the extent that a different conclusion is reached from that issued by the disciplinary panel.


(12) *Final decisions.* Each swap execution facility should establish rules setting forth when a decision rendered pursuant to its rules will become the final decision of such swap execution facility.


(13) *Summary fines for violations of rules regarding timely submission of records.* A swap execution facility may adopt a summary fine schedule for violations of rules relating to the failure to timely submit accurate records required for clearing or verifying each day's transactions. A swap execution facility may permit its compliance staff, or a designated panel of swap execution facility officials, to summarily impose minor sanctions against persons within the swap execution facility's jurisdiction for violating such rules. A swap execution facility's summary fine schedule may allow for warning letters to be issued for first-time violations or violators. If adopted, a summary fine schedule should provide for progressively larger fines for recurring violations.


(14) *Emergency disciplinary actions.* (i) A swap execution facility may impose a sanction, including suspension, or take other summary action against a person or entity subject to its jurisdiction upon a reasonable belief that such immediate action is necessary to protect the best interest of the marketplace.


(ii) Any emergency disciplinary action should be taken in accordance with a swap execution facility's procedures that provide for the following:


(A) If practicable, a respondent should be served with a notice before the action is taken, or otherwise at the earliest possible opportunity. The notice should state the action, briefly state the reasons for the action, and state the effective time and date, and the duration of the action.


(B) The respondent should have the right to be represented by legal counsel or any other representative of its choosing in all proceedings subsequent to the emergency action taken. The respondent should be given the opportunity for a hearing as soon as reasonably practicable and the hearing should be conducted before the disciplinary panel pursuant to the rules of the swap execution facility.


(C) Promptly following the hearing provided for in paragraph (14)(ii)(B) of this guidance, the swap execution facility should render a written decision based upon the weight of the evidence contained in the record of the proceeding and should provide a copy to the respondent. The decision should include a description of the summary action taken; the reasons for the summary action; a summary of the evidence produced at the hearing; a statement of findings and conclusions; a determination that the summary action should be affirmed, modified, or reversed; and a declaration of any action to be taken pursuant to the determination, and the effective date and duration of such action.


(b) *Acceptable Practices.* [Reserved]


The swap execution facility shall permit trading only in swaps that are not readily susceptible to manipulation.


(a) *Guidance.* (1) In general, a swap contract is an agreement to exchange a series of cash flows over a period of time based on some reference price, which could be a single price, such as an absolute level or a differential, or a price index calculated based on multiple observations. Moreover, such a reference price may be reported by the swap execution facility itself or by an independent third party. When listing a swap for trading, a swap execution facility shall ensure a swap's compliance with Core Principle 3, paying special attention to the reference price used to determine the cash flow exchanges. Specifically, Core Principle 3 requires that the reference price used by a swap not be readily susceptible to manipulation. As a result, when identifying a reference price, a swap execution facility should either: Calculate its own reference price using suitable and well-established acceptable methods or carefully select a reliable third-party index.


(2) The importance of the reference price's suitability for a given swap is similar to that of the final settlement price for a cash-settled futures contract. If the final settlement price is manipulated, then the futures contract does not serve its intended price discovery and risk management functions. Similarly, inappropriate reference prices cause the cash flows between the buyer and seller to differ from the proper amounts, thus benefitting one party and disadvantaging the other. Thus, careful consideration should be given to the potential for manipulation or distortion of the reference price.


(3) For swaps that are settled by physical delivery or by cash settlement refer to the guidance in appendix C to part 38 of this chapter—Demonstration of Compliance That a Contract is not Readily Susceptible to Manipulation, section b(2) and section c(4), respectively.


(b) *Acceptable Practices.* [Reserved]


The swap execution facility shall:


(A) Establish and enforce rules or terms and conditions defining, or specifications detailing:


(1) Trading procedures to be used in entering and executing orders traded on or through the facilities of the swap execution facility; and


(2) Procedures for trade processing of swaps on or through the facilities of the swap execution facility; and


(B) Monitor trading in swaps to prevent manipulation, price distortion, and disruptions of the delivery or cash settlement process through surveillance, compliance, and disciplinary practices and procedures, including methods for conducting real-time monitoring of trading and comprehensive and accurate trade reconstructions.


(a) *Guidance.* The monitoring of trading activity in listed swaps should be designed to prevent manipulation, price distortion, and disruptions of the physical-delivery and cash settlement processes. The swap execution facility should have rules in place that allow it to intervene to prevent or reduce such market disruptions. Once a threatened or actual disruption is detected, the swap execution facility should take steps to prevent the market disruption or reduce its severity.


(1) *General requirements.* Real-time monitoring for market anomalies is the most effective, but the swap execution facility may also demonstrate that it has an acceptable program if some of the monitoring is accomplished on a T+1 basis. The monitoring of trading should use automated alerts to detect abnormal price movements and unusual trading volumes in real-time and instances or threats of manipulation, price distortion, and disruptions on at least a T+1 basis. The T+1 detection and analysis should incorporate any additional data that becomes available on a T+1 basis, including the trade reconstruction data. In some cases, a swap execution facility may demonstrate that its manual processes are effective. The swap execution facility should continually monitor the appropriateness of its swaps' terms and conditions, including the physical-delivery requirements or reference prices used to determine cash flows or settlement. The swap execution facility should act promptly to address the conditions that are causing price distortions or market disruptions, including, when appropriate, changes to contract terms. The swap execution facility should be mindful that changes to contract terms may affect whether a product is subject to the trade execution and clearing requirements of the Act.


(2) *Physical-delivery swaps.* For physical-delivery swaps, the swap execution facility should monitor for conditions that may cause the swap to become susceptible to price manipulation or distortion, including: The general availability of the commodity specified by the swap, the commodity's characteristics, and the delivery locations; and if available, information related to the size and ownership of deliverable supplies.


(3) *Cash-settled swaps.* For cash-settled swaps, the swap execution facility should monitor for pricing abnormalities in the index or instrument used to calculate the reference price. If the swap execution facility computes its own reference price used for cash flows or settlement, it should promptly amend any methodologies that result, or are likely to result, in manipulation, price distortions, or market disruptions, or impose new methodologies to resolve the threat of disruptions or distortions. If the swap execution facility relies upon a third-party index or instrument, including an index or instrument traded on another venue for the swap reference price, it should conduct due diligence to ensure that the reference price is not susceptible to manipulation and that the terms and conditions of the swap continue to comply with § 37.300.


(4) *Ability to obtain information.* The swap execution facility shall demonstrate that it has access to sufficient information to assess whether trading in swaps listed on its market, in the index or instrument used as a reference price, or the underlying commodity for its listed swaps is being used to affect prices on its market. The swap execution facility should demonstrate that it can obtain position and trading information directly from the market participants that conduct substantial trading on its facility or through an information sharing agreement with other venues or a third-party regulatory service provider. If the position and trading information is not available directly from the market participants in its markets, but is available through information sharing agreements with other trading venues or a third-party regulatory service provider, the swap execution facility should cooperate in such information sharing agreements. The swap execution facility may limit the application of the requirement for market participants to keep and provide records of their activity in the index or instrument used as a reference price, the underlying commodity, and related derivatives markets, to only those market participants that conduct substantial trading on its facility.


(5) *Risk controls for trading.* An acceptable program for preventing market disruptions shall demonstrate appropriate trading risk controls, in addition to pauses and halts. Risk controls should be adapted to the unique characteristics of the trading platform and of the markets to which they apply and should be designed to avoid market disruptions without unduly interfering with that market's price discovery function. The swap execution facility may choose from among controls that include: pre-trade limits on order size, price collars or bands around the current price, message throttles, daily price limits, and intraday position limits related to financial risk to the clearing member, or design other types of controls, as well as clear error-trade and order-cancellation policies. Within the specific array of controls that are selected, the swap execution facility should set the parameters for those controls, so that the specific parameters are reasonably likely to serve the purpose of preventing market disruptions and price distortions. If a swap is fungible with, linked to, or a substitute for other swaps on the swap execution facility or on other trading venues, such risk controls should, to the extent practicable, be coordinated with any similar controls placed on those other swaps. If a swap is based on the level of an equity index, such risk controls should, to the extent practicable, be coordinated with any similar controls placed on national security exchanges.


(b) *Acceptable practices.* [Reserved]


The swap execution facility shall:


(A) Establish and enforce rules that will allow the facility to obtain any necessary information to perform any of the functions described in section 5h of the Act;


(B) Provide the information to the Commission on request; and


(C) Have the capacity to carry out such international information-sharing agreements as the Commission may require.


(a) *Guidance.* [Reserved]


(b) *Acceptable Practices.* [Reserved]


(A) *In general.* To reduce the potential threat of market manipulation or congestion, especially during trading in the delivery month, a swap execution facility that is a trading facility shall adopt for each of the contracts of the facility, as is necessary and appropriate, position limitations or position accountability for speculators.


(B) *Position limits.* For any contract that is subject to a position limitation established by the Commission pursuant to section 4a(a) of the Act, the swap execution facility shall:


(1) Set its position limitation at a level no higher than the Commission limitation; and


(2) Monitor positions established on or through the swap execution facility for compliance with the limit set by the Commission and the limit, if any, set by the swap execution facility.


(a) *Guidance.* Until such time that compliance is required under part 151 of this chapter, a swap execution facility should have reasonable discretion to comply with § 37.600, including considering part 150 of this chapter. For Required Transactions as defined in § 37.9, a swap execution facility may demonstrate compliance with § 37.600 by setting and enforcing position limitations or position accountability levels only with respect to trading on the swap execution facility's own market. For Permitted Transactions as defined in § 37.9, a swap execution facility may demonstrate compliance with § 37.600 by setting and enforcing position accountability levels or sending the Commission a list of Permitted Transactions traded on the swap execution facility.


(b) *Acceptable Practices.* [Reserved]


The swap execution facility shall establish and enforce rules and procedures for ensuring the financial integrity of swaps entered on or through the facilities of the swap execution facility, including the clearance and settlement of the swaps pursuant to section 2(h)(1) of the Act.


(a) *Guidance.* [Reserved]


(b) *Acceptable Practices.* [Reserved]


The swap execution facility shall adopt rules to provide for the exercise of emergency authority, in consultation or cooperation with the Commission, as is necessary and appropriate, including the authority to liquidate or transfer open positions in any swap or to suspend or curtail trading in a swap.


(a) *Guidance.* (1) A swap execution facility should have rules that authorize it to take certain actions in the event of an emergency, as defined in § 40.1 of this chapter. A swap execution facility should have the authority to intervene as necessary to maintain markets with fair and orderly trading and to prevent or address manipulation or disruptive trading practices, whether the need for intervention arises exclusively from the swap execution facility's market or as part of a coordinated, cross-market intervention. A swap execution facility should have the flexibility and independence to address market emergencies in an effective and timely manner consistent with the nature of the emergency, as long as all such actions taken by the swap execution facility are made in good faith to protect the integrity of the markets. However, the swap execution facility should also have rules that allow it to take market actions as may be directed by the Commission. Additionally, in situations where a swap is traded on more than one platform, emergency action to liquidate or transfer open interest shall be as directed, or agreed to, by the Commission or the Commission's staff. Swap execution facility rules should include procedures and guidelines for decision-making and implementation of emergency intervention that avoid conflicts of interest in accordance with the provisions of section 40.9 of this chapter, and include alternate lines of communication and approval procedures to address emergencies associated with real time events. To address perceived market threats, the swap execution facility should have rules that allow it to take emergency actions, including imposing or modifying position limits, imposing or modifying price limits, imposing or modifying intraday market restrictions, imposing special margin requirements, ordering the liquidation or transfer of open positions in any contract, ordering the fixing of a settlement price, extending or shortening the expiration date or the trading hours, suspending or curtailing trading in any contract, transferring customer contracts and the margin, or altering any contract's settlement terms or conditions, or, if applicable, providing for the carrying out of such actions through its agreements with its third-party provider of clearing or regulatory services.


(2) A swap execution facility should promptly notify the Commission of its exercise of emergency action, explaining its decision-making process, the reasons for using its emergency authority, and how conflicts of interest were minimized, including the extent to which the swap execution facility considered the effect of its emergency action on the underlying markets and on markets that are linked or referenced to the contracts traded on its facility, including similar markets on other trading venues. Information on all regulatory actions carried out pursuant to a swap execution facility's emergency authority should be included in a timely submission of a certified rule pursuant to part 40 of this chapter.


(b) *Acceptable Practices.* [Reserved]


(A) *In general.* The swap execution facility shall make public timely information on price, trading volume, and other trading data on swaps to the extent prescribed by the Commission.


(B) *Capacity of swap execution facility.* The swap execution facility shall be required to have the capacity to electronically capture and transmit trade information with respect to transactions executed on the facility.


(a) *Guidance.* [Reserved]


(b) *Acceptable Practices.* [Reserved]


(A) *In general.* A swap execution facility shall:


(1) Maintain records of all activities relating to the business of the facility, including a complete audit trail, in a form and manner acceptable to the Commission for a period of five years;


(2) Report to the Commission, in a form and manner acceptable to the Commission, such information as the Commission determines to be necessary or appropriate for the Commission to perform the duties of the Commission under the Act; and


(3) Keep any such records relating to swaps defined in section 1a(47)(A)(v) of the Act open to inspection and examination by the Securities and Exchange Commission.


(B) *Requirements.* The Commission shall adopt data collection and reporting requirements for swap execution facilities that are comparable to corresponding requirements for derivatives clearing organizations and swap data repositories.


(a) *Guidance.* [Reserved]


(b) *Acceptable Practices.* [Reserved]


Unless necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of the Act, the swap execution facility shall not:


(A) Adopt any rules or take any actions that result in any unreasonable restraint of trade; or


(B) Impose any material anticompetitive burden on trading or clearing.


(a) *Guidance.* An entity seeking registration as a swap execution facility may request that the Commission consider under the provisions of section 15(b) of the Act, any of the entity's rules, including trading protocols or policies, and including both operational rules and the terms or conditions of products listed for trading, at the time of registration or thereafter. The Commission intends to apply section 15(b) of the Act to its consideration of issues under this core principle in a manner consistent with that previously applied to contract markets.


(b) *Acceptable Practices.* [Reserved]


The swap execution facility shall:


(A) Establish and enforce rules to minimize conflicts of interest in its decision-making process; and


(B) Establish a process for resolving the conflicts of interest.


(a) *Guidance.* [Reserved]


(b) *Acceptable Practices.* [Reserved]


(A) *In general.* The swap execution facility shall have adequate financial, operational, and managerial resources to discharge each responsibility of the swap execution facility.


(B) *Determination of resource adequacy.* The financial resources of a swap execution facility shall be considered to be adequate if the value of the financial resources exceeds the total amount that would enable the swap execution facility to cover the operating costs of the swap execution facility for a one-year period, as calculated on a rolling basis.


(a) *Guidance.* [Reserved] 


(b) *Acceptable Practices*—(1) *Reasonable calculation of projected operating costs.* In connection with a swap execution facility calculating its projected operating costs, the Commission has determined that a reasonable calculation should include all expenses necessary for the swap execution facility to comply with the core principles set forth in section 5h of the Act and any applicable Commission regulations. This calculation should be based on the swap execution facility's current level of business and business model, and should take into account any projected modification to its business model (e.g., the addition or subtraction of business lines or operations or other changes), and any projected increase or decrease in its level of business over the next 12 months. The Commission believes, however, that it may be reasonable for a swap execution facility to exclude the following expenses (“excludable expenses”) from its projected operating cost calculations:


(i) Costs attributable solely to sales, marketing, business development, product development, or recruitment and any related travel, entertainment, event, or conference costs;


(ii) Compensation and related taxes and benefits for swap execution facility personnel who are not necessary to ensure that the swap execution facility is able to comply with the core principles set forth in section 5h of the Act and any applicable Commission regulations;


(iii) Costs for acquiring and defending patents and trademarks for swap execution facility products and related intellectual property;


(iv) Magazine, newspaper, and online periodical subscription fees;


(v) Tax preparation and audit fees;


(vi) To the extent not covered by paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this Core Principle 13 of Section 5h of the Act—Financial Resources, the variable commissions that a voice-based swap execution facility may pay to its SEF trading specialists (as defined under § 37.201(c)), calculated as a percentage of transaction revenue generated by the voice-based swap execution facility. Unlike fixed salaries or compensation, such variable commissions are not payable unless and until revenue is collected by the swap execution facility; and


(vii) Any non-cash costs, including depreciation and amortization.


(2) *Prorated expenses.* The Commission recognizes that, in the normal course of a swap execution facility's business, there may be an expense (e.g., typically related to overhead) that is only partially attributable to a swap execution facility's ability to comply with the core principles set forth in section 5h of the Act and any applicable Commission regulations; accordingly, such expense may need to be only partially attributed to the swap execution facility's projected operating costs. For example, if a swap execution facility's office rental space includes marketing personnel and compliance personnel, the swap execution facility may exclude the prorated office rental expense attributable to the marketing personnel. In order to prorate an expense, a swap execution facility should:


(i) Maintain sufficient documentation that reasonably shows the extent to which an expense is partially attributable to an excludable expense;


(ii) Identify any prorated expense in the financial reports that it submits to the Commission pursuant to § 37.1306; and


(iii) Sufficiently explain why it prorated any expense. Common allocation methodologies that can be used include actual use, headcount, or square footage. A swap execution facility may provide documentation, such as copies of service agreements, other legal documents, firm policies, audit statements, or allocation methodologies to support its determination to prorate an expense.


(3) *Expenses allocated among affiliates.* The Commission recognizes that a swap execution facility may share certain expenses with affiliated entities, such as parent entities or other subsidiaries of the parent. For example, a swap execution facility may share employees (including employees on secondment from an affiliate) that perform similar tasks for the affiliated entities or may share office space with its affiliated entities. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it would be reasonable, for purposes of calculating its projected operating costs, for a swap execution facility to prorate any shared expense that the swap execution facility pays for, but only to the extent that such shared expense is actually attributable to the affiliate and for which the swap execution facility is reimbursed. Similarly, a reasonable calculation of a swap execution facility's projected operating costs must include the prorated amount of any expense paid for by an affiliated entity to the extent that the shared expense is attributable to the swap execution facility. In order to prorate a shared expense, the swap execution facility should:


(i) Maintain sufficient documentation that reasonably shows the extent to which the shared expense is attributable to and paid for by the swap execution facility and/or affiliated entity;


(ii) Identify any shared expense in the financial reports that it submits to the Commission; and


(iii) Sufficiently explain why it prorated any shared expense. A swap execution facility may provide documentation, such as copies of service agreements, other legal documents, firm policies, audit statements, or allocation methodologies, that reasonably shows how expenses are attributable to, and paid for by, the swap execution facility and/or its affiliated entities to support its determination to prorate an expense.








(A) *In general.* Each swap execution facility shall designate an individual to serve as a chief compliance officer.


(B) *Duties.* The chief compliance officer shall:


(1) Report directly to the board or to the senior officer of the facility;


(2) Review compliance with the core principles in this subsection;


(3) In consultation with the board of the facility, a body performing a function similar to that of a board, or the senior officer of the facility, resolve any conflicts of interest that may arise;


(4) Be responsible for establishing and administering the policies and procedures required to be established pursuant to this section;


(5) Ensure compliance with the Act and the rules and regulations issued under the Act, including rules prescribed by the Commission pursuant to section 5h of the Act; and


(6) Establish procedures for the remediation of noncompliance issues found during compliance office reviews, look backs, internal or external audit findings, self-reported errors, or through validated complaints.


(C) *Requirements for procedures.* In establishing procedures under paragraph (B)(6) of this section, the chief compliance officer shall design the procedures to establish the handling, management response, remediation, retesting, and closing of noncompliance issues.


(D) *Annual reports*—(1) *In general.* In accordance with rules prescribed by the Commission, the chief compliance officer shall annually prepare and sign a report that contains a description of:


(i) The compliance of the swap execution facility with the Act; and


(ii) The policies and procedures, including the code of ethics and conflict of interest policies, of the swap execution facility.
