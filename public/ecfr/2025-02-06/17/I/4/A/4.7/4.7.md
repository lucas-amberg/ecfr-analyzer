(B) Where the claimant is a commodity trading advisor, be received by the Commission before the date the trading advisor first enters into an agreement to direct or guide the commodity interest account of a qualified eligible person pursuant to § 4.7.


(2) The notice will be effective upon receipt by the National Futures Association with respect to each pool for which it was made where the claimant is a commodity pool operator and otherwise generally where the claimant is a commodity trading advisor; *Provided,* That any notice which does not include all the required information shall not be effective, and that if at the time the National Futures Association receives the notice an enforcement proceeding brought by the Commission under the Act or the regulations is pending against the pool operator or trading advisor or any of its principals, the exemption will not be effective until twenty-one calendar days after receipt of the notice by the National Futures Association and that in such case an exemption may be denied by the Commission or the National Futures Association or made subject to such conditions as the Commission or the National Futures Association may impose. 


(3) Any exemption claimed hereunder shall cease to be effective upon any change which would cause the commodity pool operator of an exempt pool to be ineligible for the relief claimed with respect to such pool or which would cause a commodity trading advisor to be ineligible for the relief claimed. The pool operator or trading advisor must promptly file a notice advising the National Futures Association of such change. 


(4)(i) Any exemption from the requirements of § 4.21, § 4.22, § 4.23, § 4.24, § 4.25 or § 4.26 claimed hereunder with respect to a pool shall not affect the obligation of the commodity pool operator to comply with all other applicable provisions of part 4, the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations, with respect to the pool and any other pool the pool operator operates or intends to operate. 


(ii) Any exemption from the requirements of § 4.31, § 4.33, § 4.34, § 4.35 or § 4.36 claimed hereunder shall not affect the obligation of the commodity trading advisor to comply with all other applicable provisions of part 4, the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations, with respect to any qualified eligible person and any other client to which the commodity trading advisor provides or intends to provide commodity interest trading advice. 


(e) *Insignificant deviations from a term, condition or requirement of § 4.7.* (1) A failure to comply with a term or condition of § 4.7 will not result in the loss of the exemption with respect to a particular pool or client if the commodity pool operator or the commodity trading advisor relying on the exemption shows that: 


(i) The failure to comply did not pertain to a term, condition or requirement directly intended to protect that particular qualified eligible person;


(ii) The failure to comply was insignificant with respect to the exempt pool as a whole or to the particular exempt account; and 


(iii) A good faith and reasonable attempt was made to comply with all applicable terms, conditions and requirements of § 4.7. 


(2) A transaction made in reliance on § 4.7 must comply with all applicable terms, conditions and requirements of § 4.7. Where an exemption is established only through reliance upon paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the failure to comply shall nonetheless be actionable by the Commission.
