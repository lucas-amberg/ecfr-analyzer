# § 4.22   Reporting to pool participants.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) or (a)(6) of this section, each commodity pool operator registered or required to be registered under the Act must periodically distribute to each participant in each pool that it operates, within 30 calendar days after the last date of the reporting period prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, an Account Statement, which shall be presented in the form of a Statement of Operations and a Statement of Changes in Net Assets, for the prescribed period. These financial statements must be presented and computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied. The Account Statement must be signed in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.


(1) The portion of the Account Statement which must be presented in the form of a Statement of Operations must separately itemize the following information:


(i) The total amount of realized net gain or loss on commodity interest positions liquidated during the reporting period;


(ii) The change in unrealized net gain or loss on commodity interest positions during the reporting period;


(iii) The total amount of net gain or loss from all other transactions in which the pool engaged during the reporting period, including interest and dividends earned on funds not paid as premiums or used to margin the pool's commodity interest positions;


(iv) The total amount of all management fees during the reporting period;


(v) The total amount of all advisory fees during the reporting period;


(vi) The total amount of all brokerage commissions during the reporting period;


(vii) The total amount of other fees for commodity interest and other investment transactions during the reporting period; and


(viii) The total amount of all other expenses incurred or accrued by the pool during the reporting period.


(2) The portion of the Account Statement that must be presented in the form of a Statement of Changes in Net Assets must separately itemize the following information:


(i) The net asset value of the pool as of the beginning of the reporting period;


(ii) The total amount of additions to the pool, whether voluntary or involuntary, made during the reporting period;


(iii) The total amount of withdrawals from and redemption of participation units in the pool, whether voluntary or involuntary, for the reporting period;


(iv) The total net income or loss of the pool during the reporting period;


(v) The net asset value of the pool as of the end of the reporting period; and


(vi)(A) The net asset value per outstanding participation unit in the pool as of the end of the reporting period, or


(B) The total value of the participant's interest or share in the pool as of the end of the reporting period.


(3) The Account Statement must also disclose any material business dealings between the pool, the pool's operator, commodity trading advisor, futures commission merchant, retail foreign exchange dealer, swap dealer, or the principals thereof that previously have not been disclosed in the pool's Disclosure Document or any amendment thereto, other Account Statements or Annual Reports.




(4) For the purpose of the Account Statement delivery requirement in this part, including any Account Statement distributed pursuant to § 4.7(b)(3) or § 4.12(b)(2)(ii), the term “participant” does not include a commodity pool operated by a pool operator that is the same as, or that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the pool operator of a pool in which the commodity pool has invested.

 


(5) Where the pool is comprised of more than one ownership class or series, information for the series or class on which the account statement is reporting should be presented in addition to the information presented for the pool as a whole; except that, for a pool that is a series fund structured with a limitation on liability among the different series, the account statement is not required to include consolidated information for all series.


(6) A commodity pool operator of a pool that meets the conditions specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section and has filed notice pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section may elect to follow the same accounting treatment with respect to the computation and presentation of the account statement.


(b) The Account Statement must be distributed at least monthly in the case of pools with net assets of more than $500,000 at the beginning of the pool's fiscal year, and otherwise at least quarterly; *Provided, however,* That an Account Statement for the last reporting period of the pool's fiscal year need not be distributed if the Annual Report required by paragraph (c) of this section is sent to pool participants within 45 calendar days after the end of the fiscal year. The requirement to distribute an Account Statement shall commence as of the date the pool is formed as specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.


(c) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(7) or (c)(8) of this section, each commodity pool operator registered or required to be registered under the Act must distribute an Annual Report to each participant in each pool that it operates, and must electronically submit a copy of the Report and key financial balances from the Report to the National Futures Association pursuant to the electronic filing procedures of the National Futures Association, within 90 calendar days after the end of the pool's fiscal year or the permanent cessation of trading, whichever is earlier; *Provided, however,* that if during any calendar year the commodity pool operator did not operate a commodity pool, the pool operator must so notify the National Futures Association within 30 calendar days after the end of such calendar year. The Annual Report must be affirmed pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section and must contain the following:


(1) The net asset value of the pool as of the end of each of the pool's two preceding fiscal years.


(2)(i) The net asset value per outstanding participation unit in the pool as of the end of each of the pool's two preceding fiscal years, or


(ii) The total value of the participant's interest or share in the pool as of the end of each of the pool's two preceding fiscal years.


(3) A Statement of Financial Condition as of the close of the pool's fiscal year and preceding fiscal year.


(4) Statements of Operations, and Changes in Net Assets, for the period between—


(i) The later of:


(A) The date of the most recent Statement of Financial Condition delivered to the National Futures Association pursuant to this paragraph (c); or


(B) The date of the formation of the pool; and


(ii) The close of the pool's fiscal year, together with Statements of Operations, and Changes in Net Assets for the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.


(5) Appropriate footnote disclosure and such further material information as may be necessary to make the required statements not misleading. For a pool that invests in other funds, this information must include, but is not limited to, separately disclosing the amounts of income, management and incentive fees associated with each investment in an investee fund that exceeds five percent of the pool's net assets. The management and incentive fees associated with an investment in an investee fund that is less than five percent of the pool's net assets may be combined and reported in the aggregate with the income, management and incentive fees of other investee funds that, individually, represent an investment of less than five percent of the pool's net assets. If the commodity pool operator is not able to obtain the specific amounts of management and incentive fees charged by an investee fund, the commodity pool operator must disclose the percentage amounts and computational basis for each such fee and include a statement that the CPO is not able to obtain the specific fee amounts for this fund;


(6) Where the pool is comprised of more than one ownership class or series, information for the series or class on which the financial statements are reporting should be presented in addition to the information presented for the pool as a whole; except that, for a pool that is a series fund structured with a limitation on liability among the different series, the financial statements are not required to include consolidated information for all series.




(7) For a pool that has ceased operation prior to, or as of, the end of the fiscal year, the commodity pool operator may provide the following, within 90 days of the permanent cessation of trading, in lieu of the annual report that would otherwise be required by this paragraph (c) or § 4.7(b)(4):










(i) Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets for the period between—


(A) The later of:


(*1*) The date of the most recent Statement of Financial Condition filed with the National Futures Association pursuant to this paragraph (c); or


(*2*) The date of the formation of the pool; and


(B) The close of the pool's fiscal year or the date of the cessation of trading, whichever is earlier; and


(ii)(A) An explanation of the winding down of the pool's operations and written disclosure that all interests in, and assets of, the pool have been redeemed, distributed or transferred on behalf of the participants;


(B) If all funds have not been distributed or transferred to participants by the time that the final report is issued, disclosure of the value of assets remaining to be distributed and an approximate timeframe of when the distribution will occur. If the commodity pool operator does not distribute the remaining pool assets within the timeframe specified, the commodity pool operator must provide written notice to each participant and to the National Futures Association that the distribution of the remaining assets of the pool has not been completed, the value of assets remaining to be distributed, and a time frame of when the final distribution will occur.


(C) If the commodity pool operator will not be able to liquidate the pool's assets in sufficient time to prepare, file and distribute the final annual report for the pool within 90 days of the permanent cessation of trading, the commodity pool operator must provide written notice to each participant and to National Futures Association disclosing:


(*1*) The value of investments remaining to be liquidated, the timeframe within which liquidation is expected to occur, any impediments to liquidation, and the nature and amount of any fees and expenses that will be charged to the pool prior to the final distribution of the pool's funds;


(*2*) Which financial reports the commodity pool operator will continue to provide to pool participants from the time that trading ceased until the final annual report is distributed, and the frequency with which such reports will be provided, pursuant to the pool's operative documents; and


(*3*) The timeframe within which the commodity pool operator will provide the final report.


(iii) A report filed pursuant to paragraph (c)(7) of this section that would otherwise be required by paragraph (c) of this section is not required to be audited in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section if the commodity pool operator:


(A) Obtains a written waiver of their right to receive an audited Annual Report from each participant other than the pool operator, the pool's commodity trading advisor, any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the pool operator or trading advisor, and any principal of the foregoing; and


(B) At the time of filing the Annual Report with the National Futures Association, certifies that it has received a written waiver from each participant from whom it is required to obtain a waiver to qualify for the relief available under this paragraph (c)(7). The commodity pool operator must maintain the waivers in accordance with § 4.23 and must make the waivers available to the Commission or National Futures Association upon request. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, the relief made available by this paragraph (c)(7)(iii) will not be available where the commodity pool operator has not previously distributed an audited Annual Report to pool participants and submitted an audited Annual Report to the National Futures Association.


(8) For the purpose of the Annual Report distribution requirement in this part, including any annual report distributed pursuant to § 4.7(b)(4) or § 4.12(b)(2)(iii), the term “participant” does not include a commodity pool operated by a pool operator that is the same as, or that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the pool operator of a pool in which the commodity pool has invested; *Provided,* That the Annual Report of such investing pool contains financial statements that include such information as the Commission may specify concerning the operations of the pool in which the commodity pool has invested.


(d)(1) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (d)(2) and (g)(2) of this section, the financial statements in the Annual Report required by this section or by § 4.7(b)(4) must be presented and computed in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied and must be audited by an independent public accountant; *Provided, however,* and subject to the exception in paragraph (c)(7)(iii)(B) of this section, that the requirement that the Annual Report be audited by an independent public accountant does not apply for any fiscal year during which the only participants in the pool are one or more of the pool operator, the pool's commodity trading advisor, any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the pool operator or trading advisor, and any principal of the foregoing; and *Provided further,* that the commodity pool operator obtains a written waiver from each such pool participant of their right to receive an audited Annual Report for such fiscal year, maintains such waivers in accordance with § 4.23, and makes such waivers available to the Commission or National Futures Association upon request. The requirements of § 1.16(g) of this chapter shall apply with respect to the engagement of such independent public accountants, except that any related notifications to be made may be made solely to the National Futures Association, and the certification must be in accordance with § 1.16 of this chapter, except that the following requirements of § 1.16 shall not apply:












(i) The audit objectives of § 1.16(d)(1) concerning the periodic computation of minimum capital and property in segregation;


(ii) All other references in § 1.16 to the segregation requirements; and


(iii) Section 1.16(c)(5), (d)(2), (e)(2), and (f).


(2)(i) Where a pool is organized in a jurisdiction other than the United States, the financial statements in the Annual Report required by this section or by § 4.7(b)(4) may be presented and computed in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles, standards or practices followed in such other jurisdiction; *Provided,* That:




(A) The other jurisdiction follows accounting principles, standards or practices set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section and the Annual Report presents and computes the financial statements of the pool in accordance with the applicable accounting principles, standards or practices followed by such other jurisdiction;


(B) The Annual Report includes a condensed schedule of investments, or, if required by the applicable accounting principles, standards or practices followed by such other jurisdiction, a full schedule of investments;


(C) The Annual Report reports special allocations of ownership equity in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section;


(D) The Disclosure Document or offering memorandum for the pool identifies the accounting principles, standards or practices of the other jurisdiction pursuant to which the Annual Report presents and computes the financial statements of the pool; and


(E) Where the accounting principles, standards or practices of the other jurisdiction require consolidated financial statements for the pool, such as a feeder fund consolidating with its master fund, all applicable disclosures required by United States generally accepted accounting principles for the feeder fund must be presented with the reporting pool's consolidated financial statements.


(ii) For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the following alternative accounting principles, standards or practices may be employed in the preparation and computation of the financial statements in the Annual Report of the commodity pool; *Provided,* That any such alternative accounting principles, standards or practices so employed are those followed by the jurisdiction other than the United States in which the commodity pool is organized:


(A) International Financial Reporting Standards;


(B) Generally Accepted Accounting Practice in the United Kingdom;


(C) New Irish Generally Accepted Accounting Practice;


(D) Luxembourg Generally Accepted Accounting Principles; or


(E) Canadian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.


(iii) To claim the relief available under this paragraph (d)(2), a commodity pool operator must file a notice with the National Futures Association within 90 calendar days after the end of the pool's first fiscal year.


(A) The notice must contain: The name, main business address, main telephone number and National Futures Association registration identification number of the commodity pool operator; the name and identification number of the commodity pool for which the pool operator is claiming relief; and the alternative accounting principles, standards or practices pursuant to which the financial statements in the Annual Report will be presented and computed;


(B) The notice must include a representation that the commodity pool operator complies with each of the conditions specified in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A) through (D) of this section and, if applicable, paragraph (d)(2)(i)(E) of this section; and


(C) The notice must be signed by the commodity pool operator in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.


(e)(1) The Statement of Operations required by this section must itemize brokerage commissions, management fees, advisory fees, incentive fees, interest income and expense, total realized net gain or loss from commodity interest trading, and change in unrealized net gain or loss on commodity interest positions during the pool's fiscal year. Gains and losses on commodity interests need not be itemized by commodity or by specific delivery or expiration date.


(2)(i) Any share of a pool's profits or transfer of a pool's equity which exceeds the general partner's or any other class's share of profits computed on the general partner's or other class's pro rata capital contribution are “special allocations.” Special allocations of partnership equity or other interests must be recognized in the pool's Statement of Operations in the same period as the net income, interest income, or other basis of computation of the special allocation is recognized. Special allocations must be recognized and classified either as an expense of the pool or, if not recognized as an expense of the pool, presented in the Statement of Operations as a separate, itemized allocation of the pool's net income to arrive at net income available for pro rata distribution to all partners.


(ii) Special allocations of ownership interest also must be reported separately in the Statement of Partners' Equity, in addition to the pro-rata allocations of net income, as to each class of ownership interest.


(3) Realized gains or losses on regulated commodities transactions presented in the Statement of Operations of a commodity pool may be combined with realized gains or losses from trading in non-commodity interest transactions, provided that the gains or losses to be combined are part of a related trading strategy. Unrealized gains or losses on open regulated commodity positions presented in the Statement of Operations of a commodity pool may be combined with unrealized gains or losses from open positions in non-commodity positions, provided that the gains or losses to be combined are part of a related trading strategy.


(f)(1)(i) In the event the commodity pool operator finds that it cannot distribute the Annual Report for a pool that it operates within the time specified in paragraph (c) of this section without substantial undue hardship, it may file with the National Futures Association an application for extension of time to a specified date not more than 90 calendar days after the date as of which the Annual Report was to have been distributed. The application must be made by the pool operator and must:


(A) State the name of the pool for which the application is being made;


(B) State the reasons for the requested extension;


(C) Indicate that the inability to make a timely filing is due to circumstances beyond the control of the pool operator, if such is the case, and describe briefly the nature of such circumstances;


(D) Contain an undertaking to file the Annual Report on or before the date specified in the application; and


(E) Be filed with the National Futures Association prior to the date on which the Annual Report is due.


(ii) The application must be accompanied by a letter from the independent public accountant answering the following questions:


(A) What specifically are the reasons for the extension request?


(B) Do you have any indication from the part of your audit completed to date that would lead you to believe that the commodity pool operator was or is not meeting the recordkeeping requirements of this part 4 or was or is not complying with the § 4.20(c) prohibition on commingling of property of any pool with the property of any other person? 


(iii) Within ten calendar days after receipt of an application for an extension of time, the National Futures Association shall:


(A) Notify the commodity pool operator of the grant or denial of the requested extension, or


(B) Indicate to the pool operator that additional time is required to analyze the request, in which case the amount of time needed will be specified.


(2) In the event a commodity pool operator finds that it cannot obtain information necessary to prepare annual financial statements for a pool that it operates within the time specified in paragraph (c) of this section or § 4.7(b)(4)(i), as a result of the pool investing in another collective investment vehicle, it may claim an extension of time under the following conditions:




(i) The commodity pool operator must, within 90 calendar days of the end of the pool's fiscal year, file a notice with the National Futures Association, except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(v) of this section.


(ii) The notice must contain the name, main business address, main telephone number and the National Futures Association registration identification number of the commodity pool operator, and name and the identification number of the commodity pool.


(iii) The notice must state the date by which the Annual Report will be distributed and filed (the “Extended Date”), which must be no more than 180 calendar days after the end of the pool's fiscal year. The Annual Report must be distributed and filed by the Extended Date.


(iv) The notice must include representations by the commodity pool operator that:


(A) The pool for which the Annual Report is being prepared has investments in one or more collective investment vehicles (the “Investments”);


(B) For all reports prepared under paragraph (c) of this section and for reports prepared under § 4.7(b)(4)(i) that are audited by an independent public accountant, the commodity pool operator has been informed by the independent public accountant engaged to audit the commodity pool's financial statements that specified information required to complete the pool's Annual Report is necessary in order for the accountant to render an opinion on the commodity pool's financial statements. The notice must include the name, main business address, main telephone number, and contact person of the accountant; and




(C) The information specified by the accountant cannot be obtained in sufficient time for the Annual Report to be prepared, audited, and distributed before the Extended Date.


(v) For each fiscal year following the filing of the notice described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, for a particular pool, it shall be presumed that the particular pool continues to invest in another collective investment vehicle and the commodity pool operator may claim the extension of time; *Provided, however,* that if the particular pool is no longer investing in another collective investment vehicle, then the commodity pool operator must file electronically with the National Futures Association an Annual Report within 90 days after the pool's fiscal year-end accompanied by a notice indicating the change in the pool's status.


(vi) Any notice or statement filed pursuant to this paragraph (f)(2) must be signed by the commodity pool operator in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.


(g)(1) A commodity pool operator may initially elect any fiscal year for a pool, but the first fiscal year may not end more than one year after the pool's formation. For purposes of this section, a pool shall be deemed to be formed as of the date the pool operator first receives funds, securities or other property for the purchase of an interest in the pool.


(2)(i) If a commodity pool operator elects a fiscal year other than the calendar year, it must give written notice of the election to all participants and must file the notice with the National Futures Association within 90 calendar days after the date of the pool's formation. If this notice is not given, the pool operator will be deemed to have elected the calendar year as the pool's fiscal year.


(ii) For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2), the time period from the date on which the commodity pool operator first receives funds, securities or other property from a participant in the pool that is not a person listed in paragraphs (g)(2)(ii)(A)(*1*) through (g)(2)(ii)(A)(*5*) of this section to the end of the pool's first fiscal year is the stub period of the pool. Where the stub period is four months or less, the first Annual Report for the pool may be unaudited; *Provided, however,* That:


(A) Throughout the stub period, the pool had no more than fifteen participants and no more than $3,000,000 in aggregate gross capital contributions. For the purpose of satisfying these criteria, the commodity pool operator may exclude the following persons and their contributions:


(*1*) The pool operator, the pool's commodity trading advisor, any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the pool operator or trading advisor, and any principal of the foregoing;


(*2*) A child, sibling, or parent of any of these participants;


(*3*) The spouse of any participant specified in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A)(*1*) or (*2*) of this section;


(*4*) Any relative of a participant specified in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A)(*1*), (*2*) or (*3*) of this section, their spouse or a relative of their spouse, who has the same principal residence as such participant; and


(*5*) An entity that is wholly-owned by one or more participants specified in paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A)(*1*), (*2*), (*3*) or (*4*) of this section; and


(B) The next Annual Report for the pool is audited and covers the stub period plus the pool's first 12-month fiscal year.


(C) To claim the relief available under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, a commodity pool operator must:


(*1*) Prior to the date upon which it is required to distribute and submit an audited Annual Report for the pool's first fiscal year, obtain a written waiver of the pool participant's right to receive an audited Annual Report for the pool's first fiscal year from each participant other than a participant who is the pool operator, the pool's commodity trading advisor, any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the pool operator or trading advisor, or any principal of the foregoing. The waiver may be included in the subscription agreement for the pool or other agreement with the participant; *Provided, however,* That the waiver is a separate page in the agreement and the pool operator requires the participant to separately sign and date it. The waiver must be in a form substantially as follows: “[Name of participant], a participant in [Name of pool], voluntarily waives the right under CFTC Regulation 4.22(d) to receive an audited Annual Report for the fiscal year ended [end date of the pool's first fiscal year] and will accept in lieu thereof an unaudited Annual Report covering [the stub period] and an audited Annual Report covering [the start date of the stub period] through [the end date of the pool's first twelve-month fiscal year].”; and


(*2*) On or before the date upon which it is required to distribute and submit the Annual Report for the pool's first fiscal year, file a notice with the National Futures Association, along with a certification that it has received the required written waiver from each participant who is not the pool operator, the pool's commodity trading advisor, any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the pool operator or trading advisor, or any principal of the foregoing, and who has been a participant in the pool for its first fiscal year.


(*i*) The notice must contain: The name, main business address, main telephone number and National Futures Association registration identification number of the commodity pool operator; the name and identification number of the commodity pool for which the pool operator is claiming relief; and the beginning and end dates of the stub period of the pool;


(*ii*) The notice must include a representation that the commodity pool operator meets the criteria of paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A) of this section and that it will comply with the condition of paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section; and


(*iii*) The notice must be signed by the commodity pool operator in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.


(D)(*1*) Each unaudited Annual Report for which the relief available under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section has been claimed must prominently disclose on the cover page thereof: “Pursuant to an exemption from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, this unaudited Annual Report covers the period from [beginning date of the stub period of the pool] to the end of the pool's first fiscal year, a period of [number] months.”


(*2*) The next Annual Report for the pool must prominently disclose on the cover page thereof: “Pursuant to an exemption from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, this audited Annual Report covers the period from [beginning date of the stub period of the pool] to the end of the pool's first 12-month fiscal year, a period of [number] months.”


(E) The commodity pool operator must maintain in accordance with § 4.23 of this chapter each waiver it has obtained to claim the relief available under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section.


(3) The commodity pool operator must continue to use the elected fiscal year for the pool unless it provides written notice of any proposed change to all participants and files such notice with the National Futures Association at least 90 days before the change and the National Futures Association does not disapprove the change within 30 days after the filing of the notice.


(h)(1) Each Account Statement and Annual Report, including an Account Statement or Annual Report provided pursuant to § 4.7(b) or 4.12(b), must contain an oath or affirmation that, to the best of the knowledge and belief of the individual making the oath or affirmation, the information contained in the document is accurate and complete; *Provided, however,* That it shall be unlawful for the individual to make such oath or affirmation if the individual knows or should know that any of the information in the document is not accurate and complete.


(2) Each oath or affirmation must be made by a representative duly authorized to bind the pool operator, and


(i) for the copy of a commodity pool's Annual Report submitted to the National Futures Association, such representative shall satisfy the required oath or affirmation through compliance with the National Futures Association's electronic filing procedures, and


(ii) for a commodity pool Account Statement or Annual Report distributed to participants, a facsimile of the manually signed oath or affirmation of such representative may be used so long as the manually signed original is retained in accordance with § 4.23.


(3) For each manually signed oath or affirmation, there must be typed beneath the signed oath or affirmation:


(i) The name of the individual signing the document;


(ii) The capacity in which he is signing;


(iii) The name of the commodity pool operator for whom he is signing; and


(iv) The name of the commodity pool for which the document is being distributed.


(i) The Account Statement or Annual Report may be distributed to a pool participant by means of electronic media if the participant so consents; *Provided,* That prior to the transmission of any Account Statement or Annual Report by means of electronic media, a commodity pool operator must disclose to the participant that it intends to distribute electronically the Account Statement or Annual Report or both documents, as the case may be, absent objection from the participant, which objection, if any, the participant must make no later than 10 business days following its receipt of the disclosure.
