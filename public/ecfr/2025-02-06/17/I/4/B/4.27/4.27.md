(2) The following categories of persons shall not be considered reporting persons, as that term is defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section:

(iv) A commodity trading advisor that is registered, but directs only the accounts of commodity pools for which it is exempt from registration as a commodity pool operator, and though registered, complies with § 4.14(a)(5).






(c) *Reporting.* (1) Each reporting person shall file with the National Futures Association, a report with respect to the directed assets of each pool under the advisement of a commodity pool operator consistent with appendix A to this part, or a commodity trading advisor consistent with appendix C to this part.


(2) A reporting person required to file NFA Form PQR with the National Futures Association for the reporting period may make such filing in lieu of the report required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section; *provided that,* the Commission has determined that NFA Form PQR is substantively consistent with appendix A to this part.
