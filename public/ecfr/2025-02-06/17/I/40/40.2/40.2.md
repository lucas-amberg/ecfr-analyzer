(v) A concise explanation and analysis that is complete with respect to the product's terms and conditions, the underlying commodity, and the product's compliance with applicable provisions of the Act, including core principles, and the Commission's regulations thereunder. This explanation and analysis shall either be accompanied by the documentation relied upon to establish the basis for compliance with applicable law, or incorporate information contained in such documentation, with appropriate citations to data sources;


(vi) A certification that the registered entity posted a notice of a pending product certification with the Commission and a copy of the submission, concurrent with the filing of a submission with the Commission, on the registered entity's website. Information that the registered entity seeks to keep confidential may be redacted from the documents published on the registered entity's website but must be republished consistent with any determination made pursuant to § 40.8(c)(4); and


(vii) A request for confidential treatment, if appropriate, as permitted under § 40.8.


(b) *Additional information.* If requested by Commission staff, a registered entity shall provide any additional evidence, information or data that demonstrates that the contract meets, initially or on a continuing basis, the requirements of the Act or the Commission's regulations or policies thereunder.


(c) *Stay.* The Commission may stay the listing of a contract pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section during the pendency of Commission proceedings for filing a false certification or during the pendency of a petition to alter or amend the contract terms and conditions pursuant to Section 8a(7) of the Act. The decision to stay the listing of a contract in such circumstances shall not be delegable to any employee of the Commission.

(i) Each particular swap within the certified class of swaps is based upon an excluded commodity specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section;

(iii) The pricing source, formula, procedure, and methodology for calculating reference prices and payment obligations in each particular swap within the certified class of swaps is identical to a pricing source, formula, procedure, and methodology for calculating reference prices and payment obligations in a product previously submitted to the Commission and certified or approved pursuant to this section or § 40.3; and


(iv) Each particular swap within the certified class of swaps is based upon an excluded commodity involving an identical currency or identical currencies.
