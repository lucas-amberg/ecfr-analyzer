(6) Rule certifications implemented in response to an emergency.


(i) Rules or rule amendments implemented under procedures of the governing board to respond to an emergency as defined in § 40.1, shall, if practicable, be filed with the Commission prior to the implementation or, if not practicable, be filed with the Commission at the earliest possible time after implementation, but in no event more than twenty-four hours after implementation.

(9) Notwithstanding the 10 business day filing requirement of paragraphs (a)(3) and (b)(1) of this section, a registered entity may file a submission and certification of a new rule or a rule amendment that delists, or withdraws the certification of, a product that has no open interest and may make the delisting or withdrawal of the product with no open interest effective immediately upon filing the submission, provided that the submission is made in compliance with paragraphs (a)(1), (2) and (7) of this section.


(b) *Review by the Commission.* (1) The Commission shall have 10 business days to review the new rule or rule amendment before the new rule or rule amendment is deemed certified and can be made effective, unless the Commission notifies the registered entity during the 10-business day review period that it intends to issue a stay of the certification under paragraph (c) of this section.


(2) Any amendment or supplementation made by the registered entity to the submission will be treated as the filing of a new submission under this section and be subject to the initial 10-business day review period in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, unless the amendment or supplementation is requested by the Commission or is made for correction of typographical errors, renumbering or other non-substantive revisions.


(c) *Stay*—(1) *Stay of certification of new rule or rule amendment.* The Commission may stay the certification of a new rule or rule amendment submitted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section by issuing a notification informing the registered entity that the Commission is staying the certification of the rule or rule amendment on the grounds that the rule or rule amendment presents novel or complex issues that require additional time to analyze, the rule or rule amendment is accompanied by an inadequate explanation or the rule or rule amendment is potentially inconsistent with the Act or the Commission's regulations thereunder. The Commission will have an additional 90 days from the date of the notification to conduct the review. The decision to stay the certification of a rule in such circumstances shall be delegable pursuant to § 40.7 of this part.


(2) *Public comment.* The Commission shall provide a 30-day comment period within the 90-day period in which the stay is in effect as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The Commission shall publish a notice of the 30-day comment period on the Commission website. Comments from the public shall be submitted as specified in that notice.


(3) *Expiration of a stay of certification of new rule or rule amendment.* A new rule or rule amendment subject to a stay pursuant to this paragraph (c)(3) shall become effective and can be implemented, pursuant to the certification, at the expiration of the 90-day review period described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section unless the Commission withdraws the stay prior to that time, or the Commission notifies the registered entity during the 90-day time period that it objects to the certification on the grounds that the proposed rule or rule amendment is inconsistent with the Act or 17 CFR chapter I.


(4) *Stay of effectiveness of rules or rule amendments already implemented.* The Commission may stay the effectiveness of an implemented rule during the pendency of Commission proceedings for filing a false certification or during the pendency of a petition to alter or amend the rule pursuant to section 8a(7) of the Act. The decision to stay the effectiveness of a rule in such circumstances shall not be delegable to any employee of the Commission.


(5) *Effect of objection.* (i) Notification to a registered entity under paragraph (c) of this section of the Commission's objection to a certification by a registered entity on the grounds that the proposed rule or rule amendment is inconsistent with the Act or the Commission's regulations does not prevent the registered entity from subsequently submitting a revised version of the proposed rule or rule amendment for certification or Commission review and approval, or from submitting the new rule or rule amendment as initially proposed, in a supplemented submission; the revised or supplemented submission will be reviewed without prejudice.


(ii) Notification to a registered entity under paragraph (c) of this section of the Commission's objection to a certification by a registered entity shall be presumptive evidence that the entity may not truthfully certify under this part that the same, or substantially the same, proposed rule or rule amendment complies with the Act and the Commission's regulations thereunder.
