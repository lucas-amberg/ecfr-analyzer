# § 43.3   Method and timing for real-time public reporting.

(a) *Responsibilities to report swap transaction and pricing data in real-time*—(1) *In general.* The reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, or designated contract market responsible for reporting a swap as determined by this section shall report the publicly reportable swap transaction to a swap data repository as soon as technologically practicable after execution, subject to paragraphs (a)(2) through (6) of this section. Such reporting shall be done in the manner set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.


(2) *Swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market.* For each swap executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market, the swap execution facility or designated contract market shall report swap transaction and pricing data to a swap data repository as soon as technologically practicable after execution.


(3) *Off-facility swaps.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(4) through (6) of this section, a reporting counterparty shall report all publicly reportable swap transactions that are off-facility swaps to a swap data repository for the appropriate asset class in accordance with the rules set forth in this part as soon as technologically practicable after execution. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties prior to execution, the following shall be the reporting counterparty for a publicly reportable swap transaction that is an off-facility swap:


(i) If only one party is a swap dealer or major swap participant, then the swap dealer or major swap participant shall be the reporting counterparty;


(ii) If one party is a swap dealer and the other party is a major swap participant, then the swap dealer shall be the reporting counterparty;


(iii) If both parties are swap dealers, then the swap dealers shall designate which party shall be the reporting counterparty prior to execution of such swap;


(iv) If both parties are major swap participants, then the major swap participants shall designate which party shall be the reporting counterparty prior to execution of such swap; and


(v) If neither party is a swap dealer or a major swap participant, then the parties shall designate which party shall be the reporting counterparty prior to execution of such swap.


(4) *Post-priced swaps*—(i) *Post-priced swaps reporting delays.* The reporting counterparty may delay reporting a post-priced swap to a swap data repository until the earlier of the price being determined and 11:59:59 p.m. eastern time on the execution date. If the price of a publicly reportable swap transaction that is a post-priced swap is not determined by 11:59:59 p.m. eastern time on the execution date, the reporting counterparty shall report to a swap data repository by 11:59:59 p.m. eastern time on the execution date all swap transaction and pricing data for such post-priced swap other than the price and any other then-undetermined swap transaction and pricing data and shall report each such item of previously undetermined swap transaction and pricing data as soon as technologically practicable after such item is determined.


(ii) *Other economic terms.* The post-priced swap reporting delay set forth in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section does not apply to publicly reportable swap transactions with respect to which the price is known at execution, but one or more other economic or other terms are not yet known at the time of execution.


(5) *Clearing swaps.* Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, if a clearing swap, as defined in § 45.1(a) of this chapter, is a publicly reportable swap transaction, the derivatives clearing organization that is a party to such swap shall be the reporting counterparty and shall fulfill all reporting counterparty obligations for such swap as soon as technologically practicable after execution.


(6) *Prime broker swaps.* (i) A mirror swap is not a publicly reportable swap transaction. Execution of a trigger swap, for purposes of determining when execution occurs under paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, shall be deemed to occur at the time of the pricing event for such trigger swap.


(ii) With respect to a given set of swaps, if it is unclear which is, or are the mirror swap(s) and which is the related trigger swap (including, but not limited to, situations where there is more than one prime broker counterparty within such set of swaps and situations where the pricing event for each set of swaps occurs between prime brokerage agents of a common prime broker), or if under the prime brokerage agency arrangement, the trigger swap would occur between two prime brokers, the prime broker(s) shall determine which of the prime broker swaps shall be treated as the trigger swap and which are mirror swaps.


(iii) Trigger swaps shall be reported in accordance with the following:


(A) Trigger swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market shall be reported pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section; and


(B) Off-facility trigger swaps shall be reported pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, except that if a counterparty to a trigger swap is a swap dealer that is not a prime broker with respect to that trigger swap, then that swap dealer counterparty shall be the reporting counterparty for the trigger swap.


(7) *Third-party facilitation of data reporting.* Any person required by this part to report swap transaction and pricing data, while remaining fully responsible for reporting as required by this part, may contract with a third-party service provider to facilitate reporting.


(b) *Public dissemination of swap transaction and pricing data by swap data repositories in real-time*—(1) *In general.* A swap data repository shall publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data as soon as technologically practicable after such data is received from a swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty, unless such swap transaction and pricing data is subject to a time delay described in § 43.5, in which case the swap transaction and pricing data shall be publicly disseminated in the manner described in § 43.5.


(2) *Compliance with 17 CFR part 49.* Any swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time shall comply with part 49 of this chapter.


(3) *Prohibitions on disclosure of data.* (i) If there is a swap data repository for an asset class, a swap execution facility or designated contract market shall not disclose swap transaction and pricing data relating to publicly reportable swap transactions in such asset class, prior to the public dissemination of such data by a swap data repository unless:


(A) Such disclosure is made no earlier than the transmittal of such data to a swap data repository for public dissemination;


(B) Such disclosure is only made to market participants on such swap execution facility or designated contract market;


(C) Market participants are provided advance notice of such disclosure; and


(D) Any such disclosure by the swap execution facility or designated contract market is non-discriminatory.


(ii) If there is a swap data repository for an asset class, a swap dealer or major swap participant shall not disclose swap transaction and pricing data relating to publicly reportable swap transactions in such asset class, prior to the public dissemination of such data by a swap data repository unless:


(A) Such disclosure is made no earlier than the transmittal of such data to a swap data repository for public dissemination;


(B) Such disclosure is only made to the customer base of such swap dealer or major swap participant, including parties who maintain accounts with or have been swap counterparties with such swap dealer or major swap participant;


(C) Swap counterparties are provided advance notice of such disclosure; and


(D) Any such disclosure by the swap dealer or major swap participant is non-discriminatory.


(4) *Acceptance and public dissemination of all swaps in an asset class.* Any swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time for swaps in its selected asset class shall accept and publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data in real-time for all publicly reportable swap transactions within such asset class, unless otherwise prescribed by the Commission.


(5) *Annual independent review.* Any swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time shall perform, on an annual basis, an independent review in accordance with established audit procedures and standards of the swap data repository's security and other system controls for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the requirements in this part.


(c) *Availability of swap transaction and pricing data to the public.* (1) Swap data repositories shall make swap transaction and pricing data available on their websites for a period of time that is at least one year after the initial public dissemination of such data and shall make instructions freely available on their websites on how to download, save, and search such data.


(2) Swap transaction and pricing data that is publicly disseminated pursuant to this paragraph shall be made available free of charge.


(d) *Data reported to swap data repositories.* (1) In reporting swap transaction and pricing data to a swap data repository, each reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, or designated contract market shall report the swap transaction and pricing data as described in the elements in appendix A of this part in the form and manner provided in the technical specification published by the Commission pursuant to § 43.7.


(2) In reporting swap transaction and pricing data to a swap data repository, each reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, or designated contract market making such report shall satisfy the data validation procedures of the swap data repository.


(3) In reporting swap transaction and pricing data to a swap data repository, each reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, or designated contract market shall use the facilities, methods, or data standards provided or required by the swap data repository to which the entity or reporting counterparty reports the data.


(e) *Correction of errors*—(1) *Swap execution facilities, designated contract markets, and reporting counterparties.* Any swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty that by any means becomes aware of any error relating to swap transaction and pricing data that it was required to report under this part shall correct the error. To correct an error, the swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty shall submit complete and accurate swap transaction and pricing data to the swap data repository that maintains the swap transaction and pricing data for the relevant swap, or completely and accurately report swap transaction and pricing data for a swap that was not previously reported to a swap data repository as required under this part, as applicable. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the requirement to correct any error applies regardless of the state of the swap that is the subject of the swap transaction and pricing data, including a swap that has terminated, matured, or otherwise is no longer considered to be an open swap.


(i) *Timing requirement for correcting errors.* The swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty shall correct any error as soon as technologically practicable after discovery of the error. In all cases, errors shall be corrected within seven business days after discovery. Any error that a reporting counterparty discovers or could have discovered during the verification process required under § 45.14(b) of this chapter is considered discovered for the purposes of this section as of the moment the reporting counterparty began the verification process during which the error was first discovered or discoverable.


(ii) *Notification of failure to timely correct.* If the swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty will, for any reason, fail to timely correct an error, the swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty shall notify the Director of the Division of Data, or such other employee or employees of the Commission as the Director may designate. The notification shall be in the form and manner, and according to the instructions, specified by the Director of the Division of Data in concurrence with the Director of the Division of Market Oversight, or such other employee or employees of the Commission as the respective Director may designate. Unless otherwise instructed by the Director of the Division of Data, or such other employee or employees of the Commission as the Director may designate from time to time, the notification shall include an initial assessment of the scope of the error or errors that were discovered, and shall include any initial remediation plan for correcting the error or errors, if an initial remediation plan exists. This notification shall be made within 12 hours of the swap execution facility's, designated contract market's, or reporting counterparty's determination that it will fail to timely correct the error.




(iii) *Form and manner for error correction.* In order to satisfy the requirements of this section, a swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty shall conform to a swap data repository's policies and procedures created pursuant to § 49.10 of this chapter for correction of errors.


(2) *Non-reporting counterparties.* Any non-reporting counterparty that by any means becomes aware of any error in the swap transaction and pricing data for a swap to which it is the non-reporting counterparty, shall notify the reporting counterparty for the swap of the error as soon as technologically practicable after discovery, but not later than three business days following discovery of the error. If the non-reporting counterparty does not know the identity of the reporting counterparty, the non-reporting counterparty shall notify the swap execution facility or designated contract market where the swap was executed of the error as soon as technologically practicable after discovery, but no later than three business days following the discovery. Such notice from the non-reporting counterparty to the swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty constitutes discovery under this section.


(3) *Exception.* The requirements to correct errors set forth in paragraph (e) of this section only apply to errors in swap transaction and pricing data relating to swaps for which the record retention period under § 45.2 of this chapter has not expired as of the time the error is discovered. Errors in swap transaction and pricing data relating to swaps for which the record retention periods under § 45.2 of this chapter have expired at the time that the errors are discovered are not subject to the requirements to correct errors set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.


(4) *Error defined*—(i) *Errors.* For the purposes of this part, there is an error when swap transaction and pricing data is not completely and accurately reported. This includes, but is not limited to, the following circumstances:


(A) Any of the swap transaction and pricing data for a swap reported to a swap data repository is incorrect or any of the swap transaction and pricing data that is maintained by a swap data repository differs from any of the relevant swap transaction and pricing data contained in the books and records of a party to the swap.


(B) Any of the swap transaction and pricing data for a swap that is required to be reported to a swap data repository or to be maintained by a swap data repository is not reported to a swap data repository or is not maintained by the swap data repository as required by this part.


(C) None of the swap transaction and pricing data for a swap that is required to be reported to a swap data repository or to be maintained by a swap data repository is reported to a swap data repository or is maintained by a swap data repository.


(D) Any of the swap transaction and pricing data for a swap that is no longer an open swap is maintained by the swap data repository as if the swap is still an open swap.


(ii) *Presumption.* For the purposes of this section, there is a presumption that an error exists if the swap data or the swap transaction and pricing data that is maintained and disseminated by an SDR for a swap is not complete and accurate. This includes, but is not limited to, the swap data that the SDR makes available to the reporting counterparty for verification under § 49.11 of this chapter.


(f) *Data validation acceptance message.* (1) A swap data repository shall validate each swap transaction and pricing data report submitted to the swap data repository and notify the reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, or designated contract market submitting the report whether the report satisfied the data validation procedures of the swap data repository as soon as technologically practicable after accepting the swap transaction and pricing data report. A swap data repository may satisfy the requirements of this paragraph by making available data validation acceptance messages as required by § 49.10 of this chapter.


(2) If a swap transaction and pricing data report submitted to a swap data repository does not satisfy the data validation procedures of the swap data repository, the reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, or designated contract market required to submit the report has not satisfied its obligation to report swap transaction and pricing data in the manner provided by paragraph (d) of this section. The reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, or designated contract market has not satisfied its obligation until it submits the swap transaction and pricing data report in the manner provided by paragraph (d) of this section, which includes the requirement to satisfy the data validation procedures of the swap data repository.


(g) *Fees.* Any fee or charge assessed on a reporting counterparty, swap execution facility, or designated contract market by a swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time for the collection of such data shall be equitable and non-discriminatory. If such swap data repository allows a fee discount based on the volume of data reported to it for public dissemination, then such discount shall be made available to all reporting counterparties, swap execution facilities, and designated contract markets in an equitable and non-discriminatory manner.
