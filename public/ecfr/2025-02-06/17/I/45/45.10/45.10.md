# ยง 45.10   Reporting to a single swap data repository.

All swap transaction and pricing data and swap data for a given swap shall be reported to a single swap data repository, which shall be the swap data repository to which the first report of such data is made, unless the reporting counterparty changes the swap data repository to which such data is reported pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.


(a) *Swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market.* To ensure that all swap transaction and pricing data and swap data for a swap executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market is reported to a single swap data repository:


(1) The swap execution facility or designated contract market shall report all swap transaction and pricing data and required swap creation data for a swap to a single swap data repository. As soon as technologically practicable after execution of the swap, the swap execution facility or designated contract market shall transmit to both counterparties to the swap, and to the derivatives clearing organization, if any, that will clear the swap, the identity of the swap data repository to which such data is reported.


(2) Thereafter, all swap transaction and pricing data, required swap creation data, and required swap continuation data for the swap shall be reported to that same swap data repository, unless the reporting counterparty changes the swap data repository to which such data is reported pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.


(b) *Off-facility swaps that are not clearing swaps.* To ensure that all swap transaction and pricing data and swap data for an off-facility swap that is not a clearing swap is reported to a single swap data repository:


(1) The reporting counterparty shall report all swap transaction and pricing data and required swap creation data to a single swap data repository. As soon as technologically practicable after execution, the reporting counterparty shall transmit to the other counterparty to the swap, and to the derivatives clearing organization, if any, that will clear the swap, the identity of the swap data repository to which such data is reported.


(2) Thereafter, all swap transaction and pricing data, required swap creation data, and required swap continuation data for the swap shall be reported to the same swap data repository, unless the reporting counterparty changes the swap data repository to which such data is reported pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.


(c) *Clearing swaps.* To ensure that all swap transaction and pricing data and swap data for a given clearing swap, including clearing swaps that replace a particular original swap or that are created upon execution of the same transaction and that do not replace an original swap, is reported to a single swap data repository:


(1) The derivatives clearing organization that is a counterparty to such clearing swap shall report all swap transaction and pricing data and required swap creation data for that clearing swap to a single swap data repository. As soon as technologically practicable after acceptance of an original swap for clearing, or execution of a clearing swap that does not replace an original swap, the derivatives clearing organization shall transmit to the counterparty to each clearing swap the identity of the swap data repository to which such data is reported.


(2) Thereafter, all swap transaction and pricing data, required swap creation data and required swap continuation data for that clearing swap shall be reported by the derivatives clearing organization to the same swap data repository to which swap data has been reported pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unless the reporting counterparty changes the swap data repository to which such data is reported pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.


(3) For clearing swaps that replace a particular original swap, and for equal and opposite clearing swaps that are created upon execution of the same transaction and that do not replace an original swap, the derivatives clearing organization shall report all swap transaction and pricing data, required swap creation data, and required swap continuation data for such clearing swaps to a single swap data repository.


(d) *Change of swap data repository for swap transaction and pricing data and swap data reporting.* A reporting counterparty may change the swap data repository to which swap transaction and pricing data and swap data is reported as set forth in this paragraph.


(1) *Notifications.* At least five business days prior to changing the swap data repository to which the reporting counterparty reports swap transaction and pricing data and swap data for a swap, the reporting counterparty shall provide notice of such change to the other counterparty to the swap, the swap data repository to which swap transaction and pricing data and swap data is currently reported, and the swap data repository to which swap transaction and pricing data and swap data will be reported going forward. Such notification shall include the unique transaction identifier of the swap and the date on which the reporting counterparty will begin reporting such swap transaction and pricing data and swap data to a different swap data repository.


(2) *Procedure.* After providing the notifications required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the reporting counterparty shall follow paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section to complete the change of swap data repository.


(i) The reporting counterparty shall report the change of swap data repository to the swap data repository to which the reporting counterparty is currently reporting swap transaction and pricing data and swap data as a life cycle event for such swap pursuant to ยง 45.4.


(ii) On the same day that the reporting counterparty reports required swap continuation data as required by paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the reporting counterparty shall also report the change of swap data repository to the swap data repository to which swap transaction and pricing data and swap data will be reported going forward as a life cycle event for such swap pursuant to ยง 45.4. The required swap continuation data report shall identify the swap using the same unique transaction identifier used to identify the swap at the previous swap data repository.


(iii) Thereafter, all swap transaction and pricing data, required swap creation data, and required swap continuation data for the swap shall be reported to the same swap data repository, unless the reporting counterparty for the swap makes another change to the swap data repository to which such data is reported pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
