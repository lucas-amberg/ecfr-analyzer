# § 45.6   Legal entity identifiers.

Each swap execution facility, designated contract market, derivatives clearing organization, swap data repository, entity reporting pursuant to § 45.9, and counterparty to any swap that is eligible to receive a legal entity identifier shall obtain, maintain, and be identified in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting pursuant to this part by a single legal entity identifier as specified in this section.


(a) *Definitions.* As used in this section:


*Local operating unit* means an entity authorized under the standards of the Global Legal Entity Identifier System to issue legal entity identifiers.


*Reference data* means all identification and relationship information, as set forth in the standards of the Global Legal Entity Identifier System, of the legal entity or individual to which a legal entity identifier is assigned.


*Self-registration* means submission by a legal entity or individual of its own reference data.


*Third-party registration* means submission of reference data for a legal entity or individual that is or may become a swap counterparty, made by an entity or organization other than the legal entity or individual identified by the submitted reference data. Examples of third-party registration include, without limitation, submission by a swap dealer or major swap participant of reference data for its swap counterparties, and submission by a national numbering agency, national registration agency, or data service provider of reference data concerning legal entities or individuals with respect to which the agency or service provider maintains information.


(b) *International standard for the legal entity identifier.* The legal entity identifier used in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting required by this part shall be issued under, and shall conform to, ISO Standard 17442, Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), issued by the International Organization for Standardization.


(c) *Reference data reporting.* Reference data for each swap execution facility, designated contract market, derivatives clearing organization, swap data repository, entity reporting pursuant to § 45.9, and counterparty to any swap shall be reported, by self-registration, third-party registration, or both, to a local operating unit in accordance with the standards set by the Global Legal Entity Identifier System. All subsequent changes and corrections to reference data previously reported shall be reported, by self-registration, third-party registration, or both, to a local operating unit as soon as technologically practicable following occurrence of any such change or discovery of the need for a correction.


(d) *Use of the legal entity identifier.* (1) Each swap execution facility, designated contract market, derivatives clearing organization, swap data repository, entity reporting pursuant to § 45.9, and swap counterparty shall use legal entity identifiers to identify itself and swap counterparties in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting pursuant to this part. If a swap counterparty is not eligible to receive a legal entity identifier as determined by the Global Legal Entity Identifier System, such counterparty shall be identified in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting pursuant to this part with an alternate identifier as prescribed by the Commission pursuant to § 45.13(a) of this chapter.


(2) Each swap dealer, major swap participant, swap execution facility, designated contract market, derivatives clearing organization, and swap data repository shall maintain and renew its legal identity identifier in accordance with the standards set by the Global Legal Entity Identifier System.


(3) Each financial entity reporting counterparty executing a swap with a counterparty that is eligible to receive a legal entity identifier, but has not been assigned a legal entity identifier, shall, prior to reporting any required swap creation data for such swap, use best efforts to cause a legal entity identifier to be assigned to the counterparty. If these efforts do not result in a legal entity identifier being assigned to the counterparty prior to the reporting of required swap creation data, the financial entity reporting counterparty shall promptly provide the identity and contact information of the counterparty to the Commission.


(4) For swaps previously reported pursuant to this part using substitute counterparty identifiers assigned by a swap data repository prior to Commission designation of a legal entity identifier system, each swap data repository shall map the legal entity identifiers for the counterparties to the substitute counterparty identifiers in the record for each such swap.
