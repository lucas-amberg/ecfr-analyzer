# § 46.4   Unique identifiers.

The unique identifier requirements for data reporting with respect to pre-enactment or transition swaps shall be as follows:


(a) By the compliance date, the reporting counterparty (as defined by part 45 of this chapter) for each pre-enactment or transition swap in existence on or after April 25, 2011, for which an initial data report is required by this part 46, shall obtain for itself a legal entity identifier as provided in § 45.6 of this chapter (or if the Commission has not yet designated a legal entity identifier system, a substitute counterparty identifier), and shall include its own legal entity identifier (or substitute counterparty identifier) in the initial data report concerning the swap. With respect to the legal entity identifier (or substitute counterparty identifier) of the reporting counterparty, the reporting counterparty and the swap data repository to which the swap is reported shall comply thereafter with all unique identifier requirements of § 45.6 of this chapter.


(b) Within 180 days after the compliance date, the non-reporting counterparty for each pre-enactment or transition swap in existence on or after April 25, 2011, for which an initial data report is required by this part 46, shall obtain a legal entity identifier as provided in § 45.6 of this chapter (or if the Commission has not yet designated a legal entity identifier system, a substitute counterparty identifier as provided in § 45.6(f) of this chapter), and shall provide its legal entity identifier (or substitute counterparty identifier) to the reporting counterparty. Upon receipt of the non-reporting counterparty's legal entity identifier (or substitute counterparty identifier), the reporting counterparty shall provide it to the swap data repository to which swap data for the swap was reported. Thereafter, with respect to the legal entity identifier (or substitute counterparty identifier) of the non-reporting counterparty, the counterparties to the swap and the swap data repository to which it is reported shall comply with all requirements of § 45.6 of this chapter.


(c) The legal entity identifier requirements of parts 46 and 45 of this chapter shall not apply to pre-enactment or transition swaps expired or terminated prior to April 25, 2011.


(d) The unique swap identifier, unique transaction identifier, and unique product identifier requirements of part 45 of this chapter shall not apply to pre-enactment or transition swaps.
