(3) *Direct electronic access.* For the purposes of this section, the term “*direct electronic access”* shall mean an electronic system, platform, framework, or other technology that provides internet-based or other form of access to real-time SDR data that is acceptable to the Commission and also provides scheduled data transfers to Commission electronic systems.


(c) *Commission access.* A swap data repository shall provide access to the Commission for all SDR data maintained by the swap data repository pursuant to this chapter in accordance with this paragraph (c).


(1) *Direct electronic access requirements.* A swap data repository shall provide direct electronic access to the Commission or the Commission's designee, including another registered entity, in order for the Commission to carry out its legal and statutory responsibilities under the Act and the Commission's regulations in 17 CFR chapter I. A swap data repository shall maintain all SDR data reported to the swap data repository in a format acceptable to the Commission, and shall transmit all SDR data requested by the Commission to the Commission as instructed by the Commission. Such instructions may include, but are not limited to, the method, timing, and frequency of transmission, as well as the format and scope of the SDR data to be transmitted.


(2) *Monitoring tools.* A swap data repository is required to provide the Commission with proper tools for the monitoring, screening and analyzing of SDR data, including, but not limited to, Web-based services, services that provide automated transfer of SDR data to Commission systems, various software and access to the staff of the swap data repository and/or third-party service providers or agents familiar with the operations of the swap data repository, which can provide assistance to the Commission regarding data structure and content.


(3) *Authorized users.* The SDR data provided to the Commission by a swap data repository shall be accessible only by authorized users. The swap data repository shall maintain and provide a list of authorized users in the manner and frequency determined by the Commission.


(d) *Other regulators*—(1) *General procedure for gaining access to swap data repository data.* Except as set forth in paragraph (d)(2) or (3) of this section—


(i) A person who is not an appropriate domestic regulator or an appropriate foreign regulator and who seeks to gain access to the swap data maintained by a swap data repository is required to first become an appropriate domestic regulator or appropriate foreign regulator through the process set forth in paragraph (h) of this section, and


(ii) Appropriate domestic regulators and appropriate foreign regulators seeking to gain access to the swap data maintained by a swap data repository are required to apply for access by filing a request for access with the swap data repository and certifying that it is acting within the scope of its jurisdiction, comply with paragraph (d)(6) of this section prior to receiving such access and, if applicable after receiving such access, comply with the notification requirement in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section applicable to appropriate domestic regulators and appropriate foreign regulators.


(2) *Domestic regulator with regulatory responsibility over a swap data repository.* When a swap data repository that is registered with the Commission pursuant to this chapter is also registered with a domestic regulator pursuant to a separate statutory authority, and such domestic regulator seeks access to swap data that has been reported to such swap data repository pursuant to the domestic regulator's regulatory regime, such access is not subject to the requirements of sections 21(c)(7) or 21(d) of the Act, this paragraph (d) or § 49.18.


(3) *Foreign regulator with regulatory responsibility over a swap data repository.* When a swap data repository that is registered with the Commission pursuant to this chapter is also registered with, or recognized or otherwise authorized by, a foreign regulator that has supervisory authority over such swap data repository pursuant to foreign law and/or regulation, and such foreign regulator seeks access to swap data that has been reported to such swap data repository pursuant to the foreign regulator's regulatory regime, such access is not subject to the requirements of sections 21(c)(7) or 21(d) of the Act, this paragraph (d) or § 49.18.


(4) *Obligations of the swap data repository in connection with appropriate domestic regulator or appropriate foreign regulator requests for swap data access.*

 (i) A swap data repository shall notify the Commission promptly after receiving an initial request from an appropriate domestic regulator or appropriate foreign regulator to gain access to swap data maintained by such swap data repository and promptly after receiving any request that does not comport with the scope of the appropriate domestic regulator's or appropriate foreign regulator's jurisdiction, as described and appended to the confidentiality arrangement required by § 49.18(a). Each swap data repository shall maintain records thereafter, pursuant to § 49.12, of the details of such initial request and of all subsequent requests by such appropriate domestic regulator or appropriate foreign regulator for such access.


(ii) The swap data repository shall notify the Commission electronically, in a format specified by the Secretary of the Commission, of the receipt of a request specified in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.


(iii) The swap data repository shall not provide an appropriate domestic regulator or appropriate foreign regulator access to swap data maintained by the swap data repository unless the swap data repository has determined that the swap data to which the appropriate domestic regulator or appropriate foreign regulator seeks access is within the then-current scope of such appropriate domestic regulator's or appropriate foreign regulator's jurisdiction, as described and appended to the confidentiality arrangement required by § 49.18(a). An appropriate domestic regulator or appropriate foreign regulator that has executed a confidentiality arrangement with the Commission pursuant to § 49.18(a) and provided such confidentiality arrangement to one or more swap data repositories shall notify the Commission and each such swap data repository of any change to such appropriate domestic regulator's or appropriate foreign regulator's scope of jurisdiction as described in such confidentiality arrangement. The Commission may direct a swap data repository to suspend, limit, or revoke access to swap data maintained by such swap data repository based on any such change to such appropriate domestic regulator's or appropriate foreign regulator's scope of jurisdiction, and, if so directed in writing, such swap data repository shall so suspend, limit, or revoke such access.


(iv) The swap data repository need not make the determination required pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section more than once with respect to a recurring swap data request. If such request changes, the swap data repository must make a new determination pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section.


(5) *Timing, limitation, suspension, or revocation of swap data access.* Once a swap data repository has—


(i) Notified the Commission, pursuant to paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section, of an initial request for swap data access by an appropriate domestic regulator or appropriate foreign regulator, as applicable, that was submitted pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section,


(ii) Received from such appropriate domestic regulator or appropriate foreign regulator a confidentiality arrangement executed by the Commission and such appropriate domestic regulator or appropriate foreign regulator as required by § 49.18(a), and


(iii) Satisfied its obligations under paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section, such swap data repository shall provide access to the requested swap data; *provided, however,* that such swap data repository shall, if directed by the Commission in writing, limit, suspend or revoke such access should the Commission limit, suspend or revoke the appropriateness determination for such appropriate domestic regulator or appropriate foreign regulator or otherwise direct the swap data repository, in writing, to limit, suspend or revoke such access.


(6) *Confidentiality arrangement.* Consistent with § 49.18(a), the appropriate domestic regulator or appropriate foreign regulator shall, prior to receiving access to any requested swap data, execute the form of confidentiality arrangement set out in appendix B of this part with the Commission; *provided, however,* that the Commission may, in its discretion, agree to execute a confidentiality arrangement with an appropriate domestic regulator or appropriate foreign regulator that is not in the form set forth in appendix B of this part, if the confidentiality arrangement is consistent with the requirements set forth in § 49.18(b).


(e) *Third-party service providers to a swap data repository.* Access to the SDR data and SDR information maintained by a swap data repository may be necessary for certain third parties that provide various technology and data-related services to a swap data repository. Third-party access to the SDR data and SDR information maintained by a swap data repository is permissible subject to the following conditions:


(1) Both the swap data repository and the third party service provider shall have strict confidentiality procedures that protect SDR data and SDR information from improper disclosure.


(2) Prior to a swap data repository granting access to SDR data or SDR information to a third-party service provider, the third-party service provider and the swap data repository shall execute a confidentiality agreement setting forth minimum confidentiality procedures and permissible uses of the SDR data and SDR information maintained by the swap data repository that are equivalent to the privacy procedures for swap data repositories outlined in § 49.16.


(f) *Access by market participants*—(1) *General.* Access by market participants to SDR data maintained by the swap data repository is prohibited other than as set forth in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.


(2) *Exception.* SDR data and SDR information related to a particular swap transaction that is maintained by the swap data repository may be accessed by either counterparty to that particular swap. However, the SDR data and SDR information maintained by the swap data repository that may be accessed by either counterparty to a particular swap shall not include the identity or the legal entity identifier (as such term is used in part 45 of this chapter) of the other counterparty to the swap, or the other counterparty's clearing member for the swap, if the swap is executed anonymously on a swap execution facility or designated contract market, and cleared in accordance with §§ 1.74, 23.610, and 39.12(b)(7) of this chapter.


(g) *Commercial uses of SDR data accepted and maintained by the swap data repository prohibited.* SDR data accepted and maintained by the swap data repository generally may not be used for commercial or business purposes by the swap data repository or any of its affiliated entities.


(1) The swap data repository is required to adopt and implement adequate “firewalls” or controls to protect the reported SDR data required to be maintained under § 49.12 of this part and Section 21(b) of the Act from any improper commercial use.


(2) *Exception.* (A) The swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty that submits the SDR data maintained by the swap data repository may permit the commercial or business use of that data by express written consent.


(B) Swap data repositories shall not as a condition of the reporting of SDR data require a swap execution facility, designated contract market, or reporting counterparty to consent to the use of any reported SDR data for commercial or business purposes.


(3) Swap data repositories responsible for the public dissemination of swap transaction and pricing data shall not make commercial use of such data prior to its public dissemination.


(h) *Appropriateness determination process.* (1) Each person seeking an appropriateness determination pursuant to this paragraph shall file an application with the Commission.


(2) Each applicant seeking an appropriateness determination shall provide sufficient detail in its application to permit the Commission to analyze whether the applicant is acting within the scope of its jurisdiction in seeking access to swap data maintained by a swap data repository, and whether the applicant employs appropriate confidentiality safeguards to ensure that any swap data such applicant receives from a swap data repository will not, except as allowed for in the form of confidentiality arrangement set forth in appendix B to this part 49, be disclosed.


(3) If the Commission determines that an applicant pursuant to this paragraph is, conditionally or unconditionally, appropriate for purposes of section 21(c)(7) of the Act, the Commission shall issue an order setting forth its appropriateness determination. The Commission shall not determine that an applicant pursuant to this paragraph is appropriate unless the Commission is satisfied that—


(i) The applicant employs appropriate confidentiality safeguards to ensure that any swap data such applicant receives from a swap data repository will not be disclosed, except as allowed for in the form of confidentiality arrangement set forth in appendix B to this part 49 or, in the Commission's discretion as set forth in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, in a different form, provided that such confidentiality arrangement contains the elements required in § 49.18(b), and


(ii) Such applicant is acting within the scope of its jurisdiction in seeking access to swap data from a swap data repository.


(4) The Commission reserves the right, in connection with any appropriateness determination with respect to an appropriate domestic regulator or appropriate foreign regulator, to revisit, reassess, limit, suspend or revoke such determination consistent with the Act.
