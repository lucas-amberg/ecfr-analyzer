# § 5.17   Authorization to trade.

No retail foreign exchange dealer, futures commission merchant, introducing broker or any of their associated persons may directly or indirectly effect a retail forex transaction for the account of any customer unless before the transaction the customer, or person designated by the customer to control the account specifically authorized the retail foreign exchange dealer, futures commission merchant, introducing broker or any of their associated persons to effect the transaction. A transaction is “specifically authorized” if the customer or person designated by the customer to control the account specifies:


(a) The precise retail forex transaction to be effected;


(b) The exact amount of the foreign currency to be purchased or sold; and


(c) In the case of an option, the identity of the foreign currency or contract that underlies the option.
