Pursuant to the provisions of sections 4A and 4B of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, to issue notices, under § 270.0-5 of this chapter, with respect to applications for orders under the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and, with respect to section 8(f) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-8(f)), in cases where no application has been filed, where, upon examination, the matter does not appear to the Director to present significant issues that have not been previously settled by the Commission or to raise questions of fact or policy indicating that the public interest or the interest of investors warrants that the Commission consider the matter.


(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, to authorize the issuance of orders where a notice, under § 270.0-5 of this chapter, has been issued and no request for a hearing has been received from any interested person within the period specified in the notice and the Director believes that the matter presents no significant issues that have not been previously settled by the Commission and it does not appear to the Director to be necessary in the public interest or the interest of investors that the Commission consider the matter.


(3) To permit the withdrawal of applications pursuant to the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 *et seq.*)


(4) In connection with the mailing of reports to stockholders and the filing with the Commission of registration statements and of reports:


(i) To grant reasonable extensions of time, upon a showing of good cause and that it would not be contrary to the public interest or inconsistent with the protection of investors; and


(ii) To deny requests for extensions of time, provided the applicant is advised that the applicant can request Commission review of any such denial.


(5) [Reserved]


(6) To authorize the issuance of orders granting confidential treatment pursuant to section 45(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-44(a)) where applications for confidential treatment are made regarding matters of disclosure in registration statements filed pursuant to section 8 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-8), or in reports filed pursuant to section 30 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-29), but only when the Commission has previously by order granted confidential treatment to the same information.


(7) To issue notices, pursuant to Rule 0-5(a) (§ 270.0-5(a) of this chapter) with respect to applications for temporary and permanent orders under section 9(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-9(c)), and to conditionally or unconditionally exempt persons, for a temporary period not exceeding 60 days, from section 9(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-9(a)), if, on the basis of the facts then set forth in the application, it appears that:


(i)(A) The prohibitions of section 9(a), as applied to the applicant, may be unduly or disproportionately severe, or (B) the applicant's conduct has been such as not to make it against the public interest or the protection of investors to grant the temporary exemption; and


(ii) Granting the temporary exemption would protect the interests of the investment companies being served by the applicant by allowing time for the orderly consideration of the application for permanent relief or the orderly transition of the applicant's responsibilities to a successor, or both.


(8) To issue—


(i) Notices, pursuant to Rule 0-5(a) (§ 270.0-5(a) of this chapter), with respect to applications for permanent orders under section 9(c) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-9(c)], and, orders, pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, that exempt conditionally or unconditionally persons from section 9(a) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-9(a)], if, on the basis of the facts then set forth in the application, it appears that:

(B) The prohibitions arise under section 9(a)(3) of the Act solely because the applicant employs, or will employ, a person who is disqualified under section 9(a) (1) or (2) of the Act; and,
