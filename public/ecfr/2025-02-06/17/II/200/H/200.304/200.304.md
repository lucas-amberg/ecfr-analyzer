# § 200.304   Responses to inquiries and requests for access.

(a) *Initial review.* Inquiries and requests for access will be referred to the Commission's Office of FOIA Services which will make the initial determination as to whether the inquiry or request for access will be granted.


(b) *Grant of inquiry or request for access.* If it is determined that an inquiry or request for access will be granted, the requester will be advised in writing. When a request for access is granted, in full or in part, a requester may elect to receive a copy of the requested record electronically, by mail, or in person, and the Office of FOIA Services will comply with that election to the extent practicable.


(c) *Denial of an inquiry or request for access.* If it is determined that no response will be given to an inquiry or that a request for access will not be granted, the requester will be notified of that fact in writing and given the reasons for the denial. The requester also will be advised of his or her right to seek review by the Office of the General Counsel of the initial decision in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 200.308.


(d) *Time for acting on inquiries and requests for access*—(1) *Responses to inquiries.* The Office of FOIA Services will endeavor to inform a requester making an inquiry as to whether the named system of records contains a record pertaining to him or her within 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays) of receipt of such a request. Whenever a response to an inquiry cannot be made within the 10 days, the Office of FOIA Services will inform the requester of the reasons for the delay and the date by which a response may be anticipated.


(2) *Acknowledgement of and responses to requests for access.* (i) Except where the requester appears in person, the Office of FOIA Services will endeavor to acknowledge, in writing, receipt of a request for access within 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays) of receipt of such a request.


(ii) The Office of FOIA Services will endeavor to respond to a request for access to a record pertaining to a requester within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays) after the receipt of the request. If, for good cause shown, a longer period of time is required, the Office of FOIA Services will inform the requester in writing of the reasons for the delay, and indicate when access is expected to be granted or denied.


(3) *Appearance in person.* When a requester appears in person at the Commission to make a request for access and the requester provides the required information and verification of identity, the Office of FOIA Services' staff, if practicable, will indicate whether it is likely that the requester will be given access to the records and, if so, when and under what circumstances such access will be given.


(e) *Exclusion for certain records.* Nothing contained in these rules allows a requester to obtain access to any records or information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.
