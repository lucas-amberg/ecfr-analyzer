# § 200.305   Requests for amendment or correction of records.

(a) *How to a make request for amendment or correction.* A written request for amendment or correction of records may be submitted by email (*foiapa@sec.gov*) or online at the Commission's website at *https://www.sec.gov/forms/request_public_docs.* A requester may alternatively submit a request for amendment or correction by mail to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549 or other mailing address or facsimile number published on the Commission's website at *https://www.sec.gov/oso/help/foia-contact.html.* Requests that are submitted by mail should include the words “PRIVACY ACT REQUEST” in capital letters at the top of the letter and on the face of the envelope.


(1) *Information to be included in requests for amendment or correction.* Each request for amendment or correction must reasonably describe the record sought to be amended or corrected. Such description should include, for example, relevant names, dates, and subject matter to permit the record to be located among the records maintained by the Commission. The requester will be advised promptly if the record cannot be located on the basis of the description given and if further identifying information is necessary before the request can be processed. Verification of the requester's identity as set forth in § 200.303(c) will also be required before an amendment or correction is undertaken.


(2) *Basis for amendment or correction.* A requester seeking an amendment or correction to a record must specify the substance of the amendment or correction and set forth facts and provide such materials that would support the contention that the record as maintained by the Commission is not accurate, timely, or complete or, where a request seeks deletion of information, that the record is not necessary and relevant to accomplish a statutory purpose of the Commission as authorized by law or by Executive Order of the President.


(b) *Acknowledgement of requests for amendment or correction.* Receipt of a request for amendment or correction will be acknowledged in writing within 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays) after such request has been received. When a request for amendment or correction is made in person, the requester will be given a written acknowledgement when the request is presented. The acknowledgement will describe the request received and indicate when it is anticipated that action will be taken on the request.
