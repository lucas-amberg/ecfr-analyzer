# ยง 200.506   Derivative classification.

Any document that includes paraphrases, restatements, or summaries of, or incorporates in new form, information that is already classified shall be assigned the same level of classification as the source; if, however, the basic information appears to have been so changed that no classification, or a lower classification than originally assigned, should be used, the appropriate official of the originating agency or office of origin who has the authority to upgrade, downgrade or declassify the information must be consulted prior to assigning a different classification to the information.
