# ยง 201.33   Proceedings covered.

(a) The Act applies to adversary adjudications conducted by the Commission. These are on the record adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of an Office or Division of the Commission as a party, not including *amicus* participation, is presented by an attorney or other representative who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding. *See* appendix, 17 CFR 201.60.


(b) The fact that the Commission has not identified a type of proceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing of an application by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the Act; whether the proceeding is covered will then be an issue for resolution in proceedings on the application.


(c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include only fees and expenses related to covered issues.
