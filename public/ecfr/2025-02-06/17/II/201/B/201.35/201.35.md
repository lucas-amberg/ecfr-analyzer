# ยง 201.35   Standards for awards.

(a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position of the Office or Division over which the applicant has prevailed was substantially justified. The position of the Office or Division includes, in addition to the position taken by the Office or Division in the adversary adjudication, the action or failure to act by the Office or Division upon which the adversary adjudication is based. The burden of proof that an award should not be made to an eligible prevailing applicant is on counsel for an Office or Division of the Commission, which must show that its position was reasonable in law and fact.


(b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly or unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if special circumstances make the award sought unjust.
