(2) Whether a temporary suspension of a respondent's registration, if any, shall be made a permanent revocation of registration. 


(b) *Modification of temporary order.* If any temporary sanction shall not become permanent under the terms of the initial decision, the hearing officer shall issue a separate order setting aside, limiting or suspending the temporary sanction then in effect in accordance with the terms of the initial decision.
