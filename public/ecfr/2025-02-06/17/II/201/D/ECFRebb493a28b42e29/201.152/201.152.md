# § 201.152   Filing of papers: Form.

(a) *Electronic filing.* Papers filed in connection with any proceeding as defined in § 201.101(a) shall be filed electronically in the form and manner to be specified by the Office of the Secretary in the materials posted on the Commission's website. Papers filed electronically must be received by the Commission by midnight Eastern Time on the date the filing is due.


(1) *Certification of Inability to File Electronically.* If a person reasonably cannot comply with the requirements of this section, due to a lack of access to electronic transmission devices (due to incarceration or otherwise), the person promptly shall file a certification under this paragraph that explains why the person reasonably cannot comply using any additional method of filing listed in § 201.152(a)(2). The filing also must indicate the expected duration of the person's reasonable inability to comply, such as whether the certification is intended to apply to a solitary filing or all filings made during the proceeding. The certification is immediately effective. Upon filing the certification, it will be part of the record of the proceeding, and the person may file paper documents by any additional method listed in § 201.152(a)(2).


(2) *Additional methods of filing.* If a person reasonably cannot file electronically, filing may be made by hand delivering the filing by 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time through a commercial courier service or express delivery service; mailing the filing through the U.S. Postal Service by first class, certified, registered, or express mail delivery so that it is received by the Commission by 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time; or transmitting the filing by facsimile transmission so that it is received by the Commission by midnight Eastern Time.


(b) *Form.* Papers filed in connection with any proceeding as defined in § 201.101(a) shall:


(1) Reflect a page, electronically or otherwise, that measures 8
1/2 x 11 inches when printed, except that, to the extent that the reduction of larger documents would render them illegible when printed, such documents may be filed on larger paper;


(2) Use 12-point or larger typeface;


(3) Include at the head of the paper, or on a title page, the name of the Commission, the title of the proceeding, the names of the parties, the subject of the particular paper or pleading, and the file number assigned to the proceeding;


(4) Be paginated with left hand margins at least 1 inch wide, and other margins of at least 1 inch; and


(5) Be double-spaced, with single-spaced footnotes and single-spaced indented quotations.


(c) *Signature required.* All papers must be dated and signed as provided in § 201.153. Electronic filings that require a signature pursuant to § 201.153 may be signed with an “/s/” notation, but in that event, the use of the filer's log in and password to file a document shall be deemed the signature of the person making the filing for purposes of § 201.153.


(d) *Suitability for recordkeeping.* Documents which, in the opinion of the Office of the Secretary, are not suitable for computer scanning may be rejected.


(e) *Form of briefs.* All briefs containing more than 10 pages shall include a table of contents, an alphabetized table of cases, a table of statutes, and a table of other authorities cited, with references to the pages of the brief wherein they are cited. 


(f) *Scandalous or impertinent matter.* Any scandalous or impertinent matter contained in any brief or pleading or in connection with any oral presentation in a proceeding may be stricken on order of the Commission or the hearing officer.
