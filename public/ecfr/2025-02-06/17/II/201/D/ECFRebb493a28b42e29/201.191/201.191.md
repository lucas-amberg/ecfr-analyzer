# ยง 201.191   Adjudications not required to be determined on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing.

(a) *Scope of the rule.* This rule applies to every case of adjudication, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551, pursuant to any statute which the Commission administers, where adjudication is not required to be determined on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing and which the Commission has not chosen to determine on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing. 


(b) *Procedure.* In every case of adjudication under paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission shall give prompt notice of any adverse action or final disposition to any person who has requested the Commission to make (or not to make) any such adjudication, and furnish to any such person a written statement of reasons therefor. Additional procedures may be specified in rules relating to specific types of such adjudications. Where any such rule provides for the publication of a Commission order, notice of the action or disposition shall be deemed to be given by such publication. 


(c) *Contents of the record.* If the Commission provides notice and opportunity for the submission of written comments by parties to the adjudication or, as the case may be, by other interested persons, written comments received on or before the closing date for comments, unless accorded confidential treatment pursuant to statute or rule of the Commission, become a part of the record of the adjudication. The Commission, in its discretion, may accept and include in the record written comments filed with the Commission after the closing date.
