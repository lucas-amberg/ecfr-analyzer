(a) *Scope of rule.* Applications by a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant for the Commission to permit an associated person (as provided in 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(70)) to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of a registered security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, or to change the terms and conditions thereof, may be made pursuant to this section where the associated person is subject to a statutory disqualification and thereby prohibited from effecting or being involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant under Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) (15 U.S.C. 78o-10(b)(6)).


(b) *Required showing.* The applicant shall make a showing that it would be consistent with the public interest to permit the person associated with the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant who is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant.


(c) *Exclusions.* (1) *Exclusion for other persons.* The security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant shall be excluded from the prohibition in Section 15F(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-10(b)(6)) with respect to an associated person that is not a natural person who is subject to a statutory disqualification.

(d) *Form of application.* Each application with respect to an associated person that is a natural person who is subject to a statutory disqualification shall be supported by a written statement, signed by a knowledgeable person authorized by the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, which addresses the items set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.

(e) *Written statement.* The written statement required by paragraph (d) of this section shall address each of the following, to the extent applicable:

(10) Whether the associated person has been involved in any litigation during the five years preceding the filing of the application concerning investment or investment-related activities or whether there are any unsatisfied judgments outstanding against the associated person concerning investment or investment-related activities, to the extent not otherwise covered by paragraph (e)(9) of this section.

(ii) Any determination by a registered futures association (as provided in 7 U.S.C. 21) that had the associated person applied for registration as an associated person of a swap dealer or a major swap participant, or had a swap dealer or major swap participant listed the associated person as a principal in the swap dealer's or major swap participant's application for registration, notwithstanding statutory disqualification, the application of the associated person or of the swap dealer or major swap participant, as the case may be, would have been granted or denied.


(g) *Notification to applicant and written statement.* In the event an adverse recommendation is proposed by Commission staff with respect to an application made pursuant to this section, the applicant shall be so advised and provided with a written statement of the reasons for such recommendation.

(ii) The person has been granted consent to associate pursuant to the Rule of Practice 193 (17 CFR 201.193) or otherwise by the Commission;

(2) A security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant may permit a person associated with it who is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on its behalf, without making an application pursuant to this section, as provided in paragraph (h)(1), subject to the following conditions:


(i) All matters giving rise to a statutory disqualification under Section 3(a)(39)(A) through (F) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(39)(A) through (F)) have been subject to a process where the membership, association, registration or listing as a principal has been granted or otherwise approved by the Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, self-regulatory organization (as provided in 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26)), or a registered futures association (as provided in 7 U.S.C. 21);


(ii) The terms and conditions of the association with the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant are the same in all material respects as those approved in connection with a previous order, notice or other applicable document granting the membership, association, registration or listing as a principal, as provided in paragraph (h)(1); and


(iii) The security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant has filed a notice with the Commission. The notice shall be filed pursuant to Rules of Practice 151, 152, and 153 (17 CFR 201.151, 201.152, and 201.153). The notice must set forth, as appropriate:


(A) The name of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant;


(B) The name of the associated person subject to a statutory disqualification;


(C) The name of the associated person's prospective supervisor(s) at the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant;


(D) The place of employment for the associated person subject to a statutory disqualification; and


(E) Identification of any agency, self-regulatory organization (as provided in 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26)) or a registered futures association (as provided in 7 U.S.C. 21) that has indicated its agreement with the terms and conditions of the proposed association, registration or listing as a principal.


(i) *Note to ยง 201.194.* (1) Under Section 15F(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-10(b)(6)), except to the extent otherwise specifically provided by rule, regulation, or order of the Commission, it shall be unlawful for a security-based swap dealer or a major security-based swap participant to permit any person associated with a security-based swap dealer or a major security-based swap participant who is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, if the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, of the statutory disqualification.


(2) Subject to the exclusion provided in paragraph (c) of this section, in accordance with the authority granted in Section 15F(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-10(b)(6)), this section governs applications to the Commission by a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant for the Commission to issue an order to permit a natural person who is an associated person of a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant who is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the security-based swap dealer or major security- based swap participant.


(3) Applications made pursuant to this section must show that it would be consistent with the public interest to permit the associated person of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant. In addition to the information specifically required by the rule, applications should be supplemented, where appropriate, by written statements of individuals who are competent to attest to the associated person's character, employment performance, and other relevant information. In addition to the information required by the rule, the Commission staff may request supplementary information to assist in the Commission's review. Intentional misstatements or omissions of fact may constitute criminal violations of 18 U.S.C. 1001, *et seq.* and other provisions of law. The Commission will not consider any application that attempts to reargue or collaterally attack the findings that resulted in the statutory disqualification.


(4) The nature of the supervision that an associated person will receive or exercise as an associated person with a registered entity is an important matter bearing upon the public interest. In meeting the burden of showing that permitting the associated person to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant is consistent with the public interest, the application and supporting documentation must demonstrate that the terms or conditions of association, procedures or proposed supervision, are reasonably designed to ensure that the statutory disqualification does not negatively affect the ability of the associated person to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant in compliance with the applicable statutory and regulatory framework.


(5) Normally, the applicant's burden of demonstrating that permitting the associated person to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant is consistent with the public interest will be difficult to meet where the associated person is to be supervised by, or is to supervise, another statutorily disqualified individual. In addition, where there is an absence of supervision over the associated person who is subject to a statutory disqualification, the applicant's burden will be difficult to meet. The associated person may be limited to association in a specified capacity with a particular registered entity and may also be subject to specific terms and conditions.
