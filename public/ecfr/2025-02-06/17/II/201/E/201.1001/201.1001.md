# ยง 201.1001   Adjustment of civil monetary penalties.

(a) For violations from December 10, 1996, through November 2, 2015: As required by the Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, the Commission has adjusted the maximum amounts of all civil monetary penalties it administers under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and certain penalties under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for inflation in the releases and prior regulations listed in the footnotes to Table I. The penalty amounts provided in Table I apply to violations of these statutes that occurred from December 10, 1996, through November 2, 2015, with each column listing the penalty amounts for violations that occurred in a particular time frame. To determine the penalty amounts for violations that occurred prior to December 10, 1996, please refer to the applicable statutory text. To determine penalty amounts for violations after November 2, 2015, please refer to paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) For violations after November 2, 2015: The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act, as amended by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 (28 U.S.C. 2461 note), requires that civil monetary penalties be adjusted on an annual basis for inflation. Pursuant to this requirement, the maximum amounts of all civil monetary penalties under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and certain penalties under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will be adjusted annually for inflation. Notice of these adjusted penalty amounts will be published by the Commission in the _Federal Register_ on or before January 15 of each calendar year and will be available, along with the Commission's prior inflation adjustments, on the Commission's Web site at *https://www.sec.gov/enforce/civil-penalties-inflation-adjustments.htm.* The adjusted penalty amounts will apply to all penalties imposed after the effective date of the adjustment (for the first day the adjustment is effective, the prior year's penalty amounts shall apply), for violations that occurred after November 2, 2015. The adjusted penalty amount each year will be the larger of:


(1) The maximum penalty amount for the previous calendar year; or


(2) An amount adjusted for inflation, calculated by multiplying the maximum penalty amount for the previous calendar year by the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the month of October preceding the current calendar year exceeds the CPI-U for the month of October of the calendar year two years prior to the current calendar year, adding that amount to the amount for the previous calendar year, and rounding the total to the nearest dollar.
