(a) *Notification before tax refund offset.* Reduction of an income tax refund will be made only after the Commission makes a determination that an amount is owed and past-due and gives or makes a reasonable attempt to give the debtor 60 days written notice of the intent to collect by tax refund offset.


(b) *Contents of notice.* The Commission's notice of intent to collect by tax refund offset (Notice of Intent) will state: 


(1) The amount of the debt; 


(2) That unless the debt is repaid within 60 days from the date of the Commission's Notice of Intent, the Commission intends to collect the debt by requesting a reduction of any amounts payable to the debtor as a Federal income tax refund by an amount equal to the amount of the debt and all accumulated interest and other charges; 


(3) A mailing address for forwarding any written correspondence and a contact name and a telephone number for any questions; and 


(4) That the debtor may present evidence to the Commission that all or part of the debt is not past due or legally enforceable by: 


(i) Sending a written request for a review of the evidence to the address provided in the notice; 


(ii) Stating in the request the amount disputed and the reasons why the debtor believes that the debt is not past due or is not legally enforceable; and
