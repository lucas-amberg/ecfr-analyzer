# § 210.3-05   Financial statements of businesses acquired or to be acquired.

(a) *Financial statements required.* (1) Financial statements (except the related schedules specified in § 210.12) prepared and audited in accordance with Regulation S-X (including the independence standards in § 210.2-01 or, alternatively if the business is not a registrant, the applicable independence standards) must be filed for the periods specified in paragraph (b) of this section if any of the following conditions exist:


(i) During the most recent fiscal year or subsequent interim period for which a balance sheet is required by § 210.3-01, a business acquisition has occurred; or


(ii) After the date of the most recent balance sheet filed pursuant to § 210.3-01, consummation of a business acquisition has occurred or is probable.


(2) For purposes of determining whether the provisions of this section apply:


(i) The determination of whether a *business* has been acquired should be made in accordance with the guidance set forth in § 210.11-01(d); and


(ii) The acquisition of a business encompasses the acquisition of an interest in a business accounted for by the registrant under the equity method or, in lieu of the equity method, the fair value option.


(3) Acquisitions of a group of related businesses that are probable or that have occurred subsequent to the latest fiscal year-end for which audited financial statements of the registrant have been filed must be treated under this section as if they are a single business acquisition. The required financial statements of related businesses may be presented on a combined basis for any periods they are under common control or management. For purposes of this section, businesses will be deemed to be related if:


(i) They are under common control or management;


(ii) The acquisition of one business is conditional on the acquisition of each other business; or


(iii) Each acquisition is conditioned on a single common event.


(4) This section does not apply to a real estate operation subject to § 210.3-14 or a business which is totally held by the registrant prior to consummation of the transaction.


(b) *Periods to be presented.* (1) If registering an offering of securities to the security holders of the business to be acquired, then the financial statements specified in §§ 210.3-01 and 210.3-02 must be filed for the business to be acquired, except as provided otherwise for filings on Form N-14, S-4, or F-4 (§ 239.23, § 239.25, or § 239.34 of this chapter). The financial statements covering fiscal years must be audited except as provided in Item 14 of Schedule 14A (§ 240.14a-101 of this chapter) with respect to certain proxy statements or in registration statements filed on Forms N-14, S-4, or F-4 (§ 239.23, § 239.25, or § 239.34 of this chapter).


(2) In all cases not specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, financial statements of the business acquired or to be acquired must be filed for the periods specified in this paragraph (b)(2) or such shorter period as the business has been in existence. Determine the periods for which such financial statements are to be filed using the conditions specified in the definition of significant subsidiary in § 210.1-02(w), using the lower of the total revenue component or income or loss from continuing operations component for evaluating the income test condition, as follows:


(i) If none of the conditions exceeds 20 percent, financial statements are not required.


(ii) If any of the conditions exceeds 20 percent, but none exceed 40 percent, financial statements must be filed for at least the most recent fiscal year and the most recent interim period specified in §§ 210.3-01 and 210.3-02.


(iii) If any of the conditions exceeds 40 percent, financial statements must be filed for at least the two most recent fiscal years and any interim periods specified in §§ 210.3-01 and 210.3-02.


(iv) If the aggregate impact of businesses acquired or to be acquired since the date of the most recent audited balance sheet filed for the registrant, for which financial statements are either not required by paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section or are not yet required based on paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, exceeds 50 percent for any condition, the registrant must provide the disclosure specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section, however in determining the aggregate impact of the investment test condition also include the aggregate impact calculated in accordance with § 210.3-14(b)(2)(ii) of any acquired or to be acquired real estate operations specified in § 210.3-14(b)(2)(i)(C). In determining whether the income test condition (*i.e.* both the revenue component and the income or loss from continuing operations component) exceeds 50 percent, the businesses specified in this paragraph (b)(2)(iv) reporting losses must be aggregated separately from those reporting income. If either group exceeds 50 percent, paragraphs (b)(2)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section will apply to all of the businesses specified in this paragraph (b)(2)(iv) and will not be limited to either the businesses with losses or those with income.


(A) Pro forma financial information pursuant to §§ 210.11-01 through 210.11-02 that depicts the aggregate impact of these acquired or to be acquired businesses and real estate operations, in all material respects; and


(B) Financial statements covering at least the most recent fiscal year and the most recent interim period specified in §§ 210.3-01 and 210.3-02 for any acquired or to be acquired business or real estate operation for which financial statements are not yet required based on paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section or § 210.3-14(b)(3)(i).


(3) The determination must be made using § 210.11-01(b)(3) and (4).


(4) Financial statements required for the periods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be omitted to the extent specified as follows:


(i) Registration statements not subject to the provisions of § 230.419 of this chapter and proxy statements need not include separate financial statements of an acquired or to be acquired business if neither the business nor the aggregate impact specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section exceeds any of the conditions of significance in the definition of significant subsidiary in § 210.1-02 at the 50 percent level computed in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and either:


(A) The consummation of the acquisition has not yet occurred; or


(B) The date of the final prospectus or prospectus supplement relating to an offering as filed with the Commission pursuant to § 230.424(b) of this chapter, or mailing date in the case of a proxy statement, is no more than 74 days after consummation of the business acquisition, and the financial statements have not previously been filed by the registrant.


(ii) A registrant, other than a foreign private issuer required to file reports on Form 6-K (§ 249.306 of this chapter) or a shell company (other than a business combination related shell company), that omits from its initial registration statement financial statements of a recently consummated business acquisition pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section must file those financial statements and any pro forma information specified by §§ 210.11-01 through 210.11-03 (Article 11) under cover of Form 8-K (§ 249.308 of this chapter) no later than 75 days after consummation of the acquisition. When a predecessor to a shell company (other than a business combination related shell company) acquires a business and the financial statements of that recently consummated business are omitted from a registration statement or proxy statement pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, refer to § 210.15-01(d)(2).




(iii) Separate financial statements of the acquired business specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section need not be presented once the operating results of the acquired business have been reflected in the audited consolidated financial statements of the registrant for at least nine months. Separate financial statements of the acquired business specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section need not be presented once the operating results of the acquired business have been reflected in the audited consolidated financial statements of the registrant for a complete fiscal year.


(iv) A separate audited balance sheet of the acquired business is not required when the registrant's most recent audited balance sheet required by § 210.3-01 is for a date after the date the acquisition was consummated.


(c) *Financial statements of a foreign business.* Financial statements of an acquired or to be acquired foreign business (as defined in § 210.1-02(l)) meeting the requirements of Item 17 of Form 20-F (§ 249.220f of this chapter) will satisfy this section. Such financial statements may be reconciled to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS-IASB) if the registrant is a foreign private issuer that prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS-IASB. This reconciliation must generally follow the form and content requirements in Item 17(c) of Form 20-F; however, accommodations in Item 17(c)(2) of Form 20-F that would be inconsistent with IFRS-IASB may not be applied, and IFRS 1, *First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards,* may be applied.


(d) *Financial statements of an acquired or to be acquired business that would be a foreign private issuer if it were a registrant.* Financial statements of an acquired or to be acquired business that is not a foreign business (as defined in § 210.1-02(l)), but would qualify as a foreign private issuer (as defined in §§ 230.405 and 240.3b-4 of this chapter) if it were a registrant may be prepared in accordance with IFRS-IASB without reconciliation to U.S. GAAP or, if the registrant is a foreign private issuer that prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS-IASB, may be prepared according to a comprehensive basis of accounting principles other than U.S. GAAP or IFRS-IASB and must be reconciled to IFRS-IASB or to U.S. GAAP. This reconciliation must generally follow the form and content requirements in Item 17(c) of Form 20-F; however, accommodations in Item 17(c)(2) of Form 20-F that would be inconsistent with IFRS-IASB may not be applied, and IFRS 1, *First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards,* may be applied.


(e) *Financial statements for net assets that constitute a business.* For an acquisition of net assets that constitutes a business (*e.g.,* an acquired or to be acquired product line), the financial statements prepared and audited in accordance with Regulation S-X may be abbreviated financial statements prepared in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section if the business meets all of the qualifying conditions in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.


(1) *Qualifying conditions.* (i) The total assets and total revenues (both after intercompany eliminations) of the acquired or to be acquired business constitute 20 percent or less of such corresponding amounts of the seller and its subsidiaries consolidated as of and for the most recently completed fiscal year.


(ii) Separate financial statements for the business have not previously been prepared;


(iii) The acquired business was not a separate entity, subsidiary, operating segment (as defined in U.S. GAAP or IFRS-IASB, as applicable) or division during the periods for which the acquired business financial statements would be required; and


(iv) The seller has not maintained the distinct and separate accounts necessary to present financial statements that, absent this paragraph (e), would satisfy the requirements of this section and it is impracticable to prepare such financial statements.


(2) *Presentation requirements.* (i) The balance sheet may be a statement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed;


(ii) The statement of comprehensive income must include expenses incurred by or on behalf of the acquired business during the pre-acquisition financial statement periods to be presented including, but not limited to, costs of sales or services, selling, distribution, marketing, general and administrative, depreciation and amortization, and research and development, but may otherwise omit corporate overhead expense, interest expense for debt that will not be assumed by the registrant or its subsidiaries consolidated, and income tax expense. The title of the statement of comprehensive income must be appropriately modified to indicate it omits certain expenses; and


(iii) The notes to the financial statements must include:


(A) A description of the type of omitted expenses and the reason(s) why they are excluded from the financial statements.


(B) An explanation of the impracticability of preparing financial statements that include the omitted expenses.


(C) A description of how the financial statements presented are not indicative of the financial condition or results of operations of the acquired business going forward because of the omitted expenses.


(D) Information about the business's operating, investing and financing cash flows, to the extent available.


(f) *Financial statements of a business that includes oil and gas producing activities.* (1) Disclosures about oil and gas producing activities must be provided for each full year of operations presented for an acquired or to be acquired business that includes significant oil- and gas-producing activities (as defined in the FASB ASC Master Glossary). The financial statements may present the disclosures in FASB ASC Topic 932 *Extractive Activities—Oil and Gas,* 932-235-50-3 through 50-11 and 932-235-50-29 through 50-36 as unaudited supplemental information. If prior year reserve studies were not made, they may be computed using only production and new discovery quantities and valuation, in which case there will be no “revision of prior estimates” amounts. Registrants may develop these disclosures based on a reserve study for the most recent year, computing the changes backward. The method of computation must be disclosed in a footnote.


(2) The financial statements prepared and audited in accordance with Regulation S-X may consist of only statements of revenues and expenses that exclude expenses not comparable to the proposed future operations such as depreciation, depletion and amortization, corporate overhead, income taxes, and interest for debt that will not be assumed by the registrant or its subsidiaries consolidated if:
