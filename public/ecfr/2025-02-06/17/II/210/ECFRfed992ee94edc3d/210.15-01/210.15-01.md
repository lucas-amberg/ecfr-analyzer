# § 210.15-01   Acquisitions of businesses by a shell company (other than a business combination related shell company).

(a) *Audit requirements.* The term *audit* (or *examination*), when used in regard to financial statements of an entity that is or will be a predecessor to a shell company (other than a business combination related shell company), means an examination of the financial statements by an independent accountant in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) for the purpose of expressing an opinion thereon. When used in regard to financial statements of an entity that is not a predecessor that are included in a registration statement or proxy statement filed for a combination with an issuer that is a shell company (other than a business combination related shell company), the term means an examination of the financial statements by an independent accountant in accordance with either the standards of the PCAOB or U.S. generally accepted auditing standards (“U.S. GAAS”) as specified or permitted in this part and forms applicable to those entities for the purpose of expressing an opinion thereon. In transactions involving a shell company that is not a SPAC (as defined in § 229.1601(b) of this chapter), the predecessor must be audited by an independent accountant registered with the PCAOB.


(b) *Financial statements.* When a registrant is a shell company (other than a business combination related shell company) and the financial statements of a business that will be combining with such registrant are required in a registration statement or proxy statement, such registrant must file financial statements of the business in accordance with §§ 210.3-01 through 210.3-12 and 210.10-01 (Articles 3 and 10 of Regulation S-X) as if the filing were a Securities Act registration statement for the initial public offering of the business's equity securities. The financial statements of the business may be filed pursuant to §§ 210.8-01 through 210.8-08 (Article 8) when that business would qualify to be a smaller reporting company based on its annual revenues as of the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available, if it were filing a registration statement alone.


(c) *Age of financial statements.* The financial statements of a business that will be acquired by a shell company (other than a business combination related shell company) must comply with the requirements in § 210.3-12 (§ 210.8-08 when that business would qualify to be a smaller reporting company based on its annual revenues as of the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available, if it were filing a registration statement alone) as if the financial statements were included in an initial registration statement in determining the age of financial statements of the business in the registration statement or proxy statement of the registrant.


(d) *Acquisition of a business or real estate operation by a predecessor.* Registrants must apply § 210.3-05 (§ 210.8-04 when the predecessor would qualify to be a smaller reporting company based on its annual revenues as of the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available if it were filing a registration statement alone) or § 210.3-14 (§ 210.8-06 when the predecessor would qualify to be a smaller reporting company based on its annual revenues as of the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available if it were filing a registration statement alone) to acquisitions of a business or real estate operation, respectively, by a predecessor.


(1) See § 210.1-02(w)(1) for rules on applying the significance tests to acquisitions of a business or real estate operation that is not or will not be the predecessor.


(2) When the financial statements of a recently acquired business or real estate operation that is not or will not be the predecessor are omitted from a registration statement or proxy statement pursuant to § 210.3-05(b)(4)(i) (Rule 3-05(b)(4)(i) of Regulation S-X) or § 210.3-14(b)(3)(i) (Rule 3-14(b)(3)(i) of Regulation S-X), those financial statements must be filed in a Form 8-K by the later of the filing of the Form 8-K filed pursuant to Item 2.01(f) of Form 8-K or 75 days after consummation of the acquisition.


(e) *Financial statements of shell company.* After a shell company registrant (other than a business combination related shell company) acquires a business that is its predecessor, the financial statements of the shell company for periods prior to consummation of the acquisition are not required to be included in any filing once the financial statements of the predecessor have been filed for all required periods through the acquisition date and the financial statements of the registrant include the period in which the acquisition was consummated. If a registrant is to acquire or has acquired a shell company (other than a business combination related shell company), the financial statements of the shell company are required to be included in any filing that requires the registrant's financial statements, as if the shell company were the registrant for the filing, unless the financial statements of the registrant include the period in which the acquisition of the shell company was consummated.
