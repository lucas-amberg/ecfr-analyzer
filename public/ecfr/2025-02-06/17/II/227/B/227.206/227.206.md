No solicitation or acceptance of money or other consideration, nor of any commitment, binding or otherwise, from any person is permitted until the offering statement is filed.


(b) *Conditions.* The communications must:


(1) State that no money or other consideration is being solicited, and if sent in response, will not be accepted;


(2) State that no offer to buy the securities can be accepted and no part of the purchase price can be received until the offering statement is filed and only through an intermediary's platform; and


(3) State that a person's indication of interest involves no obligation or commitment of any kind.


(c) *Indications of interest.* Any written communication under this section may include a means by which a person may indicate to the issuer that such person is interested in a potential offering. This issuer may require the name, address, telephone number, and/or email address in any response form included pursuant to this paragraph (c).
