# § 227.303   Requirements with respect to transactions.

(a) *Issuer information.* An intermediary in a transaction involving the offer or sale of securities in reliance on section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) must make available to the Commission and to investors any information required to be provided by the issuer of the securities under §§ 227.201 and 227.203(a).


(1) This information must be made publicly available on the intermediary's platform, in a manner that reasonably permits a person accessing the platform to save, download, or otherwise store the information;


(2) This information must be made publicly available on the intermediary's platform for a minimum of 21 days before any securities are sold in the offering, during which time the intermediary may accept investment commitments;


(3) This information, including any additional information provided by the issuer, must remain publicly available on the intermediary's platform until the offer and sale of securities in reliance on section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) is completed or cancelled; and


(4) An intermediary may not require any person to establish an account with the intermediary to access this information.


(b) *Investor qualification.* Each time before accepting any investment commitment (including any additional investment commitment from the same person), an intermediary must:


(1) Have a reasonable basis for believing that the investor satisfies the investment limitations established by section 4(a)(6)(B) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)(B)) and this part. An intermediary may rely on an investor's representations concerning compliance with the investment limitation requirements concerning the investor's annual income, net worth, and the amount of the investor's other investments made pursuant to section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) unless the intermediary has reason to question the reliability of the representation.


(2) Obtain from the investor:


(i) A representation that the investor has reviewed the intermediary's educational materials delivered pursuant to § 227.302(b), understands that the entire amount of his or her investment may be lost, and is in a financial condition to bear the loss of the investment; and


(ii) A questionnaire completed by the investor demonstrating the investor's understanding that:


(A) There are restrictions on the investor's ability to cancel an investment commitment and obtain a return of his or her investment;


(B) It may be difficult for the investor to resell securities acquired in reliance on section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)); and


(C) Investing in securities offered and sold in reliance on section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) involves risk, and the investor should not invest any funds in an offering made in reliance on section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act unless he or she can afford to lose the entire amount of his or her investment.


(c) *Communication channels.* An intermediary must provide on its platform communication channels by which persons can communicate with one another and with representatives of the issuer about offerings made available on the intermediary's platform, provided:


(1) If the intermediary is a funding portal, it does not participate in these communications other than to establish guidelines for communication and remove abusive or potentially fraudulent communications;


(2) The intermediary permits public access to view the discussions made in the communication channels;


(3) The intermediary restricts posting of comments in the communication channels to those persons who have opened an account with the intermediary on its platform; and


(4) The intermediary requires that any person posting a comment in the communication channels clearly and prominently disclose with each posting whether he or she is a founder or an employee of an issuer engaging in promotional activities on behalf of the issuer, or is otherwise compensated, whether in the past or prospectively, to promote the issuer's offering.


(d) *Notice of investment commitment.* An intermediary must promptly, upon receipt of an investment commitment from an investor, give or send to the investor a notification disclosing:


(1) The dollar amount of the investment commitment;


(2) The price of the securities, if known;


(3) The name of the issuer; and


(4) The date and time by which the investor may cancel the investment commitment.


(e) *Maintenance and transmission of funds.* (1) An intermediary that is a registered broker must comply with the requirements of 17 CFR 240.15c2-4.


(2) An intermediary that is a funding portal must direct investors to transmit the money or other consideration directly to a qualified third party that has agreed in writing to hold the funds for the benefit of, and to promptly transmit or return the funds to, the persons entitled thereto in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section. For purposes of this subpart C (§§ 227.300 through 227.305), a qualified third party means a:


(i) Registered broker or dealer that carries customer or broker or dealer accounts and holds funds or securities for those persons; or


(ii) Bank or credit union (where such credit union is insured by National Credit Union Administration) that has agreed in writing either to hold the funds in escrow for the persons who have the beneficial interests therein and to transmit or return such funds directly to the persons entitled thereto when so directed by the funding portal as described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, or to maintain a bank or credit union account (or accounts) for the exclusive benefit of investors and the issuer.


(3) A funding portal that is an intermediary in a transaction involving the offer or sale of securities in reliance on section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) shall promptly direct the qualified third party to:


(i) Transmit funds from the qualified third party to the issuer when the aggregate amount of investment commitments from all investors is equal to or greater than the target amount of the offering and the cancellation period as set forth in § 227.304 has elapsed, *provided that* in no event may the funding portal direct this transmission of funds earlier than 21 days after the date on which the intermediary makes publicly available on its platform the information required to be provided by the issuer under §§ 227.201 and 227.203(a);


(ii) Return funds to an investor when an investment commitment has been cancelled in accordance with § 227.304 (including for failure to obtain effective reconfirmation as required under § 227.304(c)); and

(iv) If a debt security, the interest rate and the yield to maturity calculated from the price paid and the maturity date;


(v) If a callable security, the first date that the security can be called by the issuer; and


(vi) The source, form and amount of any remuneration received or to be received by the intermediary in connection with the transaction, including any remuneration received or to be received by the intermediary from persons other than the issuer.


(2) An intermediary satisfying the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section is exempt from the requirements of § 240.10b-10 of this chapter with respect to a transaction in a security offered and sold in reliance on section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)).
