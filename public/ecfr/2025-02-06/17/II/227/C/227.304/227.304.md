(b) *Early completion of offering.* If an issuer reaches the target offering amount prior to the deadline identified in its offering materials pursuant to ยง 227.201(g), the issuer may close the offering on a date earlier than the deadline identified in its offering materials pursuant to ยง 227.201(g), *provided that:*

(1) The offering remains open for a minimum of 21 days pursuant to ยง 227.303(a);
