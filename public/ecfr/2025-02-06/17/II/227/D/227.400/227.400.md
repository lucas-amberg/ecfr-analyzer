# § 227.400   Registration of funding portals.

(a) *Registration.* A funding portal must register with the Commission, by filing a complete Form Funding Portal (§ 249.2000 of this chapter) in accordance with the instructions on the form, and become a member of a national securities association registered under section 15A of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78*o*-3). The registration will be effective the later of:


(1) Thirty calendar days after the date that the registration is received by the Commission; or


(2) The date the funding portal is approved for membership by a national securities association registered under section 15A of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78*o*-3).


(b) *Amendments to registration.* A funding portal must file an amendment to Form Funding Portal (§ 249.2000 of this chapter) within 30 days of any of the information previously submitted on Form Funding Portal becoming inaccurate for any reason.


(c) *Successor registration.* (1) If a funding portal succeeds to and continues the business of a registered funding portal, the registration of the predecessor will remain effective as the registration of the successor if the successor, within 30 days after such succession, files a registration on Form Funding Portal (§ 249.2000 of this chapter) and the predecessor files a withdrawal on Form Funding Portal; *provided, however,* that the registration of the predecessor funding portal will be deemed withdrawn 45 days after registration on Form Funding Portal is filed by the successor.


(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if a funding portal succeeds to and continues the business of a registered funding portal and the succession is based solely on a change of the predecessor's date or state of incorporation, form of organization, or composition of a partnership, the successor may, within 30 days after the succession, amend the registration of the predecessor on Form Funding Portal (§ 249.2000 of this chapter) to reflect these changes.


(d) *Withdrawal.* A funding portal must promptly file a withdrawal of registration on Form Funding Portal (§ 249.2000 of this chapter) in accordance with the instructions on the form upon ceasing to operate as a funding portal. Withdrawal will be effective on the later of 30 days after receipt by the Commission (after the funding portal is no longer operational), or within such longer period of time as to which the funding portal consents or which the Commission by order may determine as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.


(e) *Applications and reports.* The applications and reports provided for in this section shall be considered filed when a complete Form Funding Portal (§ 249.2000 of this chapter) is submitted with the Commission. Duplicate originals of the applications and reports provided for in this section must be filed with surveillance personnel designated by any registered national securities association of which the funding portal is a member.


(f) *Nonresident funding portals.* Registration pursuant to this section by a nonresident funding portal shall be conditioned upon there being an information sharing arrangement in place between the Commission and the competent regulator in the jurisdiction under the laws of which the nonresident funding portal is organized or where it has its principal place of business, that is applicable to the nonresident funding portal.


(1) *Definition.* For purposes of this section, the term *nonresident funding portal* shall mean a funding portal incorporated in or organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States or its territories, or having its principal place of business in any place not in the United States or its territories.


(2) *Power of attorney.* (i) Each nonresident funding portal registered or applying for registration pursuant to this section shall obtain a written consent and power of attorney appointing an agent in the United States, other than the Commission or a Commission member, official or employee, upon whom may be served any process, pleadings or other papers in any action under the federal securities laws. This consent and power of attorney must be signed by the nonresident funding portal and the named agent(s) for service of process.


(ii) Each nonresident funding portal registered or applying for registration pursuant to this section shall, at the time of filing its application on Form Funding Portal (§ 249.2000 of this chapter), furnish to the Commission the name and address of its United States agent for service of process on Schedule C to the Form.


(iii) Any change of a nonresident funding portal's agent for service of process and any change of name or address of a nonresident funding portal's existing agent for service of process shall be communicated promptly to the Commission through amendment of the Schedule C to Form Funding Portal (§ 249.2000 of this chapter).


(iv) Each nonresident funding portal must promptly appoint a successor agent for service of process if the nonresident funding portal discharges its identified agent for service of process or if its agent for service of process is unwilling or unable to accept service on behalf of the nonresident funding portal.


(v) Each nonresident funding portal must maintain, as part of its books and records, the written consent and power of attorney identified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section for at least three years after the agreement is terminated.


(3) *Access to books and records; inspections and examinations*—(i) *Certification and opinion of counsel.* Any nonresident funding portal applying for registration pursuant to this section shall:


(A) Certify on Schedule C to Form Funding Portal (§ 249.2000 of this chapter) that the nonresident funding portal can, as a matter of law, and will provide the Commission and any registered national securities association of which it becomes a member with prompt access to the books and records of such nonresident funding portal and can, as a matter of law, and will submit to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission and any registered national securities association of which it becomes a member; and


(B) Provide an opinion of counsel that the nonresident funding portal can, as a matter of law, provide the Commission and any registered national securities association of which it becomes a member with prompt access to the books and records of such nonresident funding portal and can, as a matter of law, submit to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission and any registered national securities association of which it becomes a member.


(ii) *Amendments.* The nonresident funding portal shall re-certify, on Schedule C to Form Funding Portal (§ 249.2000 of this chapter), within 90 days after any changes in the legal or regulatory framework that would impact the nonresident funding portal's ability to provide, or the manner in which it provides, the Commission, or any registered national securities association of which it is a member, with prompt access to its books and records or that would impact the Commission's or such registered national securities association's ability to inspect and examine the nonresident funding portal. The re-certification shall be accompanied by a revised opinion of counsel describing how, as a matter of law, the nonresident funding portal can continue to meet its obligations under paragraphs (f)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.
