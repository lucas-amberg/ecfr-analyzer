(b) *Organizational documents.* A funding portal shall make and preserve during the operation of the funding portal and of any successor funding portal, all organizational documents relating to the funding portal, including but not limited to, partnership agreements, articles of incorporation or charter, minute books and stock certificate books (or other similar type documents).


(c) *Format.* The records required to be maintained and preserved pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section must be produced, reproduced, and maintained in the original, non-alterable format in which they were created or as permitted under § 240.17a-4(f) of this chapter.


(d) *Third parties.* The records required to be made and preserved pursuant to this section may be prepared or maintained by a third party on behalf of a funding portal. An agreement with a third party shall not relieve a funding portal from the responsibility to prepare and maintain records as specified in this rule. A funding portal must file with the registered national securities association of which it is a member, a written undertaking in a form acceptable to the registered national securities association, signed by a duly authorized person of the third party, stating in effect that such records are the property of the funding portal and will be surrendered promptly on request of the funding portal. The undertaking shall include the following provision:


(e) *Review of records.* All records of a funding portal are subject at any time, or from time to time, to reasonable periodic, special, or other examination by the representatives of the Commission and the registered national securities association of which a funding portal is a member. Every funding portal shall furnish promptly to the Commission, its representatives, and the registered national securities association of which the funding portal is a member true, correct, complete and current copies of such records of the funding portal that are requested by the representatives of the Commission and the registered national securities association.


(f) *Financial recordkeeping and reporting of currency and foreign transactions.* A funding portal that is subject to the requirements of the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. 5311 *et seq.*) shall comply with the reporting, recordkeeping and record retention requirements of 31 CFR chapter X. Where 31 CFR chapter X and § 227.404(a) and (b) require the same records or reports to be preserved for different periods of time, such records or reports shall be preserved for the longer period of time.
