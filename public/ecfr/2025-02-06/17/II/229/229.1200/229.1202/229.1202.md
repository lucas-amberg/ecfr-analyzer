# ยง 229.1202   (Item 1202) Disclosure of reserves.

(a) *Summary of oil and gas reserves at fiscal year end.* (1) Provide the information specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this Item in tabular format as provided below: 


(2) Disclose, in the aggregate and by geographic area and for each country containing 15% or more of the registrant's proved reserves, expressed on an oil-equivalent-barrels basis, reserves estimated using prices and costs under existing economic conditions, for the product types listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this Item, in the following categories:


(i) Proved developed reserves;


(ii) Proved undeveloped reserves;


(iii) Total proved reserves;


(iv) Probable developed reserves (optional);


(v) Probable undeveloped reserves (optional);


(vi) Possible developed reserves (optional); and


(vii) Possible undeveloped reserves (optional).


(3) Reported total reserves shall be simple arithmetic sums of all estimates for individual properties or fields within each reserves category. When probabilistic methods are used, reserves should not be aggregated probabilistically beyond the field or property level; instead, they should be aggregated by simple arithmetic summation.


(4) Disclose separately material reserves of the following product types:


(i) Oil;


(ii) Natural gas;


(iii) Synthetic oil;


(iv) Synthetic gas; and


(v) Sales products of other non-renewable natural resources that are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil and gas.


(5) If the registrant discloses probable or possible reserves, discuss the uncertainty related to such reserves estimates.


(6) If the registrant has not previously disclosed reserves estimates in a filing with the Commission or is disclosing material additions to its reserves estimates, the registrant shall provide a general discussion of the technologies used to establish the appropriate level of certainty for reserves estimates from material properties included in the total reserves disclosed. The particular properties do not need to be identified.


(7) *Preparation of reserves estimates or reserves audit.* Disclose and describe the internal controls the registrant uses in its reserves estimation effort. In addition, disclose the qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimates and, if the registrant represents that a third party conducted a reserves audit, disclose the qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing such reserves audit.


(8) *Third party reports.* If the registrant represents that a third party prepared, or conducted a reserves audit of, the registrant's reserves estimates, or any estimated valuation thereof, or conducted a process review, the registrant shall file a report of the third party as an exhibit to the relevant registration statement or other Commission filing. If the report relates to the preparation of, or a reserves audit of, the registrant's reserves estimates, it must include the following disclosure, if applicable to the type of filing:


(i) The purpose for which the report was prepared and for whom it was prepared;


(ii) The effective date of the report and the date on which the report was completed;


(iii) The proportion of the registrant's total reserves covered by the report and the geographic area in which the covered reserves are located;


(iv) The assumptions, data, methods, and procedures used, including the percentage of the registrant's total reserves reviewed in connection with the preparation of the report, and a statement that such assumptions, data, methods, and procedures are appropriate for the purpose served by the report;


(v) A discussion of primary economic assumptions;


(vi) A discussion of the possible effects of regulation on the ability of the registrant to recover the estimated reserves;


(vii) A discussion regarding the inherent uncertainties of reserves estimates;


(viii) A statement that the third party has used all methods and procedures as it considered necessary under the circumstances to prepare the report;


(ix) A brief summary of the third party's conclusions with respect to the reserves estimates; and


(x) The signature of the third party.


(9) For purposes of this Item 1202, the term *reserves audit* means the process of reviewing certain of the pertinent facts interpreted and assumptions underlying a reserves estimate prepared by another party and the rendering of an opinion about the appropriateness of the methodologies employed, the adequacy and quality of the data relied upon, the depth and thoroughness of the reserves estimation process, the classification of reserves appropriate to the relevant definitions used, and the reasonableness of the estimated reserves quantities.


(b) *Reserves sensitivity analysis (optional).* (1) The registrant may, but is not required to, provide the information specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this Item in tabular format as provided below: 


(2) The registrant may, but is not required to, disclose, in the aggregate, an estimate of reserves estimated for each product type based on different price and cost criteria, such as a range of prices and costs that may reasonably be achieved, including standardized futures prices or management's own forecasts.


(3) If the registrant provides disclosure under this paragraph (b), disclose the price and cost schedules and assumptions on which the disclosed values are based.
