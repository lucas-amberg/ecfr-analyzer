# § 229.910   (Item 910) Fairness of the transaction.

(a) State whether the general partner reasonably believes that the roll-up transaction is fair or unfair to investors and the reasons for such belief. Such discussion must address the fairness of the roll-up transaction to investors in each of the partnerships and as a whole. If the roll-up transaction may be completed with a combination of partnerships consisting of less than all partnerships, or with portions of partnerships, the belief stated must address each possible combination.


(b) Discuss in reasonable detail the material factors upon which the belief stated in paragraph (a) of this Item (§ 229.910) is based and, to the extent practicable, the weight assigned to each such factor. Such discussion should include an analysis of the extent, if any, to which such belief is based on the factors set forth in Instructions (2) and (3) to this Item (§ 229.910), paragraph (b)(1) of Item 909 of this subpart (§ 229.909(b)(1)) and Item 911 of this subpart (§ 229.911). This discussion also must:


(1) Compare the value of the consideration to be received in the roll-up transaction to the value of the consideration that would be received pursuant to each of the alternatives discussed in response to Item 908(b) of this subpart (§ 229.908(b)); and


(2) Describe any material differences among the partnerships (e.g., different types of assets or different investment objectives) relating to the fairness of the transaction.


(c) If any offer of the type described in Instruction (2)(viii) to this Item (§ 229.910) has been received, describe such offer and state the reason(s) for its rejection.


(d) Describe any factors known to the general partner that may affect materially the value of the consideration to be received by investors in the roll-up transaction, the values assigned to the partnerships for purposes of the comparisons to alternatives required by paragraph (b) of this Item (§ 229.910) and the fairness of the transaction to investors.


(e) State whether the general partner's statements in response to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Item (§ 229.910) are based, in whole or in part, on any report, opinion or appraisal described in response to Item 911 of this subpart (§ 229.911). If so, describe any material uncertainties known to the general partner that relate to the conclusions in any such report, opinion or appraisal including, but not limited to, developments or trends that have affected or are reasonably likely to affect materially such conclusions.
