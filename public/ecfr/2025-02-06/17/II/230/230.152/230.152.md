# § 230.152   Integration.

This section provides a general principle of integration and non-exclusive safe harbors from integration of registered and exempt offerings. Because of the objectives of this section and the policies underlying the Act, the provisions of this section will not have the effect of avoiding integration for any transaction or series of transactions that, although in technical compliance with the section, is part of a plan or scheme to evade the registration requirements of the Act.


(a) *General principle of integration.* If the safe harbors in paragraph (b) of this section do not apply, in determining whether two or more offerings are to be treated as one for the purpose of registration or qualifying for an exemption from registration under the Act, offers and sales will not be integrated if, based on the particular facts and circumstances, the issuer can establish that each offering either complies with the registration requirements of the Act, or that an exemption from registration is available for the particular offering. In making this determination:


(1) For an exempt offering prohibiting general solicitation, the issuer must have a reasonable belief, based on the facts and circumstances, with respect to each purchaser in the exempt offering prohibiting general solicitation, that the issuer (or any person acting on the issuer's behalf) either:


(i) Did not solicit such purchaser through the use of general solicitation; or


(ii) Established a substantive relationship with such purchaser prior to the commencement of the exempt offering prohibiting general solicitation; and


(2) For two or more concurrent exempt offerings permitting general solicitation, in addition to satisfying the requirements of the particular exemption relied on, general solicitation offering materials for one offering that includes information about the material terms of a concurrent offering under another exemption may constitute an offer of securities in such other offering, and therefore the offer must comply with all the requirements for, and restrictions on, offers under the exemption being relied on for such other offering, including any legend requirements and communications restrictions.


(b) *Safe harbors.* No integration analysis under paragraph (a) of this section is required, if any of the following non-exclusive safe harbors apply:


(1) Any offering made more than 30 calendar days before the commencement of any other offering, or more than 30 calendar days after the termination or completion of any other offering, will not be integrated with such other offering, *provided that* for an exempt offering for which general solicitation is not permitted that follows by 30 calendar days or more an offering that allows general solicitation, the provisions of § 230.152(a)(1) shall apply.


(2) Offers and sales made in compliance with § 230.701, pursuant to an employee benefit plan, or in compliance with §§ 230.901 through 230.905 (Regulation S) will not be integrated with other offerings;


(3) An offering for which a registration statement under the Act has been filed will not be integrated if it is made subsequent to:


(i) A terminated or completed offering for which general solicitation is not permitted;


(ii) A terminated or completed offering for which general solicitation is permitted made only to qualified institutional buyers and institutional accredited investors; or


(iii) An offering for which general solicitation is permitted that terminated or completed more than 30 calendar days prior to the commencement of the registered offering; or


(4) Offers and sales made in reliance on an exemption for which general solicitation is permitted will not be integrated if made subsequent to any terminated or completed offering.


(c) *Commencement of an offering.* For purposes of this section, an offering of securities will be deemed to be commenced at the time of the first offer of securities in the offering by the issuer or its agents. The following non-exclusive list of factors should be considered in determining when an offering is deemed to be commenced. Pursuant to the requirements for registered and exempt offerings, an issuer or its agents may commence an offering in reliance on:


(1) Section 230.241, on the date the issuer first made a generic offer soliciting interest in a contemplated securities offering for which the issuer had not yet determined the exemption under the Act under which the offering of securities would be conducted;


(2) Section 15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(2) (Section 4(a)(2)), §§ 230.501 through 230.508 (Regulation D), or § 230.147, or § 230.147A (Rules 147 or 147A), on the date the issuer first made an offer of its securities in reliance on these exemptions;


(3) Sections 230.251 through 230.263 (Regulation A), on the earlier of the date the issuer first made an offer soliciting interest in a contemplated securities offering in reliance on § 230.255, or the public filing of a Form 1-A offering statement;


(4) Sections 227.100 through 227.503 of this chapter (Regulation Crowdfunding), on the earlier of the date the issuer first made an offer soliciting interest in a contemplated securities offering in reliance on § 227.206 of this chapter, or the public filing of a Form C offering statement; and


(5) A registration statement filed under the Act, in the case of:


(i) A continuous offering that will commence promptly on the date of initial effectiveness, on the date the issuer first filed its registration statement for the offering with the Commission; or


(ii) A delayed offering, on the earliest date on which the issuer or its agents commenced public efforts to offer and sell the securities, which could be evidenced by the earlier of:


(A) The first filing of a prospectus supplement with the Commission describing the delayed offering; or


(B) The issuance of a widely disseminated public disclosure, such as a press release, confirming the commencement of the delayed offering.


(d) *Termination or completion of an offering.* For purposes of this section, the termination or completion of an offering is deemed to have occurred when the issuer and its agents cease efforts to make further offers to sell the issuer's securities under such offering. The following non-exclusive list of factors should be considered in determining when an offering is deemed to be terminated or completed including for offerings made in reliance on:


(1) Section 4(a)(2), Regulation D, or Rules 147 or 147A, on the later of the date:


(i) The issuer entered into a binding commitment to sell all securities to be sold under the offering (subject only to conditions outside of the investor's control); or

(2) Regulation A, on:


(i) The withdrawal of an offering statement under § 230.259(a);

(iii) The declaration by the Commission that the offering statement has been abandoned under § 230.259(b); or


(iv) The date, after the third anniversary of the date the offering statement was initially qualified, on which § 230.251(d)(3)(i)(F) prohibits the issuer from continuing to sell securities using the offering statement, or any earlier date on which the offering terminates by its terms;


(3) Regulation Crowdfunding, on the deadline of the offering identified in the offering materials pursuant to § 227.201(g) of this chapter, or indicated by the Regulation Crowdfunding intermediary in any notice to investors delivered under § 227.304(b) of this chapter; and


(4) A registration statement filed under the Act:


(i) On the withdrawal of the registration statement after an application is granted or deemed granted under § 230.477;


(ii) On the filing of a prospectus supplement or amendment to the registration statement indicating that the offering, or particular delayed offering in the case of a shelf registration statement, has been terminated or completed;


(iii) On the entry of an order of the Commission declaring that the registration statement has been abandoned under § 230.479;


(iv) On the date, after the third anniversary of the initial effective date of the registration statement, on which § 230.415(a)(5) prohibits the issuer from continuing to sell securities using the registration statement, or any earlier date on which the offering terminates by its terms; or


(v) Any other factors that indicate that the issuer has abandoned or ceased its public selling efforts in furtherance of the offering, or particular delayed offering in the case of a shelf registration statement, which could be evidenced by:


(A) The filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K; or


(B) The issuance of a widely disseminated public disclosure by the issuer, or its agents, informing the market that the offering, or particular delayed offering, in the case of a shelf registration statement, has been terminated or completed.
