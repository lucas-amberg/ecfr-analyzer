# § 232.15   Administration of EDGAR.

(a) In its administration of EDGAR, the Commission may take the following actions to promote the reliability and integrity of submissions made through EDGAR.


(1) If the Commission determines that a submission contains personally identifiable information that if released may result in financial or personal harm to an individual, which may comprise a single item of information or a combination of two or more items, the Commission may redact such information from the submission, prevent dissemination of the submission, and/or remove the submission from the Commission's public website, and may communicate as necessary with the filer to facilitate submission of a version in which such information is redacted;


(2) The Commission may prevent the submission to EDGAR of any submission that poses a cybersecurity threat, including but not limited to, submissions containing any malware or virus, and may communicate as necessary with the filer regarding the submission;


(3) If the Commission determines that a submission has not been processed by EDGAR, or has been processed incorrectly by EDGAR, or contains an error attributable to the Commission staff, the Commission may correct and/or prevent public dissemination of the submission and may communicate with the filer as necessary to facilitate the filer's submission of an amendment to, or a notice of withdrawal of, the filer's submission (a “filer corrective disclosure”);


(4) If the Commission determines that a submission is made under an incorrect EDGAR unique identifying number, the Commission may remove and/or prevent public dissemination of the submission and may communicate with the filer as necessary to facilitate a filer corrective disclosure;


(5) If the Commission determines that a dispute exists regarding the authority to make submissions on behalf of a filer, the Commission may prevent a filer's ability to make submissions until the dispute is resolved by the disputing parties or by a court of competent jurisdiction;


(6) If the Commission has reason to believe that an attempted submission may be misleading or manipulative, the Commission may prevent acceptance or dissemination of the submission unless, after evaluating the circumstances surrounding the submission, the Commission's concerns are satisfactorily addressed;


(7) If the Commission has reason to believe that a filer has made an unauthorized submission or attempted to make an unauthorized submission, the Commission may prevent any further submissions by the filer or otherwise remove the filer's access to EDGAR; and


(8) If the Commission otherwise has reason to believe that, to promote the reliability and integrity of submissions made through EDGAR, it must address a submission issue that cannot be addressed solely by filer corrective disclosure or by the actions set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section, the Commission may take such further steps as are appropriate to address the matter and communicate as necessary with the filer regarding the submission.


(b) The Commission may act under paragraph (a) of this section without providing advance notice to the filer or any other person. As soon as reasonably practicable after taking action under paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission will provide written notice and a brief factual statement of the basis for the action to the filer and any other person the Commission determines is relevant to the matter (“relevant persons”). The Commission will send the notice and factual statement by electronic mail to the email address on record in the filer's EDGAR account, and to the email address of any relevant persons. The Commission may also send, if necessary, the notice and factual statement by registered, certified, or express mail to the physical address on record in the filer's EDGAR account and the physical address of any relevant persons.


(c) Nothing in this section prevents a filer from addressing an error or mistake in the filer's submission by making a filer corrective disclosure.
