This instruction sets forth registrant requirements and transaction requirements for the use of Form S-3.

With respect to majority-owned subsidiaries, see paragraph (c) of this section. With respect to well-known seasoned issuers and majority-owned subsidiaries of well-known seasoned issuers, see paragraph (d) of this section.


(a) *Registrant requirements.* Registrants must meet the following conditions in order to use this Form for registration under the Securities Act of securities offered in the transactions specified in paragraph (b) of this section:

(2) The registrant has a class of securities registered pursuant to section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (*Exchange Act*) or a class of equity securities registered pursuant to section 12(g) of the Exchange Act or is required to file reports pursuant to section 15(d) of the Exchange Act;


(3) The registrant: (i) Has been subject to the requirements of section 12 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and has filed all the material required to be filed pursuant to sections 13, 14 or 15(d) for a period of at least twelve calendar months immediately preceding the filing of the registration statement on this Form; and

If the registrant has used (during the twelve calendar months and any portion of a month immediately preceding the filing of the registration statement) § 240.12b-25(b) of this chapter with respect to a report or a portion of a report, that report or portion thereof has actually been filed within the time period prescribed by that section; and




(4) Neither the registrant nor any of its consolidated or unconsolidated subsidiaries have, since the end of the last fiscal year for which certified financial statements of the registrant and its consolidated subsidiaries were included in a report filed pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act: (i) Failed to pay any dividend or sinking fund installment on preferred stock; or (ii) defaulted (A) on any installment or installments on indebtedness for borrowed money, or (B) on any rental on one or more long term leases, which defaults in the aggregate are material to the financial position of the registrant and its consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries, taken as a whole.


(5) A foreign issuer, other than a foreign government, which satisfies all of the above provisions of these registrant eligibility requirements except the provisions in paragraph (a)(1) of this section relating to organization and principal business shall be deemed to have met these registrant eligibility requirements provided that such foreign issuer files the same reports with the Commission under section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as a domestic registrant pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section. 


(6) If the registrant is a successor registrant, it shall be deemed to have met conditions in paragraph (a)(1), (2), (3), and (5) of this section if: 


(i) its predecessor and it, taken together, do so, provided that the succession was primarily for the purpose of changing the state of incorporation of the predecessor or forming a holding company and that the assets and liabilities of the successor at the time of succession were substantially the same as those of the predecessor; or 


(ii) If all predecessors met the conditions at the time of succession and the registrant has continued to do so since the succession.
