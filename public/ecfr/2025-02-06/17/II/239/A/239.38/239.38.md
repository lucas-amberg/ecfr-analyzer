(b) This Form shall not be used for registration of securities if no takeover bid circular or issuer bid circular (in the case of an exchange offer) or information circular (in the case of a business combination) is prepared pursuant to the requirements of any Canadian jurisdiction due to the availability of an exemption from such requirements.

S. holders upon terms and conditions not less favorable than those offered to any other holder of the same class of the securities to be exchanged (the “subject securities”) for the securities of the registrant. 


(f) In the case of an exchange offer, if the registrant is a successor registrant subsisting after a business combination, the registrant shall be deemed to meet the 36-month reporting requirement and the 12-month listing requirement of paragraph (d)(3) of this section if:

(3) The successor registrant has been subject to such continuous disclosure requirements and listing requirements since the business combination, and is currently in compliance with its obligations thereunder. 


(g) In the case of an exchange offer, the issuer of the subject securities shall be incorporated or organized under the laws of Canada or any Canadian province or territory and be a foreign private issuer, and less than 25 percent of the class of subject securities outstanding shall be held by U. S. holders. 


(h) In the case of a business combination, Form F-8 is available if: 


(1) Each company participating in the business combination, including the successor registrant, is incorporated or organized under the laws of Canada or any Canadian province or territory and is a foreign private issuer;
