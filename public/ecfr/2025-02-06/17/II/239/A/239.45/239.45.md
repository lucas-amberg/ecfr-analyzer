This Form may be used for registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) of offerings of asset-backed securities, as defined in 17 CFR 229.1101(c). Any registrant which meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section may use this Form for the registration of asset-backed securities (as defined in 17 CFR 229.1101(c)) under the Securities Act which are offered in any transaction specified in paragraph (b) of this section provided that the requirements applicable to the specified transaction are met. Terms used have the same meaning as in Item 1101 of Regulation AB (17 CFR 229.1101).


(a) *Registrant requirements.* Registrants must meet the following conditions in order to use this Form for registration under the Securities Act of asset-backed securities offered in the transactions specified in paragraph (b) of this section:


(1) To the extent the depositor or any issuing entity previously established, directly or indirectly, by the depositor or any affiliate of the depositor (as defined in Item 1101 of Regulation AB (17 CFR 229.1101)) is or was at any time during the twelve calendar months and any portion of a month immediately preceding the filing of the registration statement on this Form required to comply with the transaction requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section with respect to a previous offering of asset-backed securities involving the same asset class, the following requirements shall apply:


(i) Such depositor and each such issuing entity must have filed on a timely basis all certifications required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section; and


(ii) Such depositor and each such issuing entity must have filed on a timely basis all transaction agreements containing the provisions that are required by paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) through (iv) of this section.


(iii) If such depositor or issuing entity fails to meet the requirements of paragraphs(a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, such depositor or issuing entity will be deemed to satisfy such requirements for purposes of this Form 90 days after the date it files the information required by paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section; provided however that if the information is filed within 90 days of evaluating compliance with this paragraph (a) such depositor and issuing entity will be deemed to have been in compliance with such requirements for purposes of this Form 90 days after the date it files the information required by paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.


(2) To the extent the depositor or any issuing entity previously established, directly or indirectly, by the depositor or any affiliate of the depositor (as defined in Item 1101 of Regulation AB (17 CFR 229.1101)) is or was at any time during the twelve calendar months and any portion of a month immediately preceding the filing of the registration statement on this Form subject to the requirements of section 12 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78*l* or 78o(d)) with respect to a class of asset-backed securities involving the same asset class, such depositor and each such issuing entity must have filed all material required to be filed regarding such asset-backed securities pursuant to section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78o(d)) for such period (or such shorter period that each such entity was required to file such materials). In addition, such material must have been filed in a timely manner, other than a report that is required solely pursuant to Item 1.01, 1.02, 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 4.02(a), 6.01, or 6.03 of Form 8-K (17 CFR 249.308). If § 240.12b-25(b) of this chapter was used during such period with respect to a report or a portion of a report, that report or portion thereof has actually been filed within the time period prescribed by § 240.12b-25(b) of this chapter. Regarding an affiliated depositor that became an affiliate as a result of a business combination transaction during such period, the filing of any material prior to the business combination transaction relating to asset-backed securities of an issuing entity previously established, directly or indirectly, by such affiliated depositor is excluded from this section, provided such business combination transaction was not part of a plan or scheme to evade the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. See the definition of “affiliate” in § 230.405 of this chapter.


(b) *Transaction Requirements.* If the registrant meets the registrant requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section, an offering meeting the following conditions may be registered on this Form SF-3:

Reviews shall be required under the transaction documents, at a minimum, when the following conditions are met:


(*1*) A threshold of delinquent assets, as specified in the transaction agreements, has been reached or exceeded; and


(*2*) An investor vote to direct a review, pursuant to the processes specified in the transaction agreements, provided that the agreement not require more than:
