# ยง 240.3Ca-1   Stay of clearing requirement and review by the Commission.

(a) After making a determination pursuant to a clearing agency's security-based swap submission that a security-based swap, or any group, category, type or class of security-based swaps, is required to be cleared, the Commission, on application of a counterparty to a security-based swap or on the Commission's own initiative, may stay the clearing requirement until the Commission completes a review of the terms of the security-based swap (or group, category, type, or class of security-based swaps) and the clearing of the security-based swap (or group, category, type, or class of security-based swaps) by the clearing agency that has accepted it for clearing.


(b) A counterparty to a security-based swap applying for a stay of the clearing requirement for a security-based swap (or group, category, type, or class of security-based swaps) shall submit a written statement to the Commission that includes:


(1) A request for a stay of the clearing requirement;


(2) The identity of the counterparties to the security-based swap and a contact at the counterparty requesting the stay;


(3) The identity of the clearing agency clearing the security-based swap;


(4) The terms of the security-based swap subject to the clearing requirement and a description of the clearing arrangement; and


(5) Reasons why such stay should be granted and why the security-based swap should not be subject to a clearing requirement, specifically addressing the same factors a clearing agency must address in its security-based-swap submission pursuant to ยง 240.19b-4(o)(3).


(c) A stay of the clearing requirement may be granted with respect to a security-based swap, or the group, category, type, or class of security-based swaps, as determined by the Commission.


(d) The Commission's review shall include a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the factors specified in ยง 240.19b-4(o)(3). Any clearing agency that has accepted for clearing a security-based swap, or any group, category, type or class of security-based swaps, that is subject to the stay of the clearing requirement shall provide information requested by the Commission as necessary to assess any of the factors it determines to be appropriate in the course of its review.


(e) Upon completion of its review, the Commission may:


(1) Determine, subject to any terms and conditions that the Commission determines to be appropriate in the public interest, that the security-based swap, or group, category, type, or class of security-based swaps must be cleared; or


(2) Determine that the clearing requirement will not apply to the security-based swap, or group, category, type, or class of security-based swaps, but clearing may continue on a non-mandatory basis.
