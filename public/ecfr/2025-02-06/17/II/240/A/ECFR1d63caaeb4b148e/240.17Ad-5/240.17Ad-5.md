If a new certificate is dispatched or mailed to the presentor within five business days following receipt of an inquiry pertaining to that certificate, no further response to the inquiry shall be required pursuant to this paragraph.


(b) When any broker-dealer requests in writing that a registered transfer agent acknowledge the transfer instructions and the possession of a security presented for transfer by such broker-dealer or revalidate a window ticket with respect to such security and the request identifies the issue, the number of shares (or principal amount of debt securities or number of units if relating to any other kind of security), the approximate date of presentment, the certificate number and the name in which it is registered, every registered transfer agent shall, within five business days following receipt of the request, in writing, confirm or deny possession of the security, and, if the registered transfer agent has possession, (1) acknowledge the transfer instructions or (2) revalidate the window ticket. If a new certificate is dispatched or mailed to the presentor within five business days following receipt of a request pertaining to that certificate, no further response to the inquiry shall be required pursuant to this paragraph.


(c) When any person, or anyone acting under his authority, requests in writing that a transfer agent confirm possession as of a given date of a certificate presented by such person during the 30 days before the date the inquiry is received and the request identifies the issue, the number of shares (or principal amount of debt securities or number of units if relating to any other kind of security), the approximate date of presentment, the certificate number and the name in which the certificate was registered, every registered transfer agent shall, within ten business days following receipt of the request and upon assurance of payment of a reasonable fee if required by such transfer agent, make available a written response to such person, or anyone acting under his authority, confirming or denying possession of such security as of such given date.


(d) When any person requests in writing a transcript of such person's account with respect to a particular issue, either as the account appears currently or as it appeared on a specific date not more than six months prior to the date the registered transfer agent receives the request, every registered transfer agent shall, within twenty business days following receipt of the request and upon assurance of payment of a reasonable fee if required by such transfer agent, make available to such person a transcript, ledger or statement of account in sufficient detail to permit reconstruction of such account as of the date for which the transcript was requested.


(e)(1) *Response to written inquiries concerning dividend and interest payments.* A registered transfer agent shall respond, within ten business days of receipt, to current claims that contain sufficient detail. A registered transfer agent shall respond, within twenty business days of receipt, to aged claims that contain sufficient detail. The response shall indicate in writing that the inquiry has been received, whether the claim requires further research and, if so, a reasonable estimate of how long that research may take. If no further research is required, the response shall indicate whether that claim is being or will be paid and, if not, the reason for not paying the claim. A registered transfer agent shall devote diligent attention to unresolved inquiries and shall resolve all inquiries as soon as possible.


(2) *Misdirected written inquiries concerning dividend and interest payments.* In the event that a transfer agent is not the dividend disbursing or interest paying agent for an issue that is the subject of a claim under this section, but performed those or any transfer agent services for that issue within the preceding three years, the transfer agent shall provide in writing to the inquirer, within ten business days of receipt of the inquiry, the name and address of the current dividend disbursing or interest paying agent. If the transfer agent did not perform those or other transfer agent services for the issue within the preceding three years, the transfer agent must respond to the inquiry and may respond by returning the inquiry with a statement that the transfer agent is not the current dividend disbursing or interest paying agent and that it does not know the name and address of the current dividend disbursing or interest paying agent.


(3) As used in this paragraph:


(i) A *current claim* means a written inquiry concerning non-payment or incorrect payment of dividends or interest, the payment date for which occurred within the preceding six months.


(ii) An *aged claim* means a written inquiry concerning non-payment or incorrect payment of dividends or interest, the payment date for which occurred more than six months before the inquiry.


(iii) *Sufficient detail* means a written inquiry or request that identifies: The issue; the name(s) in which the securities are registered; the number of shares (or principal amount of debt securities or number of units for any other kind of security) involved; the approximate record date(s) or payment date(s) relating to the claim; and, with respect to registered broker-dealers, registered clearing agencies, or banks, certificate numbers.


(f) *Telephone response.* (1) A transfer agent may satisfy the written response requirements of this section by a telephone response to the inquirer if:


(i) The telephone response resolves that inquiry; and


(ii) The inquirer does not request a written response.


(2) When any person makes a written inquiry or request that would qualify under paragraph (e) of this section except that it fails to provide sufficient detail as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, a registered transfer agent may telephone the inquirer to obtain the necessary additional detail within the time periods specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. If the transfer agent does not receive the additional detail within ten business days, the transfer agent immediately shall make a written request for the additional information.

(2) When any person makes a written inquiry or request which would qualify under paragraph (e) of this section except that it fails to provide sufficient detail as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, a registered transfer agent must respond to the inquiry within the time periods specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
