# § 240.18a-1   Net capital requirements for security-based swap dealers for which there is not a prudential regulator.

Sections 240.18a-1, 240.18a-1a, 240.18a-1b, 240.18a-1c, and 240.18a-1d apply to a security-based swap dealer registered under section 15F of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78*o*-10), including a security-based swap dealer that is an *OTC derivatives dealer* as that term is defined in § 240.3b-12. A security-based swap dealer registered under section 15F of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78*o*-10) that is also a broker or dealer registered under section 15 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o), other than an OTC derivatives dealer, is subject to the net capital requirements in § 240.15c3-1 and its appendices. A security-based swap dealer registered under section 15F of the Act that has a prudential regulator is not subject to § 240.18a-1, 240.18a-1a, 240.18a-1b, 240.18a-1c, and 240.18a-1d.


(a) *Minimum requirements.* Every registered security-based swap dealer must at all times have and maintain net capital no less than the greater of the highest minimum requirements applicable to its business under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, and tentative net capital no less than the minimum requirement under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.


(1)(i) A security-based swap dealer must at all times maintain net capital of not less than the greater of $20 million or:


(A) Two percent of the risk margin amount; or


(B) Four percent or less of the risk margin amount if the Commission issues an order raising the requirement to four percent or less on or after the third anniversary of this section's compliance date; or


(C) Eight percent or less of the risk margin amount if the Commission issues an order raising the requirement to eight percent or less on or after the fifth anniversary of this section's compliance date and the Commission had previously issued an order raising the requirement under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section;


(ii) If, after considering the capital and leverage levels of security-based swap dealers subject to this paragraph (a)(1), as well as the risks of their security-based swap positions, the Commission determines that it may be appropriate to change the percentage pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) or (C) of this section, the Commission will publish a notice of the potential change and subsequently will issue an order regarding any such change.


(2) In accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, the Commission may approve, in whole or in part, an application or an amendment to an application by a security-based swap dealer to calculate net capital using the market risk standards of paragraph (d) to compute a deduction for market risk on some or all of its positions, instead of the provisions of paragraphs (c)(1)(iv), (vi), and (vii) of this section, and § 240.18a-1b, and using the credit risk standards of paragraph (d) to compute a deduction for credit risk on certain credit exposures arising from transactions in derivatives instruments, instead of the provisions of paragraphs (c)(1)(iii) and (c)(1)(ix)(A) and (B) of this section, subject to any conditions or limitations on the security-based swap dealer the Commission may require as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. A security-based swap dealer that has been approved to calculate its net capital under paragraph (d) of this section must at all times maintain tentative net capital of not less than $100 million and net capital of not less than the greater of $20 million or:


(i)(A) Two percent of the risk margin amount;


(B) Four percent or less of the risk margin amount if the Commission issues an order raising the requirement to four percent or less on or after the third anniversary of this section's compliance date; or


(C) Eight percent or less of the risk margin amount if the Commission issues an order raising the requirement to eight percent or less on or after the fifth anniversary of this section's compliance date and the Commission had previously issued an order raising the requirement under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section;


(ii) If, after considering the capital and leverage levels of security-based swap dealers subject to this paragraph (a)(2), as well as the risks of their security-based swap positions, the Commission determines that it may be appropriate to change the percentage pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) or (C) of this section, the Commission will publish a notice of the potential change and subsequently will issue an order regarding any such change; and


(b) A security-based swap dealer must at all times maintain net capital in addition to the amounts required under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable, in an amount equal to 10 percent of:


(1) The excess of the market value of United States Treasury Bills, Bonds and Notes subject to reverse repurchase agreements with any one party over 105 percent of the contract prices (including accrued interest) for reverse repurchase agreements with that party;


(2) The excess of the market value of securities issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by an agency of the United States or mortgage related securities as defined in section 3(a)(41) of the Act subject to reverse repurchase agreements with any one party over 110 percent of the contract prices (including accrued interest) for reverse repurchase agreements with that party; and


(3) The excess of the market value of other securities subject to reverse repurchase agreements with any one party over 120 percent of the contract prices (including accrued interest) for reverse repurchase agreements with that party.

(B)(*1*) In determining net worth, all long and all short positions in listed options shall be marked to their market value and all long and all short securities and commodities positions shall be marked to their market value.


(*2*) In determining net worth, the value attributed to any unlisted option shall be the difference between the option's exercise value and the market value of the underlying security. In the case of an unlisted call, if the market value of the underlying security is less than the exercise value of such call it shall be given no value and in the case of an unlisted put if the market value of the underlying security is more than the exercise value of the unlisted put it shall be given no value.


(C) Adding to net worth the lesser of any deferred income tax liability related to the items in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(C)(*1*) through (*3*) of this section, or the sum of paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(C)(*1*), (*2*), and (*3*) of this section;

(*2*) Any deferred tax liability related to income accrued which is directly related to an asset otherwise deducted pursuant to this section;


(*3*) Any deferred tax liability related to unrealized appreciation in value of any asset(s) which has been otherwise deducted from net worth in accordance with the provisions of this section; and


(D) Adding, in the case of future income tax benefits arising as a result of unrealized losses, the amount of such benefits not to exceed the amount of income tax liabilities accrued on the books and records of the security-based swap dealer, but only to the extent such benefits could have been applied to reduce accrued tax liabilities on the date of the capital computation, had the related unrealized losses been realized on that date.


(E) Adding to net worth any actual tax liability related to income accrued which is directly related to an asset otherwise deducted pursuant to this section.


(ii) *Subordinated liabilities.* Excluding liabilities of the security-based swap dealer that are subordinated to the claims of creditors pursuant to a satisfactory subordinated loan agreement, as defined in § 240.18a-1d.

(*ii*) The excess of the aggregate repurchase agreement deficits with any one party over 25 percent of the security-based swap dealer's net capital before the application of paragraphs (c)(1)(vi) and (vii) of this section (less any deduction taken with respect to repurchase agreements with that party under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(E)(*3*)(*i*) of this section) or, if greater; the excess of the aggregate repurchase agreement deficits over 300 percent of the security-based swap dealer's net capital before the application of paragraphs (c)(1)(vi) and (vii) of this section.


(*iii*) In determining the required deduction under paragraphs (c)(1)(iii)(E)(*3*)(*i*) and (*ii*) of this section, the security-based swap dealer may reduce a repurchase agreement by any margin or other deposits held by the security-based swap dealer on account of a reverse repurchase agreement with the same party to the extent not otherwise used to reduce a reverse repurchase agreement deficit; the difference between the contract price and the market value of securities subject to other repurchase agreements with the same party (if the market value of those securities is less than the contract price) not otherwise used to reduce a reverse repurchase agreement deficit; and calls for margin, marks to the market, or other required deposits that are outstanding one business day or less to the extent not otherwise used to reduce a reverse repurchase agreement deficit.


(F) *Securities borrowed.* One percent of the market value of securities borrowed collateralized by an irrevocable letter of credit.


(G) *Affiliate receivables and collateral.* Any receivable from an affiliate of the security-based swap dealer (not otherwise deducted from net worth) and the market value of any collateral given to an affiliate (not otherwise deducted from net worth) to secure a liability over the amount of the liability of the security-based swap dealer unless the books and records of the affiliate are made available for examination when requested by the representatives of the Commission in order to demonstrate the validity of the receivable or payable. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply where the affiliate is a registered security-based swap dealer, registered broker or dealer, registered government securities broker or dealer, bank as defined in section 3(a)(6) of the Act, insurance company as defined in section 3(a)(19) of the Act, investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, federally insured savings and loan association, or futures commission merchant or swap dealer registered pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act.


(iv) *Non-marketable securities.* Deducting 100 percent of the carrying value in the case of securities or evidence of indebtedness in the proprietary or other accounts of the security-based swap dealer, for which there is no ready market, as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, and securities, in the proprietary or other accounts of the security-based swap dealer, that cannot be publicly offered or sold because of statutory, regulatory or contractual arrangements or other restrictions.


(v) Deducting from the contract value of each failed to deliver contract that is outstanding five business days or longer (21 business days or longer in the case of municipal securities) the percentages of the market value of the underlying security that would be required by application of the deduction required by paragraph (c)(1)(vii) of this section. Such deduction, however, shall be increased by any excess of the contract price of the failed to deliver contract over the market value of the underlying security or reduced by any excess of the market value of the underlying security over the contract value of the failed to deliver contract, but not to exceed the amount of such deduction. The Commission may, upon application of the security-based swap dealer, extend for a period up to 5 business days, any period herein specified when it is satisfied that the extension is warranted. The Commission upon expiration of the extension may extend for one additional period of up to 5 business days, any period herein specified when it is satisfied that the extension is warranted.

(B) *Non-cleared security-based swaps*—(*1*) *Credit default swaps*—(*i*) *Short positions (selling protection).* In the case of a non-cleared security-based swap that is a short credit default swap, deducting the percentage of the notional amount based upon the current basis point spread of the credit default swap and the maturity of the credit default swap in accordance with table 1 to § 240.18a-1(c)(1)(vi)(B)(*1*)(*i*):


(*ii*) *Long positions (purchasing protection).* In the case of a non-cleared security-based swap that is a long credit default swap, deducting 50 percent of the deduction that would be required by paragraph (c)(1)(vi)(B)(*1*)(*i*) of this section if the non-cleared security-based swap was a short credit default swap, each such deduction not to exceed the current market value of the long position.


(*iii*) *Long and short credit default swaps.* In the case of non-cleared security-based swaps that are long and short credit default swaps referencing the same entity (in the case of non-cleared credit default swap security-based swaps referencing a corporate entity) or obligation (in the case of non-cleared credit default swap security-based swaps referencing an asset-backed security), that have the same credit events which would trigger payment by the seller of protection, that have the same basket of obligations which would determine the amount of payment by the seller of protection upon the occurrence of a credit event, that are in the same or adjacent spread category, and that are in the same or adjacent maturity category and have a maturity date within three months of the other maturity category, deducting the percentage of the notional amount specified in the higher maturity category under paragraph (c)(1)(vi)(B)(*1*)(*i*) or (*ii*) on the excess of the long or short position. In the case of non-cleared security-based swaps that are long and short credit default swaps referencing corporate entities in the same industry sector and the same spread and maturity categories prescribed in paragraph (c)(1)(vi)(B)(*1*)(*i*) of this section, deducting 50 percent of the amount required by paragraph (c)(1)(vi)(B)(*1*)(*i*) of this section on the short position plus the deduction required by paragraph (c)(1)(vi)(B)(*1*)(*ii*) of this section on the excess long position, if any. For the purposes of this section, the security-based swap dealer must use an industry sector classification system that is reasonable in terms of grouping types of companies with similar business activities and risk characteristics and the security-based swap dealer must document the industry sector classification system used pursuant to this section.


(*iv*) *Long security and long credit default swap.* In the case of a non-cleared security-based swap that is a long credit default swap referencing a debt security and the security-based swap dealer is long the same debt security, deducting 50 percent of the amount specified in § 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi) or (vii) for the debt security, provided that the security-based swap dealer can deliver the debt security to satisfy the obligation of the security-based swap dealer on the credit default swap.


(*v*) *Short security and short credit default swap.* In the case of a non-cleared security-based swap that is a short credit default swap referencing a debt security or a corporate entity, and the security-based swap dealer is short the debt security or a debt security issued by the corporate entity, deducting the amount specified in § 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi) or (vii) for the debt security. In the case of a non-cleared security-based swap that is a short credit default swap referencing an asset-backed security and the security-based swap dealer is short the asset-backed security, deducting the amount specified in § 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi) or (vii) for the asset-backed security.

(B) *Swaps.* Deducting the initial margin amount calculated pursuant to the margin rules of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the account of a counterparty at the security-based swap dealer that is subject to a margin exception in those rules, less the margin value of collateral held in the account.


(C) *Treatment of collateral held at a third-party custodian.* For the purposes of the deductions required pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1)(ix)(A) and (B) of this section, collateral held by an independent third-party custodian as initial margin may be treated as collateral held in the account of the counterparty at the security-based swap dealer if:


(*1*) The independent third-party custodian is a bank as defined in section 3(a)(6) of the Act or a registered U.S. clearing organization or depository that is not affiliated with the counterparty or, if the collateral consists of foreign securities or currencies, a supervised foreign bank, clearing organization, or depository that is not affiliated with the counterparty and that customarily maintains custody of such foreign securities or currencies;


(*2*) The security-based swap dealer, the independent third-party custodian, and the counterparty that delivered the collateral to the custodian have executed an account control agreement governing the terms under which the custodian holds and releases collateral pledged by the counterparty as initial margin that is a legal, valid, binding, and enforceable agreement under the laws of all relevant jurisdictions, including in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or a similar proceeding of any of the parties to the agreement, and that provides the security-based swap dealer with the right to access the collateral to satisfy the counterparty's obligations to the security-based swap dealer arising from transactions in the account of the counterparty; and


(*3*) The security-based swap dealer maintains written documentation of its analysis that in the event of a legal challenge the relevant court or administrative authorities would find the account control agreement to be legal, valid, binding, and enforceable under the applicable law, including in the event of the receivership, conservatorship, insolvency, liquidation, or a similar proceeding of any of the parties to the agreement.


(x)(A) Deducting the market value of all short securities differences (which shall include securities positions reflected on the securities record which are not susceptible to either count or confirmation) unresolved after discovery in accordance with the schedule in table 2 to § 240.18a-1(c)(1)(x)(A):

(ii) The Commission may determine by order that the notice will become effective after a shorter or longer period of time if the security-based swap dealer consents or if the Commission determines that a shorter or longer period of time is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors; and


(8) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(7) of this section, the Commission, by order, may revoke a security-based swap dealer's exemption that allows it to use the market risk standards of this paragraph (d) to calculate deductions for market risk, and the exemption to use the credit risk standards of this paragraph (d) to calculate deductions for credit risk on certain credit exposures arising from transactions in derivatives instruments if the Commission finds that such exemption is no longer necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. In making its finding, the Commission will consider the compliance history of the security-based swap dealer related to its use of models, the financial and operational strength of the security-based swap dealer and its ultimate holding company, and the security-based swap dealer's compliance with its internal risk management controls.


(9) To be approved, each value-at-risk (“VaR”) model must meet the following minimum qualitative and quantitative requirements:


(i) *Qualitative requirements.* (A) The VaR model used to calculate market or credit risk for a position must be integrated into the daily internal risk management system of the security-based swap dealer;


(B) The VaR model must be reviewed both periodically and annually. The periodic review may be conducted by the security-based swap dealer's internal audit staff, but the annual review must be conducted by a registered public accounting firm, as that term is defined in section 2(a)(12) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7201 *et seq.*); and


(C) For purposes of computing market risk, the security-based swap dealer must determine the appropriate multiplication factor as follows:


(*1*) Beginning three months after the security-based swap dealer begins using the VaR model to calculate market risk, the security-based swap dealer must conduct backtesting of the model by comparing its actual daily net trading profit or loss with the corresponding VaR measure generated by the VaR model, using a 99 percent, one-tailed confidence level with price changes equivalent to a one business-day movement in rates and prices, for each of the past 250 business days, or other period as may be appropriate for the first year of its use;


(*2*) On the last business day of each quarter, the security-based swap dealer must identify the number of backtesting exceptions of the VaR model, that is, the number of business days in the past 250 business days, or other period as may be appropriate for the first year of its use, for which the actual net trading loss, if any, exceeds the corresponding VaR measure; and


(*3*) The security-based swap dealer must use the multiplication factor indicated in table 3 to § 240.18a-1(d)(9)(i)(C)(*3*) in determining its market risk until it obtains the next quarter's backtesting results;


(*4*) For purposes of incorporating specific risk into a VaR model, a security-based swap dealer must demonstrate that it has methodologies in place to capture liquidity, event, and default risk adequately for each position. Furthermore, the models used to calculate deductions for specific risk must:


(*i*) Explain the historical price variation in the portfolio;


(*ii*) Capture concentration (magnitude and changes in composition);


(*iii*) Be robust to an adverse environment;


(*iv*) Capture name-related basis risk;


(*v*) Capture event risk; and


(*vi*) Be validated through backtesting.


(*5*) For purposes of computing the credit equivalent amount of the security-based swap dealer's exposures to a counterparty, the security-based swap dealer must determine the appropriate multiplication factor as follows:


(*i*) Beginning three months after it begins using the VaR model to calculate maximum potential exposure, the security-based swap dealer must conduct backtesting of the model by comparing, for at least 80 counterparties with widely varying types and sizes of positions with the firm, the ten-business day change in its current exposure to the counterparty based on its positions held at the beginning of the ten-business day period with the corresponding ten-business day maximum potential exposure for the counterparty generated by the VaR model;


(*ii*) As of the last business day of each quarter, the security-based swap dealer must identify the number of backtesting exceptions of the VaR model, that is, the number of ten-business day periods in the past 250 business days, or other period as may be appropriate for the first year of its use, for which the change in current exposure to a counterparty exceeds the corresponding maximum potential exposure; and


(*iii*) The security-based swap dealer will propose, as part of its application, a schedule of multiplication factors, which must be approved by the Commission based on the number of backtesting exceptions of the VaR model. The security-based swap dealer must use the multiplication factor indicated in the approved schedule in determining the credit equivalent amount of its exposures to a counterparty until it obtains the next quarter's backtesting results, unless the Commission determines, based on, among other relevant factors, a review of the security-based swap dealer's internal risk management control system, including a review of the VaR model, that a different adjustment or other action is appropriate.


(ii) *Quantitative requirements.* (A) For purposes of determining market risk, the VaR model must use a 99 percent, one-tailed confidence level with price changes equivalent to a ten business-day movement in rates and prices;


(B) For purposes of determining maximum potential exposure, the VaR model must use a 99 percent, one-tailed confidence level with price changes equivalent to a one-year movement in rates and prices; or based on a review of the security-based swap dealer's procedures for managing collateral and if the collateral is marked to market daily and the security-based swap dealer has the ability to call for additional collateral daily, the Commission may approve a time horizon of not less than ten business days;


(C) The VaR model must use an effective historical observation period of at least one year. The security-based swap dealer must consider the effects of market stress in its construction of the model. Historical data sets must be updated at least monthly and reassessed whenever market prices or volatilities change significantly; and


(D) The VaR model must take into account and incorporate all significant, identifiable market risk factors applicable to positions in the accounts of the security-based swap dealer, including:


(*1*) Risks arising from the non-linear price characteristics of derivatives and the sensitivity of the market value of those positions to changes in the volatility of the derivatives' underlying rates and prices;


(*2*) Empirical correlations with and across risk factors or, alternatively, risk factors sufficient to cover all the market risk inherent in the positions in the proprietary or other trading accounts of the security-based swap dealer, including interest rate risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange risk, and commodity price risk;


(*3*) Spread risk, where applicable, and segments of the yield curve sufficient to capture differences in volatility and imperfect correlation of rates along the yield curve for securities and derivatives that are sensitive to different interest rates; and


(*4*) Specific risk for individual positions:


(iii) *Additional conditions.* As a condition for the security-based swap dealer to use this paragraph (d) to calculate certain of its capital charges, the Commission may impose additional conditions on the security-based swap dealer, which may include, but are not limited to restricting the security-based swap dealer's business on a product-specific, category-specific, or general basis; submitting to the Commission a plan to increase the security-based swap dealer's net capital or tentative net capital; filing more frequent reports with the Commission; modifying the security-based swap dealer's internal risk management control procedures; or computing the security-based swap dealer's deductions for market and credit risk in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1)(iii), (iv), (vi), (vii), and (c)(1)(ix)(A) and (B), as appropriate, and § 240.18a-1b, as appropriate. If the Commission finds it is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, the Commission may impose additional conditions on the security-based swap dealer, if:


(A) The security-based swap dealer fails to meet the reporting requirements set forth in § 240.18a-7;


(B) Any event specified in § 240.18a-8 occurs;


(C) There is a material deficiency in the internal risk management control system or in the mathematical models used to price securities or to calculate deductions for market and credit risk or allowances for market and credit risk, as applicable, of the security-based swap dealer;


(D) The security-based swap dealer fails to comply with this paragraph (d); or


(E) The Commission finds that imposition of other conditions is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.


(e) *Models to compute deductions for market risk and credit risk*—(1) *Market risk.* A security-based swap dealer whose application, including amendments, has been approved under paragraph (d) of this section, shall compute a deduction for market risk in an amount equal to the sum of the following:


(i) For positions for which the Commission has approved the security-based swap dealer's use of VaR models, the VaR of the positions multiplied by the appropriate multiplication factor determined according to paragraph (d) of this section, except that the initial multiplication factor shall be three, unless the Commission determines, based on a review of the security-based swap dealer's application or an amendment to the application under paragraph (d) of this section, including a review of its internal risk management control system and practices and VaR models, that another multiplication factor is appropriate;


(ii) For positions for which the VaR model does not incorporate specific risk, a deduction for specific risk to be determined by the Commission based on a review of the security-based swap dealer's application or an amendment to the application under paragraph (d) of this section and the positions involved;


(iii) For positions for which the Commission has approved the security-based swap dealer's application to use scenario analysis, the greatest loss resulting from a range of adverse movements in relevant risk factors, prices, or spreads designed to represent a negative movement greater than, or equal to, the worst ten-day movement of the four years preceding calculation of the greatest loss, or some multiple of the greatest loss based on the liquidity of the positions subject to scenario analysis. If historical data is insufficient, the deduction shall be the largest loss within a three standard deviation movement in those risk factors, prices, or spreads over a ten-day period, multiplied by an appropriate liquidity adjustment factor. Irrespective of the deduction otherwise indicated under scenario analysis, the resulting deduction for market risk must be at least $25 per 100 share equivalent contract for equity positions, or one-half of one percent of the face value of the contract for all other types of contracts, even if the scenario analysis indicates a lower amount. A qualifying scenario must include the following:


(A) A set of pricing equations for the positions based on, for example, arbitrage relations, statistical analysis, historic relationships, merger evaluations, or fundamental valuation of an offering of securities;


(B) Auxiliary relationships mapping risk factors to prices; and


(C) Data demonstrating the effectiveness of the scenario in capturing market risk, including specific risk; and


(iv) For all remaining positions, the deductions specified in § 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi), § 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vii), and applicable appendices to § 240.15c3-1.


(2) *Credit risk.* A security-based swap dealer whose application, including amendments, has been approved under paragraph (d) of this section may compute a deduction for credit risk on transactions in derivatives instruments (if this paragraph (e) is used to calculate a deduction for market risk on those positions) in an amount equal to the sum of the following:


(i) *Counterparty exposure charge.* A counterparty exposure charge in an amount equal to the sum of the following:


(A) The net replacement value in the account of each counterparty that is insolvent, or in bankruptcy, or that has senior unsecured long-term debt in default; and


(B) For a counterparty not otherwise described in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the *credit equivalent amount* of the security-based swap dealer's exposure to the counterparty, as defined in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, multiplied by the credit risk weight of the counterparty, as determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(F) of this section, multiplied by eight percent; and


(ii) *Counterparty concentration charge.* A concentration charge by counterparty in an amount equal to the sum of the following:


(A) For each counterparty with a credit risk weight of 20 percent or less, 5 percent of the amount of the current exposure to the counterparty in excess of 5 percent of the tentative net capital of the security-based swap dealer;


(B) For each counterparty with a credit risk weight of greater than 20 percent but less than 50 percent, 20 percent of the amount of the current exposure to the counterparty in excess of 5 percent of the tentative net capital of the security-based swap dealer; and


(C) For each counterparty with a credit risk weight of greater than 50 percent, 50 percent of the amount of the current exposure to the counterparty in excess of 5 percent of the tentative net capital of the security-based swap dealer;


(iii) *Terms.* (A) The *credit equivalent amount* of the security-based swap dealer's exposure to a counterparty is the sum of the security-based swap dealer's *maximum potential exposure* to the counterparty, as defined in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, multiplied by the appropriate multiplication factor, and the security-based swap dealer's *current exposure* to the counterparty, as defined in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(C) of this section. The security-based swap dealer must use the multiplication factor determined according to paragraph (d)(9)(i)(C)(*5*) of this section, except that the initial multiplication factor shall be one, unless the Commission determines, based on a review of the security-based swap dealer's application or an amendment to the application approved under paragraph (d) of this section, including a review of its internal risk management control system and practices and VaR models, that another multiplication factor is appropriate;


(B) The *maximum potential exposure* is the VaR of the counterparty's positions with the security-based swap dealer, after applying netting agreements with the counterparty meeting the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(D) of this section, taking into account the value of collateral from the counterparty held by the security-based swap dealer in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E) of this section, and taking into account the current replacement value of the counterparty's positions with the security-based swap dealer;


(C) The *current exposure* of the security-based swap dealer to a counterparty is the current replacement value of the counterparty's positions with the security-based swap dealer, after applying netting agreements with the counterparty meeting the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(D) of this section and taking into account the value of collateral from the counterparty held by the security-based swap dealer in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E) of this section;


(D) *Netting agreements.* A security-based swap dealer may include the effect of a netting agreement that allows the security-based swap dealer to net gross receivables from and gross payables to a counterparty upon default of the counterparty if:


(*1*) The netting agreement is legally enforceable in each relevant jurisdiction, including in insolvency proceedings;


(*2*) The gross receivables and gross payables that are subject to the netting agreement with a counterparty can be determined at any time; and


(*3*) For internal risk management purposes, the security-based swap dealer monitors and controls its exposure to the counterparty on a net basis;


(E) *Collateral.* When calculating maximum potential exposure and current exposure to a counterparty, the fair market value of collateral pledged and held may be taken into account provided:


(*1*) The collateral is marked to market each day and is subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement;


(*2*)(*i*) The collateral is subject to the security-based swap dealer's physical possession or control and may be liquidated promptly by the firm without intervention by any other party; or


(*ii*) The collateral is held by an independent third-party custodian that is a bank as defined in section 3(a)(6) of the Act or a registered U.S. clearing organization or depository that is not affiliated with the counterparty or, if the collateral consists of foreign securities or currencies, a supervised foreign bank, clearing organization, or depository that is not affiliated with the counterparty and that customarily maintains custody of such foreign securities or currencies;


(*3*) The collateral is liquid and transferable;


(*4*) The collateral agreement is legally enforceable by the security-based swap dealer against the counterparty and any other parties to the agreement;


(*5*) The collateral does not consist of securities issued by the counterparty or a party related to the security-based swap dealer or to the counterparty;


(*6*) The Commission has approved the security-based swap dealer's use of a VaR model to calculate deductions for market risk for the type of collateral in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section; and


(*7*) The collateral is not used in determining the credit rating of the counterparty;


(F) *Credit risk weights of counterparties.* A security-based swap dealer that computes its deductions for credit risk pursuant to this paragraph (e)(2) shall apply a credit risk weight for transactions with a counterparty of either 20 percent, 50 percent, or 150 percent based on an internal credit rating the security-based swap dealer determines for the counterparty.


(*1*) As part of its initial application or in an amendment, the security-based swap dealer may request Commission approval to apply a credit risk weight of either 20 percent, 50 percent, or 150 percent based on internal calculations of credit ratings, including internal estimates of the maturity adjustment. Based on the strength of the security-based swap dealer's internal credit risk management system, the Commission may approve the application. The security-based swap dealer must make and keep current a record of the basis for the credit risk weight of each counterparty;


(*2*) As part of its initial application or in an amendment, the security-based swap dealer may request Commission approval to determine credit risk weights based on internal calculations, including internal estimates of the maturity adjustment. Based on the strength of the security-based swap dealer's internal credit risk management system, the Commission may approve the application. The security-based swap dealer must make and keep current a record of the basis for the credit risk weight of each counterparty; and


(*3*) As part of its initial application or in an amendment, the security-based swap dealer may request Commission approval to reduce deductions for credit risk through the use of credit derivatives.


(f) *Internal risk management control systems.* A security-based swap dealer must comply with § 240.15c3-4 as if it were an OTC derivatives dealer with respect to all of its business activities, except that § 240.15c3-4(c)(5)(xiii) and (xiv) and (d)(8) and (9) shall not apply.


(g) *Debt-equity requirements.* No security-based swap dealer shall permit the total of outstanding principal amounts of its satisfactory subordination agreements (other than such agreements which qualify under this paragraph (g) as equity capital) to exceed 70 percent of its debt-equity total, as hereinafter defined, for a period in excess of 90 days or for such longer period which the Commission may, upon application of the security-based swap dealer, grant in the public interest or for the protection of investors. In the case of a corporation, the debt-equity total shall be the sum of its outstanding principal amounts of satisfactory subordination agreements, par or stated value of capital stock, paid in capital in excess of par, retained earnings, unrealized profit and loss or other capital accounts. In the case of a partnership, the debt-equity total shall be the sum of its outstanding principal amounts of satisfactory subordination agreements, capital accounts of partners (exclusive of such partners' securities accounts) subject to the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section, and unrealized profit and loss. *Provided, however,* that a satisfactory subordinated loan agreement entered into by a partner or stockholder which has an initial term of at least three years and has a remaining term of not less than 12 months shall be considered equity for the purposes of this paragraph (g) if:


(1) It does not have any of the provisions for accelerated maturity provided for by paragraph (b)(8)(i) or (b)(9)(i) or (ii) of § 240.18a-1d and is maintained as capital subject to the provisions restricting the withdrawal thereof required by paragraph (h) of this section; or


(2) The partnership agreement provides that capital contributed pursuant to a satisfactory subordination agreement as defined in § 240.18a-1d shall in all respects be partnership capital subject to the provisions restricting the withdrawal thereof required by paragraph (h) of this section.


(h) *Provisions relating to the withdrawal of equity capital*—(1) *Notice provisions relating to limitations on the withdrawal of equity capital.* No equity capital of the security-based swap dealer or a subsidiary or affiliate consolidated pursuant to § 240.18a-1c may be withdrawn by action of a stockholder or a partner or by redemption or repurchase of shares of stock by any of the consolidated entities or through the payment of dividends or any similar distribution, nor may any unsecured advance or loan be made to a stockholder, partner, employee or affiliate without written notice given in accordance with paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section:


(i) Two business days prior to any withdrawals, advances or loans if those withdrawals, advances or loans on a net basis exceed in the aggregate in any 30 calendar day period, 30 percent of the security-based swap dealer's excess net capital. A security-based swap dealer, in an emergency situation, may make withdrawals, advances or loans that on a net basis exceed 30 percent of the security-based swap dealer's excess net capital in any 30 calendar day period without giving the advance notice required by this paragraph, with the prior approval of the Commission. Where a security-based swap dealer makes a withdrawal with the consent of the Commission, it shall in any event comply with paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section; or


(ii) Two business days after any withdrawals, advances or loans if those withdrawals, advances or loans on a net basis exceed in the aggregate in any 30 calendar day period, 20 percent of the security-based swap dealer's excess net capital.


(iii) This paragraph (h)(1) does not apply to:


(A) Securities or commodities transactions in the ordinary course of business between a security-based swap dealer and an affiliate where the security-based swap dealer makes payment to or on behalf of such affiliate for such transaction and then receives payment from such affiliate for the securities or commodities transaction within two business days from the date of the transaction; or


(B) Withdrawals, advances or loans which in the aggregate in any thirty calendar day period, on a net basis, equal $500,000 or less.


(iv) Each required notice shall be effective when received by the Commission in Washington, DC, the regional office of the Commission for the region in which the security-based swap dealer has its principal place of business, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission if such security-based swap dealer is registered with that Commission.


(2) *Limitations on withdrawal of equity capital.* No equity capital of the security-based swap dealer or a subsidiary or affiliate consolidated pursuant to § 240.18a-1c may be withdrawn by action of a stockholder or a partner or by redemption or repurchase of shares of stock by any of the consolidated entities or through the payment of dividends or any similar distribution, nor may any unsecured advance or loan be made to a stockholder, partner, employee or affiliate, if after giving effect thereto and to any other such withdrawals, advances or loans and any Payments of Payments Obligations (as defined in § 240.18a-1d) under satisfactory subordinated loan agreements which are scheduled to occur within 180 days following such withdrawal, advance or loan if:


(i) The security-based swap dealer's net capital would be less than 120 percent of the minimum dollar amount required by paragraph (a) of this section; or


(ii) The total outstanding principal amounts of satisfactory subordinated loan agreements of the security-based swap dealer and any subsidiaries or affiliates consolidated pursuant to § 240.18a-1c (other than such agreements which qualify as equity under paragraph (g) of this section) would exceed 70 percent of the debt-equity total as defined in paragraph (g) of this section.


(3) *Temporary restrictions on withdrawal of net capital.* (i) The Commission may by order restrict, for a period up to twenty business days, any withdrawal by the security-based swap dealer of equity capital or unsecured loan or advance to a stockholder, partner, member, employee or affiliate under such terms and conditions as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or consistent with the protection of investors if the Commission, based on the information available, concludes that such withdrawal, advance or loan may be detrimental to the financial integrity of the security-based swap dealer, or may unduly jeopardize the security-based swap dealer's ability to repay its customer claims or other liabilities which may cause a significant impact on the markets or expose the customers or creditors of the security-based swap dealer to loss.


(ii) An order temporarily prohibiting the withdrawal of capital shall be rescinded if the Commission determines that the restriction on capital withdrawal should not remain in effect. A hearing on an order temporarily prohibiting withdrawal of capital will be held within two business days from the date of the request in writing by the security-based swap dealer.


(4) *Miscellaneous provisions.* (i) Excess net capital is that amount in excess of the amount required under paragraph (a) of this section. For the purposes of paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) of this section, a security-based swap dealer may use the amount of excess net capital and deductions required under paragraphs (c)(1)(vi) and (vii) and § 240.18a-1a reported in its most recently required filed Part II of Form X-17A-5 for the purposes of calculating the effect of a projected withdrawal, advance or loan relative to excess net capital or deductions. The security-based swap dealer must assure itself that the excess net capital or the deductions reported on the most recently required filed Part II of Form X-17A-5 have not materially changed since the time such report was filed.


(ii) The term equity capital includes capital contributions by partners, par or stated value of capital stock, paid-in capital in excess of par, retained earnings or other capital accounts. The term equity capital does not include securities in the securities accounts of partners and balances in limited partners' capital accounts in excess of their stated capital contributions.


(iii) Paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) of this section shall not preclude a security-based swap dealer from making required tax payments or preclude the payment to partners of reasonable compensation, and such payments shall not be included in the calculation of withdrawals, advances, or loans for purposes of paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) of this section.


(iv) For the purpose of this paragraph (h), any transactions between a security-based swap dealer and a stockholder, partner, employee or affiliate that results in a diminution of the security-based swap dealer's net capital shall be deemed to be an advance or loan of net capital.
