# § 240.18a-1a   Options.

(a)(1) *Definitions.* The term *unlisted option* means any option not included in the definition of listed option provided in § 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(x).


(2) The term *option series* refers to listed option contracts of the same type (either a call or a put) and exercise style, covering the same underlying security with the same exercise price, expiration date, and number of underlying units.


(3) The term *related instrument* within an option class or product group refers to futures contracts, options on futures contracts, security-based swaps on a narrow-based security index, and swaps covering the same underlying instrument. In relation to options on foreign currencies, a related instrument within an option class also shall include forward contracts on the same underlying currency.


(4) The term *underlying instrument* refers to long and short positions, as appropriate, covering the same foreign currency, the same security, security future, or security-based swap other than a security-based swap on a narrow-based security index, or a security which is exchangeable for or convertible into the underlying security within a period of 90 days. If the exchange or conversion requires the payment of money or results in a loss upon conversion at the time when the security is deemed an underlying instrument for purposes of this Appendix A, the broker or dealer will deduct from net worth the full amount of the conversion loss. The term *underlying instrument* shall not be deemed to include securities options, futures contracts, options on futures contracts, security-based swaps on a narrow-based security index, qualified stock baskets, unlisted instruments, or swaps.


(5) The term *options class* refers to all options contracts covering the same underlying instrument.


(6) The term *product group* refers to two or more option classes, related instruments, underlying instruments, and qualified stock baskets in the same portfolio type (see paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section) for which it has been determined that a percentage of offsetting profits may be applied to losses at the same valuation point.


(b) The deduction under this Appendix A must equal the sum of the deductions specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(C) of this section.


(1)(i) *Definitions.* (A) The terms *theoretical gains and losses* mean the gain and loss in the value of individual option series, the value of underlying instruments, related instruments, and qualified stock baskets within that option's class, at 10 equidistant intervals (valuation points) ranging from an assumed movement (both up and down) in the current market value of the underlying instrument equal to the percentage corresponding to the deductions otherwise required under § 240.15c3-1 for the underlying instrument (see paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section). Theoretical gains and losses shall be calculated using a theoretical options pricing model that satisfies the criteria set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section.


(B) The term *theoretical options pricing model* means any mathematical model, other than a security-based swap dealer's proprietary model, the use of which has been approved by the Commission. Any such model shall calculate theoretical gains and losses as described in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section for all series and issues of equity, index and foreign currency options and related instruments, and shall be made available equally and on the same terms to all security-based swap dealers. Its procedures shall include the arrangement of the vendor to supply accurate and timely data to each security-based swap dealer with respect to its services, and the fees for distribution of the services. The data provided to security-based swap dealers shall also contain the minimum requirements set forth in paragraphs (b)(1)(iv)(C) of this section and the product group offsets set forth in paragraphs (b)(1)(iv)(B) of this section. At a minimum, the model shall consider the following factors in pricing the option:


(*1*) The current spot price of the underlying asset;


(*2*) The exercise price of the option;


(*3*) The remaining time until the option's expiration;


(*4*) The volatility of the underlying asset;


(*5*) Any cash flows associated with ownership of the underlying asset that can reasonably be expected to occur during the remaining life of the option; and


(*6*) The current term structure of interest rates.


(C) The term *major market foreign currency* means the currency of a sovereign nation for which there is a substantial inter-bank forward currency market.


(D) The term *qualified stock basket* means a set or basket of stock positions which represents no less than 50 percent of the capitalization for a high-capitalization or non-high-capitalization diversified market index, or, in the case of a narrow-based index, no less than 95 percent of the capitalization for such narrow-based index.


(ii) With respect to positions involving listed options in its proprietary or other account, the security-based swap dealer shall group long and short positions into the following portfolio types:


(A) Equity options on the same underlying instrument and positions in that underlying instrument;


(B) Options on the same major market foreign currency, positions in that major market foreign currency, and related instruments within those options' classes;


(C) High-capitalization diversified market index options, related instruments within the option's class, and qualified stock baskets in the same index;


(D) Non-high-capitalization diversified index options, related instruments within the index option's class, and qualified stock baskets in the same index; and


(E) Narrow-based index options, related instruments within the index option's class, and qualified stock baskets in the same index.


(iii) Before making the computation, each security-based swap dealer shall obtain the theoretical gains and losses for each option series and for the related and underlying instruments within those options' class in the proprietary or other accounts of that security-based swap dealer. For each option series, the theoretical options pricing model shall calculate theoretical prices at 10 equidistant valuation points within a range consisting of an increase or a decrease of the following percentages of the daily market price of the underlying instrument:


(A) +(−) 15 percent for equity securities with a ready market, narrow-based indexes, and non-high-capitalization diversified indexes;


(B) +(−) 6 percent for major market foreign currencies;


(C) +(−) 20 percent for all other currencies; and


(D) +(−)10 percent for high-capitalization diversified indexes.


(iv)(A) The security-based swap dealer shall multiply the corresponding theoretical gains and losses at each of the 10 equidistant valuation points by the number of positions held in a particular option series, the related instruments and qualified stock baskets within the option's class, and the positions in the same underlying instrument.


(B) In determining the aggregate profit or loss for each portfolio type, the security-based swap dealer will be allowed the following offsets in the following order, provided, that in the case of qualified stock baskets, the security-based swap dealer may elect to net individual stocks between qualified stock baskets and take the appropriate deduction on the remaining, if any, securities:


(*1*) First, a security-based swap dealer is allowed the following offsets within an option's class:


(*i*) Between options on the same underlying instrument, positions covering the same underlying instrument, and related instruments within the option's class, 100 percent of a position's gain shall offset another position's loss at the same valuation point;


(*ii*) Between index options, related instruments within the option's class, and qualified stock baskets on the same index, 95 percent, or such other amount as designated by the Commission, of gains shall offset losses at the same valuation point;


(*2*) Second, a security-based swap dealer is allowed the following offsets within an index product group:


(*i*) Among positions involving different high-capitalization diversified index option classes within the same product group, 90 percent of the gain in a high-capitalization diversified market index option, related instruments, and qualified stock baskets within that index option's class shall offset the loss at the same valuation point in a different high-capitalization diversified market index option, related instruments, and qualified stock baskets within that index option's class;


(*ii*) Among positions involving different non-high-capitalization diversified index option classes within the same product group, 75 percent of the gain in a non-high-capitalization diversified market index option, related instruments, and qualified stock baskets within that index option's class shall offset the loss at the same valuation point in another non-high-capitalization diversified market index option, related instruments, and qualified stock baskets within that index option's class or product group;


(*iii*) Among positions involving different narrow-based index option classes within the same product group, 90 percent of the gain in a narrow-based market index option, related instruments, and qualified stock baskets within that index option's class shall offset the loss at the same valuation point in another narrow-based market index option, related instruments, and qualified stock baskets within that index option's class or product group;


(*iv*) No qualified stock basket should offset another qualified stock basket; and


(*3*) Third, a security-based swap dealer is allowed the following offsets between product groups: Among positions involving different diversified index product groups within the same market group, 50 percent of the gain in a diversified market index option, a related instrument, or a qualified stock basket within that index option's product group shall offset the loss at the same valuation point in another product group;


(C) For each portfolio type, the total deduction shall be the larger of:


(*1*) The amount for any of the 10 equidistant valuation points representing the largest theoretical loss after applying the offsets provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(B) if this section; or


(*2*) A minimum charge equal to 25 percent times the multiplier for each equity and index option contract and each related instrument within the option's class or product group, or $25 for each option on a major market foreign currency with the minimum charge for futures contracts and options on futures contracts adjusted for contract size differentials, not to exceed market value in the case of long positions in options and options on futures contracts; plus


(*3*) In the case of portfolio types involving index options and related instruments offset by a qualified stock basket, there will be a minimum charge of 5 percent of the market value of the qualified stock basket for high-capitalization diversified and narrow-based indexes;


(*4*) In the case of portfolio types involving index options and related instruments offset by a qualified stock basket, there will be a minimum charge of 7
1/2 percent of the market value of the qualified stock basket for non-high-capitalization diversified indexes; and


(*5*) In the case of portfolio types involving security futures and equity options on the same underlying instrument and positions in that underlying instrument, there will be a minimum charge of 25 percent times the multiplier for each security-future and equity option.
