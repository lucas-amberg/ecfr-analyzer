# § 240.18a-1b   Adjustments to net worth for certain commodities transactions.

(a) Every registered security-based swap dealer in computing net capital pursuant to § 240.18a-1 shall comply with the following:


(1) Where a security-based swap dealer has an asset or liability which is treated or defined in paragraph (c) of § 240.18a-1, the inclusion or exclusion of all or part of such asset or liability for net capital shall be in accordance with § 240.18a-1, except as specifically provided otherwise in this section. Where a commodity related asset or liability, including a swap-related asset or liability, is specifically treated or defined in 17 CFR 1.17 and is not generally or specifically treated or defined in § 240.18a-1 or this section, the inclusion or exclusion of all or part of such asset or liability for net capital shall be in accordance with 17 CFR 1.17.


(2) In computing net capital as defined in § 240.18a-1(c)(1), the net worth of a security-based swap dealer shall be adjusted as follows with respect to commodity-related transactions:


(i)(A) Unrealized profits shall be added and unrealized losses shall be deducted in the commodities accounts of the security-based swap dealer, including unrealized profits and losses on fixed price commitments and forward contracts; and


(B) The value attributed to any commodity option which is not traded on a contract market shall be the difference between the option's strike price and the market value for the physical or futures contract which is the subject of the option. In the case of a long call commodity option, if the market value for the physical or futures contract which is the subject of the option is less than the strike price of the option, it shall be given no value. In the case of a long put commodity option, if the market value for the physical commodity or futures contract which is the subject of the option is more than the striking price of the option, it shall be given no value.


(ii) Deduct any unsecured commodity futures or option account containing a ledger balance and open trades, the combination of which liquidates to a deficit or containing a debit ledger balance only: *Provided, however,* Deficits or debit ledger balances in unsecured customers', non-customers' and proprietary accounts, which are the subject of calls for margin or other required deposits need not be deducted until the close of business on the business day following the date on which such deficit or debit ledger balance originated;


(iii) Deduct all unsecured receivables, advances and loans except for:


(A) Management fees receivable from commodity pools outstanding no longer than thirty (30) days from the date they are due;


(B) Receivables from foreign clearing organizations;


(C) Receivables from registered futures commission merchants or brokers, resulting from cleared swap transactions or, commodity futures or option transactions, except those specifically excluded under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.


(iv) Deduct all inventories (including work in process, finished goods, raw materials and inventories held for resale) except for readily marketable spot commodities; or spot commodities which adequately collateralize indebtedness under 17 CFR 1.17(c)(7);


(v) Guarantee deposits with commodities clearing organizations are not required to be deducted from net worth;


(vi) Stock in commodities clearing organizations to the extent of its margin value is not required to be deducted from net worth;


(vii) Deduct from net worth the amount by which any advances paid by the security-based swap dealer on cash commodity contracts and used in computing net capital exceeds 95 percent of the market value of the commodities covered by such contracts.


(viii) Do not include equity in the commodity accounts of partners in net worth.


(ix) In the case of all inventory, fixed price commitments and forward contracts, except for inventory and forward contracts in the inter-bank market in those foreign currencies which are purchased or sold for further delivery on or subject to the rules of a contract market and covered by an open futures contract for which there will be no charge, deduct the applicable percentage of the net position specified below:


(A) Inventory which is currently registered as deliverable on a contract market and covered by an open futures contract or by a commodity option on a physical—No charge.


(B) Inventory which is covered by an open futures contract or commodity option—5 percent of the market value.


(C) Inventory which is not covered—20 percent of the market value.


(D) Fixed price commitments (open purchases and sales) and forward contracts which are covered by an open futures contract or commodity option—10 percent of the market value.


(E) Fixed price commitments (open purchases and sales) and forward contracts which are not covered by an open futures contract or commodity option—20 percent of the market value.


(x) Deduct for undermargined customer commodity futures accounts the amount of funds required in each such account to meet maintenance margin requirements of the applicable board of trade or, if there are no such maintenance margin requirements, clearing organization margin requirements applicable to such positions, after application of calls for margin, or other required deposits which are outstanding three business days or less. If there are no such maintenance margin requirements or clearing organization margin requirements on such accounts, then deduct the amount of funds required to provide margin equal to the amount necessary after application of calls for margin, or other required deposits outstanding three days or less to restore original margin when the original margin has been depleted by 50 percent or more. *Provided,* To the extent a deficit is deducted from net worth in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, such amount shall not also be deducted under this paragraph (a)(2)(x). In the event that an owner of a customer account has deposited an asset other than cash to margin, guarantee or secure his account, the value attributable to such asset for purposes of this paragraph shall be the lesser of the value attributable to such asset pursuant to the margin rules of the applicable board of trade, or the market value of such asset after application of the percentage deductions specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ix) of this section or, where appropriate, specified in § 240.18a-1(c)(1)(iv), (vi), or (vii) of this part;


(xi) Deduct for undermargined non-customer and omnibus commodity futures accounts the amount of funds required in each such account to meet maintenance margin requirements of the applicable board of trade or, if there are no such maintenance margin requirements, clearing organization margin requirements applicable to such positions, after application of calls for margin, or other required deposits which are outstanding two business days or less. If there are no such maintenance margin requirements or clearing organization margin requirements, then deduct the amount of funds required to provide margin equal to the amount necessary after application of calls for margin, or other required deposits outstanding two days or less to restore original margin when the original margin has been depleted by 50 percent or more. *Provided,* To the extent a deficit is deducted from net worth in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section such amount shall not also be deducted under this paragraph (a)(2)(xi). In the event that an owner of a non-customer or omnibus account has deposited an asset other than cash to margin, guarantee or secure the account, the value attributable to such asset for purposes of this paragraph shall be the lesser of the value attributable to such asset pursuant to the margin rules of the applicable board of trade, or the market value of such asset after application of the percentage deductions specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ix) of this section or, where appropriate, specified in § 240.18a-1(c)(1)(iv), (vi), or (vii) of this part;


(xii) In the case of open futures contracts and granted (sold) commodity options held in proprietary accounts carried by the security-based swap dealer which are not covered by a position held by the security-based swap dealer or which are not the result of a “changer trade” made in accordance with the rules of a contract market, deduct:


(A) For a security-based swap dealer which is a clearing member of a contract market for the positions on such contract market cleared by such member, the applicable margin requirement of the applicable clearing organization;


(B) For a security-based swap dealer which is a member of a self-regulatory organization, 150 percent of the applicable maintenance margin requirement of the applicable board of trade or clearing organization, whichever is greater; or


(C) For all other security-based swap dealers, 200 percent of the applicable maintenance margin requirement of the applicable board of trade or clearing organization, whichever is greater; or


(D) For open contracts or granted (sold) commodity options for which there are no applicable maintenance margin requirements, 200 percent of the applicable initial margin requirement; *Provided,* the equity in any such proprietary account shall reduce the deduction required by this paragraph (a)(2)(xii) if such equity is not otherwise includable in net capital.


(xiii) In the case of a security-based swap dealer which is a purchaser of a commodity option which is traded on a contract market, the deduction shall be the same safety factor as if the security-based swap dealer were the grantor of such option in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(xii) of this section, but in no event shall the safety factor be greater than the market value attributed to such option.


(xiv) In the case of a security-based swap dealer which is a purchaser of a commodity option not traded on a contract market which has value and such value is used to increase net capital, the deduction is ten percent of the market value of the physical or futures contract which is the subject of such option but in no event more than the value attributed to such option.


(xv) A loan or advance or any other form of receivable shall not be considered “secured” for the purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section unless the following conditions exist:


(A) The receivable is secured by readily marketable collateral which is otherwise unencumbered and which can be readily converted into cash: *Provided, however,* That the receivable will be considered secured only to the extent of the market value of such collateral after application of the percentage deductions specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ix) of this section; and


(B)(*1*) The readily marketable collateral is in the possession or control of the security-based swap dealer; or


(*2*) The security-based swap dealer has a legally enforceable, written security agreement, signed by the debtor, and has a perfected security interest in the readily marketable collateral within the meaning of the laws of the State in which the readily marketable collateral is located.


(xvi) The term *cover* for purposes of this section shall mean cover as defined in 17 CFR 1.17(j).


(xvii) The term *customer* for purposes of this section shall mean customer as defined in 17 CFR 1.17(b)(2). The term *non-customer* for purposes of this section shall mean non-customer as defined in 17 CFR 1.17(b)(4).


(b) Every registered security-based swap dealer in computing net capital pursuant to § 240.18a-1 shall comply with the following:


(1) *Cleared swaps.* In the case of a cleared swap held in a proprietary account of the security-based swap dealer, deducting the amount of the applicable margin requirement of the derivatives clearing organization or, if the swap references an equity security index, the security-based swap dealer may take a deduction using the method specified in § 240.18a-1a.


(2) *Non-cleared swaps*—(i) *Credit default swaps referencing broad-based security indices.* In the case of a non-cleared credit default swap for which the deductions in § 240.18a-1(e) do not apply:


(A) *Short positions (selling protection).* In the case of a non-cleared swap that is a short credit default swap referencing a broad-based security index, deducting the percentage of the notional amount based upon the current basis point spread of the credit default swap and the maturity of the credit default swap in accordance with table 1 to § 240.18a-1b(b)(2)(i)(A):


(B) *Long positions (purchasing protection).* In the case of a non-cleared swap that is a long credit default swap referencing a broad-based security index, deducting 50 percent of the deduction that would be required by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section if the non-cleared swap was a short credit default swap, each such deduction not to exceed the current market value of the long position.


(C) *Long and short credit default swaps.* In the case of non-cleared swaps that are long and short credit default swaps referencing the same broad-based security index, have the same credit events which would trigger payment by the seller of protection, have the same basket of obligations which would determine the amount of payment by the seller of protection upon the occurrence of a credit event, that are in the same or adjacent spread category, and that are in the same or adjacent maturity category and have a maturity date within three months of the other maturity category, deducting the percentage of the notional amount specified in the higher maturity category under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section on the excess of the long or short position.


(D) *Long basket of obligors and long credit default swap.* In the case of a non-cleared swap that is a long credit default swap referencing a broad-based security index and the security-based swap dealer is long a basket of debt securities comprising all of the components of the security index, deducting 50 percent of the amount specified in § 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi) for the component securities, provided the security-based swap dealer can deliver the component securities to satisfy the obligation of the security-based swap dealer on the credit default swap.


(E) *Short basket of obligors and short credit default swap.* In the case of a non-cleared swap that is a short credit default swap referencing a broad-based security index and the security-based swap dealer is short a basket of debt securities comprising all of the components of the security index, deducting the amount specified in § 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi) for the component securities.


(ii) *All other swaps.* (A) In the case of any non-cleared swap that is not a credit default swap for which the deductions in § 240.18a-1(e) do not apply, deducting the amount calculated by multiplying the notional value of the swap by the percentage specified in:


(*1*) Section 240.15c3-1 applicable to the reference asset if § 240.15c3-1 specifies a percentage deduction for the type of asset;


(*2*) 17 CFR 1.17 applicable to the reference asset if 17 CFR 1.17 specifies a percentage deduction for the type of asset and § 240.15c3-1 does not specify a percentage deduction for the type of asset; or


(*3*) In the case of a non-cleared interest rate swap, § 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(A) based on the maturity of the swap, provided that the percentage deduction must be no less than one eighth of 1 percent of the amount of a long position that is netted against a short position in the case of a non-cleared swap with a maturity of three months or more.


(B) A security-based swap dealer may reduce the deduction under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section by an amount equal to any reduction recognized for a comparable long or short position in the reference asset or interest rate under 17 CFR 1.17 or § 240.15c3-1.
