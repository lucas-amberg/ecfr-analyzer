(C) If applicable, a description of an instance of non-compliance with § 240.18a-1 or § 240.18a-4(c) as of the end of the most recent fiscal year.


(ii) The term *Internal Control Over Compliance* means internal controls that have the objective of providing the security-based swap dealer with reasonable assurance that non-compliance with § 240.18a-1, § 240.18a-4(c), § 240.18a-9, or § 240.17a-13, as applicable, will be prevented or detected on a timely basis.


(iii) The security-based swap dealer is not permitted to conclude that its Internal Control Over Compliance was effective during the most recent fiscal year if there were one or more material weaknesses in its Internal Control Over Compliance during the most recent fiscal year. The security-based swap dealer is not permitted to conclude that its Internal Control Over Compliance was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year if there were one or more material weaknesses in its internal control as of the end of the most recent fiscal year. A *material weakness* is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in Internal Control Over Compliance such that there is a reasonable possibility that non-compliance with § 240.18a-1 or § 240.18a-4(c) will not be prevented, or detected on a timely basis or that non-compliance to a material extent with § 240.18a-4, except for paragraph (c), or § 240.18a-9 or § 240.17a-13, as applicable, will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A deficiency in Internal Control Over Compliance exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow the management or employees of the security-based swap dealer in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect on a timely basis non-compliance with § 240.18a-1, § 240.18a-4, § 240.18a-9, or § 240.17a-13, as applicable.

(i) A statement that the security-based swap dealer met the exemption provisions in § 240.18a-4(f) throughout the most recent fiscal year without exception or that it met the exemption provisions in § 240.18a-4(f) throughout the most recent fiscal year except as described under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section; and


(ii) If applicable, a statement that identifies each exception during the most recent fiscal year in meeting the exemption provisions in § 240.18a-4(f) and that briefly describes the nature of each exception and the approximate date(s) on which the exception existed.


(5) *Timing of filing.* The annual reports must be filed not more than sixty (60) calendar days after the end of the fiscal year of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant.


(6) *Location of filing.* The annual reports must be filed with the Commission at the regional office of the Commission for the region in which the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant has its principal place of business and the Commission's principal office in Washington, DC, or the annual reports may be filed with the Commission electronically in accordance with directions provided on the Commission's website.


(d) *Nature and form of reports.* The annual reports filed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section must be prepared and filed in accordance with the following requirements:


(1)(i) The security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant must attach to each of the confidential and non-confidential portions of the annual reports separately bound under paragraph (d)(2) of this section a complete and executed Part III of Form X-17A-5 (§ 249.617 of this chapter). The security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant must attach to the financial report an oath or affirmation that, to the best knowledge and belief of the person making the oath or affirmation:


(A) The financial report is true and correct; and


(B) Neither the registrant, nor any partner, officer, director, or equivalent person, as the case may be, has any proprietary interest in any account classified solely as that of a customer.


(ii) The oath or affirmation must be made before a person duly authorized to administer such oaths or affirmations. If the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant is a sole proprietorship, the oath or affirmation must be made by the proprietor; if a partnership, by a general partner; if a corporation, by a duly authorized officer; or if a limited liability company or limited liability partnership, by the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, manager, managing member, or those members vested with management authority for the limited liability company or limited liability partnership.


(2) The annual reports filed under paragraph (c) of this section are not confidential, except that, if the Statement of Financial Condition is in a format that is consistent with Part II of Form X-17A-5 (§ 249.617 of this chapter), and is bound separately from the balance of the annual reports filed under paragraph (c) of this section, and each page of the balance of the annual report is stamped “confidential,” then the balance of the annual reports will be deemed confidential to the extent permitted by law. However, the annual reports, including the confidential portions, will be available for official use by any official or employee of the U.S. or any State, and by any other person if the Commission authorizes disclosure of the annual reports to that person as being in the public interest. Nothing contained in this paragraph (d)(2) may be construed to be in derogation of the right of customers of a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, upon request to the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, to obtain information relative to its financial condition.


(e) *Independent public accountant*—(1) *Qualifications of independent public accountant.* The independent public accountant must be qualified and independent in accordance with § 210.2-01 of this chapter.


(2) *Statement regarding independent public accountant.* (i) Every security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant that is required to file annual reports under paragraph (c) of this section must file no later than December 10 of each year (or 30 days after effective date of its registration as a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant if earlier) a statement as prescribed in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section with the Commission's principal office in Washington, DC and the regional office of the Commission for the region in which its principal place of business is located. The statement must be dated no later than December 1 (or 20 calendar days after the effective date of its registration as a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, if earlier). If the engagement of an independent public accountant is of a continuing nature, providing for successive engagements, no further filing is required. If the engagement is for a single year, or if the most recent engagement has been terminated or amended, a new statement must be filed by the required date.


(ii) The statement must be headed “Statement regarding independent public accountant under Rule 18a-7(e)(2)” and must contain the following information and representations:


(A) Name, address, telephone number and registration number of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant.

(3) *Replacement of accountant.* A security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant must file a notice that must be received by the Commission's principal office in Washington, DC and the regional office of the Commission for the region in which its principal place of business is located not more than 15 business days after:


(i) The security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant has notified the independent public accountant that provided the reports the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant filed under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section for the most recent fiscal year that the independent public accountant's services will not be used in future engagements; or

(B) The details of any issues arising during the 24 months (or the period of the engagement, if less than 24 months) preceding the termination or new engagement relating to any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, auditing scope or procedure, or compliance with applicable rules of the Commission, which issues, if not resolved to the satisfaction of the former independent public accountant, would have caused the independent public accountant to make reference to them in the report of the independent public accountant. The issues required to be reported include both those resolved to the former independent public accountant's satisfaction and those not resolved to the former accountant's satisfaction. Issues contemplated by this section are those which occur at the decision-making level—that is, between principal financial officers of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant and personnel of the accounting firm responsible for rendering its report. The notice must also state whether the accountant's report filed under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section for any of the past two fiscal years contained an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion or was qualified as to uncertainties, audit scope, or accounting principles, and must describe the nature of each such adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion, or qualification. The security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant must also request the former independent public accountant to furnish the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant with a letter addressed to the Commission stating whether the independent public accountant agrees with the statements contained in the notice of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant and, if not, stating the respects in which the independent public accountant does not agree. The security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant must file three copies of the notice and the accountant's letter, one copy of which must be manually signed by the sole proprietor, or a general partner or a duly authorized corporate, limited liability company, or limited liability partnership officer or member, as appropriate, and by the independent public accountant, respectively.

(1) To prepare an independent public accountant's report based on an examination of the financial report required to be filed by the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in the United States or the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; and

(ii) To prepare an independent public accountant's report based on a review of the statements required under paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (ii) of this section in the exemption report required to be filed by the security-based swap dealer under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B)(*2*) of this section in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in the United States or the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.

If the notice from the accountant concerns an instance of non-compliance that would require a security-based swap dealer to provide a notification under § 240.18a-8, or if the notice concerns a material weakness, the security-based swap dealer must provide a notification in accordance with § 240.18a-8, as applicable, and provide a copy of the notification to the independent public accountant. If the independent public accountant does not receive the notification within one business day, or if the independent public accountant does not agree with the statements in the notification, then the independent public accountant must notify the Commission within one business day. The report from the accountant must, if the security-based swap dealer failed to file a notification, describe any instances of non-compliance that required a notification under § 240.18a-8 or any material weakness. If the security-based swap dealer filed a notification, the report from the accountant must detail the aspects of the notification of the security-based swap dealer with which the accountant does not agree; or


(2) A major security-based swap participant is not in compliance with § 240.18a-2, the independent public accountant must immediately notify the chief financial officer of the major security-based swap participant of the nature of the non-compliance. If the notice from the accountant concerns an instance of non-compliance that would require a major security-based swap participant to provide a notification under § 240.18a-8, the major security-based swap participant must provide a notification in accordance with § 240.18a-8 and provide a copy of the notification to the independent public accountant. If the independent public accountant does not receive the notification within one business day, or if the independent public accountant does not agree with the statements in the notification, then the independent public accountant must notify the Commission within one business day. The report from the accountant must, if the major security-based swap participant failed to file a notification, describe any instances of non-compliance that required a notification under § 240.18a-8. If the major security-based swap participant filed a notification, the report from the accountant must detail the aspects of the notification of the major security-based swap participant with which the accountant does not agree.
