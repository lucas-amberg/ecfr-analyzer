(a) Direct participation program securities sold on a basis whereby the purchase price is paid to the issuer in one or more mandatory deferred payments shall be deemed to be exempted securities for purposes of the arranging provisions of sections 7(c) and 11(d)(1) of the Act, provided that:


(1) The securities are registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or are sold or offered exclusively on an intrastate basis in reliance upon section 3(a)(11) of that Act;


(2) The mandatory deferred payments bear a reasonable relationship to the capital needs and program objectives described in a business development plan disclosed to investors in a registration statement filed with the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 or, where no registration statement is required to be filed with the Commission, as part of a statement filed with the relevant state securities administrator;


(3) Not less than 50 percent of the purchase price of the direct participation program security is paid by the investor at the time of sale;


(4) The total purchase price of the direct participation program security is due within three years in specified property programs or two years in non-specified property programs. Such pay-in periods are to be measured from the earlier of the completion of the offering or one year following the effective date of the offering.

(1) *Direct participation program* shall mean a program financed through the sale of securities, other than securities that are listed on an exchange, quoted on NASDAQ, or will otherwise be actively traded during the pay-in period as a result of efforts by the issuer, underwriter, or other participants in the initial distribution of such securities, that provides for flow-through tax consequences to its investors; *Provided, however,* That the term “direct participation program” does not include real estate investment trusts, Subchapter S corporate offerings, tax qualified pension and profit sharing plans under sections 401 and 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”), tax shelter annuities under section 403(b) of the Code, individual retirement plans under section 408 of the Code, and any issuer, including a separate account, that is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
