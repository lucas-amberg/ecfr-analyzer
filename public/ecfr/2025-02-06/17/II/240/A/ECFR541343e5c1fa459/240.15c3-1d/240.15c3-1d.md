# § 240.15c3-1d   Satisfactory Subordination Agreements (Appendix D to 17 CFR 240.15c3-1).

(a) *Introduction.* (1) This appendix sets forth minimum and non-exclusive requirements for satisfactory subordination agreements (hereinafter “subordination agreement”). The Examining Authority may require or the broker or dealer may include such other provisions as deemed necessary or appropriate to the extent such provisions do not cause the subordination agreement to fail to meet the minimum requirements of this Appendix (D). 


(2) *Certain definitions.* For purposes of 17 CFR 240.15c3-1 and this Appendix (D): 


(i) A subordination agreement may be either a subordinated loan agreement or a secured demand note agreement. 


(ii) The term *subordinated loan agreement* shall mean the agreement or agreements evidencing or governing a subordinated borrowing of cash. 


(iii) The term *collateral value* of any securities pledged to secure a secured demand note shall mean the market value of such securities after giving effect to the percentage deductions set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of § 240.15c3-1 except for paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(J). In lieu of the deduction under (c)(2)(vi)(J), the broker or dealer shall reduce the market value of the securities pledged to secure the secured demand note by 30 percent.


(iv) The term *payment obligation* shall mean the obligation of a broker or dealer in respect to any subordination agreement (A) to repay cash loaned to the broker or dealer pursuant to a subordinated loan agreement or (B) to return a secured demand note contributed to the broker or dealer or reduce the unpaid principal amount thereof and to return cash or securities pledged as collateral to secure the secured demand note and (C) “Payment” shall mean the performance by a broker or dealer of a Payment Obligation. 


(v)(A) The term *secured demand note agreement* shall mean an agreement (including the related secured demand note) evidencing or governing the contribution of a secured demand note to a broker or dealer and the pledge of securities and/or cash with the broker or dealer as collateral to secure payment of such secured demand note. The secured demand note agreement may provide that neither the lender, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns shall be personally liable on such note and that in the event of default the broker or dealer shall look for payment of such note solely to the collateral then pledged to secure the same. 


(B) The secured demand note shall be a promissory note executed by the lender and shall be payable on the demand of the broker or dealer to which it is contributed; provided, however, that the making of such demand may be conditioned upon the occurrence of any of certain events which are acceptable to the Commission and to the Examining Authority for such broker or dealer. 


(C) If such note is not paid upon presentment and demand as provided for therein, the broker or dealer shall have the right to liquidate all or any part of the securities then pledged as collateral to secure payment of the same and to apply the net proceeds of such liquidation, together with any cash then included in the collateral, in payment of such note. Subject to the prior rights of the broker or dealer as pledgee, the lender, as defined herein, may retain ownership of the collateral and have the benefit of any increases and bear the risks of any decreases in the value of the collateral and may retain the right to vote securities contained within the collateral and any right to income therefrom or distributions thereon, except the broker or dealer shall have the right to receive and hold as pledgee all dividends payable in securities and all partial and complete liquidating dividends. 


(D) Subject to the prior rights of the broker or dealer as pledgee, the lender may have the right to direct the sale of any securities included in the collateral, to direct the purchases of securities with any cash included therein, to withdraw excess collateral or to substitute cash or other securities as collateral, provided that the net proceeds of any such sale and the cash so substituted and the securities so purchased or substituted are held by the broker or dealer, as pledgee, and are included within the collateral to secure payment of the secured demand note, and provided further that no such transaction shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto, the sum of the amount of any cash, plus the Collateral Value of the securities, then pledged as collateral to secure the secured demand note would be less than the unpaid principal amount of the secured demand note. 


(E) Upon payment by the lender, as distinguished from a reduction by the lender which is provided for in (b)(6)(iii) or reduction by the broker or dealer as provided for in subparagraph (b)(7) of this appendix (D), of all or any part of the unpaid principal amount of the secured demand note, a broker or dealer shall issue to the lender a subordinated loan agreement in the amount of such payment (or in the case of a broker or dealer that is a partnership credit a capital account of the lender) or issue preferred or common stock of the broker or dealer in the amount of such payment, or any combination of the foregoing, as provided for in the secured demand note agreement. 


(F) The term *lender* shall mean the person who lends cash to a broker or dealer pursuant to a subordinated loan agreement and the person who contributes a secured demand note to a broker or dealer pursuant to a secured demand note agreement. 


(b) *Minimum requirements for subordination agreements.* (1) Subject to paragraph (a) of this section, a subordination agreement shall mean a written agreement between the broker or dealer and the lender, which (i) has a minimum term of one year, except for temporary subordination agreements provided for in paragraph (c)(5) of this appendix (D), and (ii) is a valid and binding obligation enforceable in accordance with its terms (subject as to enforcement to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws) against the broker or dealer and the lender and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. 


(2) *Specific amount.* All subordination agreements shall be for a specific dollar amount which shall not be reduced for the duration of the agreement except by installments as specifically provided for therein and except as otherwise provided in this appendix (D). 


(3) *Effective subordination.* The subordination agreement shall effectively subordinate any right of the lender to receive any Payment with respect thereto, together with accrued interest or compensation, to the prior payment or provision for payment in full of all claims of all present and future creditors of the broker or dealer arising out of any matter occurring prior to the date on which the related Payment Obligation matures consistent with the provisions of 17 CFR 240.15c3-1 and 240.15c3-1d, except for claims which are the subject of subordination agreements which rank on the same priority as or junior to the claim of the lender under such subordination agreements. 


(4) *Proceeds of subordinated loan agreements.* The subordinated loan agreement shall provide that the cash proceeds thereof shall be used and dealt with by the broker or dealer as part of its capital and shall be subject to the risks of the business. 


(5) *Certain rights of the broker or dealer.* The subordination agreement shall provide that the broker or dealer shall have the right to: 


(i) Deposit any cash proceeds of a subordinated loan agreement and any cash pledged as collateral to secure a secured demand note in an account or accounts in its own name in any bank or trust company; 


(ii) Pledge, repledge, hypothecate and rehypothecate, any or all of the securities pledged as collateral to secure a secured demand note, without notice, separately or in common with other securities or property for the purpose of securing any indebtedness of the broker or dealer; and 


(iii) Lend to itself or others any or all of the securities and cash pledged as collateral to secure a secured demand note. 


(6) *Collateral for secured demand notes.* Only cash and securities which are fully paid for and which may be publicly offered or sold without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, and the offer, sale and transfer of which are not otherwise restricted, may be pledged as collateral to secure a secured demand note. The secured demand note agreement shall provide that if at any time the sum of the amount of any cash, plus the Collateral Value of any securities, then pledged as collateral to secure the secured demand note is less than the unpaid principal amount of the secured demand note, the broker or dealer must immediately transmit written notice to that effect to the lender and the Examining Authority for such broker or dealer. The secured demand note agreement shall also require that following such transmittal: 


(i) The lender, prior to noon of the business day next succeeding the transmittal of such notice, may pledge as collateral additional cash or securities sufficient, after giving effect to such pledge, to bring the sum of the amount of any cash plus the Collateral Value of any securities, then pledged as collateral to secure the secured demand note, up to an amount not less than the unpaid principal amount of the secured demand note; and 


(ii) Unless additional cash or securities are pledged by the lender as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, the broker or dealer at noon on the business day next succeeding the transmittal of notice to the lender must commence sale, for the account of the lender, of such of the securities then pledged as collateral to secure the secured demand note and apply so much of the net proceeds thereof, together with such of the cash then pledged as collateral to secure the secured demand note as may be necessary to eliminate the unpaid principal amount of the secured demand note; *Provided, however,* That the unpaid principal amount of the secured demand note need not be reduced below the sum of the amount of any remaining cash, plus the Collateral Value of the remaining securities, then pledged as collateral to secure the secured demand note. The broker or dealer may not purchase for its own account any securities subject to such a sale. 


(iii) The secured demand note agreement also may provide that, in lieu of the procedures specified in the provisions required by paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, the lender with the prior written consent of the broker or dealer and the Examining Authority for the broker or dealer may reduce the unpaid principal amount of the secured demand note. After giving effect to such reduction, the aggregate indebtedness of the broker or dealer may not exceed 1000 percent of its net capital or, in the case of a broker or dealer operating pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of § 240.15c3-1, net capital may not be less than 5 percent of aggregate debit items computed in accordance with § 240.15c3-3a, or, if registered as a futures commission merchant, 7 percent of the funds required to be segregated pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder (less the market value of commodity options purchased by option customers subject to the rules of a contract market, each such deduction not to exceed the amount of funds in the option customer's account), if greater. No single secured demand note shall be permitted to be reduced by more than 15 percent of its original principal amount and after such reduction no excess collateral may be withdrawn. No Examining Authority shall consent to a reduction of the principal amount of a secured demand note if, after giving effect to such reduction, net capital would be less than 120 percent of the minimum dollar amount required by § 240.15c3-1.


(7) A broker or dealer at its option but not at the option of the lender may, if the subordination agreement so provides, make a Payment of all or any portion of the Payment Obligation thereunder prior to the scheduled maturity date of such Payment Obligation (hereinafter referred to as a “Prepayment”), but in no event may any Prepayment be made before the expiration of one year from the date such subordination agreement became effective. This restriction shall not apply to temporary subordination agreements that comply with the provisions of paragraph (c)(5) of this section. No Prepayment shall be made, if, after giving effect thereto (and to all Payments of Payment Obligations under any other subordinated agreements then outstanding the maturity or accelerated maturities of which are scheduled to fall due within six months after the date such Prepayment is to occur pursuant to this provision or on or prior to the date on which the Payment Obligation in respect of such Prepayment is scheduled to mature disregarding this provision, whichever date is earlier) without reference to any projected profit or loss of the broker or dealer, either aggregate indebtedness of the broker or dealer would exceed 1000 percent of its net capital or its net capital would be less than 120 percent of the minimum dollar amount required by § 240.15c3-1 or, in the case of a broker or dealer operating pursuant to § 240.15c3-1(a)(1)(ii), its net capital would be less than 5 percent of its aggregate debit items computed in accordance with § 240.15c3-3a, or if registered as a futures commission merchant, 7 percent of the funds required to be segregated pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder (less the market value of commodity options purchased by option customers subject to the rules of a contract market, each such deduction not to exceed the amount of funds in the option customer's account), if greater, or its net capital would be less than 120 percent of the minimum dollar amount required by § 240.15c3-1(a)(1)(ii), or if, in the case of a broker or dealer operating pursuant to § 240.15c3-1(a)(10), its net capital would be less than 120 percent of its minimum requirement.


(8)(i) The Payment Obligation of the broker or dealer in respect of any subordination agreement shall be suspended and shall not mature if, after giving effect to Payment of such Payment Obligation (and to all Payments of Payment Obligations of such broker or dealer under any other subordination agreement(s) then outstanding that are scheduled to mature on or before such Payment Obligation) either:


(A) The aggregate indebtedness of the broker or dealer would exceed 1200 percent of its net capital, or in the case of a broker or dealer operating pursuant to § 240.15c3-1(a)(1)(ii), its net capital would be less than 5 percent of aggregate debit items computed in accordance with § 240.15c3-3a or, if registered as a futures commission merchant, 6 percent of the funds required to be segregated pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder (less the market value of commodity options purchased by option customers on or subject to the rules of a contract market, each such deduction not to exceed the amount of funds in the option customer's account), if greater, or, in the case of a broker or dealer operating pursuant to § 240.15c3-1(a)(10), its net capital would be less than 120 percent of its minimum requirement; or


(B) Its net capital would be less than 120 percent of the minimum dollar amount required by § 240.15c3-1 including paragraph (a)(1)(ii), if applicable. The subordination agreement may provide that if the Payment Obligation of the broker or dealer thereunder does not mature and is suspended as a result of the requirement of this paragraph (b)(8) for a period of not less than six months, the broker or dealer shall thereupon commence the rapid and orderly liquidation of its business, but the right of the lender to receive Payment, together with accrued interest or compensation, shall remain subordinate as required by the provisions of §§ 240.15c3-1 and 240.15c3-1d.


(ii) [Reserved]


(9) *Accelerated maturity-obligation to repay to remain subordinate.* (i) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(8) of this appendix, a subordination agreement may provide that the lender may, upon prior written notice to the broker or dealer and the Examining Authority given not earlier than six months after the effective date of such subordination agreement, accelerate the date on which the Payment Obligation of the broker or dealer, together with accrued interest or compensation, is scheduled to mature to a date not earlier than six months after the giving of such notice, but the right of the lender to receive Payment, together with accrued interest or compensation, shall remain subordinate as required by the provisions of 17 CFR 240.15c3-1 and 240.15c3-1d. 


(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(8) of this appendix, the Payment Obligation of the broker or dealer with respect to a subordination agreement, together with accrued interest and compensation, shall mature in the event of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation pursuant to the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 or otherwise, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization whether or not pursuant to the bankruptcy laws, or any other marshalling of the assets and liabilities of the broker or dealer but the right of the lender to receive Payment, together with accrued interest or compensation, shall remain subordinate as required by the provisions of 17 CFR 240.15c3-1 and 240.15c3-1d. 


(10)(i) *Accelerated maturity of subordination agreements on event of default and event of acceleration—obligation to repay to remain subordinate.* A subordination agreement may provide that the lender may, upon prior written notice to the broker or dealer and the Examining Authority of the broker or dealer of the occurrence of any Event of Acceleration (as hereinafter defined) given no sooner than six months after the effective date of such subordination agreement, accelerate the date on which the Payment Obligation of the broker or dealer, together with accrued interest or compensation, is scheduled to mature, to the last business day of a calendar month which is not less than six months after notice of acceleration is received by the broker or dealer and the Examining Authority for the broker or dealer. Any subordination agreement containing such Events of Acceleration may also provide, that if upon such accelerated maturity date the Payment Obligation of the broker or dealer is suspended as required by paragraph (b)(8) of this appendix (D) and liquidation of the broker or dealer has not commenced on or prior to such accelerated maturity date, then notwithstanding paragraph (b)(8) of this appendix the Payment Obligation of the broker or dealer with respect to such subordination agreement shall mature on the day immediately following such accelerated maturity date and in any such event the Payment Obligations of the broker or dealer with respect to all other subordination agreements then outstanding shall also mature at the same time but the rights of the respective lenders to receive Payment, together with accrued interest or compensation, shall remain subordinate as required by the provisions of this Appendix (D). Events of Acceleration which may be included in a subordination agreement complying with this paragraph (b)(10) shall be limited to: 


(A) Failure to pay interest or any installment of principal on a subordination agreement as scheduled; 


(B) Failure to pay when due other money obligations of a specified material amount;

(D) Any specified and clearly measurable event which is included in the subordination agreement and which the lender and the broker or dealer agree (*1*) is a significant indication that the financial position of the broker or dealer has changed materially and adversely from agreed upon specified norms or (*2*) could materially and adversely affect the ability of the broker or dealer to conduct its business as conducted on the date the subordination agreement was made; or (*3*) is a significant change in the senior management of the broker or dealer or in the general business conducted by the broker or dealer from that which obtained on the date the subordination agreement became effective; 


(E) Any continued failure to perform agreed covenants included in the subordination agreement relating to the conduct of the business of the broker or dealer or relating to the maintenance and reporting of its financial position; and 


(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(8) of this appendix, a subordination agreement may provide that, if liquidation of the business of the broker or dealer has not already commenced, the Payment Obligation of the broker or dealer shall mature, together with accrued interest or compensation, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as hereinafter defined). Such agreement may also provide that, if liquidation of the business of the broker or dealer has not already commenced, the rapid and orderly liquidation of the business of the broker or dealer shall then commence upon the happening of an Event of Default. Any subordination agreement which so provides for maturity of the Payment Obligation upon the occurrence of an Event of Default shall also provide that the date on which such Event of Default occurs shall, if liquidation of the broker or dealer has not already commenced, be the date on which the Payment Obligations of the broker or dealer with respect to all other subordination agreements then outstanding shall mature but the rights of the respective lenders to receive Payment, together with accrued interest or compensation, shall remain subordinate as required by the provisions of this Appendix (D). Events of Default which may be included in a subordination agreement shall be limited to: 


(A) The making of an application by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation for a decree adjudicating that customers of the broker or dealer are in need of protection under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 and the failure of the broker or dealer to obtain the dismissal of such application within 30 days;

(C) The Commission shall revoke the registration of the broker or dealer; 


(D) The Examining Authority shall suspend (and not reinstate within 10 days) or revoke the broker's or dealer's status as a member thereof;

(2) Every broker or dealer shall immediately notify the Examining Authority for such broker or dealer if, after giving effect to all Payments of Payment Obligations under subordination agreements then outstanding that are then due or mature within the following six months without reference to any projected profit or loss of the broker or dealer either the aggregate indebtedness of the broker or dealer would exceed 1200 percent of its net capital or its net capital would be less than 120 percent of the minimum dollar amount required by § 240.15c3-1, or, in the case of a broker or dealer operating pursuant to § 240.15c3-1(a)(1)(ii), its net capital would be less than 5 percent of aggregate debit items computed in accordance with § 240.15c3-3a, or, if registered as a futures commission merchant, 6 percent of the funds required to be segregated pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder (less the market value of commodity options purchased by option customers on or subject to the rules of a contract market, each such deduction not to exceed the amount of funds in the option customer's account), if greater, or less than 120 percent of the minimum dollar amount required by § 240.15c3-1(a)(1)(ii), or, in the case of a broker or dealer operating pursuant to § 240.15c3-1(a)(10), its net capital would be less than 120 percent of its minimum requirement.

(4) *Legal title to securities.* All securities pledged as collateral to secure a secured demand note must be in bearer form, or registered in the name of the broker or dealer or the name of its nominee or custodian.

This temporary relief shall not apply to a broker or dealer if, within the preceding thirty calendar days, it has given notice pursuant to § 240.17a-11, or if immediately prior to entering into such subordination agreement, either:

Copies of the proposed agreement shall also be filed with the Examining Authority in such quantities and at such time as the Examining Authority may require. The broker or dealer shall also file with said parties a statement setting forth the name and address of the lender, the business relationship of the lender to the broker or dealer, and whether the broker or dealer carried funds or securities for the lender at or about the time the proposed agreement was so filed. All agreements shall be examined by the Commission's Regional Office or the Examining Authority with whom such agreement is required to be filed prior to their becoming effective. No proposed agreement shall be a satisfactory subordination agreement for the purposes of this section unless and until the Examining Authority has found the agreement acceptable and such agreement has become effective in the form found acceptable. 


(ii) The broker or dealer need not file with the Regional Office for the region in which the broker or dealer maintains its principal place of business (if a Regional Office is not its Examining Authority) copies of any proposed subordination agreement or the statement described above if the Examining Authority for that broker or dealer has consented to file with the Commission periodic reports (not less than monthly) summarizing for the period, on a firm-by-firm basis, the subordination agreements it has approved for that period. Such reports should include at the minimum, the amount of the loan and its duration, the name of the lender and the business relationship of the lender to the broker or dealer.
