(iv) *Counterparty notification* In connection with the transaction, the registered entity described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section notifies the counterparties of the non-U.S. person relying on this exception that the non-U.S. person is not registered with the Commission as a security-based swap dealer, and that certain Exchange Act provisions or rules addressing the regulation of security-based swaps would not be applicable in connection with the transaction, including provisions affording clearing rights to counterparties. Such notice shall be provided contemporaneously with, and in the same manner as, the arranging, negotiating, or executing activity at issue; *provided, however,* that during a period in which a counterparty is neither a customer (as such term is defined in § 240.15c3-3) of the registered entity described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section (if such registered entity is a registered broker or dealer) nor a counterparty to a security-based swap with the registered entity described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, such notice need only be provided contemporaneously with, and in the same manner as, the first such arranging, negotiating, or executing activity during such period.

The Commission shall publicly post such notice on the same section of its website.


(vii) *Limitation for covered inter-dealer security-based swaps.* The aggregate gross notional amount of covered inter-dealer security-based swap positions connected with dealing activity subject to the exception in this paragraph (d) engaged in by persons described in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section over the course of the immediately preceding 12 months does not exceed $50 billion.

(i) *Applications.* Applications for an order requesting listed jurisdiction status may be made by a party or group of parties that potentially would seek to rely on the exception provided by paragraph (d) of this section, or by any foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities supervising such a party or its security-based swap activities. Applications must be filed pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 240.0-13.

(iii) *Withdrawal or modification of listed jurisdiction status.* The Commission may, on its own initiative, by order after notice and opportunity for comment, modify or withdraw a jurisdiction's status as a listed jurisdiction, if the Commission determines that continued listed jurisdiction status no longer would be in the public interest, based on:


(A) The criteria set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section;


(B) Any laws or regulations that have had the effect of preventing the Commission or its representatives, on request, to promptly access information or documents regarding the activities of persons relying on the exception provided by this paragraph (d), to obtain the testimony of their foreign associated persons, and to obtain the assistance of persons relying on this exception in taking the evidence of other persons, wherever located, as described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A) of this section; and


(C) Any other factor the Commission determines to be relevant to whether continued status as a listed jurisdiction would be in the public interest.


(3) *Exception for person that engages in arranging, negotiating, or executing activity as agent.* The registered entity described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section need not count, against the *de minimis* thresholds described in § 240.3a71-2(a)(1), the transactions described by paragraph (d) of this section.

(i) The conditions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section are satisfied in connection with such activities; and
