# § 240.13f-1   Reporting by institutional investment managers of information with respect to accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.

(a)(1) Every institutional investment manager which exercises investment discretion with respect to accounts holding section 13(f) securities, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, having an aggregate fair market value on the last trading day of any month of any calendar year of at least $100,000,000 shall file a report on Form 13F (§ 249.325 of this chapter) with the Commission within 45 days after the last day of such calendar year and within 45 days after the last day of each of the first three calendar quarters of the subsequent calendar year. 


(2) An amendment to a Form 13F (§ 249.325 of this chapter) report, other than one reporting only holdings that were not previously reported in a public filing for the same period, must set forth the complete text of the Form 13F. Amendments must be numbered sequentially.


(b) For the purposes of this rule, “investment descretion” has the meaning set forth in section 3(a)(35) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(35)). An institutional investment manager shall also be deemed to exercise “investment discretion” with respect to all accounts over which any person under its control exercises investment discretion.


(c) For purposes of this rule “section 13(f) securities” shall mean equity securities of a class described in section 13(d)(1) of the Act that are admitted to trading on a national securities exchange or quoted on the automated quotation system of a registered securities association. In determining what classes of securities are section 13(f) securities, an institutional investment manager may rely on the most recent list of such securities published by the Commission pursuant to section 13(f)(4) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78m(f)(4)). Only securities of a class on such list shall be counted in determining whether an institutional investment manager must file a report under this rule (§ 240.13f-1(a)) and only those securities shall be reported in such report. Where a person controls the issuer of a class of equity securities which are “section 13(f) securities” as defined in this rule, those securities shall not be deemed to be “section 13(f) securities” with respect to the controlling person, provided that such person does not otherwise exercise investment descretion with respect to accounts with fair market value of at least $100,000,000 within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section.
