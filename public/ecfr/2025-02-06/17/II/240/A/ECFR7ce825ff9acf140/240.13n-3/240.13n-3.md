# ยง 240.13n-3   Registration of successor to registered security-based swap data repository.

(a) In the event that a security-based swap data repository succeeds to and continues the business of a security-based swap data repository registered pursuant to section 13(n) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78m(n)), the registration of the predecessor shall be deemed to remain effective as the registration of the successor if, within 30 days after such succession, the successor files an application for registration on Form SDR (17 CFR 249.1500), and the predecessor files a withdrawal from registration on Form SDR; *provided, however,* that the registration of the predecessor security-based swap data repository shall cease to be effective 90 days after the publication of notice of the filing of the application for registration on Form SDR filed by the successor security-based swap data repository.


(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if a security-based swap data repository succeeds to and continues the business of a registered predecessor security-based swap data repository, and the succession is based solely on a change in the predecessor's date or state of incorporation, form of organization, or composition of a partnership, the successor may, within 30 days after the succession, amend the registration of the predecessor security-based swap data repository on Form SDR (17 CFR 249.1500) to reflect these changes. This amendment shall be deemed an application for registration filed by the predecessor and adopted by the successor.
