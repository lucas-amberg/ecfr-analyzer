# § 240.3a67-5   Definition of “substantial counterparty exposure.”

(a) *General.* For purposes of section 3(a)(67) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(67), and § 240.3a67-1, the term *substantial counterparty exposure that could have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States banking system or financial markets* means a security-based swap position that satisfies either of the following thresholds:


(1) $2 billion in daily average aggregate uncollateralized outward exposure; or


(2) $4 billion in:


(i) Daily average aggregate uncollateralized outward exposure; plus


(ii) Daily average aggregate potential outward exposure.


(b) *Calculation.* For these purposes, daily average *aggregate uncollateralized outward exposure* and daily average *aggregate potential outward exposure* shall be calculated the same way as is prescribed in § 240.3a67-3, except that these amounts shall be calculated by reference to all of the person's security-based swap positions, rather than by reference to a specific major security-based swap category.
