# § 240.17a-10   Report on revenue and expenses.

(a)(1) Every broker or dealer exempted from the filing requirements of paragraph (a) of § 240.17a-5 shall, not later than 17 business days after the close of each calendar year, file the Facing Page, a Statement of Income (Loss) and balance sheet from Part IIA of Form X-17A-5 (§ 249.617 of this chapter) and Schedule I of Form X-17A-5 (§ 249.617 of this chapter) for such calendar year.


(2) Every broker or dealer subject to the filing requirements of paragraph (a) of § 240.17a-5 shall submit Schedule I of Form X-17A-5 (§ 249.617 of this chapter) with its Form X-17A-5 (§ 249.617 of this chapter) for the calendar quarter ending December 31 of each year.


(b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to a member of a national securities exchange or a registered national securities association which maintains records containing the information required by Form X-17A-5 (§ 249.617 of this chapter) as to each of its members, and which transmits to the Commission a copy of the record as to each such member, pursuant to a plan the procedures and provisions of which have been submitted to and declared effective by the Commission. Any such plan filed by a national securities exchange or a registered national securities association may provide that when a member is also a member of one or more national securities exchanges, or of one or more national securities exchanges and a registered national securities association, the information required to be submitted with respect to any such member may be transmitted by only one specified national securities exchange or registered national securities association. For the purpose of this section, a plan filed with the Commission by a national securities exchange or a registered national securities association shall not become effective unless the Commission, having due regard for the public interest, for the protection of investors, and for the fulfillment of the Commission's functions under the provisions of the Act, declares the plan to be effective. Further, the Commission, in declaring any such plan effective, may impose such terms and conditions relating to the provisions of the plan and the period of its effectiveness as may be deemed necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or to carry out the Commission's duties under the Act. 


(c) Individual reports filed by, or on behalf of, brokers, dealers, or members of national securities exchanges pursuant to this section are to be considered nonpublic information, except in cases where the Commission determines that it is in the public interest to direct otherwise. 


(d) In the event any broker or dealer finds that it cannot file the annual report required by paragraph (a) of this section within the time specified without undue hardship, it may file with the Commission's principal office in Washington, DC, prior to the date upon which the report is due, an application for an extension of time to a specified date which shall not be later than 60 days after the close of the calendar year for which the report is to be made. The application shall state the reasons for the requested extension and shall contain an agreement to file the report on or before the specified date.
