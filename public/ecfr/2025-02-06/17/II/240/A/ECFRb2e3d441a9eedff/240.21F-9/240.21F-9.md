# § 240.21F-9   Procedures for submitting original information.

(a) To submit information in a manner that satisfies § 240.21F-2(b) and § 240.21F-2(c) of this chapter you must submit your information to the Commission by any of these methods:


(1) Online, through the Commission's website located at *www.sec.gov*, using the Commission's electronic TCR portal (Tip, Complaint, or Referral);


(2) Mailing or faxing a Form TCR to the SEC Office of the Whistleblower at the mailing address or fax number designated on the SEC's web page for making such submissions; or


(3) By any other such method that the Commission may expressly designate on its website as a mechanism that satisfies §§ 240.21F-2(b) and 240.21F-2(c) of this chapter. For a 30-day period following the Commission's designation of any new forms by placing them on the Commission's website, the Commission shall also continue to accept submissions made using the prior version of the forms.


(b) Further, to be eligible for an award, you must declare under penalty of perjury at the time you submit your information pursuant to paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section that your information is true and correct to the best of your knowledge and belief.


(c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if you are providing your original information to the Commission anonymously, then your attorney must submit your information on your behalf pursuant to the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section. Prior to your attorney's submission, you must provide your attorney with a completed Form TCR that you have signed under penalty of perjury. When your attorney makes her submission on your behalf, your attorney will be required to certify that he or she:


(1) Has verified your identity;


(2) Has reviewed your completed and signed Form TCR for completeness and accuracy and that the information contained therein is true, correct and complete to the best of the attorney's knowledge, information and belief;


(3) Has obtained your non-waivable consent to provide the Commission with your original completed and signed Form TCR in the event that the Commission requests it due to concerns that you may have knowingly and willfully made false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations, or used any false writing or document knowing that the writing or document contains any false fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry; and


(4) Consents to be legally obligated to provide the signed Form TCR within seven (7) calendar days of receiving such request from the Commission.


(d) If you submitted original information in writing to the Commission after July 21, 2010 (the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) but before the effective date of these rules, your submission will be deemed to satisfy the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. If you were an anonymous whistleblower, however, you must provide your attorney with a completed and signed copy of Form TCR  within 60 days of the effective date of these rules, your attorney must retain the signed form in his or her records, and you must provide of copy of the signed form to the Commission staff upon request by Commission staff prior to any payment of an award to you in connection with your submission. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you must follow the procedures and conditions for making a claim for a whistleblower award described in §§ 240.21F-10 and 240.21F-11 of this chapter.




(e) You must follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section within 30 days of when you first provide the Commission with original information that you rely upon as a basis for claiming an award. If you fail to do so, then you will be deemed ineligible for an award in connection with that information (even if you later resubmit that information in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Commission shall waive your noncompliance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section if:


(1) You demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commission that you complied with the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section within 30 days of first obtaining actual or constructive notice about those requirements (or 30 days from the date you retain counsel to represent you in connection with your submission of original information, whichever occurs first); and


(2) The Commission can readily develop an administrative record that unambiguously demonstrates that you would otherwise qualify for an award.
