(a) *Certification.* No registered security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant shall act as a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant unless it has certified electronically on Form SBSE-C (Section 249.1600c of this chapter) that it neither knows, nor in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that any person associated with such security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant who effects or is involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant is subject to a statutory disqualification, as described in Sections 3(a)(39)(A) through (F) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(39)(A)-(F)), unless otherwise specifically provided by rule, regulation or order of the Commission.


(b) To support the certification required by paragraph (a) of this section, the security-based swap dealer's or major security-based swap participant's Chief Compliance Officer, or his or her designee, shall review and sign the questionnaire or application for employment, which the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant is required to obtain pursuant to the relevant recordkeeping rule applicable to such security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, executed by each associated person who is a natural person and who effects or is involved in effecting security based swaps on the security-based swap dealer's or major security-based swap participant's behalf. The questionnaire or application shall serve as a basis for a background check of the associated person to verify that the person is not subject to statutory disqualification.
