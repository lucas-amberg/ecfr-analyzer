# § 240.15Fh-5   Special requirements for security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants acting as counterparties to special entities.

(a)(1) A security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant that offers to enter into or enters into a security-based swap with a special entity, other than a special entity defined in § 240.15Fh-2(d)(3), must have a reasonable basis to believe that the special entity has a qualified independent representative. For these purposes, a qualified independent representative is a representative that:


(i) Has sufficient knowledge to evaluate the transaction and risks;


(ii) Is not subject to a statutory disqualification;


(iii) Undertakes a duty to act in the best interests of the special entity;


(iv) Makes appropriate and timely disclosures to the special entity of material information concerning the security-based swap;


(v) Evaluates, consistent with any guidelines provided by the special entity, the fair pricing and the appropriateness of the security-based swap;


(vi) In the case of a special entity defined in §§ 240.15Fh-2(d)(2) or (5), is a person that is subject to rules of the Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or a self-regulatory organization subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission prohibiting it from engaging in specified activities if certain political contributions have been made, *provided that* this paragraph (a)(1)(vi) shall not apply if the independent representative is an employee of the special entity; and


(vii) Is independent of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant.


(A) A representative of a special entity is independent of a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant if the representative does not have a relationship with the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, whether compensatory or otherwise, that reasonably could affect the independent judgment or decision-making of the representative.


(B) A representative of a special entity will be deemed to be independent of a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant if:


(*1*) The representative is not and, within one year of representing the special entity in connection with the security-based swap, was not an associated person of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant;


(*2*) The representative provides timely disclosures to the special entity of all material conflicts of interest that could reasonably affect the judgment or decision making of the representative with respect to its obligations to the special entity and complies with policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage and mitigate such material conflicts of interest; and


(*3*) The security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant did not refer, recommend, or introduce the representative to the special entity within one year of the representative's representation of the special entity in connection with the security-based swap.


(2) A security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant that offers to enter into or enters into a security-based swap with a special entity as defined in § 240.15Fh-2(d)(3) must have a reasonable basis to believe that the special entity has a representative that is a fiduciary as defined in section 3 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1002).


(b) *Safe harbor.* (1) A security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant shall be deemed to have a reasonable basis to believe that the special entity, other than a special entity defined in § 240.15Fh-2(d)(3), has a representative that satisfies the applicable requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, provided that:


(i) The special entity represents in writing to the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant that it has complied in good faith with written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that it has selected a representative that satisfies the applicable requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and that such policies and procedures provide for ongoing monitoring of the performance of such representative consistent with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and


(ii) The representative represents in writing to the special entity and security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant that the representative:


(A) Has policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that it satisfies the applicable requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section;


(B) Meets the independence test in paragraph (a)(1)(vii) of this section; has the knowledge required under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section; is not subject to a statutory disqualification under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section; undertakes a duty to act in the best interests of the special entity as required under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section; and is subject to the requirements regarding political contributions, as applicable, under paragraph (a)(1)(vi) of this section; and


(C) Is legally obligated to comply with the applicable requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section by agreement, condition of employment, law, rule, regulation, or other enforceable duty.


(2) A security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant shall be deemed to have a reasonable basis to believe that a special entity defined in § 240.15Fh-2(d)(3) of this section has a representative that satisfies the applicable requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, provided that the special entity provides in writing to the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant the representative's name and contact information, and represents in writing that the representative is a fiduciary as defined in section 3 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1002).


(c) Before initiation of a security-based swap with a special entity, a security-based swap dealer shall disclose to the special entity in writing the capacity in which the security-based swap dealer is acting in connection with the security-based swap and, if the security-based swap dealer engages in business with the counterparty in more than one capacity, the security-based swap dealer shall disclose the material differences between such capacities and any other financial transaction or service involving the counterparty.


(d) The requirements of this section shall not apply with respect to a security-based swap if:


(1) The transaction is executed on a registered or exempt security-based swap execution facility or registered national securities exchange; and


(2) The security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant does not know the identity of the counterparty at a reasonably sufficient time prior to execution of the transaction to permit the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant to comply with the obligations of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.
