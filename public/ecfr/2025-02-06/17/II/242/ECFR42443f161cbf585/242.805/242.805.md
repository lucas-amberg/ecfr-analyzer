# § 242.805   Voluntary submission of new products for Commission review and approval.

(a) *Request for approval.* A security-based swap execution facility may request that the Commission approve a new or dormant product prior to listing the product for trading, or if a product was initially submitted under § 242.804, subsequent to listing the product for trading. A submission requesting approval shall:


(1) Be filed electronically with the Commission using the EFFS system;


(2) Include a copy of the submission cover sheet in accordance with the instructions therein;


(3) Include a copy of the rules that set forth the security-based swap's terms and conditions;


(4) Include an explanation and analysis of the product and its compliance with applicable provisions of the Act, including the core principles and the Commission's rules thereunder. This explanation and analysis shall either be accompanied by the documentation relied upon to establish the basis for compliance with the applicable law, or incorporate information contained in such documentation, with appropriate citations to data sources;


(5) Describe any agreements or contracts entered into with other parties that enable the security-based swap execution facility to carry out its responsibilities;


(6) Include, if appropriate, a request for confidential treatment as permitted under § 240.24b-2 of this chapter;


(7) Certify that the security-based swap execution facility posted a notice of its request for Commission approval of the new product and a copy of the submission, concurrent with the filing of a submission with the Commission, on the security-based swap execution facility's website. Information that the security-based swap execution facility seeks to keep confidential may be redacted from the documents published on the security-based swap execution facility's website but must be republished consistent with any determination made pursuant to § 240.24b-2 of this chapter; and


(8) Include, if requested by Commission staff, additional evidence, information, or data demonstrating that the security-based swap meets, initially or on a continuing basis, the requirements of the Act, or other requirement for registration under the Act, or the Commission's rules or policies thereunder. The security-based swap execution facility shall submit the requested information by the open of business on the date that is two business days from the date of request by Commission staff, or at the conclusion of such extended period agreed to by Commission staff after timely receipt of a written request from the security-based swap execution facility.


(b) *Standard for review and approval.* The Commission shall approve a new product unless the terms and conditions of the product violate the Act or the Commission's rules thereunder.


(c) *Forty-five-day review.* A product submitted for Commission approval under this paragraph shall be deemed approved by the Commission 45 days after receipt by the Commission, or at the conclusion of an extended period as provided under paragraph (d) of this section, unless notified otherwise within the applicable period, if:


(1) The submission complies with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; and


(2) The submitting security-based swap execution facility does not amend the terms or conditions of the product or supplement the request for approval, except as requested by the Commission or for correction of typographical errors, renumbering, or other non-substantive revisions, during that period. Any voluntary, substantive amendment by the security-based swap execution facility will be treated as a new submission under this section.


(d) *Extension of time.* The Commission may extend the 45-day review period in paragraph (c) of this section for:


(1) An additional 45 days, if the product raises novel or complex issues that require additional time to analyze, in which case the Commission shall notify the security-based swap execution facility within the initial 45-day review period and shall briefly describe the nature of the specific issue(s) for which additional time for review is required; or


(2) Any extended review period to which the security-based swap execution facility agrees in writing.


(e) *Notice of non-approval.* The Commission, at any time during its review under this section, may notify the security-based swap execution facility that it will not, or is unable to, approve the product. This notification will briefly specify the nature of the issues raised and the specific provision of the Act or the Commission's rules thereunder, including the form or content requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, that the product violates, appears to violate, or potentially violates but which cannot be ascertained from the submission.


(f) *Effect of non-approval.* (1) Notification to a security-based swap execution facility under paragraph (e) of this section of the Commission's determination not to approve a product does not prejudice the security-based swap execution facility from subsequently submitting a revised version of the product for Commission approval, or from submitting the product as initially proposed pursuant to a supplemented submission.


(2) Notification to a security-based swap execution facility under paragraph (e) of this section of the Commission's refusal to approve a product shall be presumptive evidence that the security-based swap execution facility may not truthfully certify under § 242.804 that the same, or substantially the same, product does not violate the Act or the Commission's rules thereunder.
