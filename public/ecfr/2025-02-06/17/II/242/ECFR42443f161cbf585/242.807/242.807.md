# § 242.807   Self-certification of rules.

(a) *Required certification.* A security-based swap execution facility shall comply with the following conditions prior to implementing any rule—other than a rule delisting or withdrawing the certification of a product with no open interest and submitted in compliance with paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (6) of this section—that has not obtained Commission approval under § 242.806, or that remains a dormant rule subsequent to being submitted under this section or approved under § 242.806.


(1) The security-based swap execution facility has filed its submission electronically with the Commission using the EFFS system.


(2) The security-based swap execution facility has provided a certification that it posted a notice of pending certification with the Commission and a copy of the submission, concurrent with the filing of a submission with the Commission, on the security-based swap execution facility's website. Information that the security-based swap execution facility seeks to keep confidential may be redacted from the documents published on the security-based swap execution facility's website, but it must be republished consistent with any determination made pursuant to § 240.24b-2 of this chapter.


(3) The Commission has received the submission not later than the open of business on the business day that is 10 business days prior to the security-based swap execution facility's implementation of the rule or rule amendment.


(4) The Commission has not stayed the submission pursuant to § 242.807(c).


(5) A new rule or rule amendment that establishes standards for responding to an emergency shall be submitted pursuant to § 242.807(a). A rule or rule amendment implemented under procedures of the governing board to respond to an emergency shall, if practicable, be filed with the Commission prior to implementation or, if not practicable, be filed with the Commission at the earliest possible time after implementation, but in no event more than 24 hours after implementation. Any such submission shall be subject to the certification and stay provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.


(6) The rule submission shall include:


(i) A copy of the submission cover sheet in accordance with the instructions therein (in the case of a rule or rule amendment that responds to an emergency, “Emergency Rule Certification” should be noted in the description section of the submission cover sheet);


(ii) The text of the rule (in the case of a rule amendment, deletions and additions must be indicated);


(iii) The date of intended implementation;


(iv) A certification by the security-based swap execution facility that the rule complies with the Act and the Commission's rules thereunder;


(v) A concise explanation and analysis of the operation, purpose, and effect of the proposed rule or rule amendment and its compliance with applicable provisions of the Act, including core principles relating to security-based swap execution facilities and the Commission's rules thereunder;


(vi) A brief explanation of any substantive opposing views expressed to the security-based swap execution facility by governing board or committee members, members of the security-based swap execution facility, or market participants, that were not incorporated into the rule, or a statement that no such opposing views were expressed; and


(vii) As appropriate, a request for confidential treatment pursuant to the procedures provided in § 240.24b-2 of this chapter.


(7) The security-based swap execution facility shall provide, if requested by Commission staff, additional evidence, information, or data that may be beneficial to the Commission in conducting a due diligence assessment of the filing and the security-based swap execution facility's compliance with any of the requirements of the Act or the Commission's rules or policies thereunder.


(b) *Review by the Commission.* The Commission shall have 10 business days to review the new rule or rule amendment before the new rule or rule amendment is deemed certified and can be made effective, unless the Commission notifies the security-based swap execution facility during the 10-business-day review period that it intends to issue a stay of the certification under paragraph (c) of this section.


(c) *Stay*—(1) *Stay of certification of new rule or rule amendment.* The Commission may stay the certification of a new rule or rule amendment submitted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section by issuing a notification informing the security-based swap execution facility that the Commission is staying the certification of the rule or rule amendment on the grounds that the rule or rule amendment presents novel or complex issues that require additional time to analyze, the rule or rule amendment is accompanied by an inadequate explanation, or the rule or rule amendment is potentially inconsistent with the Act or the Commission's rules thereunder. The Commission will have an additional 90 days from the date of the notification to conduct the review.


(2) *Public comment.* The Commission shall provide a 30-day comment period within the 90-day period in which the stay is in effect, as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The Commission shall publish a notice of the 30-day comment period on the Commission website. Comments from the public shall be submitted as specified in that notice.


(3) *Expiration of a stay of certification of new rule or rule amendment.* A new rule or rule amendment subject to a stay pursuant to this paragraph shall become effective, pursuant to the certification, at the expiration of the 90-day review period described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unless the Commission withdraws the stay prior to that time, or the Commission notifies the security-based swap execution facility during the 90-day time period that it objects to the proposed certification on the grounds that the proposed rule or rule amendment is inconsistent with the Act or the Commission's rules thereunder.


(d) *Notification of rule amendments.* Notwithstanding the rule certification requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a security-based swap execution facility may place the following rules or rule amendments into effect without certification to the Commission if the following conditions are met:


(1) The security-based swap execution facility provides to the Commission at least weekly a summary notice of all rule amendments made effective pursuant to this paragraph during the preceding week. Such notice must be labeled “Weekly Notification of Rule Amendments” and need not be filed for weeks during which no such actions have been taken.
