# § 242.815   Methods of execution for Required and Permitted Transactions.

(a) *Execution methods for Required Transactions*—(1) *Required Transaction* means any transaction involving a security-based swap that is subject to the trade execution requirement in section 3C(h) of the Act.


(2) *Execution methods.* (i) Each Required Transaction that is not a block trade shall be executed on a security-based swap execution facility in accordance with one of the following methods of execution, except as provided in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section:


(A) An order book; or


(B) A request-for-quote system that operates in conjunction with an order book.


(ii) In providing either one of the execution methods set forth in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, a security-based swap execution facility may for purposes of execution and communication use any means of interstate commerce, including, but not limited to, the mail, internet, email, and telephone, provided that the chosen execution method satisfies the requirements for order books in § 242.802 of this chapter or in paragraph (a)(3) of this section for request-for-quote systems.


(3) *Request-for-quote system* means a trading system or platform in which a market participant transmits a request for a quote to buy or sell a specific instrument to no less than three market participants in the trading system or platform, to which all such market participants may respond. The three market participants shall not be affiliates of or controlled by the requester and shall not be affiliates of or controlled by each other. A security-based swap execution facility that offers a request-for-quote system in connection with Required Transactions shall provide the following functionality:


(i) At the same time that the requester receives the first responsive bid or offer, the security-based swap execution facility shall communicate to the requester any firm bid or offer pertaining to the same instrument resting on any of the security-based swap execution facility's order books;


(ii) The security-based swap execution facility shall provide the requester with the ability to execute against such firm resting bids or offers along with any responsive orders; and


(iii) The security-based swap execution facility shall ensure that its trading protocols provide each of its market participants with equal priority in receiving requests for quotes and in transmitting and displaying for execution responsive orders.


(b) *Time delay requirement for Required Transactions on an order book*—(1) *Time delay requirement.* With regard to Required Transactions, a security-based swap execution facility shall require that a broker or dealer who seeks to either execute against its customer's order or execute two of its customers' orders against each other through the security-based swap execution facility's order book, following some form of pre-arrangement or pre-negotiation of such orders, be subject to at least a 15-second time delay between the entry of those two orders into the order book, such that one side of the potential transaction is disclosed and made available to other market participants before the second side of the potential transaction, whether for the broker's or dealer's own account or for a second customer, is submitted for execution.


(2) *Adjustment of time delay requirement.* A security-based swap execution facility may adjust the time period of the 15-second time delay requirement described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, based upon a security-based swap's liquidity or other product-specific considerations; however, the time delay shall be set for a sufficient period of time so that an order is exposed to the market and other market participants have a meaningful opportunity to execute against such order.


(c) *Execution methods for Permitted Transactions.* (1) *Permitted Transaction* means any transaction not involving a security-based swap that is subject to the trade execution requirement in section 3C(h) of the Act.


(2) *Execution methods.* A security-based swap execution facility may offer any method of execution for each Permitted Transaction.


(d) *Exceptions to required methods of execution for package transactions.* (1) For purposes of this paragraph, a package transaction consists of two or more component transactions executed between two or more counterparties where:


(i) At least one component transaction is a Required Transaction;


(ii) Execution of each component transaction is contingent upon the execution of all other component transactions; and


(iii) The component transactions are priced or quoted together as one economic transaction with simultaneous or near-simultaneous execution of all components.


(2) A Required Transaction that is executed as a component of a package transaction that includes a component security-based swap that is subject exclusively to the Commission's jurisdiction, but is not subject to the clearing requirement under section 3C of the Act and is not intended to be cleared, may be executed on a security-based swap execution facility in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section as if it were a Permitted Transaction;


(3) A Required Transaction that is executed as a component of a package transaction that includes a component that is not a security-based swap may be executed on a security-based swap execution facility in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section as if it were a Permitted Transaction. This provision shall not apply to:


(i) A Required Transaction that is executed as a component of a package transaction in which all other non-security-based swap components are U.S. Treasury securities;


(ii) A Required Transaction that is executed as a component of a package transaction in which all other non-security-based swap components are contracts for the purchase or sale of a commodity for future delivery;


(iii) A Required Transaction that is executed as a component of a package transaction in which all other non-security-based swap components are agency mortgage-backed securities;


(iv) A Required Transaction that is executed as a component of a package transaction that includes a component transaction that is the issuance of a bond in a primary market; and


(v) A Required Transaction that is executed as a component of a package transaction in which all other non-security-based swap components are swaps that are subject to a trade execution requirement under 17 CFR 37.9.


(4) A Required Transaction that is executed as a component of a package transaction that includes a component security-based swap that is not exclusively subject to the Commission's jurisdiction may be executed on a security-based swap in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section as if it were a Permitted Transaction.


(e) *Resolution of operational and clerical error trades.* (1) A security-based swap execution facility shall maintain rules and procedures that facilitate the resolution of error trades. Such rules shall be fair, transparent, and consistent; allow for timely resolution; require members to provide prompt notice of an error trade—and, as applicable, offsetting and correcting trades—to the security-based swap execution facility; and permit members to:


(i) Execute a correcting trade, in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, regardless of whether it is a Required or Permitted Transaction, for an error trade that has been rejected from clearing as soon as technologically practicable, but no later than one hour after a registered clearing agency provides notice of the rejection; or


(ii) Execute an offsetting trade and a correcting trade, in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, regardless of whether it is a Required or Permitted Transaction, for an error trade that was accepted for clearing as soon as technologically practicable, but no later than three days after the error trade was accepted for clearing at a registered clearing agency.


(2) If a correcting trade is rejected from clearing, then the security-based swap execution facility shall not allow the counterparties to execute another correcting trade.


(f) *Counterparty anonymity.* (1) Except as otherwise required under the Act or the Commission's rules thereunder, a security-based swap execution facility shall not directly or indirectly, including through a third-party service provider, disclose the identity of a counterparty to a security-based swap that is executed anonymously and intended to be cleared.


(2) A security-based swap execution facility shall establish and enforce rules that prohibit any person from directly or indirectly, including through a third-party service provider, disclosing the identity of a counterparty to a security-based swap that is executed anonymously and intended to be cleared.


(3) For purposes of paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section, “executed anonymously” shall include a security-based swap that is pre-arranged or pre-negotiated anonymously, including by a member of the security-based swap execution facility.


(4) For a package transaction that includes a component transaction that is not a security-based swap intended to be cleared, disclosing the identity of a counterparty shall not violate paragraphs (f)(1) or (2) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (f), a “package transaction” consists of two or more component transactions executed between two or more counterparties where:


(i) Execution of each component transaction is contingent upon the execution of all other component transactions; and


(ii) The component transactions are priced or quoted together as one economic transaction with simultaneous or near-simultaneous execution of all components.


(g) *Transactions not accepted for clearing.* A security-based swap execution facility shall establish and enforce rules that provide that a security-based swap that is intended to be cleared at the time of the transaction, but is not accepted for clearing at a registered clearing agency, shall be void *ab initio.*
