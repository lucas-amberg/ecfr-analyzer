# § 242.816   Trade execution requirement and exemptions therefrom.

(a) *General*—(1) *Required submission.* A security-based swap execution facility that makes a security-based swap available to trade in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, shall submit to the Commission its determination with respect to such security-based swap as a rule, pursuant to the procedures under § 242.806 or § 242.807.


(2) *Listing requirement.* A security-based swap execution facility that makes a security-based swap available to trade must demonstrate that it lists or offers that security-based swap for trading on its trading system or platform.


(b) *Factors to consider.* To make a security-based swap available to trade for purposes of section 3C(h) of the Act, a security-based swap execution facility shall consider, as appropriate, the following factors with respect to such security-based swap:


(1) Whether there are ready and willing buyers and sellers;


(2) The frequency or size of transactions;


(3) The trading volume;


(4) The number and types of market participants;


(5) The bid/ask spread; or


(6) The usual number of resting firm or indicative bids and offers.


(c) *Applicability.* Upon a determination that a security-based swap is available to trade on a security-based swap execution facility or national securities exchange, all other security-based swap execution facilities and SBS exchanges shall comply with the requirements of section 3C(h) of the Act in listing or offering such security-based swap for trading.


(d) *Removal.* The Commission may issue a determination that a security-based swap is no longer available to trade upon determining that no security-based swap execution facility or SBS exchange lists such security-based swap for trading.


(e) *Exemptions to trade execution requirement.* (1) A security-based swap transaction that is executed as a component of a package transaction that also includes a component transaction that is the issuance of a bond in a primary market is exempt from the trade execution requirement in section 3C(h) of the Act. For purposes of paragraph (e) of this section, a package transaction consists of two or more component transactions executed between two or more counterparties where:


(i) At least one component transaction is subject to the trade execution requirement in section 3C(h) of the Act;


(ii) Execution of each component transaction is contingent upon the execution of all other component transactions; and


(iii) The component transactions are priced or quoted together as one economic transaction with simultaneous or near-simultaneous execution of all components.


(2) Section 3C(h) of the Act does not apply to a security-based swap transaction that qualifies for an exception under section 3C(g) of the Act, or any exemption from the clearing requirement that is granted by the Commission, for which the associated requirements are met.


(3)(i) Section 3C(h) of the Act does not apply to a security-based swap transaction that is executed between counterparties that qualify as “eligible affiliate counterparties,” as defined below.


(ii) For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), counterparties will be “eligible affiliate counterparties” if:


(A) One counterparty, directly or indirectly, holds a majority ownership interest in the other counterparty, and the counterparty that holds the majority interest in the other counterparty reports its financial statements on a consolidated basis under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or International Financial Reporting Standards, and such consolidated financial statements include the financial results of the majority-owned counterparty; or


(B) A third party, directly or indirectly, holds a majority ownership interest in both counterparties, and the third party reports its financial statements on a consolidated basis under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or International Financial Reporting Standards, and such consolidated financial statements include the financial results of both of the counterparties.


(iii) For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), a counterparty or third party directly or indirectly holds a majority ownership interest if it directly or indirectly holds a majority of the equity securities of an entity, or the right to receive upon dissolution, or the contribution of, a majority of the capital of a partnership.
