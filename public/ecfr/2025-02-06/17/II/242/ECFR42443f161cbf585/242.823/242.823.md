(a) *General.* The security-based swap execution facility shall establish and enforce rules and procedures for ensuring the financial integrity of security-based swaps entered on or through the facilities of the security-based swap execution facility, including the clearance and settlement of security-based swaps pursuant to section 3C(a)(1) of the Act.


(b) *Required clearing.* Transactions executed on or through the security-based swap execution facility that are required to be cleared under section 3C(a)(1) of the Act or are voluntarily cleared by the counterparties shall be cleared through a registered clearing agency or a clearing agency that has obtained an exemption from clearing agency registration to provide central counterparty services for security-based swaps.


(c) *General financial integrity.* A security-based swap execution facility shall provide for the financial integrity of its transactions:


(1) By establishing minimum financial standards for its members, which shall, at a minimum, require that each member qualify as an eligible contract participant;


(2) For transactions cleared by a registered clearing agency:


(i) By ensuring that the security-based swap execution facility has the capacity to route transactions to the registered clearing agency in a manner acceptable to the clearing agency for purposes of clearing; and


(ii) By coordinating with each registered clearing agency to which it submits transactions for clearing, in the development of rules and procedures to facilitate prompt and efficient transaction processing.


(d) *Monitoring for financial soundness.* A security-based swap execution facility shall monitor its members to ensure that they continue to qualify as eligible contract participants.
