# § 242.824   Core Principle 7—Emergency authority.

(a) The security-based swap execution facility shall adopt rules to provide for the exercise of emergency authority, in consultation or cooperation with the Commission, as is necessary and appropriate, including the authority to liquidate or transfer open positions in any security-based swap or to suspend or curtail trading in a security-based swap.


(b) To comply with this core principle, a security-based swap execution facility shall adopt rules that are reasonably designed to:


(1) Allow the security-based swap execution facility to intervene as necessary to maintain markets with fair and orderly trading and to prevent or address manipulation or disruptive trading practices, whether the need for intervention arises exclusively from the security-based swap execution facility's market or as part of a coordinated, cross-market intervention;


(2) Have the flexibility and independence to address market emergencies in an effective and timely manner consistent with the nature of the emergency, as long as all such actions taken by the security-based swap execution facility are made in good faith to protect the integrity of the markets;


(3) Take market actions as may be directed by the Commission, including, in situations where a security-based swap is traded on more than one platform, emergency action to liquidate or transfer open interest as directed, or agreed to, by the Commission or the Commission's staff;


(4) Include procedures and guidelines for decision-making and implementation of emergency intervention that avoid conflicts of interest;


(5) Include alternate lines of communication and approval procedures to address emergencies associated with real-time events; and


(6) Allow the security-based swap execution facility, to address perceived market threats, to impose or modify position limits, impose or modify price limits, impose or modify intraday market restrictions, impose special margin requirements, order the liquidation or transfer of open positions in any contract, order the fixing of a settlement price, extend or shorten the expiration date or the trading hours, suspend or curtail trading in any contract, transfer customer contracts and the margin, or alter any contract's settlement terms or conditions, or, if applicable, provide for the carrying out of such actions through its agreements with its third-party provider of clearing or regulatory services.


(c) A security-based swap execution facility shall promptly notify the Commission of its exercise of emergency authority, explaining its decision-making process, the reasons for using its emergency authority, and how conflicts of interest were minimized, including the extent to which the security-based swap execution facility considered the effect of its emergency action on the underlying markets and on markets that are linked or referenced to the contracts traded on its facility, including similar markets on other trading venues. Information on all regulatory actions carried out pursuant to a security-based swap execution facility's emergency authority shall be included in a timely submission of a certified rule pursuant to § 242.807.
