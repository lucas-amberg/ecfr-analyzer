# ยง 242.605   Disclosure of order execution information.

This section requires market centers, brokers, and dealers to make available standardized, monthly reports of statistical information concerning their order executions. This information is presented in accordance with uniform standards that are based on broad assumptions about order execution and routing practices. The information will provide a starting point to promote visibility and competition on the part of market centers and broker-dealers, particularly on the factors of execution price and speed. The disclosures required by this section do not encompass all of the factors that may be important to investors in evaluating the order routing services of a broker-dealer. In addition, any particular market center, broker, or dealer's statistics will encompass varying types of orders routed by different broker-dealers on behalf of customers with a wide range of objectives. Accordingly, the statistical information required by this section alone does not create a reliable basis to address whether any particular broker-dealer failed to obtain the most favorable terms reasonably available under the circumstances for customer orders.




(a) *Monthly electronic reports by market centers, brokers, and dealers.* (1) Every market center, broker, or dealer shall make available for each calendar month, in accordance with the procedures established pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a report on the covered orders in NMS stocks that it received for execution from any person or that it received for execution in a prior calendar month but which remained open. Any OTC market maker that provides a trading system for only a single dealer to solely buy and sell securities against all other persons entering orders in that system shall produce a separate report pertaining only to covered orders entered in such trading system. Alternative trading systems (as defined in ยง 242.300(a)) shall prepare reports separately from their broker-dealer operators to the extent such entities are required to prepare reports. Each report shall be in electronic form; shall be categorized by security, order type, and order size; and shall include the following columns of information:

(4) In the event there is no effective national market system plan establishing such procedures, market centers, brokers, and dealers shall prepare their reports in a consistent, usable, and machine-readable electronic format, in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and make such reports available for downloading from an internet website that is free and readily accessible to the public.

(7) A broker or dealer that is not a market center shall not be subject to the requirements of this section unless that broker or dealer introduces or carries 100,000 or more customer accounts through which transactions are effected for the purchase or sale of NMS stocks (the โcustomer account thresholdโ for purposes of this paragraph). For purposes of this section, a broker or dealer that utilizes an omnibus clearing arrangement with respect to any of its underlying customer accounts shall be considered to carry such underlying customer accounts when calculating the number of customer accounts that it introduces or carries. Any broker or dealer that meets or exceeds this customer account threshold and is also a market center shall produce separate reports pertaining to each function. A broker or dealer that meets or exceeds the customer account threshold shall be required to produce reports pursuant to this section for at least three calendar months (โReporting Periodโ). The Reporting Period shall begin the first calendar day of the next calendar month after the broker or dealer met or exceeded the customer account threshold, unless it is the first time the broker or dealer has met or exceeded the customer account threshold, in which case the Reporting Period shall begin the first calendar day four calendar months later. If, at any time after a broker or dealer has been required to produce reports pursuant to this section for at least a Reporting Period, a broker or dealer falls below the customer account threshold, the broker or dealer shall not be required to produce a report pursuant to this paragraph (a)(7) for the next calendar month.




(b) *Exemptions.* The Commission may, by order upon application, conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions, from any provision or provisions of this section, if the Commission determines that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of investors.
