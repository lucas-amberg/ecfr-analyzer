(8)(i) A participant in an effective national market system plan shall ensure that a current and complete version of the plan is posted on a plan website or on a website designated by plan participants within two business days after notification by the Commission of effectiveness of the plan.

Each plan participant shall provide a link to the website with the current version of the plan.


(b) *Effectiveness of national market system plans.* (1) The Commission shall publish notice of the filing of any national market system plan, or any proposed amendment to any effective national market system plan (including any amendment initiated by the Commission), together with the terms of substance of the filing or a description of the subjects and issues involved, and shall provide interested persons an opportunity to submit written comments. No national market system plan, or any amendment thereto, shall become effective unless approved by the Commission or otherwise permitted in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.


(i) *Publication of national market system plans.* The Commission shall send the notice of the filing of a national market system plan to the _Federal Register_ for publication thereof under this paragraph (b)(1) within 90 days of the business day on which such plan was filed with the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. If the Commission fails to send the notice to the _Federal Register_ for publication thereof within such 90-day period, then the date of publication shall be deemed to be the last day of such 90-day period.


(ii) *Publication of proposed amendments.* The Commission shall send the notice of the filing of a proposed amendment to the _Federal Register_ for publication thereof under this paragraph (b)(1) within 15 days of the business day on which such proposed amendment was posted on a plan website or a website designated by plan participants pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section after being filed with the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. If the Commission fails to send the notice to the _Federal Register_ for publication thereof within such 15-day period, then the date of publication shall be deemed to be the business day on which such website posting was made.


(iii) A national market system plan or proposed amendment has not been filed with the Commission for purposes of this paragraph (b)(1) if, not later than 7 business days after the business day of receipt by the Commission, the Commission notifies the plan participants that the filing of the national market system plan or proposed amendment does not comply with paragraph (a) of this section or plan filing requirements in other sections of Regulation NMS and part 240, subpart A of this chapter, except that if the Commission determines that the plan or amendment is unusually lengthy and is complex or raises novel regulatory issues, the Commission shall inform the plan participants of such determination not later than 7 business days after the business day of receipt by the Commission and, for purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), the filing of such plan or amendment has not been made with the Commission if, not later than 21 days after the business day of receipt by the Commission, the Commission notifies the plan participants that the filing of such plan or amendment does not comply with paragraph (a) of this section or plan filing requirements in other sections of Regulation NMS and part 240, subpart A of this chapter.


(iv) For purposes of this section, a “business day” is any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, Federal holiday, a day that the Office of Personnel Management has announced that Federal agencies in the Washington, DC area are closed to the public, a day on which the Commission is subject to a Federal government shutdown or a day on which the Commission's Washington, DC office is otherwise not open for regular business; provided further, a filing received by the Commission or a website posting made at or before 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Saving Time, whichever is currently in effect, on a business day, shall be deemed received or made on that business day, and a filing received by the Commission or a website posting made after 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Saving Time, whichever is currently in effect, shall be deemed received or made on the next business day.


(2) The Commission shall approve a national market system plan or proposed amendment to an effective national market system plan, with such changes or subject to such conditions as the Commission may deem necessary or appropriate, if it finds that such plan or amendment is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanisms of, a national market system, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Commission shall disapprove a national market system plan or proposed amendment if it does not make such a finding. Approval or disapproval of a national market system plan, or an amendment to an effective national market system plan (other than an amendment initiated by the Commission), shall be by order. Promulgation of an amendment to an effective national market system plan initiated by the Commission shall be by rule.


(i) Within 90 days of the date of publication of notice of the filing of a national market system plan or proposed amendment, or within such longer period as to which the plan participants consent, the Commission shall, by order, approve or disapprove the plan or amendment, or institute proceedings to determine whether the plan or amendment should be disapproved. Proceedings to determine whether the plan or amendment should be disapproved will be conducted pursuant to 17 CFR 201.700 and 201.701. Such proceedings shall include notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration and opportunity for hearing and shall be concluded within 180 days of the date of publication of notice of the plan or amendment. At the conclusion of such proceedings the Commission shall, by order, approve or disapprove the plan or amendment. The time for conclusion of such proceedings may be extended for up to 60 days (up to 240 days from the date of notice publication) if the Commission determines that a longer period is appropriate and publishes the reasons for such determination or the plan participants consent to the longer period.


(ii) The time for conclusion of proceedings to determine whether a national market system plan or proposed amendment should be disapproved may be extended for an additional period up to 60 days beyond the period set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section (up to 300 days from the date of notice publication) if the Commission determines that a longer period is appropriate and publishes the reasons for such determination or the plan participants consent to the longer period.


(3) A proposed amendment may be put into effect upon filing with the Commission if designated by the sponsors as:


(i) [Reserved]


(ii) Concerned solely with the administration of the plan, or involving the governing or constituent documents relating to any person (other than a self-regulatory organization) authorized to implement or administer such plan on behalf of its sponsors; or


(iii) Involving solely technical or ministerial matters. At any time within 60 days of the filing of any such amendment, the Commission may summarily abrogate the amendment and require that such amendment be refiled in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section and reviewed in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanisms of, a national market system or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a proposed amendment may be put into effect summarily upon publication of notice of such amendment, on a temporary basis not to exceed 120 days, if the Commission finds that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors or the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanisms of, a national market system or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


(5) Any plan (or amendment thereto) in connection with:


(i) The planning, development, operation, or regulation of a national market system (or a subsystem thereof) or one or more facilities thereof; or


(ii) The development and implementation of procedures and/or facilities designed to achieve compliance by self-regulatory organizations and/or their members of any section of this Regulation NMS (§§ 242.600 through 242.612) and part 240, subpart A of this chapter promulgated pursuant to section 11A of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78k-1), approved by the Commission pursuant to section 11A of the Act (or pursuant to any rule or regulation thereunder) prior to the effective date of this section (either temporarily or permanently) shall be deemed to have been filed and approved pursuant to this section and no additional filing need be made by the sponsors with respect to such plan or amendment; *provided, however,* that all terms and conditions associated with any such approval (including time limitations) shall continue to be applicable; *provided, further,* that any amendment to such plan filed with or approved by the Commission on or after the effective date of this section shall be subject to the provisions of, and considered in accordance with the procedures specified in, this section.


(c) *Compliance with terms of national market system plans.* Each self-regulatory organization shall comply with the terms of any effective national market system plan of which it is a sponsor or a participant. Each self-regulatory organization also shall, absent reasonable justification or excuse, enforce compliance with any such plan by its members and persons associated with its members.


(d) *Appeals.* The Commission may, in its discretion, entertain appeals in connection with the implementation or operation of any effective national market system plan as follows:


(1) Any action taken or failure to act by any person in connection with an effective national market system plan (other than a prohibition or limitation of access reviewable by the Commission pursuant to section 11A(b)(5) or section 19(d) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78k-1(b)(5) or 78s(d))) shall be subject to review by the Commission, on its own motion or upon application by any person aggrieved thereby (including, but not limited to, self-regulatory organizations, brokers, dealers, issuers, and vendors), filed not later than 30 days after notice of such action or failure to act or within such longer period as the Commission may determine.


(2) Application to the Commission for review, or the institution of review by the Commission on its own motion, shall not operate as a stay of any such action unless the Commission determines otherwise, after notice and opportunity for hearing on the question of a stay (which hearing may consist only of affidavits or oral arguments).


(3) In any proceedings for review, if the Commission, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing (which hearing may consist solely of consideration of the record of any proceedings conducted in connection with such action or failure to act and an opportunity for the presentation of reasons supporting or opposing such action or failure to act) and upon consideration of such other data, views, and arguments as it deems relevant, finds that the action or failure to act is in accordance with the applicable provisions of such plan and that the applicable provisions are, and were, applied in a manner consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, and the removal of impediments to, and the perfection of the mechanisms of a national market system, the Commission, by order, shall dismiss the proceeding. If the Commission does not make any such finding, or if it finds that such action or failure to act imposes any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, the Commission, by order, shall set aside such action and/or require such action with respect to the matter reviewed as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, or to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanisms of, a national market system.


(e) *Exemptions.* The Commission may exempt from the provisions of this section, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, any self-regulatory organization, member thereof, or specified security, if the Commission determines that such exemption is consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, the maintenance of fair and orderly markets and the removal of impediments to, and perfection of the mechanisms of, a national market system.
