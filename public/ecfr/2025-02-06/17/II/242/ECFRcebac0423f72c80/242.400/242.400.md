(A) Is a member of a national securities exchange or national securities association registered pursuant to section 15A(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-3(a)); and 


(B) Is registered with such exchange or such association as a security futures dealer pursuant to rules that are effective in accordance with section 19(b)(2) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)) and, as applicable, section 5c(c) of the CEA (7 U.S.C. 7a-2(c)), that: 


(*1*) Require such member to be registered as a floor trader or a floor broker with the CFTC under Section 4f(a)(1) of the CEA (7 U.S.C. 6f(a)(1)), or as a dealer with the Commission under section 15(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o(b)); 


(*2*) Require such member to maintain records sufficient to prove compliance with this paragraph (c)(2)(v) and the rules of the exchange or association of which it is a member; 


(*3*) Require such member to hold itself out as being willing to buy and sell security futures for its own account on a regular or continuous basis; and 


(*4*) Provide for disciplinary action, including revocation of such member's registration as a security futures dealer, for such member's failure to comply with this Regulation (§§ 242.400 through 242.406) or the rules of the exchange or association. 


(d) *Exemption.* The Commission may exempt, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, financial relations involving any security futures intermediary, customer, position, or transaction, or any class of security futures intermediaries, customers, positions, or transactions, from one or more requirements of this Regulation (§§ 242.400 through 242.406), if the Commission determines that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors. An exemption granted pursuant to this paragraph shall not operate as an exemption from any CFTC rules. Any exemption that may be required from such rules must be obtained separately from the CFTC.
