# § 248.30   Procedures to safeguard customer information, including response programs for unauthorized access to customer information and customer notice; disposal of customer information and consumer information.

(a) *Policies and procedures to safeguard customer information*—(1) *General requirements.* Every covered institution must develop, implement, and maintain written policies and procedures that address administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the protection of customer information.


(2) *Objectives.* These written policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to:


(i) Ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information;


(ii) Protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of customer information; and


(iii) Protect against unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.


(3) *Response programs for unauthorized access to or use of customer information.* Written policies and procedures in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must include a program reasonably designed to detect, respond to, and recover from unauthorized access to or use of customer information, including customer notification procedures. This response program must include procedures for the covered institution to:


(i) Assess the nature and scope of any incident involving unauthorized access to or use of customer information and identify the customer information systems and types of customer information that may have been accessed or used without authorization;


(ii) Take appropriate steps to contain and control the incident to prevent further unauthorized access to or use of customer information; and


(iii) Notify each affected individual whose sensitive customer information was, or is reasonably likely to have been, accessed or used without authorization in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section unless the covered institution determines, after a reasonable investigation of the facts and circumstances of the incident of unauthorized access to or use of sensitive customer information, that the sensitive customer information has not been, and is not reasonably likely to be, used in a manner that would result in substantial harm or inconvenience.


(4) *Notifying affected individuals of unauthorized access or use*—(i) *Notification obligation.* Unless a covered institution has determined, after a reasonable investigation of the facts and circumstances of the incident of unauthorized access to or use of sensitive customer information that occurred at the covered institution or one of its service providers that is not itself a covered institution, that sensitive customer information has not been, and is not reasonably likely to be, used in a manner that would result in substantial harm or inconvenience, the covered institution must provide a clear and conspicuous notice, or ensure that such notice is provided, to each affected individual whose sensitive customer information was, or is reasonably likely to have been, accessed or used without authorization. The notice must be transmitted by a means designed to ensure that each affected individual can reasonably be expected to receive actual notice in writing.


(ii) *Affected individuals.* If an incident of unauthorized access to or use of customer information has occurred or is reasonably likely to have occurred, but the covered institution is unable to identify which specific individuals' sensitive customer information has been accessed or used without authorization, the covered institution must provide notice to all individuals whose sensitive customer information resides in the customer information system that was, or was reasonably likely to have been, accessed or used without authorization. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the covered institution reasonably determines that a specific individual's sensitive customer information that resides in the customer information system was not accessed or used without authorization, the covered institution is not required to provide notice to that individual under this paragraph.


(iii) *Timing.* A covered institution must provide the notice as soon as practicable, but not later than 30 days, after becoming aware that unauthorized access to or use of customer information has occurred or is reasonably likely to have occurred unless the United States Attorney General determines that the notice required under this rule poses a substantial risk to national security or public safety, and notifies the Commission of such determination in writing, in which case the covered institution may delay providing such notice for a time period specified by the Attorney General, up to 30 days following the date when such notice was otherwise required to be provided. The notice may be delayed for an additional period of up to 30 days if the Attorney General determines that the notice continues to pose a substantial risk to national security or public safety and notifies the Commission of such determination in writing. In extraordinary circumstances, notice required under this section may be delayed for a final additional period of up to 60 days if the Attorney General determines that such notice continues to pose a substantial risk to national security and notifies the Commission of such determination in writing. Beyond the final 60-day delay under this paragraph (a)(4)(iii), if the Attorney General indicates that further delay is necessary, the Commission will consider additional requests for delay and may grant such delay through Commission exemptive order or other action.


(iv) *Notice contents.* The notice must:


(A) Describe in general terms the incident and the type of sensitive customer information that was or is reasonably believed to have been accessed or used without authorization;


(B) Include, if the information is reasonably possible to determine at the time the notice is provided, any of the following: the date of the incident, the estimated date of the incident, or the date range within which the incident occurred;


(C) Include contact information sufficient to permit an affected individual to contact the covered institution to inquire about the incident, including the following: a telephone number (which should be a toll-free number if available), an email address or equivalent method or means, a postal address, and the name of a specific office to contact for further information and assistance;


(D) If the individual has an account with the covered institution, recommend that the customer review account statements and immediately report any suspicious activity to the covered institution;


(E) Explain what a fraud alert is and how an individual may place a fraud alert in the individual's credit reports to put the individual's creditors on notice that the individual may be a victim of fraud, including identity theft;


(F) Recommend that the individual periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting company and that the individual have information relating to fraudulent transactions deleted;


(G) Explain how the individual may obtain a credit report free of charge; and


(H) Include information about the availability of online guidance from the Federal Trade Commission and *usa.gov* regarding steps an individual can take to protect against identity theft, a statement encouraging the individual to report any incidents of identity theft to the Federal Trade Commission, and include the Federal Trade Commission's website address where individuals may obtain government information about identity theft and report suspected incidents of identity theft.


(5) *Service providers.* (i) A covered institution's response program prepared in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section must include the establishment, maintenance, and enforcement of written policies and procedures reasonably designed to require oversight, including through due diligence and monitoring, of service providers, including to ensure that the covered institution notifies affected individuals as set forth in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. The policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to ensure service providers take appropriate measures to:


(A) Protect against unauthorized access to or use of customer information; and


(B) Provide notification to the covered institution as soon as possible, but no later than 72 hours after becoming aware that a breach in security has occurred resulting in unauthorized access to a customer information system maintained by the service provider. Upon receipt of such notification, the covered institution must initiate its incident response program adopted pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section.


(ii) As part of its incident response program, a covered institution may enter into a written agreement with its service provider to notify affected individuals on the covered institution's behalf in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section.


(iii) Notwithstanding a covered institution's use of a service provider in accordance with paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section, the obligation to ensure that affected individuals are notified in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section rests with the covered institution.


(b) *Disposal of consumer information and customer information*—(1) *Standard.* Every covered institution, other than notice-registered broker-dealers, must properly dispose of consumer information and customer information by taking reasonable measures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of the information in connection with its disposal.


(2) *Written policies, procedures, and records.* Every covered institution, other than notice-registered broker-dealers, must adopt and implement written policies and procedures that address the proper disposal of consumer information and customer information according to the standard identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(3) *Relation to other laws.* Nothing in this paragraph (b) shall be construed:

(ii) To alter or affect any requirement imposed under any other provision of law to maintain or destroy records.
