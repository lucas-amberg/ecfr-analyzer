(ii) Non-financial companies; and 


(iii) Others. 


(4) *Disclosures under exception for service providers and joint marketers.* If you disclose nonpublic personal information under the exception in § 248.13 to a nonaffiliated third party to market products or services that you offer alone or jointly with another financial institution, you satisfy the disclosure requirement of paragraph (a)(5) of this section if you:

(i) Be clear and conspicuous; 


(ii) State that your privacy notice is available upon request; and


(iii) Explain a reasonable means by which the consumer may obtain the privacy notice.
