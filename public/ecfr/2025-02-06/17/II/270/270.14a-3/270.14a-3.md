(ii) Liquidate the eligible trust securities held by the Trust and distribute the proceeds thereof to the unitholders of the Trust; 


(3) The sponsor instructs the trustee when the eligible trust securities are deposited in the Trust that, in the event that redemptions by the sponsor or any underwriter of units constituting a part of the unsold units results in the Trust having a net worth of less than 40 percent of the principal amount of the eligible trust securities (or delivery statements relating to contracts for the purchase of any such securities which, together with cash or an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a bank in the amount required for their purchase, are held by the Trust for purchase of the securities) initially deposited in the Trust—


(i) The trustee shall terminate the Trust and distribute the assets thereof to the unitholders of the Trust, and
