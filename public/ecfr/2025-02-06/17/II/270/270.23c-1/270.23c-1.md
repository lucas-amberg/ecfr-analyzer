(a) A registered closed-end company may purchase for cash a security of which it is the issuer, subject to the following conditions: 


(1) If the security is a stock entitled to cumulative dividends, such dividends are not in arrears. 


(2) If the security is a stock not entitled to cumulative dividends, at least 90 percent of the net income of the issuer for the last preceding fiscal year, determined in accordance with good accounting practice and not including profits or losses realized from the sale of securities or other properties, was distributed to its shareholders during such fiscal year or within 60 days after the close of such fiscal year.

(4) The seller of the security is not to the knowledge of the issuer an affiliated person of the issuer. 


(5) Payment of the purchase price is accompanied or preceded by a written confirmation of the purchase. 


(6) The purchase is made at a price not above the market value, if any, or the asset value of such security, whichever is lower, at the time of such purchase. 


(7) The issuer discloses to the seller or, if the seller is acting through a broker, to the seller's broker, either prior to or at the time of purchase the approximate or estimated asset coverage per unit of the security to be purchased.

(9) The purchase is not made in a manner or on a basis which discriminates unfairly against any holders of the class of securities purchased. 


(10) If the security is a stock, the issuer has, within the preceding six months, informed stockholders of its intention to purchase stock of such class by letter or report addressed to all the stockholders of such class. 


(11) The issuer files with the Commission, as an exhibit to Form N-CSR (ยง 249.331 and ยง 274.128), a copy of any written solicitation to purchase securities under this section sent or given during the period covered by the report by or on behalf of the issuer to 10 or more persons.
