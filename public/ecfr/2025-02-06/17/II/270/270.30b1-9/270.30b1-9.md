# § 270.30b1-9   Monthly report.

Each registered management investment company or exchange-traded fund organized as a unit investment trust, or series thereof, other than a registered open-end management investment company that is regulated as a money market fund under § 270.2a-7 or a small business investment company registered on Form N-5 (§§ 239.24 and 274.5 of this chapter), must file a monthly report of portfolio holdings on Form N-PORT (§ 274.150 of this chapter), current as of the last business day, or last calendar day, of the month. A registered investment company that has filed a registration statement with the Commission registering its securities for the first time under the Securities Act of 1933 is relieved of this reporting obligation with respect to any reporting period or portion thereof prior to the date on which that registration statement becomes effective or is withdrawn. Each registered investment company that is required to file reports on Form N-PORT must maintain in its records the information that is required to be included on Form N-PORT no later than 30 days after the end of each month. Such information shall be treated as a record under section 31(a)(1) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-30(a)(1)] and § 270.31a-1(b) of this chapter subject to the requirements of § 270.31a-2(a)(2) of this chapter. Reports on Form N-PORT for each month in each fiscal quarter of a registered investment company must be filed with the Commission no later than 60 days after the end of such fiscal quarter.
