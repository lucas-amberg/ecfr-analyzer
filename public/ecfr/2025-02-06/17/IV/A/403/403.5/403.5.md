(b) A financial institution shall not be in violation of the possession or control requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section if, solely as the result of normal business operations, temporary lags occur between the time when a security is first required to be in the financial institution's possession or control and the time when it is actually placed in possession or control, provided that the financial institution takes timely steps in good faith to establish prompt possession or control. In the event that a financial institution has accepted funds from a customer for the purchase of securities and the financial institution does not initiate the purchase of the specified securities by the close of the next business day after receipt of such customer's funds, the financial institution shall immediately deposit or redeposit the funds in an account belonging to such customer and send the customer notice of such deposit or redeposit.

(i) Promptly obtain the release of any lien, charge, or other encumbrance against such securities; 


(ii) Promptly obtain the return of any securities loaned; 


(iii) Take prompt steps to obtain possession or control of securities failed to receive for more than 30 calendar days, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities, for more than 60 calendar days; or

(3) Nothing stated in this section shall be construed as affecting the absolute right of a customer of a government securities broker or dealer, unless otherwise agreed in writing, in the normal course of business operations following demand made on the broker or dealer, to receive the physical delivery of certificates if the securities are issued in certificated form, or to direct a transfer of or otherwise to exercise control over any securities if they are:

(i) Obtain the repurchase agreement in writing; 


(ii) Confirm in writing the specific securities that are the subject of a repurchase transaction pursuant to such agreement at the end of the day of initiation of the transaction and at the end of any other day during which other securities are substituted if the substitution results in a change to issuer, maturity date, par amount or coupon rate specified in the previous confirmation;

(2)(i) A confirmation issued in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section shall specify the issuer, maturity date, coupon rate, par amount and market value of the security and shall further identify a CUSIP or mortgage-backed security pool number, as appropriate, except that a CUSIP or a pool number is not required on the confirmation if it is identified in internal records of the broker or dealer that designate the specific security of the counterparty. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), the market value of any security that is the subject of the repurchase transaction shall be the most recently available bid price plus accrued interest, obtained by any reasonable and consistent methodology.
