# § 2.67   Calculation of taxes for property of pipeline companies constructed or acquired after January 1, 1970.

Pursuant to the provisions of section 441(a)(4)(A) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, 83 Stat. 487, 625, natural gas pipeline companies which have exercised the option provided by that section to change from flow through accounting will be permitted by the Commission, with respect to liberalized depreciation, to employ a normalization method for computing Federal income taxes in their accounts and annual reports with respect to property constructed or acquired after January 1, 1970, to the extent to which such property increases the productive or operational capacity of the utility and is not a replacement of existing capacity. Such normalization will also be permitted for ratemaking purposes. As to balances in Account No. 282 of the Uniform System of Accounts, “Accumulated deferred income taxes—Other property,” it will remain the Commission's policy to deduct such balances from the rate base of natural gas pipeline companies in rate proceedings.
