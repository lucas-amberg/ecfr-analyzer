# § 2.12   Calculation of taxes for property of public utilities and licensees constructed or acquired after January 1, 1970.

Pursuant to the provisions of section 441(a)(4)(A) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, 83 Stat. 487, 625, public utilities and licensees regulated by the Commission under the Federal Power Act which have exercised the option provided by that section to change from flow through accounting will be permitted by the Commission, with respect to liberalized depreciation, to employ a normalization method for computing federal income taxes in their accounts and annual reports with respect to property constructed or acquired after January 1, 1970, to the extent with which such property increases the productive or operational capacity of the utility and is not a replacement of existing capacity. Such normalization will also be permitted for ratemaking purposes to the extent such rates are subject to the Commission's ratemaking authority. As to balances in Account 282 of the Uniform System of Accounts, “Accumulated deferred income taxes—Other property,” it will remain the Commission's policy to deduct such balances from rate base in rate proceedings.
