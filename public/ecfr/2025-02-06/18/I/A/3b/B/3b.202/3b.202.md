# ยง 3b.202   Collection of information from individuals concerned.

(a) Any information collected by the Commission for inclusion in a system of records which may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs, will, to the greatest extent practicable, be collected directly from the subject individual (see paragraph (d) of this section). 


(b) The Commission will inform each individual whom it asks to supply information about himself, on the form which it uses to collect the information, or on a separate sheet that can be easily retained by the individual, in language which is explicit, informative, and easily understood, and not so lengthy as to deter an individual from reading it, of: 


(1) The specific provision of the statute or executive order of the President, including the brief title or subject of that statute or order which authorizes the solicitation of the information; whether disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary; and whether the Commission is authorized or required to impose penalties for failing to respond; 


(2) The principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used; 


(3) The routine uses which may be made of the information, as described in the _Federal Register_ in the notice of the system of records in which the information is maintained, and which are relatable and necessary to a purpose described pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and 


(4) The effects (beneficial and adverse) on the individual if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information. 


(c) Social security numbers will not be required from individuals whom the Commission asks to supply information unless the disclosure of the number is required by Federal statute or unless disclosure is to the Commission maintaining a system of records in existence and operating before January 1, 1975, if such disclosure was required pursuant to a statute or regulation adopted prior to such date to verify the identity of an individual. When an individual is requested to disclose his social security number to the Commission, he will be informed under what statutory or other authority such number is solicited, what uses will be made of it, whether disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, and if it is mandatory, under what provisions of law or regulation. 


(d) The use of third-party sources to collect information about an individual may be appropriate in certain circumstances. In determining when the use of third-party sources would be appropriate, the following considerations will govern: 


(1) When the information needed can only be obtained from a third party; 


(2) When the cost of collecting the information directly from the individual concerned far exceeds the cost of collecting it from a third party; 


(3) When there is little risk that the information proposed to be collected from the third party, if inaccurate, could result in an adverse determination about the individual concerned. 


(4) When there is a need to insure the accuracy of information supplied by an individual by verifying it with a third party, or there is a need to obtain a qualitative assessment of the individual's capabilities or character; or 


(5) When there are provisions for verifying any third-party information with the individual concerned before making a determination based on that information.
