# ยง 11.14   Procedures for establishing charges without an energy gains investigation.

(a) *Settlements.* (1) Owners of downstream and headwater projects subject to this subpart may negotiate a settlement for headwater benefits charges. Settlements must be filed with the Commission for its approval, according to the provisions of ยง 385.602. 


(2) If the headwater project is a Federal project, any settlement under this section must result in headwater benefits payments that approximate those that would result under the energy gains method. 


(b) *Continuation of previous headwater benefits determinations.* (1) For any downstream project being assessed headwater benefit charges on or before September 16, 1986, the Commission will continue to assess charges to that project on the same basis until changes occur in the river basin, including hydrology or project development, that affect headwater benefits. 


(2) Any procedures that apply to ยง 11.17(b)(5) of this subpart will apply to any prospectively fixed charges that are continued under this paragraph.
