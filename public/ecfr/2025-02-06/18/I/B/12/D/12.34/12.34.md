(a) The licensee must obtain written approval of the independent consultant team, and the facilitator(s) for a potential failure mode analysis or risk analysis, from the Director of the Division of Dam Safety and Inspections, prior to the performance of a periodic inspection or comprehensive assessment under this subpart D.


(b) At least 180 days prior to performing a periodic inspection or comprehensive assessment under this subpart D, the licensee must submit to the Director of the Division of Dam Safety and Inspections, with a copy to the Regional Engineer, a detailed part 12D inspection plan that includes an independent consultant team proposal that describes the technical disciplines and level of expertise required to perform the inspection.


(1) If the independent consultant team comprises one person, the detailed independent consultant team proposal must:


(i) Describe the experience of the independent consultant; and


(ii) Show that the independent consultant meets the requirements as defined in §§ 12.31(a) and 12.31(b)(3).


(2) If the independent consultant team comprises more than one person, the detailed independent consultant team proposal must:
