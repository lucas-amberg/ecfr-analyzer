# ยง 12.39   Evaluation of spillway adequacy.

The adequacy of any spillway must be evaluated, as part of a comprehensive assessment or as otherwise requested by the Regional Engineer, by considering hazard potential which would result from failure of the project works during normal and flood flows.


(a) If failure would present a hazard to human life or cause significant property damage, the independent consultant team must evaluate the following for floods up to and including the probable maximum flood:


(1) The ability of project works to withstand the loading or overtopping which may occur during floods;


(2) The capacity of spillways to prevent the reservoir from rising to an elevation that would endanger the project works; and


(3) The potential for misoperation of; failure to operate; blockage of; or debilitating damage to a spillway and its appurtenances (including but not limited to structural, mechanical, and electrical components of gates, valves, chutes, and training walls); and the effect thereof on the maximum reservoir level and potential for surcharged loading or overtopping to occur during floods.


(b) If failure would not present a hazard to human life or cause significant property damage, spillway adequacy may be evaluated by means of a design flood of lesser magnitude than the probable maximum flood provided that the most recent comprehensive assessment report required by ยง 12.38 provides a detailed explanation of and rationale for the finding that structural failure would not present a hazard to human life or cause significant property damage.
