(ii) Coordinate the operation of the project with any upstream or downstream water resource projects; and 


(iii) Coordinate the operation of the project with the applicant's or other electrical systems to minimize the cost of production. 


(2) A discussion of the need of the applicant over the short and long term for the electricity generated by the project, including: 


(i) The reasonable costs and reasonable availability of alternative sources of power that would be needed by the applicant or its customers, including wholesale customers, if the applicant is not granted a license for the project; 


(ii) A discussion of the increase in fuel, capital, and any other costs that would be incurred by the applicant or its customers to purchase or generate power necessary to replace the output of the licensed project, if the applicant is not granted a license for the project;

(A) The applicant's customers, including wholesale customers; 


(B) The applicant's operating and load characteristics; and 


(C) The communities served or to be served, including any reallocation of costs associated with the transfer of a license from the existing licensee. 


(3) The following data showing need and the reasonable cost and availability of alternative sources of power: 


(i) The average annual cost of the power produced by the project, including the basis for that calculation; 


(ii) The projected resources required by the applicant to meet the applicant's capacity and energy requirements over the short and long term including: 


(A) Energy and capacity resources, including the contributions from the applicant's generation, purchases, and load modification measures (such as conservation, if considered as a resource), as separate components of the total resources required; 


(B) A resource analysis, including a statement of system reserve margins to be maintained for energy and capacity; and 


(C) If load management measures are not viewed as resources, the effects of such measures on the projected capacity and energy requirements indicated separately; 


(iii) For alternative sources of power, including generation of additional power at existing facilities, restarting deactivated units, the purchase of power off-system, the construction or purchase and operation of a new power plant, and load management measures such as conservation: 


(A) The total annual cost of each alternative source of power to replace project power; 


(B) The basis for the determination of projected annual cost; and 


(C) A discussion of the relative merits of each alternative, including the issues of the period of availability and dependability of purchased power, average life of alternatives, relative equivalent availability of generating alternatives, and relative impacts on the applicant's power system reliability and other system operating characteristics; and 


(iv) The effect on the direct providers (and their immediate customers) of alternate sources of power. 


(4) If an applicant uses power for its own industrial facility and related operations, the effect of obtaining or losing electricity from the project on the operation and efficiency of such facility or related operations, its workers, and the related community. 


(5) If an applicant is an Indian tribe applying for a license for a project located on the tribal reservation, a statement of the need of such tribe for electricity generated by the project to foster the purposes of the reservation. 


(6) A comparison of the impact on the operations and planning of the applicant's transmission system of receiving or not receiving the project license, including: 


(i) An analysis of the effects of any resulting redistribution of power flows on line loading (with respect to applicable thermal, voltage, or stability limits), line losses, and necessary new construction of transmission facilities or upgrading of existing facilities, together with the cost impact of these effects; 


(ii) An analysis of the advantages that the applicant's transmission system would provide in the distribution of the project's power; and 


(iii) Detailed single-line diagrams, including existing system facilities identified by name and circuit number, that show system transmission elements in relation to the project and other principal interconnected system elements. Power flow and loss data that represent system operating conditions may be appended if applicants believe such data would be useful to show that the operating impacts described would be beneficial. 


(7) If the applicant has plans to modify existing project facilities or operations, a statement of the need for, or usefulness of, the modifications, including at least a reconnaissance-level study of the effect and projected costs of the proposed plans and any alternate plans, which in conjunction with other developments in the area would conform with a comprehensive plan for improving or developing the waterway and for other beneficial public uses as defined in section 10(a)(1) of the Federal Power Act. 


(8) If the applicant has no plans to modify existing project facilities or operations, at least a reconnaissance-level study to show that the project facilities or operations in conjunction with other developments in the area would conform with a comprehensive plan for improving or developing the waterway and for other beneficial public uses as defined in section 10(a)(1) of the Federal Power Act. 


(9) A statement describing the applicant's financial and personnel resources to meet its obligations under a new license, including specific information to demonstrate that the applicant's personnel are adequate in number and training to operate and maintain the project in accordance with the provisions of the license.

(i) A statement of the applicant's record of encouraging or assisting its customers to conserve electricity and a description of its plans and capabilities for promoting electricity conservation by its customers; and 


(ii) A statement describing the compliance of the applicant's energy conservation programs with any applicable regulatory requirements. 


(12) The names and mailing addresses of every Indian tribe with land on which any part of the proposed project would be located or which the applicant reasonably believes would otherwise be affected by the proposed project.
