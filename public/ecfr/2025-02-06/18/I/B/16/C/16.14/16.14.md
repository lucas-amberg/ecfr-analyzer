(2) Be filed in accordance with the formal requirements for filings in subpart T of part 385 of the Commission's regulations and be served on each relevant Federal and state resource agency, all applicants for new license, nonpower license or exemption, and any other party to the proceeding; 


(3) Specify the project works that would be taken over by the United States; 


(4) Describe the proposed Federal operation of the project, including any plans for its redevelopment, and discuss the manner in which takeover would serve the public interest as fully as non-Federal development and operation; 


(5) State whether the agency intends to undertake the operation of the project; and 


(6) Include the information required by §§ 4.41, 4.51, or 4.61 of this chapter, as appropriate.

(c) An applicant or potential applicant for a new license, a nonpower license, or an exemption that involves a takeover recommendation may file a reply to the recommendation, within 120 days from the date the takeover recommendation is filed with the Commission. The reply must be filed with the Commission in accordance with part 385 of the Commission's regulations and a copy of such a reply must be served on the agency recommending the takeover and on any other party to the proceeding.
