(i) For each separately identified function and subfunction of production plant or transmission plant, the utility shall state the original cost as of the beginning of the first month and the end of each month of both Period I and Period II, with an average of the thirteen balances for each period. If any of the Period I or Period II thirteen monthly balances is not available or is unrepresentative of the current plan of the utility for plant in service, the utility shall provide an explanation of the relevant circumstances. 


(ii) For each separately identified function and subfunction of plant other than production or transmission, the utility shall state the original cost as of the beginning and the end of both Period I and Period II, with an average of the beginning and end balances for each period. If any of the Period I or Period II balances is not available or is unrepresentative of the current plan of the utility for plant in service, the utility shall provide an explanation of the relevant circumstances. 


(iii) The utility shall show the electric plant in service in accordance with each of the following five major functional classifications: 


(A) Production; 


(B) Transmission; 


(C) Distribution; 


(D) General and Intangible; and 


(E) Common and Other. 


(iv) To the extent feasible, the utility shall show completed construction not classified in accordance with clause (iii) in accordance with tentative classification to major functional accounts. If this is not feasible, the utility shall describe such facilities as other plant under clause (iii)(E). 


(v) If a utility designs its rate change so that subdivision of the major functional classifications is necessary to support the changed rate, the utility shall supply the original cost information for any of the five major functional plant classifications in clause (iii) that are divided into subfunctional categories. If subfunctional original cost information is provided, the utility shall explain the importance of providing such information to support the changed rate. The utility shall describe each subfunctional category in substantive terms, such as *steam electric production* or *high voltage transmission.*

(vi) The utility shall select any subfunctional categories, as appropriate, under the following criteria:
