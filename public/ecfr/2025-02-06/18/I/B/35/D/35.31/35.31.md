# ยง 35.31   Commission review.

(a) *Procedures.* Filings under this subpart are subject to the procedures applicable to other filings under section 205 of the Federal Power Act, as the Commission deems appropriate.


(b) *Commission standard.* With respect to any filing under this subpart, the Commission will determine whether the ASC set by BPA for the applicable exchange period was determined in accordance with the ASC methodology set forth at 18 CFR 301.1. If the ASC is not in accord with the methodology, the Commission will order that BPA amend the ASC to conform with the methodology. If the ASC is in accord with the methodology, the rate is deemed just and reasonable.


(c) *Refunds and adjustments.* (1) Any ASC-based rate charged by a public utility under this subpart pending Commission order is subject to refund or to adjustment that increases the ASC-based rate.


(2) Any interest on refunds ordered by the Commission under this subpart is computed in accordance with 18 CFR 35.19a. Interest on any increase ordered by the Commission will be at the rate charged to BPA by the U.S. Treasury during that period, unless the Commission orders another interest rate.
