# ยง 35.38   Mitigation.

(a) A Seller that has been found to have market power in generation or ancillary services, or that is presumed to have horizontal market power in generation or ancillary services by virtue of failing or foregoing the relevant market power screens, as described in 35.37(c), may adopt the default mitigation detailed in paragraph (b) of this section for sales of energy or capacity or paragraph (c) of this section for sales of ancillary services or may propose mitigation tailored to its own particular circumstances to eliminate its ability to exercise market power. Mitigation will apply only to the market(s) in which the Seller is found, or presumed, to have market power.


(b) Default mitigation for sales of energy or capacity consists of three distinct products:


(1) Sales of power of one week or less priced at the Seller's incremental cost plus a 10 percent adder;


(2) Sales of power of more than one week but less than one year priced at no higher than a cost-based ceiling reflecting the costs of the unit(s) expected to provide the service; and


(3) New contracts filed for review under section 205 of the Federal Power Act for sales of power for one year or more priced at a rate not to exceed embedded cost of service.


(c) Default mitigation for sales of ancillary services consist of: (1) A cap based on the relevant OATT ancillary service rate of the purchasing transmission operator; or (2) the results of a competitive solicitation that meets the Commission's requirements for transparency, definition, evaluation, and competitiveness.
