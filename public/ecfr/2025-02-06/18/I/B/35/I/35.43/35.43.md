# § 35.43   Generally.

(a) For purposes of this subpart:


(1) *Affiliate* of a specified company means:


(i) For any person other than an exempt wholesale generator:


(A) Any person that directly or indirectly owns, controls, or holds with power to vote, 10 percent or more of the outstanding voting securities of the specified company;


(B) Any company 10 percent or more of whose outstanding voting securities are owned, controlled, or held with power to vote, directly or indirectly, by the specified company;


(C) Any person or class of persons that the Commission determines, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, to stand in such relation to the specified company that there is liable to be an absence of arm's-length bargaining in transactions between them as to make it necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers that the person be treated as an affiliate; and


(D) Any person that is under common control with the specified company.


(E) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, owning, controlling or holding with power to vote, less than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of a specified company creates a rebuttable presumption of lack of control.


(ii) For any exempt wholesale generator (as defined under § 366.1 of this chapter), consistent with section 214 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824m), which provides that “affiliate” will have the same meaning as provided in section 2(a) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 79b(a)(11)):


(A) Any person that directly or indirectly owns, controls, or holds with power to vote, 5 percent or more of the outstanding voting securities of the specified company;


(B) Any company 5 percent or more of whose outstanding voting securities are owned, controlled, or held with power to vote, directly or indirectly, by the specified company;


(C) Any individual who is an officer or director of the specified company, or of any company which is an affiliate thereof under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section; and


(D) Any person or class of persons that the Commission determines, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, to stand in such relation to the specified company that there is liable to be an absence of arm's-length bargaining in transactions between them as to make it necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers that the person be treated as an affiliate.


(2) *Captive customers* means any wholesale or retail electric energy customers served by a franchised public utility under cost-based regulation.


(3) *Franchised public utility* means a public utility with a franchised service obligation under state law.


(4) *Market-regulated power sales affiliate* means any power seller affiliate other than a franchised public utility, including a power marketer, exempt wholesale generator, qualifying facility or other power seller affiliate, whose power sales are regulated in whole or in part on a market-rate basis.


(5) *Non-utility affiliate* means any affiliate that is not in the power sales or transmission business, other than a local gas distribution company or an interstate natural gas pipeline.


(b) The provisions of this subpart apply to all franchised public utilities that have captive customers or that own or provide transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities.
