Existing residential, commercial, or other structures may be included within the boundary only to the extent that underlying lands are needed for project purposes (e.g., for flowage, public recreation, shoreline control, or protection of environmental resources). If the boundary is on land covered by a public survey, ties must be shown on the map at sufficient points to permit accurate platting of the position of the boundary relative to the lines of the public land survey. If the lands are not covered by a public land survey, the best available legal description of the position of the boundary must be provided, including distances and directions from fixed monuments or physical features. The boundary must be described as follows:

(B) The boundary must be located no more than 200 feet (horizontal measurement) from the exterior margin of the reservoir, defined by the normal maximum surface elevation, except where deviations may be necessary in describing the boundary according to the above methods or where additional lands are necessary for project purposes, such as public recreation, shoreline control, or protection of environmental resources.


(ii) *Continuous features.* The boundary around linear (*continuous*) project features such as access roads, transmission lines, and conduits may be described by specified distances from center lines or offset lines of survey. The width of such corridors must not exceed 200 feet unless good cause is shown for a greater width. Several sections of a continuous feature may be shown on a single sheet with information showing the sequence of contiguous sections.


(iii) *Noncontinuous features.* (A) The boundary around noncontinuous project works such as dams, spillways, and powerhouses must be described by one of the following:

(*3*) If the project lands are covered by a public land survey, lines upon or parallel to the lines of the survey; or


(*4*) Any combination of the above methods.


(B) The boundary must enclose only those lands that are necessary for safe and efficient operation and maintenance of the project or for other specified project purposes, such as public recreation or protection of environmental resources.


(3) *Federal lands.* Any public lands and reservations of the United States (*Federal lands*) [*see* 16 U.S.C. 796 (1) and (2)] that are within the project boundary, such as lands administered by the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, or National Park Service, or Indian tribal lands, and the boundaries of those Federal lands, must be identified as such on the map by:


(i) Legal subdivisions of a public land survey of the affected area (a protraction of identified township and section lines is sufficient for this purpose); and


(ii) The Federal agency, identified by symbol or legend, that maintains or manages each identified subdivision of the public land survey within the project boundary; or


(iii) In the absence of a public land survey, the location of the Federal lands according to the distances and directions from fixed monuments or physical features.

The maps show the location (and elevation, for bench marks) of the survey monument or bench mark which will be destroyed or rendered unusable, as well as of the witness monuments or bench marks. Connecting courses and distances from the witness monuments or bench marks to the original must also be shown.


(iv) The project location must include the most current information pertaining to affected Federal lands as described under § 4.81(b)(5).


(4) *Non-Federal lands.* For those lands within the project boundary not identified under paragraph (h)(3) of this section, the map must identify by legal subdivision:


(i) Lands owned in fee by the applicant and lands that the applicant plans to acquire in fee; and


(ii) Lands over which the applicant has acquired or plans to acquire rights to occupancy and use other than fee title, including rights acquired or to be acquired by easement or lease.
