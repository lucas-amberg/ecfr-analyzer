# ยง 50.2   Purpose and intent of rules.

(a) The purpose of the regulations in this part is to provide for efficient and timely review of requests for permits for the siting of electric transmission facilities under section 216 of the Federal Power Act. The regulations ensure that each stakeholder is afforded an opportunity to present views and recommendations with respect to the need for and impact of a facility covered by the permit. They also coordinate, to the maximum extent practicable, the Federal authorization and review processes of other Federal and State agencies, Indian Tribes, multistate, and local entities that are responsible for conducting any separate permitting and environmental reviews of the proposed facilities.


(b) Every applicant shall file all pertinent data and information necessary for a full and complete understanding of the proposed project.


(c) Every requirement of this part will be considered as an obligation of the applicant that can only be avoided by a definite and positive showing that the information or data called for by the applicable rules is not necessary for the consideration and ultimate determination of the application.


(d) The burden of assuring that all applications and information submitted under this part is in an intelligible form and any omission of data is justified rests with the applicant.
