# ยง 7.5   Decision on request to use expedited licensing process.

When the Commission has determined that the original license application is complete insofar as it meets the Commission's requirements as specified in 18 CFR parts 4, 5, and this part; any deficiencies have been cured; and no other additional information is needed, the Director will make a decision on the request to use the expedited licensing process under this part no later than 180 days after receipt of a request for authorization to use the expedited process. If the Commission cannot deem the application complete within 180 days of application filing, the Director will deny the request to use the expedited licensing process. If the Director denies the request to use the expedited licensing process, the original license application will be processed pursuant to a standard processing schedule under 18 CFR parts 4 and 5, as applicable.
