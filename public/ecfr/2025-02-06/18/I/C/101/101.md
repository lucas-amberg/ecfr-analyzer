31. *Regulatory Assets and Liabilities* are assets and liabilities that result from rate actions of regulatory agencies. Regulatory assets and liabilities arise from specific revenues, expenses, gains, or losses that would have been included in net income determination in one period under the general requirements of the Uniform System of Accounts but for it being probable: 


A. that such items will be included in a different period(s) for purposes of developing the rates the utility is authorized to charge for its utility services; or

This definition includes expenditures for the implementation or development of new and/or existing concepts until technically feasible and commercially feasible operations are verified. Such research, development, and demonstration costs should be reasonably related to the existing or future utility business, broadly defined, of the public utility or licensee or in the environment in which it operates or expects to operate. The term includes, but is not limited to: All such costs incidental to the design, development or implementation of an experimental facility, a plant process, a product, a formula, an invention, a system or similar items, and the improvement of already existing items of a like nature; amounts expended in connection with the proposed development and/or proposed delivery of alternate sources of electricity; and the costs of obtaining its own patent, such as attorney's fees expended in making and perfecting a patent application. The term includes preliminary investigations and detailed planning of specific projects for securing for customers non-conventional electric power supplies that rely on technology that has not been verified previously to be feasible. The term does not include expenditures for efficiency surveys; studies of management, management techniques and organization; consumer surveys, advertising, promotions, or items of a like nature. 


33. *Retained Earnings* (formerly earned surplus) means the accumulated net income of the utility less distribution to stockholders and transfers to other capital accounts.

35. *Salvage value* means the amount received for property retired, less any expenses incurred in connection with the sale or in preparing the property for sale; or, if retained, the amount at which the material recoverable is chargeable to materials and supplies, or other appropriate account. 


36. *Service life* means the time between the date electric plant is includible in electric plant in service, or electric plant leased to others, and the date of its retirement. If depreciation is accounted for on a production basis rather than on a time basis, then service life should be measured in terms of the appropriate unit of production. 


37. *Service value* means the difference between original cost and net salvage value of electric plant. 


38. *State* means a State admitted to the Union, the District of Columbia, and any organized Territory of the United States. 


39. *Subsidiary Company* in the case of Major utilities means a company which is controlled by the utility through ownership of voting stock. (See *Definitions* item 5B, *Control*). A corporate joint venture in which a corporation is owned by a small group of businesses as a separate and specific business or project for the mutual benefit of the members of the group is a subsidiary company for the purposes of this system of accounts. 


40. *Utility,* as used herein and when not otherwise indicated in the context, means any public utility or licensee to which this system of accounts is applicable. 

General Instructions


1. *Classification of utilities.*

A. For purpose of applying the system of accounts prescribed by the Commission, electric utilities and licensees are divided into classes, as follows:


(1) *Major.* Utilities and licensees that had, in each of the last three consecutive years, sales or transmission service that exceeded any one or more of the following: 


(a) One million megawatt-hours of total sales;


(b) 100 megawatt-hours of sales for resale;


(c) 500 megawatt-hours of power exchanges delivered; or


(d) 500 megawatt-hours of wheeling for others (deliveries plus losses).


(2) *Nonmajor.* Utilities and licensees that are not classified as *Major* (as defined above), and had total sales in each of the last three consecutive years of 10,000 megawatt-hours or more.


(3) *Nonoperating.* Utilities and licensees formerly designated as Major or Nonmajor that have ceased operation but continue to collect amounts pursuant to a Commission-accepted tariff or rate schedule, or a Commission order.


B. This system applies to Major, Nonmajor, and Nonoperating utilities and licensees. Provisions have been incorporated into this system for those entities which, prior to January 1, 1984, were applying the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts Prescribed for Public Utilities and Licensees subject to the Provisions of the Federal Power Act (Class C and Class D) [part 104 of this chapter, now revoked]. The notations (*Nonmajor*) and (*Major*) have been used to indicate those instructions and accounts from previous systems and classifications, which by definition, are not interchangeable without causing a loss of detail for the Major (previously Class A and Class B) or an increase in detail burden on the Nonmajor (previously Class C and Class D).


C. The class to which any utility or licensee belongs will originally be determined by its annual megawatt hours in each of the last three consecutive years, or in the case of a newly established entity, the projected data shall be the basis. Subsequent changes in classification shall be made as necessary when the megawatt-hours for each of the three immediately preceding years shall exceed the upper limit, or be less than the lower limit of the classification previously applicable to the utility.


D. Any utility may, at its option, adopt the system of accounts prescribed by the Commission for any larger class of utilities. 


2. *Records.*

A. Each utility shall keep its books of account, and all other books, records, and memoranda which support the entries in such books of account so as to be able to furnish readily full information as to any item included in any account. Each entry shall be supported by such detailed information as will permit ready identification, analysis, and verification of all facts relevant thereto. 


B. The books and records referred to herein include not only accounting records in a limited technical sense, but all other records, such as minute books, stock books, reports, correspondence, memoranda, etc., which may be useful in developing the history of or facts regarding any transaction. 


C. No utility shall destroy any such books or records unless the destruction thereof is permitted by rules and regulations of the Commission. 


D. In addition to prescribed accounts, clearing accounts, temporary or experimental accounts, and subdivisions of any accounts, may be kept, provided the integrity of the prescribed accounts is not impaired. 


E. All amounts included in the accounts prescribed herein for electric plant and operating expenses shall be just and reasonable and any payments or accruals by the utility in excess of just and reasonable charges shall be included in account 426.5, Other Deductions. 


F. The arrangement or sequence of the accounts prescribed herein shall not be controlling as to the arrangement or sequence in report forms which may be prescribed by the Commission. 


3. *Numbering System.*

A. The account numbering plan used herein consists of a system of three-digit whole numbers as follows: 


B. In certain instances, numbers have been skipped in order to allow for possible later expansion or to permit better coordination with the numbering system for other utility departments. 


C. The numbers prefixed to account titles are to be considered as parts of the titles. Each utility, however, may adopt for its own purposes a different system of account numbers (see also general instruction 2D) provided that the numbers herein prescribed shall appear in the descriptive headings of the ledger accounts and in the various sources of original entry; however, if a utility uses a different group of account numbers and it is not practicable to show the prescribed account numbers in the various sources of original entry, such reference to the prescribed account numbers may be omitted from the various sources of original entry. Moreover, each utility using different account numbers for its own purposes shall keep readily available a list of such account numbers which it uses and a reconciliation of such account numbers with the account numbers provided herein. It is intended that the utility's records shall be so kept as to permit ready analysis by prescribed accounts (by direct reference to sources of original entry to the extent practicable) and to permit preparation of financial and operating statements directly from such records at the end of each accounting period according to the prescribed accounts. 


4. *Accounting Period.*

Each utility shall keep its books on a monthly basis so that for each month all transactions applicable thereto, as nearly as may be ascertained, shall be entered in the books of the utility. Amounts applicable or assignable to specific utility departments shall be so segregated monthly. Each utility shall close its books at the end of each calendar year unless otherwise authorized by the Commission. 


5. *Submittal of Questions.*

To maintain uniformity of accounting, utilities shall submit questions of doubtful interpretation to the Commission for consideration and decision. 


6. *Item Lists.*

Lists of *items* appearing in the texts of the accounts or elsewhere herein are for the purpose of more clearly indicating the application of the prescribed accounting. The lists are intended to be representative, but not exhaustive. The appearance of an item in a list warrants the inclusion of the item in the account mentioned only when the text of the account also indicates inclusion inasmuch as the same item frequently appears in more than one list. The proper entry in each instance must be determined by the texts of the accounts. 


7. *Extraordinary Items.*

It is the intent that net income shall reflect all items of profit and loss during the period with the exception of prior period adjustments as described in paragraph 7.1 and long-term debt as described in paragraph 17 below. Those items related to the effects of events and transactions which have occurred during the current period and which are of unusual nature and infrequent occurrence shall be considered extraordinary items. Accordingly, they will be events and transactions of significant effect which are abnormal and significantly different from the ordinary and typical activities of the company, and which would not reasonably be expected to recur in the forseeable future. (In determining significance, items should be considered individually and not in the aggregate. However, the effects of a series of related transactions arising from a single specific and identifiable event or plan of action should be considered in the aggregate. To be considered as extraordinary under the above guidelines, an item should be more than approximately 5 percent of income, computed before extraordinary items. Commission approval must be obtained to treat an item of less than 5 percent, as extraordinary. (See accounts 434 and 435.) 


7.1 *Prior period items.*

A. Items of profit and loss related to the following shall be accounted for as prior period adjustments and excluded from the determination of net income for the current year:


(1) Correction of an error in the financial statements of a prior year.


(2) Adjustments that result from realization of income tax benefits of pre-acquisition operating loss carryforwards of purchased subsidiaries.


B. All other items of profit and loss recognized during the year shall be included in the determination of net income for that year.


8. *Unaudited Items (Major Utility).*

Whenever a financial statement is required by the Commission, if it is known that a transaction has occurred which affects the accounts but the amount involved in the transaction and its effect upon the accounts cannot be determined with absolute accuracy, the amount shall be estimated and such estimated amount included in the proper accounts. The utility is not required to anticipate minor items which would not appreciably affect the accounts. 


9. *Distribution of Pay and Expenses of Employees.*

The charges to electric plant, operating expense and other accounts for services and expenses of employees engaged in activities chargeable to various accounts, such as construction, maintenance, and operations, shall be based upon the actual time engaged in the respective classes of work, or in case that method is impracticable, upon the basis of a study of the time actually engaged during a representative period. 


10. *Payroll Distribution.*

Underlying accounting data shall be maintained so that the distribution of the cost of labor charged direct to the various accounts will be readily available. Such underlying data shall permit a reasonably accurate distribution to be made of the cost of labor charged initially to clearing accounts so that the total labor cost may be classified among construction, cost of removal, electric operating functions (steam generation, nuclear generation, hydraulic generation, transmission, distribution, etc.) and nonutility operations. 


11. *Accounting to be on Accrual Basis.*

A. The utility is required to keep its accounts on the accrual basis. This requires the inclusion in its accounts of all known transactions of appreciable amount which affect the accounts. If bills covering such transactions have not been received or rendered, the amounts shall be estimated and appropriate adjustments made when the bills are received.


B. When payments are made in advance for items such as insurance, rents, taxes or interest the amount applicable to future periods shall be charged to account 165, Prepayments, and spread over the periods to which applicable by credits to account 165, and charges to the accounts appropriate for the expenditure.


12. *Records for Each Plant (Major Utility).*

Separate records shall be maintained by electric plant accounts of the book cost of each plant owned, including additions by the utility to plant leased from others, and of the cost of operating and maintaining each plant owned or operated. The term *plant* as here used means each generating station and each transmission line or appropriate group of transmission lines. 


13. *Accounting for Other Departments.*

If the utility also operates other utility departments, such as gas, water, etc., it shall keep such accounts for the other departments as may be prescribed by proper authority and in the absence of prescribed accounts, it shall keep such accounts as are proper or necessary to reflect the results of operating each such department. It is not intended that proprietary and similar accounts which apply to the utility as a whole shall be departmentalized. 


14. *Transactions With Associated Companies (Major Utility).*

Each utility shall keep its accounts and records so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously statements of all transactions with associated companies. The statements may be required to show the general nature of the transactions, the amounts involved therein and the amounts included in each account prescribed herein with respect to such transactions. Transactions with associated companies shall be recorded in the appropriate accounts for transactions of the same nature. Nothing herein contained, however, shall be construed as restraining the utility from subdividing accounts for the purpose of recording separately transactions with associated companies. 


15. *Contingent Assets and Liabilities (Major Utility).*

Contingent assets represent a possible source of value to the utility contingent upon the fulfillment of conditions regarded as uncertain. Contingent liabilities include items which may under certain conditions become obligations of the utility but which are neither direct nor assumed liabilities at the date of the balance sheet. The utility shall be prepared to give a complete statement of significant contingent assets and liabilities (including cumulative dividends on preference stock) in its annual report and at such other times as may be requested by the Commission. 


16. *Separate Accounts or Records for Each Licensed Project.*

The accounts or records of each licensee shall be so kept as to show for each project (including pumped storage) under license; 


(a) The actual legitimate original cost of the project, including the original cost (or fair value, as determined under section 23 of the Federal Power Act) of the original project, the original cost of additions thereto and betterments thereof and credits for property retired from service, as determined under the Commission's regulations; 


(b) The charges for operation and maintenance of the project property directly assignable to the project; 


(c) The credits and debits to the depreciation and amortization accounts, and the balances in such accounts; 


(d) The credits and debits to operating revenue, income, and retained earnings accounts that can be identified with and directly assigned to the project. 


17. *Long-Term Debt: Premium, Discount and Expense, and Gain or Loss on Reacquisition.*

A. *Premium, discount and expense.* A separate premium, discount and expense account shall be maintained for each class and series of long-term debt (including receivers' certificates) is- sued or assumed by the utility. The premium will be recorded in account 225, Unamortized Premium on Long-Term Debt, the discount will be recorded in account 226, Unamortized Discount on Long-Term Debt—Debit, and the expense of issuance shall be recorded in account 181, Unamortized Debt Expense. 


The premium, discount and expense shall be amortized over the life of the respective issues under a plan which will distribute the amounts equitably over the life of the securities. The amortization shall be on a monthly basis, and amounts thereof relating to discount and expense shall be charged to account 428, Amortization of Debt Discount and Expense. The amounts relating to premium shall be credited to account 429, Amortization of Premium on Debt—Credit. 


B. *Reacquisition, without refunding.* When long-term debt is reacquired or redeemed without being converted into another form of long-term debt and when the transaction is not in connection with a refunding operation (primarily redemptions for sinking fund purposes), the difference between the amount paid upon reacquisition and the face value; plus any un- amortized premium less any related unamortized debt expense and reacquisition costs; or less any unamortized discount, related debt expense and reacquisition costs applicable to the debt redeemed, retired and canceled, shall be included in account 189, Unamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt, or account 257, Unamortized Gain on Reacquired Debt, as appropriate. The utility shall amortize the recorded amounts equally on a monthly basis over the remaining life of the respective security issues (old original debt). The amounts so amortized shall be charged to account 428.1, Amortization of Loss on Reacquired Debt, or credited to account 429.1, Amortization of Gain on Reacquired Debt—Credit, as appropriate. 


C. *Reacquisition, with refunding.* When the redemption of one issue or series of bonds or other long-term obligations is financed by another issue or series before the maturity date of the first issue, the difference between the amount paid upon refunding and the face value; plus any unamortized premium less related debt expense or less any unamortized discount and related debt expense, applicable to the debt refunded, shall be included in account 189, Unamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt, or account 257, Unamortized Gain on Reacquired Debt, as appropriate. The utility may elect to account for such amounts as follows: 


(1) Write them off immediately when the amounts are insignificant. 


(2) Amortize them by equal monthly amounts over the remainder of the original life of the issue retired, or 


(3) Amortize them by equal monthly amounts over the life of the new issue. 


Once an election is made, it shall be applied on a consistent basis. The amounts in (1), (2) or (3) above shall be charged to account 428.1. Amortization of Loss on Reacquired Debt, or credited to account 429.1, Amortization of Gain on Reacquired Debt—Credit, as appropriate. 


D. Under methods (2) and (3) above, the increase or reduction in current income taxes resulting from the reacquisition should be apportioned over the remainder of the original life of the issue retired or over the life of the new issue, as appropriate, as directed more specifically in paragraphs E and F below. 


E. When the utility recognizes the loss in the year of reacquisition as a tax deduction, account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, shall be debited and account 283, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other, shall be credited with the amount of the related tax effect, such amount to be allocated to the periods affected in accordance with the provisions of account 283. 


F. When the utility chooses to recognize the gain in the year of reacquisition as a taxable gain, account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Utility Operating Income, shall be credited and account 190, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes, shall be debited with the amount of the related tax effect, such amount to be allocated to the periods affected in accordance with the provisions of account 190. 


G. When the utility chooses to use the optional privilege of deferring the tax on the gain attributable to the reacquisition of debt by reducing the depreciable basis of utility property for tax purposes, pursuant to section 108 of the Internal Revenue Code, the related tax effects shall be deferred as the income is recognized for accounting purposes, and the deferred amounts shall be amortized over the life of the associated property on a vintage year basis. Account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, shall be debited, and account 282, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other Property shall be credited with an amount equal to the estimated income tax effect applicable to the portion of the income, attributable to reacquired debt, recognized for accounting purposes during the period. Account 282 shall be debited and account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Utility Operating Income, shall be credited with an amount equal to the estimated income tax effects, during the life of the property, attributable to the reduction in the depreciable basis for tax purposes. 


H. The tax effects relating to gain or loss shall be allocated as above to utility operations except in cases where a portion of the debt reacquired is directly applicable to nonutility operations. In that event, the related portion of the tax effects shall be allocated to nonutility operations. Where it can be established that reacquired debt is generally applicable to both utility and nonutility operations, the tax effects shall be allocated between utility and nonutility operations based on the ratio of net investment in utility plant to net investment in nonutility plant. 


I. Premium, discount, or expense on debt shall not be included as an element in the cost of construction or acquisition of property (tangible or intangible), except under the provisions of account 432, Allowance for Borrowed Funds Used During Construction—Credit. 


J. *Alternate method.* Where a regulatory authority or a group of regulatory authorities having prime rate jurisdiction over the utility specifically disallows the rate principle of amortizing gains or losses on reacquisition of long-term debt without refunding, and does not apply the gain or loss to reduce interest charges in computing the allowed rate of return for rate purposes, then the following alternate method may be used to account for gains or losses relating to reacquisition of long-term debt, with or without refunding. 


(1) The difference between the amount paid upon reacquisition of any long-term debt and the face value, adjusted for unamortized discount, expenses or premium, as the case may be, applicable to the debt redeemed shall be recognized currently in income and recorded in account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or account 426.5, Other Deductions. 


(2) When this alternate method of accounting is used, the utility shall include a footnote to each financial statement, prepared for public use, explaining why this method is being used along with the treatment given for ratemaking purposes. 


18. *Comprehensive Interperiod In- come Tax Allocation.*

A. Where there are timing differences between the periods in which transactions affect taxable income and the periods in which they enter into the determination of pretax accounting income, the income tax effects of such transactions are to be recognized in the periods in which the differences between book accounting income and taxable income arise and in the periods in which the differences reverse using the deferred tax method. In general, comprehensive interperiod tax allocation should be followed whenever transactions enter into the determination of pretax accounting income for the period even though some transactions may affect the determination of taxes payable in a different period, as further qualified below. 


B. Utilities are not required to utilize comprehensive interperiod income tax allocation until the deferred income taxes are included as an expense in the rate level by the regulatory authority having rate jurisdiction over the utility. Where comprehensive interperiod tax allocation accounting is not practiced the utility shall include as a note to each financial statement, prepared for public use, a footnote explanation setting forth the utility's accounting policies with respect to interperiod tax allocation and describing the treatment for ratemaking purposes of the tax timing differences by regulatory authorities having rate jurisdiction. 


C. Should the utility be subject to more than one agency having rate jurisdiction, its accounts shall appropriately reflect the ratemaking treatment (deferral or flow through) of each jurisdiction. 


D. Once comprehensive interperiod tax allocation has been initiated either in whole or in part it shall be practiced on a consistent basis and shall not be changed or discontinued without prior Commission approval. 


E. Tax effects deferred currently will be recorded as deferred debits or deferred credits in accounts 190, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes, 281, Accumulated Deferred Income Tax- es—Accelerated Amortization Property, 282, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other Property, and 283, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other, as appropriate. The resulting amounts recorded in these accounts shall be disposed of as prescribed in this system of accounts or as otherwise authorized by the Commission. 


19. *Criteria for classifying leases.*

A. If at its inception a lease meets one or more of the following criteria, the lease shall be classified as a capital lease. Otherwise, it shall be classified as an operating lease. 


(1) The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the end of the lease term


(2) The lease contains a bargain purchase option.


(3) The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated economic life of the leased property. However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the leased property, including earlier years of use, this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease.


(4) The present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, including any profit thereon, equals or exceeds 90 percent of the excess of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at the inception of the lease over any related investment tax credit retained by the lessor and expected to be realized by the lessor. However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the leased property, including earlier years of use, this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease. The lessee utility shall compute the present value of the minimum lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate, unless (A) it is practicable for the utility to learn the implicit rate computed by the lessor, and (B) the implicit rate computed by the lessor is less than the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. If both of those conditions are met, the lessee shall use the implicit rate.


B. If at any time the lessee and lessor agree to change the provisions of the lease, other than by renewing the lease or extending its term, in a manner that would have resulted in a different classification of the lease under the criteria in paragraph A had the changed terms been in effect at the inception of the lease, the revised agreement shall be considered as a new agreement over its term, and the criteria in paragraph A shall be applied for purposes of classifying the new lease. Likewise, any action that extends the lease beyond the expiration of the existing lease term, such as the exercise of a lease renewal option other than those already included in the lease term, shall be considered as a new agreement and shall be classified according to the above provisions. Changes in estimates (for example, changes in estimates of the economic life or of the residual value of the leased property) or changes in circumstances (for example, default by the lessee) shall not give rise to a new classification of a lease for accounting purposes.


20. *Accounting for leases.*

A. All leases shall be classified as either capital or operating leases. The accounting for capitalized leases is effective January 1, 1984, except for the retroactive classification of certain leases which, in accordance with FASB No. 71, will not be required to be capitalized until after a three year transition period. For the purpose of reporting to the FERC, the transition period shall be deemed to end December 31, 1986.


B. The utility shall record a capital lease as an asset in account 101.1, Property under Capital Leases, Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel under Capital Leases, or account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate, and an obligation in account 227, Obligations under Capital Leases—Noncurrent, or account 243, Obligations under Capital Leases—Current, at an amount equal to the present value at the beginning of the lease term of minimum lease payments during the lease term, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, together with any profit thereon. However, if the amount so determined exceeds the fair value of the leased property at the inception of the lease, the amount recorded as the asset and obligation shall be the fair value.


C. The utility, as a lessee, shall recognize an asset retirement obligation (*See* General Instruction 25) arising from the plant under a capital lease unless the obligation is recorded as an asset and liability under a capital lease. The utility shall record the asset retirement cost by debiting account 101.1, Property under capital leases, or account 120.6, Nuclear fuel under capital leases, or account 121, Nonutility property, as appropriate, and crediting the liability for the asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset retirement obligations. Asset retirement costs recorded in account 101.1, account 120.6, or account 121 shall be amortized by charging rent expense (*See* Operating Expense Instruction 3), or account 518, Nuclear fuel expense (Major only), or account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, as appropriate, and crediting a separate subaccount of the account in which the asset retirement costs are recorded. Charges for the periodic accretion of the liability in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, shall be recorded by a charge to account 411.10, Accretion expense, for electric utility plant, and account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, for nonutility plant and a credit to account 230, Asset retirement obligations. 


D. Rental payments on all leases shall be charged to rent expense, fuel expense, construction work in progress, or other appropriate accounts as they become payable.


E. For a capital lease, for each period during the lease term, the amounts recorded for the asset and obligation shall be reduced by an amount equal to the portion of each lease payment that would have been allocated to the reduction of the obligation, if the payment had been treated as a payment on an installment obligation (liability) and allocated between interest expense and a reduction of the obligation so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance.


21. *Allowances and environmental credits.*

A. Public utilities owning allowances and environmental credits for operational purposes, shall account for such allowances and environmental credits at historical cost in account 158.1, Allowance Inventory, account 158.2, Allowances Withheld, account 158.3, Bundled Environmental Credits Inventory, or account 158.4, Unbundled Environmental Credits Inventory, as appropriate.


B. Allowances and environmental credits acquired for speculative purposes shall be accounted for in account 124, Other Investments. When purchased allowances and environmental credits acquired for speculative purposes become eligible for use in different years, and the allocation of the purchase cost cannot be determined by fair value, the purchase cost allocated to allowances and environmental credits of each vintage shall be determined through use of a present-value based measurement. The interest rate used in the present-value measurement shall be the utility's incremental borrowing rate, in the month in which the allowances and environmental credits are acquired, for a loan with a term similar to the period that it will hold the allowances and environmental credits and in an amount equal to the purchase price.


C. The underlying records supporting operational allowances and environmental credits recorded in account 158.1, account 158.2, account 158.3, and account 158.4 shall be maintained in sufficient detail at historical costs and provide the number of allowances and environmental credits and the related cost by vintage year, including allowances and environmental credits acquired at zero cost.


D. Issuances from inventory included in account 158.1, account 158.2, account 158.3, and account 158.4 shall be accounted for on a vintage basis using a monthly weighted-average method of historical cost determination. The cost of eligible allowances and environmental credits not used in the current year, shall be transferred to the vintage for the immediately following year.


E. Account 158.1 shall be credited and account 509, Allowances, debited concurrent with the monthly remittance of the allowances to be charged to expense based on each month's emissions. Account 158.3 and account 158.4 shall be credited and account 555.2, Bundled Environmental Credits, and account 555.3, Unbundled Environmental Credits, debited, respectively, so that the cost of the environmental credits to be remitted for the year is charged to expense based on each month's usage. This may, in certain circumstances, require allocation of the cost between months on a fractional basis.


F. In any period in which actual emissions exceed the amount allowable based on eligible allowances owned, the utility shall estimate the cost to acquire the additional allowances needed and charge account 158.1 with the estimated cost and credit the proper liability account. In any period in which a utility records its estimated amount of required environmental credits, the utility shall debit account 158.3 or account 158.4 with the estimated cost and credit the proper liability account. When differences between the estimated and actual costs become known, the adjustments should be made through account 158.1, account 158.3, and account 158.4, as well as account 509, account 555.2, and account 555.3 within a single month, as appropriate.


G. When a prepayment is made for allowances or environmental credits, the payment is debited to account 165, Prepayments. This accounting is not intended to influence the outcome of any rate treatment.


H. Penalties assessed by any authoritative agencies shall be charged to account 426.3, Penalties.


I. Gains on dispositions of allowances and environmental credits, other than those held for speculative purposes, shall be accounted for as follows. First, if there is uncertainty as to the regulatory treatment, the gain shall be deferred in account 254, Other Regulatory Liabilities, pending resolution of the uncertainty. Second, if there is certainty as to the existence of a regulatory liability, the gain will be credited to account 254, with subsequent recognition in income when reductions in charges to customers occur or the liability is otherwise satisfied. Third, all other gains will be credited to account 411.8, Gains from Disposition of Allowances, or account 411.11, Gains from Disposition of Environmental Credits. Losses on disposition of allowances and environmental credits, other than those held for speculative purposes, shall be accounted for as follows. Losses that qualify as regulatory assets shall be charged directly to account 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets. All other losses shall be charged to account 411.9, Losses from Disposition of Allowances, or account 411.12, Losses from Disposition of Environmental Credits. (*See* Definition No. 31.) Gains or losses on disposition of allowances and environmental credits held for speculative purposes shall be recognized in account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or account 426.5, Other Deductions, as appropriate.


J. Revenues for environmental credits associated with the sale of energy shall be recorded in the appropriate operating revenue account.


22. *Depreciation Accounting.*

A. *Method.* Utilities must use a method of depreciation that allocates in a systematic and rational manner the service value of depreciable property over the service life of the property. 


B. *Service lives.* Estimated useful service lives of depreciable property must be supported by engineering, economic, or other depreciation studies. 


C. *Rate.* Utilities must use percentage rates of depreciation that are based on a method of depreciation that allocates in a systematic and rational manner the service value of depreciable property to the service life of the property. Where composite depreciation rates are used, they should be based on the weighted average estimated useful service lives of the depreciable property comprising the composite group. 


23. *Accounting for other comprehensive income.*

A. Utilities shall record items of other comprehensive income in account 219, Accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts included in this account shall be maintained by each category of other comprehensive income. Examples of categories of other comprehensive income include, foreign currency items, minimum pension liability adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale type securities and cash flow hedge amounts. Supporting records shall be maintained for account 219 so that the company can readily identify the cumulative amount of other comprehensive income for each item included in this account. 


B. When an item of other comprehensive income enters into the determination of net income in the current or subsequent periods, a reclassification adjustment shall be recorded in account 219 to avoid double counting of that amount. 


C. When it is probable that an item of other comprehensive income will be included in the development of cost-of-service rates in subsequent periods, that amount of unrealized losses or gains will be recorded in Accounts 182.3 or 254 as appropriate.


24. *Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities.*

A. Utilities shall recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the financial statements and measure those instruments at fair value, except those falling within recognized exceptions. Normal purchases or sales are contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of goods that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold by the utility over a reasonable period in the normal course of business. A derivative instrument is a financial instrument or other contract with all of the following characteristics: 


(1) It has one or more underlyings and a notional amount or payment provision. Those terms determine the amount of the settlement or settlements, and, in some cases, whether or not a settlement is required. 


(2) It requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors. 


(3) Its terms require or permit net settlement, can readily be settled net by a means outside the contract, or provides for delivery of an asset that puts the recipient in a position not substantially different from net settlement. 


B. The accounting for the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends upon its intended use and designation. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges shall be recorded in account 175, derivative instrument assets, or account 244, derivative instrument liabilities, as appropriate, with the gains recorded in account 421, miscellaneous nonoperating income, and losses recorded in account 426.5, other deductions. 


C. A derivative instrument may be specifically designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge. A hedge is used to manage risk to price, interest rates, or foreign currency transactions. A company shall maintain documentation of the hedge relationship at the inception of the hedge that details the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how hedge effectiveness will be determined. 


D. If the utility designates the derivative instrument as a fair value hedge against exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment, it shall record the change in fair value of the derivative instrument to account 176, derivative instrument assets-hedges, or account 245, derivative instrument liabilities-hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding adjustment to the subaccount of the item being hedged. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the same income or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income. In the case of a fair value hedge of a firm commitment a new asset or liability is created. As a result of the hedge relationship, the new asset or liability will become part of the carrying amount of the item being hedged. 


E. If the utility designates the derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge against exposure to variable cash flows of a probable forecasted transaction, it shall record changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument in account 176, derivative instrument assets-hedges, or account 245, derivative instrument liabilities-hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding amount in account 219, accumulated other comprehensive income, for the effective portion of the hedge. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the same income or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income shall be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged forecasted item enters into the determination of net income.


25. *Accounting for asset retirement obligations.*

A. An *asset retirement obligation* represents a liability for the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that a company is required to settle as a result of an existing or enacted law, statute, ordinance, or written or oral contract or by legal construction of a contract under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. An *asset retirement cost* represents the amount capitalized when the liability is recognized for the long-lived asset that gives rise to the legal obligation. The amount recognized for the liability and an associated asset retirement cost shall be stated at the fair value of the asset retirement obligation in the period in which the obligation is incurred. 


B. The utility shall initially record a liability for an asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, and charge the associated asset retirement costs to electric utility plant (including accounts 101.1 and 120.6), and nonutility plant, as appropriate, related to the plant that gives rise to the legal obligation. The asset retirement cost shall be depreciated over the useful life of the related asset that gives rise to the obligations. For periods subsequent to the initial recording of the asset retirement obligation, a utility shall recognize the period to period changes of the asset retirement obligation that result from the passage of time due to the accretion of the liability and any subsequent measurement changes to the initial liability for the legal obligation recorded in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, as follows: 


(1) The utility shall record the accretion of the liability by debiting account 411.10, Accretion expense, for electric utility plant, account 413, Expenses of electric plant leased to others, for electric plant leased to others, and account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, for nonutility plant and crediting account 230, Asset retirement obligations; and 


(2) The utility shall recognize any subsequent measurement changes of the liability initially recorded in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, for each specific asset retirement obligation as an adjustment of that liability in account 230 with the corresponding adjustment to electric utility plant, electric plant leased to others, and nonutility plant, as appropriate. The utility shall on a timely basis monitor any measurement changes of the asset retirement obligations. 


C. Gains or losses resulting from the settlement of asset retirement obligations associated with utility plant resulting from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation included in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, and the actual amount paid to settle the obligation shall be accounted for as follows: 


(1) Gains shall be credited to account 411.6, Gains from disposition of utility plant, and; 


(2) Losses shall be charged to account 411.7, Losses from disposition of utility plant. 


D. Gains or losses on the settlement of asset retirement obligations associated with nonutility plant resulting from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, and the amount paid to settle the obligation, shall be accounted for as follows: 


(1) Gains shall be credited to account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, and; 


(2) Losses shall be charged to account 426.5, Other deductions. 


E. Separate subsidiary records shall be maintained for each asset retirement obligation showing the initial liability and associated asset retirement cost, any incremental amounts of the liability incurred in subsequent reporting periods for additional layers of the original liability and related asset retirement cost, the accretion of the liability, the subsequent measurement changes to the asset retirement obligation, the depreciation and amortization of the asset retirement costs and related accumulated depreciation, and the settlement date and actual amount paid to settle the obligation. For purposes of analyses a utility shall maintain supporting documentation so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously with respect to each asset retirement obligation the full details of the identity and nature of the legal obligation, the year incurred, the identity of the plant giving rise to the obligation, the full particulars relating to each component and supporting computations related to the measurement of the asset retirement obligation. 

Electric Plant Instructions 


1. *Classification of electric plant at effective date of system of accounts (Major utilities).*

A. The electric plant accounts provided herein are the same as those contained in the prior system of accounts except for inclusion of accounts for nuclear production plant and some changes in classification in the general equipment accounts. Except for these changes, the balances in the various plant accounts, as determined under the prior system of accounts, should be carried forward. Any remaining balance of plant which has not yet been classified, pursuant to the requirements of the prior system, shall be classified in accordance with the following instructions. 


B. The cost to the utility of its unclassified plant shall be ascertained by analysis of the utility's records. Adjustments shall not be made to record in utility plant accounts amounts previously charged to operating expenses or to income deductions in accordance with the uniform system of accounts in effect at the time or in accordance with the discretion of management as exercised under a uniform system of accounts, or under accounting practices previously followed. 


C. The detailed electric plant accounts (301 to 399, inclusive) shall be stated on the basis of cost to the utility of plant constructed by it and the original cost, estimated if not known, of plant acquired as an operating unit or system. The difference between the original cost, as above, and the cost to the utility of electric plant after giving effect to any accumulated provision for depreciation or amortization shall be recorded in account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments. The original cost of electric plant shall be determined by analysis of the utility's records or those of the predecessor or vendor companies with respect to electric plant previously acquired as operating units or systems and the difference between the original cost so determined, less accumulated provisions for depreciation and amortization and the cost to the utility with necessary adjustments for retirements from the date of acquisition, shall be entered in account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments. Any difference between the cost of electric plant and its book cost, when not properly includible in other accounts, shall be recorded in account 116, Other Electric Plant Adjustments. 


D. Plant acquired by lease which qualifies as capital lease property under General Instruction 19. *Criteria for Classifying Leases,* shall be recorded in Account 101.1, Property under Capital Leases, or Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel under Capital Leases, as appropriate.


2. *Electric Plant To Be Recorded at Cost.*

A. All amounts included in the accounts for electric plant acquired as an operating unit or system, except as otherwise provided in the texts of the intangible plant accounts, shall be stated at the cost incurred by the person who first devoted the property to utility service. All other electric plant shall be included in the accounts at the cost incurred by the utility, except for property acquired by lease which qualifies as capital lease property under General Instruction 19. *Criteria for Classifying Leases,* and is recorded in Account 101.1, Property under Capital Leases, or Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel under Capital Leases. Where the term *cost* is used in the detailed plant accounts, it shall have the meaning stated in this paragraph. 


B. When the consideration given for property is other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be determined on a cash basis (see, however, definition 9). In the entry recording such transition, the actual consideration shall be described with sufficient particularity to identify it. The utility shall be prepared to furnish the Commission the particulars of its determination of the cash value of the consideration if other than cash. 


C. When property is purchased under a plan involving deferred payments, no charge shall be made to the electric plant accounts for interest, insurance, or other expenditures occasioned solely by such form of payment. 


D. The electric plant accounts shall not include the cost or other value of electric plant contributed to the company. Contributions in the form of money or its equivalent toward the construction of electric plant shall be credited to accounts charged with the cost of such construction. Plant constructed from contributions of cash or its equivalent shall be shown as a reduction to gross plant constructed when assembling cost data in work orders for posting to plant ledgers of accounts. The accumulated gross costs of plant accumulated in the work order shall be recorded as a debit in the plant ledger of accounts along with the related amount of contributions concurrently be recorded as a credit. 


3. *Components of construction cost.*

A. For Major utilities, the cost of construction properly includible in the electric plant accounts shall include, where applicable, the direct and overhead cost as listed and defined hereunder:


(1) *Contract work* includes amounts paid for work performed under contract by other companies, firms, or individuals, costs incident to the award of such contracts, and the inspection of such work. 


(2) *Labor* includes the pay and expenses of employees of the utility engaged on construction work, and related workmen's compensation insurance, payroll taxes and similar items of expense. It does not include the pay and expenses of employees which are distributed to construction through clearing accounts nor the pay and expenses included in other items hereunder. 


(3) *Materials and supplies* includes the purchase price at the point of free delivery plus customs duties, excise taxes, the cost of inspection, loading and transportation, the related stores expenses, and the cost of fabricated materials from the utility's shop. In determining the cost of materials and supplies used for construction, proper allowance shall be made for unused materials and supplies, for materials recovered from temporary structures used in performing the work involved, and for discounts allowed and realized in the purchase of materials and supplies. 


(4) *Transportation* includes the cost of transporting employees, materials and supplies, tools, purchased equipment, and other work equipment (when not under own power) to and from points of construction. It includes amounts paid to others as well as the cost of operating the utility's own transportation equipment. (See item 5 following.) 


(5) *Special machine service* includes the cost of labor (optional), materials and supplies, depreciation, and other expenses incurred in the maintenance, operation and use of special machines, such as steam shovels, pile drivers, derricks, ditchers, scrapers, material unloaders, and other labor saving machines; also expenditures for rental, maintenance and operation of machines of others. It does not include the cost of small tools and other individual items of small value or short life which are included in the cost of materials and supplies. (See item 3, above.) When a particular construction job requires the use for an extended period of time of special machines, transportation or other equipment, the net book cost thereof, less the appraised or salvage value at time of release from the job, shall be included in the cost of construction. 


(6) *Shop service* includes the proportion of the expense of the utility's shop department assignable to construction work except that the cost of fabricated materials from the utility's shop shall be included in *materials and supplies.*

(7) *Protection* includes the cost of protecting the utility's property from fire or other casualties and the cost of preventing damages to others, or to the property of others, including payments for discovery or extinguishment of fires, cost of apprehending and prosecuting incendiaries, witness fees in relation thereto, amounts paid to municipalities and others for fire protection, and other analogous items of expenditures in connection with construction work. 


(8) *Injuries and damages* includes expenditures or losses in connection with construction work on account of injuries to persons and damages to the property of others; also the cost of investigation of and defense against actions for such injuries and damages. Insurance recovered or recoverable on account of compensation paid for injuries to persons incident to construction shall be credited to the account or accounts to which such compensation is charged Insurance recovered or recoverable on account of property damages incident to construction shall be credited to the account or accounts charged with the cost of the damages. 


(9) *Privileges and permits* includes payments for and expenses incurred in securing temporary privileges, permits or rights in connection with construction work, such as for the use of private or public property, streets, or highways, but it does not include rents, or amounts chargeable as franchises and consents for which see account 302, Franchises and Consents. 


(10) *Rents* includes amounts paid for the use of construction quarters and office space occupied by construction forces and amounts properly includible in construction costs for such facilities jointly used. 


(11) *Engineering and supervision* includes the portion of the pay and expenses of engineers, surveyors, draftsmen, inspectors, superintendents and their assistants applicable to construction work. 


(12) *General administration capitalized* includes the portion of the pay and expenses of the general officers and administrative and general expenses applicable to construction work. 


(13) *Engineering services* includes amounts paid to other companies, firms, or individuals engaged by the utility to plan, design, prepare estimates, supervise, inspect, or give general advice and assistance in connection with construction work. 


(14) *Insurance* includes premiums paid or amounts provided or reserved as self-insurance for the protection against loss and damages in connection with construction, by fire or other casualty injuries to or death of persons other than employees, damages to property of others, defalcation of employees and agents, and the nonperformance of contractual obligations of others. It does not include workmen's compensation or similar insurance on employees included as *labor* in item 2, above. 


(15) *Law expenditures* includes the general law expenditures incurred in connection with construction and the court and legal costs directly related thereto, other than law expenses included in protection, item 7, and in injuries and damages, item 8. 


(16) *Taxes* includes taxes on physical property (including land) during the period of construction and other taxes properly includible in construction costs before the facilities become available for service. 


(17) *Allowance for funds used during construction* (Major and Nonmajor Utilities) includes the net cost for the period of construction of borrowed funds used for construction purposes and a reasonable rate on other funds when so used, not to exceed, without prior approval of the Commission, allowances computed in accordance with the formula prescribed in paragraph (a) of this subparagraph. No allowance for funds used during construction charges shall be included in these accounts upon expenditures for construction projects which have been abandoned. 


(a) The formula and elements for the computation of the allowance for funds used during construction shall be:


(b) The rates shall be determined annually. The balances for long-term debt, preferred stock and common equity shall be the actual book balances as of the end of the prior year. The cost rates for long-term debt and preferred stock shall be the weighted average cost determined in the manner indicated in § 35.13 of the Commission's Regulations Under the Federal Power Act. The cost rate for common equity shall be the rate granted common equity in the last rate proceeding before the ratemaking body having primary rate jurisdictions. If such cost rate is not available, the average rate actually earned during the preceding three years shall be used. The short-term debt balances and related cost and the average balance for construction work in progress plus nuclear fuel in process of refinement, conversion, enrichment, and fabrication shall be estimated for the current year with appropriate adjustments as actual data becomes available. 


(18) *Earnings and expenses during construction.* The earnings and expenses during construction shall constitute a component of construction costs. 


(a) The earnings shall include revenues received or earned for power produced by generating plants during the construction period and sold or used by the utility. Where such power is sold to an independent purchaser before intermingling with power generated by other plants, the credit shall consist of the selling price of the energy. Where the power generated by a plant under construction is delivered to the utility's electric system for distribution and sale, or is delivered to an associated company, or is delivered to and used by the utility for purposes other than distribution and sale (for manufacturing or industrial use, for example), the credit shall be the fair value of the energy so delivered. The revenues shall also include rentals for lands, buildings etc., and miscellaneous receipts not properly includible in other accounts. 


(b) The expenses shall consist of the cost of operating the power plant, and other costs incident to the production and delivery of the power for which construction is credited under paragraph (a), above, including the cost of repairs and other expenses of operating and maintaining lands, buildings, and other property, and other miscellaneous and like expenses not properly includible in other accounts. 


(19) *Training costs* (Major and Nonmajor Utilities). When it is necessary that employees be trained to operate or maintain plant facilities that are being constructed and such facilities are not conventional in nature, or are new to the company's operations, these costs may be capitalized as a component of construction cost. Once plant is placed in service, the capitalization of training costs shall cease and subsequent training costs shall be expensed. (See Operating Expense Instruction 4.) 


(20) *Studies* includes the costs of studies such as nuclear operational, safety, or seismic studies or environmental studies mandated by regulatory bodies relative to plant under construction. Studies relative to facilities in service shall be charged to account 183, Preliminary Survey and Investigation Charges.


(21) *Asset retirement costs.* The costs recognized as a result of asset retirement obligations incurred during the construction and testing of utility plant shall constitute a component of construction costs. 


B. For Nonmajor utilities, the cost of construction of property chargeable to the electric plant accounts shall include, where applicable, the cost of labor; materials and supplies; transportation; work done by others for the utility; injuries and damages incurred in construction work; privileges and permits; special machine service; allowance for funds used during construction, not to exceed without prior approval of the Commission, amounts computed in accordance with the formula prescribed in paragraph (a) of paragraph (17) of this Instruction; training costs; and such portion of general engineering, administrative salaries and expenses, insurance, taxes, and other analogous items as may be properly includable in construction costs. (See Operating Expense Instruction 4.) The rates and balances of short and long-term debt, preferred stock, common equity and construction work in progress shall be determined as prescribed in paragraph (b) of paragraph (17) of this Instruction.


4. *Overhead Construction Costs.*

A. All overhead construction costs, such as engineering, supervision, general office salaries and expenses, construction engineering and supervision by others than the accounting utility, law expenses, insurance, injuries and damages, relief and pensions, taxes and interest, shall be charged to particular jobs or units on the basis of the amounts of such overheads reasonably applicable thereto, to the end that each job or unit shall bear its equitable proportion of such costs and that the entire cost of the unit, both direct and overhead, shall be deducted from the plant accounts at the time the property is retired. 


B. As far as practicable, the determination of pay roll charges includible in construction overheads shall be based on time card distributions thereof. Where this procedure is impractical, special studies shall be made periodically of the time of supervisory employees devoted to construction activities to the end that only such overhead costs as have a definite relation to construction shall be capitalized. The addition to direct construction costs of arbitrary percentages or amounts to cover assumed overhead costs is not permitted. 


C. For Major utilities, the records supporting the entries for overhead construction costs shall be so kept as to show the total amount of each overhead for each year, the nature and amount of each overhead expenditure charged to each construction work order and to each electric plant account, and the bases of distribution of such costs. 


5. *Electric Plant Purchased or Sold.*

A. When electric plant constituting an operating unit or system is acquired by purchase, merger, consolidation, liquidation, or otherwise, after the effective date of this system of accounts, the costs of acquisition, including expenses incidental thereto properly includible in electric plant, shall be charged to account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold. 


B. The accounting for the acquisition shall then be completed as follows: 


(1) The original cost of plant, estimated if not known, shall be credited to account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold, and concurrently charged to the appropriate electric plant in service accounts and to account 104, Electric Plant Leased to Others, account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, and account 107, Construction Work in Progress—Electric, as appropriate. 


(2) The depreciation and amortization applicable to the original cost of the properties purchased shall be charged to account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold, and concurrently credited to the appropriate account for accumulated provision for depreciation or amortization. 


(3) The cost to the utility of any property includible in account 121, Nonutility Property, shall be transferred thereto. 


(4) The amount remaining in account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold, shall then be closed to account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments. 


C. If property acquired in the purchase of an operating unit or system is in such physical condition when acquired that it is necessary substantially to rehabilitate it in order to bring the property up to the standards of the utility, the cost of such work, except replacements, shall be accounted for as a part of the purchase price of the property. 


D. When any property acquired as an operating unit or system includes duplicate or other plant which will be retired by the accounting utility in the reconstruction of the acquired property or its consolidation with previously owned property, the proposed accounting for such property shall be presented to the Commission. 


E. In connection with the acquisition of electric plant constituting an operating unit or system, the utility shall procure, if possible, all existing records relating to the property acquired, or certified copies thereof, and shall preserve such records in conformity with regulations or practices governing the preservation of records of its own construction. 


F. When electric plant constituting an operating unit or system is sold, conveyed, or transferred to another by sale, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, the book cost of the property sold or transferred to another shall be credited to the appropriate utility plant accounts, including amounts carried in account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments. The amounts (estimated if not known) carried with respect thereto in the accounts for accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization and in account 252, Customer Advances for Construction, shall be charged to such accounts and contra entries made to account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, the difference, if any, between (1) the net amount of debits and credits and (2) the consideration received for the property (less commissions and other expenses of making the sale) shall be included in account 421.1. Gain on Disposition of Property, or account 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property. (See account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold.) 


6. *Expenditures on Leased Property.*

A. The cost of substantial initial improvements (including repairs, rear-rangements, additions, and betterments) made in the course of preparing for utility service property leased for a period of more than one year, and the cost of subsequent substantial additions, replacements, or betterments to such property, shall be charged to the electric plant account appropriate for the class of property leased. If the service life of the improvements is terminable by action of the lease, the cost, less net salvage, of the improvements shall be spread over the life of the lease by charges to account 404, Amortization of Limited-Term Electric Plant. However, if the service life is not terminated by action of the lease but by depreciation proper, the cost of the improvements, less net salvage, shall be accounted for as depreciable plant. The provisions of this paragraph are applicable to property leased under either capital leases or operating leases. 


B. If improvements made to property leased for a period of more than one year are of relatively minor cost, or if the lease is for a period of not more than one year, the cost of the improvements shall be charged to the account in which the rent is included, either directly or by amortization thereof. 


7. *Land and Land Rights.*

A. The accounts for land and land rights shall include the cost of land owned in fee by the utility and rights. Interests, and privileges held by the utility in land owned by others, such as leaseholds, easements, water and water power rights, diversion rights, submersion rights, rights-of-way, and other like interests in land. Do not include in the accounts for land and land rights and rights-of-way costs incurred in connection with first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with the construction and installation of plant. Such costs shall be included in the appropriate plant accounts directly benefited. 


B. Where special assessments for public improvements provide for deferred payments, the full amount of the assessments shall be charged to the appropriate land account and the unpaid balance shall be carried in an appropriate liability account. Interest on unpaid balances shall be charged to the appropriate interest account. If any part of the cost of public improvements is included in the general tax levy, the amount thereof shall be charged to the appropriate tax account. 


C. The net profit from the sale of timber, cord wood, sand, gravel, other resources or other property acquired with the rights-of-way or other lands shall be credited to the appropriate plant account to which related. Where land is held for a considerable period of time and timber and other natural resources on the land at the time of purchase increases in value, the net profit (after giving effect to the cost of the natural resources) from the sales of timber or its products or other natural resources shall be credited to the appropriate utility operating income account when such land has been recorded in account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use or classified as plant in service, otherwise to account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income. 


D. Separate entries shall be made for the acquisition, transfer, or retirement of each parcel of land, and each land right (except rights of way for distribution lines), or water right, having a life of more than one year. A record shall be maintained showing the nature of ownership, full legal description, area, map reference, purpose for which used, city, county, and tax district on which situated, from whom purchased or to whom sold, payment given or received, other costs, contract date and number, date of recording of deed, and book and page of record. Entries transferring or retiring land or land rights shall refer to the original entry recording its acquisition. 


E. Any difference between the amount received from the sale of land or land rights, less agents' commissions and other costs incident to the sale, and the book cost of such land or rights, shall be included in account 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant, or 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant when such property has been recorded in account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, otherwise to account 421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property or 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property, as appropriate, unless a reserve therefor has been authorized and provided. Appropriate adjustments of the accounts shall be made with respect to any structures or improvements located on land sold. 


F. The cost of buildings and other improvements (other than public improvements) shall not be included in the land accounts. If at the time of acquisition of an interest in land such interest extends to buildings or other improvements (other than public improvements) which are then devoted to utility operations, the land and improvements shall be separately appraised and the cost allocated to land and buildings or improvements on the basis of the appraisals. If the improvements are removed or wrecked without being used in operations, the cost of removing or wrecking shall be charged and the salvage credited to the account in which the cost of the land is recorded. 


G. When the purchase of land for electric operations requires the purchase of more land than needed for such purposes, the charge to the specific land account shall be based upon the cost of the land purchased, less the fair market value of that portion of the land which is not to be used in utility operations. The portion of the cost measured by the fair market value of the land not to be used shall be included in account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, or account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate. 


H. Provisions shall be made for amortizing amounts carried in the accounts for limited-term interests in land so as to apportion equitably the cost of each interest over the life thereof. (For Major utilities, see account 111, Accumulated Provision for Amortization of Electric Plant Utility, and account 404, Amortization of Limited-Term Electric Plant. For Nonmajor utilities, see account 404.) 


I. The items of cost to be included in the accounts for land and land rights are as follows: 


8. *Structures and Improvements.*

A. The accounts for structures and improvements shall include the cost of all buildings and facilities to house, support, or safeguard property or persons, including all fixtures permanently attached to and made a part of buildings and which cannot be removed therefrom without cutting into the walls, ceilings, or floors, or without in some way impairing the buildings, and improvements of a permanent character on or to land. Also include those costs incurred in connection with the first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with construction and installation of plant. 


B. The cost of specially provided foundations not intended to outlast the machinery or apparatus for which provided, and the cost of angle irons, castings, etc., installed at the base of an item of equipment, shall be charged to the same account as the cost of the machinery, apparatus, or equipment. 


C. Minor buildings and structures, such as valve towers, patrolmen's towers, telephone stations, fish and wildlife, and recreation facilities, etc., which are used directly in connection with or form a part of a reservoir, dam, waterway, etc., shall be considered a part of the facility in connection with which constructed or operated and the cost thereof accounted for accordingly. 


D. Where furnaces and boilers are used primarily for furnishing steam for some particular department and only incidentally for furnishing steam for heating a building and operating the equipment therein, the entire cost of such furnaces and boilers shall be charged to the appropriate plant account, and no part to the building account. 


E. Where the structure of a dam forms also the foundation of the power plant building, such foundation shall be considered a part of the dam. 


F. The cost of disposing of materials excavated in connection with construction of structures shall be considered as a part of the cost of such work, except as follows: (a) When such material is used for filling, the cost of loading, hauling, and dumping shall be equitably apportioned between the work in connection with which the removal occurs and the work in connection with which the material is used; (b) when such material is sold, the net amount realized from such sales shall be credited to the work in connection with which the removal occurs. If the amount realized from the sale of excavated materials exceeds the removal costs and the costs in connection with the sale, the excess shall be credited to the land account in which the site is carried. 


G. Lighting or other fixtures temporarily attached to buildings for purposes of display or demonstration shall not be included in the cost of the building but in the appropriate equipment account. 


H. The items of cost to be included in the accounts for structures and improvements are as follows: 


9. *Equipment.*

A. The cost of equipment chargeable to the electric plant accounts, unless otherwise indicated in the text of an equipment account, includes the net purchase price thereof, sales taxes, investigation and inspection expenses necessary to such purchase, expenses of transportation when borne by the utility, labor employed, materials and supplies consumed, and expenses incurred by the utility in unloading and placing the equipment in readiness to operate. Also include those costs incurred in connection with the first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with construction and installation of plant. 


B. Exclude from equipment accounts hand and other portable tools, which are likely to be lost or stolen or which have relatively small value (for example, $500 or less) or short life, unless the correctness of the accounting therefor as electric plant is verified by current inventories. Special tools acquired and included in the purchase price of equipment shall be included in the appropriate plant account. Portable drills and similar tool equipment when used in connection with the operation and maintenance of a particular plant or department, such as production, transmission, distribution, etc., or in *stores,* shall be charged to the plant account appropriate for their use. 


C. The equipment accounts shall include angle irons and similar items which are installed at the base of an item of equipment, but piers and foundations which are designed to be as permanent as the buildings which house the equipment, or which are constructed as a part of the building and which cannot be removed without cutting into the walls, ceilings or floors or without in some way impairing the building, shall be included in the building accounts. 


D. The equipment accounts shall include the necessary costs of testing or running a plant or parts thereof during an experimental or test period prior to such plant becoming ready for or placed in service. In the case of Nonmajor utilities, the utility shall pay the fee prescribed in part 381 of this chapter and shall furnish the Commission with full particulars of and justification for any test or experimental run extending beyond a period of 30 days. In the case of Major utilities, the utility shall furnish the Commission with full particulars of and justification for any test or experimental run extending beyond a period of 120 days for nuclear plant, and a period of 90 days for all other plant. Such particulars shall include a detailed operational and downtime log showing days of production, gross kilowatts generated by hourly increments, types, and periods of outages by hours with explanation thereof, beginning with the first date the equipment was either tested or synchronized on the line to the end of the test period. 


E. The cost of efficiency or other tests made subsequent to the date equipment becomes available for service shall be charged to the appropriate expense accounts, except that tests to determine whether equipment meets the specifications and requirements as to efficiency, performance, etc., guaranteed by manufacturers, made after operations have commenced and within the period specified in the agreement or contract of purchase may be charged to the appropriate electric plant account. 


10. *Additions and Retirements of Electric Plant.*

A. For the purpose of avoiding undue refinement in accounting for additions to and retirements and replacements of electric plant, all property will be considered as consisting of (1) retirement units and (2) minor items of property. Each utility shall maintain a written property units listing for use in accounting for additions and retirements of electric plant and apply the listing consistently.


B. The addition and retirement of retirement units shall be accounted for as follows: 


(1) When a retirement unit is added to electric plant, the cost thereof shall be added to the appropriate electric plant account, except that when units are acquired in the acquisition of any electric plant constituting an operating system, they shall be accounted for as provided in electric plant instruction 5. 


(2) When a retirement unit is retired from electric plant, with or without replacement, the book cost thereof shall be credited to the electric plant account in which it is included, determined in the manner set forth in paragraph D, below. If the retirement unit is of a depreciable class, the book cost of the unit retired and credited to electric plant shall be charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation applicable to such property. The cost of removal and the salvage shall be charged or credited, as appropriate, to such depreciation account. 


C. The addition and retirement of minor items of property shall be accounted for as follows: 


(1) When a minor item of property which did not previously exist is added to plant, the cost thereof shall be accounted for in the same manner as for the addition of a retirement unit, as set forth in paragraph B(1), above, if a substantial addition results, otherwise the charge shall be to the appropriate maintenance expense account. 


(2) When a minor item of property is retired and not replaced, the book cost thereof shall be credited to the electric plant account in which it is included; and, in the event the minor item is a part of depreciable plant, the account for accumulated provision for depreciation shall be charged with the book cost and cost of removal and credited with the salvage. If, however, the book cost of the minor item retired and not replaced has been or will be accounted for by its inclusion in the retirement unit of which it is a part when such unit is retired, no separate credit to the property account is required when such minor item is retired. 


(3) When a minor item of depreciable property is replaced independently of the retirement unit of which it is a part, the cost of replacement shall be charged to the maintenance account appropriate for the item, except that if the replacement effects a substantial betterment (the primary aim of which is to make the property affected more useful, more efficient, of greater durability, or of greater capacity), the excess cost of the replacement over the estimated cost at current prices of replacing without betterment shall be charged to the appropriate electric plant account. 


D. The book cost of electric plant retired shall be the amount at which such property is included in the electric plant accounts, including all components of construction costs. The book cost shall be determined from the utility's records and if this cannot be done it shall be estimated. Utilities must furnish the particulars of such estimates to the Commission, if requested. When it is impracticable to determine the book cost of each unit, due to the relatively large number or small cost thereof, an appropriate average book cost of the units, with due allowance for any differences in size and character, shall be used as the book cost of the units retired.


E. The book cost of land retired shall be credited to the appropriate land account. If the land is sold, the difference between the book cost (less any accumulated provision for depreciation or amortization therefore which has been authorized and provided) and the sale price of the land (less commissions and other expenses of making the sale) shall be recorded in account 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant, or 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant when the property has been recorded in account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, otherwise to accounts 421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property or 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property, as appropriate. If the land is not used in utility service but is retained by the utility, the book cost shall be charged to account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, or account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate. 


F. The book cost less net salvage of depreciable electric plant retired shall be charged in its entirety to account 108. Accumulated Provision for Depreciation of Electric Plant in Service (Account 110, Accumulated Provision for Depreciation and Amortization of Electric Utility Plant, in the case of Nonmajor utilities). Any amounts which, by approval or order of the Commission, are charged to account 182.1, Extraordinary Property Losses, shall be credited to account 108 (Account 110 for Nonmajor utilities). 


G. In the case of Major utilities, the accounting for the retirement of amounts included in account 302, Franchises and Consents, and account 303, Miscellaneous Intangible Plant, and the items of limited-term interest in land included in the accounts for land and land rights, shall be as provided for in the text of account 111. Accumulated Provision for Amortization of Electric Plant in Service, account 404, Amortization of Limited-Term Electric Plant, and account 405, Amortization of Other Electric Plant. 


11. *Work Order and Property Record System Required.*

A. Each utility shall record all construction and retirements of electric plant by means of work orders or job orders. Separate work orders may be opened for additions to and retirements of electric plant or the retirements may be included with the construction work order, provided, however, that all items relating to the retirements shall be kept separate from those relating to construction and provided, further, that any maintenance costs involved in the work shall likewise be segregated. 


B. Each utility shall keep its work order system so as to show the nature of each addition to or retirement of electric plant, the total cost thereof, the source or sources of costs, and the electric plant account or accounts to which charged or credited. Work orders covering jobs of short duration may be cleared monthly. 


C. In the case of Major utilities, each utility shall maintain records in which, for each plant account, the amounts of the annual additions and retirements are classified so as to show the number and cost of the various record units or retirement units.


12. *Transfers of Property.*

When property is transferred from one electric plant account to another, from one utility department to another, such as from electric to gas, from one operating division or area to another, to or from accounts 101, Electric Plant in Service, 104. Electric Plant Leased to Others, 105. Electric Plant Held for Future Use, and 121, Nonutility Property, the transfer shall be recorded by transferring the original cost thereof from the one account, department, or location to the other. Any related amounts carried in the accounts for accumulated provision for depreciation or amortization shall be transferred in accordance with the segregation of such accounts. 


13. *Common Utility Plant.*

A. If the utility is engaged in more than one utility service, such as electric, gas, and water, and any of its utility plant is used in common for several utility services or for other purposes to such an extent and in such manner that it is impracticable to segregate it by utility services currently in the accounts, such property, with the approval of the Commission, may be designated and classified as *common utility plant.*

B. The book amount of utility plant designated as common plant shall be included in account 118, Other Utility Plant, and if applicable in part to the electric department, shall be segregated and accounted for in subaccounts as electric plant is accounted for in accounts 101 to 107, inclusive, and electric plant adjustments in account 116; any amounts classifiable as common plant acquisition adjustments or common plant adjustments shall be subject to disposition as provided in paragraphs C and B of accounts 114 and 116, respectively, for amounts classified in those accounts. The original cost of common utility plant in service shall be classified according to detailed utility plant accounts appropriate for the property. 


C. The utility shall be prepared to show at any time and to report to the Commission annually, or more frequently, if required, and by utility plant accounts (301 to 399) the following: (1) The book cost of common utility plant, (2) The allocation of such cost to the respective departments using the common utility plant, and (3) The basis of the allocation. 


D. The accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization of the utility shall be segregated so as to show the amount applicable to the property classified as common utility plant. 


E. The expenses of operation, maintenance, rents, depreciation and amortization of common utility plant shall be recorded in the accounts prescribed herein, but designated as common expenses, and the allocation of such expenses to the departments using the common utility plant shall be supported in such manner as to reflect readily the basis of allocation used. 


14. *Transmission and Distribution Plant.*

For the purpose of this system of accounts: 


A. *Transmission system* means: 


(1) All land, conversion structures, and equipment employed at a primary source of supply (i.e., generating station, or point of receipt in the case of purchased power) to change the voltage or frequency of electricity for the purpose of its more efficient or convenient transmission; 


(2) All land, structures, lines, switching and conversion stations, high tension apparatus, and their control and protective equipment between a generating or receiving point and the entrance to a distribution center or wholesale point; and 


(3) All lines and equipment whose primary purpose is to augment, integrate or tie together the sources of power supply 


B. *Distribution system* means all land, structures, conversion equipment, lines, line transformers, and other facilities employed between the primary source of supply (i.e., generating station, or point of receipt in the case of purchased power) and of delivery to customers, which are not includible in transmission system, as defined in paragraph A, whether or not such land, structures, and facilities are operated as part of a transmission system or as part of a distribution system. 


C. Where poles or towers support both transmission and distribution conductors, the poles, towers, anchors, guys, and rights of way shall be classified as transmission system. The conductors, crossarms, braces, grounds, tiewire, insulators, etc., shall be classified as transmission or distribution facilities, according to the purpose for which used. 


D. Where underground conduit contains both transmission and distribution conductors, the underground conduit and right of way shall be classified as distribution system. The conductors shall be classified as transmission or distribution facilities according to the purpose for which used. 


E. Land (other than rights of way) and structures used jointly for transmission and distribution purposes shall be classified as transmission or distribution according to the major use thereof. 


15. *Hydraulic production plant (Major Utilities).*

For the purpose of this system of accounts hydraulic production plant means all land and land rights, structures and improvements used in connection with hydraulic power generation, reservoirs dams and waterways, water wheels, turbines, generators, accessory electric equipment, miscellaneous powerplant equipment, roads, railroads, and bridges, and structures and improvements used in connection with fish and wildlife, and recreation. 


16. *Nuclear Fuel Records Required (Major Utilities).*

Each utility shall keep all the necessary records to support the entries to the various nuclear fuel plant accounts classified under “Assets and Other Debits,” Utility Plant 120.1 through 120.6, inclusive, account 518, Nuclear Fuel Expense and account 157, Nuclear Materials Held for Sale. These records shall be so kept as to readily furnish the basis of the computation of the net nuclear fuel costs. 


17. *Integrated computer hardware, software, and communication equipment.* Where computer hardware, software, and communication equipment is integrated as part of a larger retirement unit, it shall be recorded in the property account of the retirement unit purchased. This shall be done consistently with electric plant instruction 10. 

Operating Expense Instructions 


1. *Supervision and Engineering (Major Utilities).*

The supervision and engineering includible in the operating expense accounts shall consist of the pay and expenses of superintendents, engineers, clerks, other employees and consultants engaged in supervising and directing the operation and maintenance of each utility function. Wherever allocations are necessary in order to arrive at the amount to be included in any account, the method and basis of allocation shall be reflected by underlying records.




2. *Maintenance.*

A. The cost of maintenance chargeable to the various operating expense and clearing accounts includes labor, materials, overheads and other expenses incurred in maintenance work. A list of work operations applicable generally to utility plant is included hereunder. Other work operations applicable to specific classes of plant are listed in functional maintenance expense accounts. 


B. Materials recovered in connection with the maintenance of property shall be credited to the same account to which the maintenance cost was charged. 


C. If the book cost of any property is carried in account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold, the cost of maintaining such property shall be charged to the accounts for maintenance of property of the same class and use, the book cost of which is carried in other electric plant in service accounts.

If rents cover property used for more than one function, such as production and transmission, or by more than one department, the rents shall be apportioned to the appropriate rent expense or clearing accounts of each department on an actual, or, if necessary, an estimated basis. 


B. When a portion of property or equipment rented from others for use in connection with utility operations is subleased, the revenue derived from such subleasing shall be credited to the rent revenue account in operating revenues; provided, however, that in case the rent was charged to a clearing account, amounts received from subleasing the property shall be credited to such clearing account. 


C. The cost, when incurred by the lessee, of operating and maintaining leased property, shall be charged to the accounts appropriate for the expense if the property were owned. 


D. The cost incurred by the lessee of additions and replacements to electric plant leased from others shall be accounted for as provided in electric plant instruction 6. 


4. *Training Costs.*

When it is necessary that employees be trained to specifically operate or maintain plant facilities that are being constructed, the related costs shall be accounted for as a current operating and maintenance expense. These expenses shall be charged to the appropriate functional accounts currently as they are incurred. However, when the training costs involved relate to facilities which are not conventional in nature, or are new to the company's operations, then see Electric Plant Instruction 3(19), for accounting. 


A. This account shall include the original cost of electric plant, included in accounts 301 to 399, prescribed herein, owned and used by the utility in its electric utility operations, and having an expectation of life in service of more than one year from date of installation, including such property owned by the utility but held by nominees. (See also account 106 for unclassified construction costs of completed plant actually in service.) 


B. The cost of additions to and betterments of property leased from others, which are includible in this account, shall be recorded in subdivisions separate and distinct from those relating to owned property. (See electric plant instruction 6.)

A. This account shall include the cost of electric plant which was constructed as a research, development, and demonstration plant under the provisions of paragraph C, Account 107, Construction Work in Progress—Electric, and due to the nature of the plant it is desirous to operate it for a period of time in an experimental status. 


B. Amounts in this account shall be transferred to Account 101, Electric Plant in Service, or Account 121, Nonutility Property as appropriate when the project is no longer considered as experimental. 


C. The depreciation on plant in this account shall be charged to account 403, Depreciation expense, and account 403.1, Depreciation expense for asset retirement costs, as appropriate, and credited to account 108, Accumulated provision for depreciation of electric utility plant (Major only). The amounts herein shall be depreciated over a period which corresponds to the estimated useful life of the relevant project considering the characteristics involved. However, when projects are transferred to account 101, Electric plant in service, a new depreciation rate based on the remaining service life and undepreciated amounts, will be established. 


D. Records shall be maintained with respect to each unit of experiment so that full details may be obtained as to the cost, depreciation and the experimental status. 


E. Should it be determined that experimental plant recorded in this account will fail to satisfactorily perform its function, the costs thereof shall be accounted for as directed or authorized by the Commission. 

103.1 Electric plant in process of reclassification (Nonmajor only). 


A. This account shall include temporarily the balance of electric plant as of the effective date of the prior system of accounts, which has not yet been reclassified as of the effective date of this system of accounts. The detail or primary accounts in support of this account employed prior to such date shall be continued pending reclassification into the electric plant accounts herein prescribed (301-399), but shall not be used for additions, betterments, or new construction. 


B. No charges other than as provided in paragraph A, above, shall be made to this account, but retirements of such unclassified electric plant shall be credited hereto and to the supporting (old) fixed capital accounts until the reclassification shall have been accomplished. 

104 Electric plant leased to others. 


A. This account shall include the original cost of electric plant owned by the utility, but leased to others as operating units or systems, where the lessee has exclusive possession. 


B. The property included in this account shall be classified according to the detailed accounts (301 to 399) prescribed for electric plant in service and this account shall be maintained in such detail as though the property were used by the owner in its utility operations. 

105 Electric plant held for future use.


A. This account shall include the original cost of electric plant (except land and land rights) owned and held for future use in electric service under a definite plan for such use, to include: (1) Property acquired (except land and land rights) but never used by the utility in electric service, but held for such service in the future under a definite plan, and (2) property (except land and land rights) previously used by the utility in service, but retired from such service and held pending its reuse in the future, under a definite plan, in electric service. 


B. This account shall also include the original cost of land and land rights owned and held for future use in electric service under a plan for such use, to include land and land rights: (1) Acquired but never used by the utility in electric service, but held for such service in the future under a plan, and (2) previously held by the utility in service, but retired from such service and held pending its reuse in the future under a plan, in electric service. (See Electric Plant Instruction 7.) 


C. In the event that property recorded in this account shall no longer be needed or appropriate for future utility operations, the company shall request Commission approval of journal entries to remove such property from this account when the gain realized from the sale or other disposition of the property is $100,000 or more, prior to their being recorded. Such filings shall include the description and original cost of individual properties removed from this account, the accounts charged upon removal, and any associated gains realized upon disposition of such property.

If the work is abandoned, the charge shall be to account 426.5, Other Deductions, or to the appropriate operating expense accounts.


(2) Undistributed balances in clearing accounts at the date of the balance sheet. Balances in clearing accounts shall be substantially cleared not later than the end of the calendar year unless items held therein related to a future period.


(3) Balances representing expenditures for work in progress other than on utility plant. This includes jobbing and contract work in progress.


(4) Other debit balances, the proper final disposition of which is uncertain and unusual or extraordinary expenses not included in other accounts, which are in process of being written off.

C. In certain instances a company may incur large and significant research, development, and demonstration expenditures which are nonrecurring and which would distort the annual research, development, and demonstration charges for the period. In such a case the portion of such amounts that cause the distortion may be amortized to the appropriate operating expense account over a period not to exceed 5 years unless otherwise authorized by the Commission.
