# § 152.1   Exemption applications and blanket certificates.

(a) Application for exemption from the provisions of the Natural Gas Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission issued pursuant thereto may be made by any person as defined in the Natural Gas Act engaged in, or authorized to engage in the transportation in interstate commerce or the sale in interstate commerce for resale, of natural gas received by such applicant from another person within or at the boundary of a State, if all of the natural gas so received is ultimately consumed in such State: *Provided,* That the natural-gas rates (including rates for sales for resale) and service of the applicant and its natural-gas facilities are subject to regulation by a State Commission, as defined in the Natural Gas Act, and that such State Commission is exercising that jurisdiction. 


(b)(1)(i) For purposes of the Commission's regulations implementing the Natural Gas Act, “vehicular natural gas” or “VNG” means natural gas that will be used, in either a gaseous or liquefied state, as fuel in any self-propelled vehicle.


(ii) For purposes of the Commission's regulations implementing the Natural Gas Act, vehicular natural gas, or VNG, is deemed to be ultimately consumed in the state in which the gas is physically delivered into the vehicle's fuel tank regardless of whether the tank is attached to the vehicle at the time it is filled.


(2)(i) Blanket certificates of public convenience and necessity are issued pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act to all persons that engage in sales for resale of VNG that are subject to the Commission's authority under section 1(b) of the NGA, such authorization to be effective upon that person's engagement in the jurisdictional sale. A blanket certificate issued under this paragraph (b)(2)(i) is a certificate of limited jurisdiction which will not subject the certificate holder to any other regulation under the Natural Gas Act jurisdiction of the Commission by virtue of transactions under the certificate. Such certificate will not impair the continued validity of any Natural Gas Act exemption from Commission jurisdiction.


(ii) A blanket certificate issued under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section authorizes the holder to make sales of VNG for resale in interstate commerce at market rates.


(iii) Abandonment of the sales service authorized in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is authorized pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act upon the expiration of the contractual term or upon termination of each individual sales arrangement.
