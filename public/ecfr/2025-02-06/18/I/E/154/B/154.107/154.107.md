# § 154.107   Currently effective rates.

(a) This section of the tariff must present the currently effective rates and charges under each rate schedule. 


(b) All rates must be stated clearly in cents or dollars and cents per thermal unit. The unit of measure must be stated for each component of a rate. 


(c) A rate having more than one part must have each component set out separately under appropriate headings (e.g., “Reservation Charge,” “Usage Charge.”) 


(d) Where a component of a rate is adjusted pursuant to a mechanism approved under subpart E of this part, the adjustment must be stated in a separate column on the rate sheet or section. 


(e) Exception to paragraph (d) of this section. Where the rate component is an Annual Charge Adjustment surcharge approved by the Commission, the adjustment or surcharge may be stated in a footnote on the rate sheet or section. 


(f) A total rate, indicating the sum of the rate components under paragraph (c) of this section plus the adjustments under paragraph (d) of this section, must be shown in the last column at the end of a line for a rate, so that a reader can readily determine the separate components comprising the total rate for a service.
