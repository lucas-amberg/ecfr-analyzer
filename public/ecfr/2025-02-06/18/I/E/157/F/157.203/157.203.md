# § 157.203   Blanket certification.

(a) *Effect.* A blanket certificate issued pursuant to this subpart authorizes the certificate holder, in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, to engage in any of the activities specified in § 157.208 through § 157.218 (as may be amended from time to time).


(b) *Automatic authorization.* A blanket certificate issued pursuant to this subpart authorizes the certificate holder to engage in transactions described in § 157.208(a), § 157.209(a), § 157.211(a)(1), § 157.213(a), § 157.215, § 157.216(a), or § 157.218 without further Commission approval.


(c) *Prior notice required.* A blanket certificate issued pursuant to this subpart authorizes the certificate holder to engage in activities described in § 157.208(b), § 157.210,§ 157.211(a)(2), § 157.212, § 157.213(b), § 157.214, or § 157.216(b), if the requirements of § 157.205 have been fulfilled.


(d) *Landowner notification.* (1) Except as identified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, no activity described in paragraph (b) of this section is authorized unless the company makes a good faith effort to notify, in writing all affected landowners, as defined in § 157.6(d)(2), at least 45 days prior to commencing construction or at the time it initiates easement negotiations, whichever is earlier. A landowner may waive the 45-day prior notice requirement in writing as long as the notice has been provided. For activity required to restore service in an emergency, the 45-day prior notice period is satisfied in the event a company obtains all necessary easements. The notification shall include at least: 


(i) A brief description of the facilities to be constructed or replaced and the effect the construction activity will have on the landowner's property;


(ii) The name and phone number of a company representative who is knowledgeable about the project;


(iii) A description of the company's environmental complaint resolution procedure that must:


(A) Provide landowners with clear and simple directions for identifying and resolving their environmental mitigation problems and concerns during construction of the project and restoration of the right-of way;


(B) Provide a local or toll-free phone number and a name of a specific person to be contacted by landowners and with responsibility for responding to landowner problems and concerns, and who will indicate when a landowner should expect a response;


(C) Instruct landowners that if they are not satisfied with the response, they may call the company's Hotline; and


(D) Instruct landowners that, if they are still not satisfied with the response, they may contact the Commission's Landowner Helpline at the current telephone number and email address, which is to be provided in the notification.


(2) For activities described in paragraph (c) of this section, the company shall make a good faith effort to notify in writing all affected landowners, as defined in § 157.6(d)(2), within at least three business days following the date that a docket number is assigned to the application or at the time it initiates easement negotiations, whichever is earlier. The notice should include at least: 


(i) A brief description of the company and the proposed project, including the facilities to be constructed or replaced and the location (including a general location map), the purpose, and the timing of the project and the effect the construction activity will have on the landowner's property;


(ii) A general description of what the company will need from the landowner if the project is approved, and how the landowner may contact the company, including a local or toll-free phone number and a name of a specific person to contact who is knowledgeable about the project; 


(iii) The docket number (if assigned) for the company's application;


(iv) A general description of the blanket certificate program and procedures, as posted on the Commission's Web site at the time the landowner notification is prepared, and the link to the information on the Commission's Web site;


(v) A brief summary of the rights the landowner has in Commission proceedings and in proceedings under the relevant eminent domain rules; and 


(vi) The following paragraph: This project is being proposed under the prior notice requirements of the blanket certificate program administered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Under the Commission's regulations, you have the right to protest this project within 60 days of the date the Commission issues a notice of the pipeline's filing. If you file a protest, you should include the docket number listed in this letter and provide the specific reasons for your protest. The protest should be mailed to the Secretary of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First St., NE., Room 1A, Washington, DC 20426. A copy of the protest should be mailed to the pipeline at [pipeline address]. If you have any questions concerning these procedures you can call the Commission's Office of External Affairs at (202) 208-1088; and


(vii) The description of the company's environmental complaint resolution procedure as described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.


(3) *Exceptions.* (i) No landowner notice is required for replacements which would have been done under § 2.55 of this chapter but for the fact that the replacement facilities are not of the same capacity as long as they meet the location requirements of § 2.55(b)(1)(ii) of this chapter and do not cause any ground disturbance; or any replacement done for safety, DOT compliance, environmental, or unplanned maintenance reasons that are not foreseen and that require immediate attention by the certificate holder.


(ii) No landowner notice is required for abandonments which involve only the sale or transfer of the facilities, and the easement will continue to be used for transportation of natural gas.


(iii) No landowner notice is required if there is only one landowner and that landowner has requested the service or facilities. 


(iv) No landowner notice is required for activities that do not involve ground disturbance or changes to operational air and noise emissions. 


(4) If paragraphs (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section require an applicant to reveal Critical Energy Infrastructure Information (CEII), as defined by § 388.113(c) of this chapter, to any person, the applicant shall follow the procedures set out in § 157.10(d).
