3. *Actually outstanding,* as applied to securities issued or assumed by the utility, means those which have been actually issued and are neither retired nor held by or for the utility; provided, however, that securities held by trustees shall be considered as actually outstanding. 


4. *Amortization* means the gradual extinguishment of an amount in an account by distributing such amount over a fixed period, over the life of the asset or liability to which it applies, or over the period during which it is anticipated the benefit will be realized. 


5. A. *Associated (affiliated) companies* means companies or persons that directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control, or are controlled by, or are under common control with the accounting company. 


B. *Control* (including the terms “controlling,” “controlled by,” and “under common control with”) means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company, whether such power is exercised through one or more intermediary companies, or alone, or in conjunction with, or pursuant to an agreement, and whether such power is established through a majority or minority ownership or voting of securities, common directors, officers, or stockholders, voting trusts, holding trusts, associated companies, contract or any other direct or indirect means.

(4) The plant control account to which the costs are charged. 


9. *Cost* means the amount of money actually paid for property or services. When the consideration given is other than cash in a purchase and sale transaction, as distinguished from a transaction involving the issuance of common stock in a merger or a pooling of interest, the value of such consideration shall be determined on a cash basis. 


10. *Cost of removal* means the cost of demolishing, dismantling, tearing down or otherwise removing gas plant, including the cost of transportation and handling incidental thereto. It does not include the cost of removal activities associated with asset retirement obligations that are capitalized as part of the tangible long-lived assets that give rise to the obligation.

19. *Lease, operating* means a lease of property used in utility or non-utility operations, which does not meet any of the criteria stated in General Instruction 19. 


20. *Minor items of property* means the associated parts or items of which retirement units are composed. 


21. *Natural gas* means either natural gas unmixed, or any mixture of natural and artificial gas. 


22. *Natural gas company* means a person engaged in the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, or the sale in interstate commerce of such gas for resale. 


23. *Net salvage value* means the salvage value of property retired less the cost of removal. 


24. *Nominally issued,* as applied to securities issued or assumed by the utility, means those which have been signed, certified, or otherwise executed, and placed with the proper officer for sale and delivery, or pledged, or otherwise placed in some special fund of the utility, but which have not been sold, or issued direct to trustees of sinking funds in accordance with contractual requirements. 


25. *Nominally outstanding,* as applied to securities issued or assumed by the utility, means those which, after being actually issued, have been reacquired by or for the utility under circumstances which require them to be considered as held alive and not retired, provided, however, that securities held by trustees shall be considered as actually outstanding. 


26. *Original cost,* as applied to gas plant, means the cost of such property to the person first devoting it to public service. 


27. *Person* means an individual, a corporation, a partnership, an association, a joint stock company, a business trust, or any organized group of persons, whether incorporated or not, or any receiver or trustee. 


28. *Premium,* as applied to securities issued or assumed by the utility, means the excess of the cash value of the consideration received from their sale over the sum of their par (stated value of no-par stocks) or face value and interest or dividends accrued at the date of sale. 


29. *Production, transmission, and distribution plant.* For the purposes of this system of accounts: 


A. *Production system* shall consist of plant and equipment used in the production of gas. It shall include producing lands and leaseholds, gas rights, other land rights, structures, drilling and clearing equipment, gas wells, well head equipment, separation and other facilities used in the production of natural gas. The production system ends where the gas enters a gathering system, transmission system or distribution system, as applicable, in accordance with the practices in the pricing area where such system is located. 


B. *Transmission system* means the land, structures, mains, valves, meters, boosters, regulators, tanks, compressors, and their driving units and appurtenances, and other equipment used primarily for transmitting gas from a production plant, delivery point of purchased gas, gathering system, storage area, or other wholesale source of gas, to one or more distribution areas. The transmission system begins at the outlet side of the valve at the connection to the last equipment in a manufactured gas plant, the connection to gathering lines or delivery point of purchased gas, and includes the equipment at such connection that is used to bring the gas to transmission pressure, and ends at the outlet side of the equipment which meters or regulates the entry of gas into the distribution system or into a storage area. It does not include storage land, structures or equipment. Pipeline companies, including those companies which measure deliveries of gas to their own distribution systems, shall include city gate and main line industrial measuring and regulating stations in the transmission function. 


C. *Distribution system* means the mains which are provided primarily for distributing gas within a distribution area, together with land, structures, valves, regulators, services and measuring devices, including the mains for transportation of gas from production plants or points of receipt located within such distribution area to other points therein. The distribution system owned by companies having no transmission facilities connected to such distribution system begins at the inlet side of the distribution system equipment which meters or regulates the entry of gas into the distribution system and ends with and includes property on the customer's premises. For companies which own both transmission and distribution facilities on a continuous line, the distribution system begins at the outlet side of the equipment which meters or regulates the entry of gas into the distribution system and ends with and includes property on the customer's premises. The distribution system does not include storage land, structures, or equipment. 


D. *Distribution area* means a metropolitan area or other urban area comprising one or more adjacent or nearby cities, villages or unincorporated areas, including developed areas contiguous to main highways. 


30. *Property retired,* as applied to gas plant, means property which has been removed, sold, abandoned, destroyed, or which for any cause has been withdrawn from service. 


31. *Regulatory Assets and Liabilities* are assets and liabilities that result from rate actions of regulatory agencies. Regulatory assets and liabilities arise from specific revenues, expenses, gains, or losses that would have been included in net income determinations in one period under the general requirements of the Uniform System of Accounts but for it being probable: 1) that such items will be included in a different period(s) for purposes of developing the rates the utility is authorized to charge for its utility services; or 2) in the case of regulatory liabilities, that refunds to customers, not provided for in other accounts, will be required.


32. A. *Replacing* or *replacement,* when not otherwise indicated in the context, means the construction or installation of gas plant in place of property retired, together with the removal of the property retired. 


B. *Research, Development, and Demonstration* (RD&D), means expenditures incurred by natural gas companies either directly or through another person or organization (such as research institute, industry association, foundation, university, engineering company, or similar contractor) in pursuing research, development, and demonstration activities including experiment, design, installation, construction, or operation. This definition includes expenditures for the implementation or development of new and/or existing concepts until technically feasible and commercially feasible operations are verified. Such research, development, and demonstration costs should be reasonably related to the existing or future utility business, broadly defined, of the public utility or licensee or in the environment in which it operates or expects to operate. The term includes, but is not limited to: All such costs incidental to the design, development or implementation of an experimental facility, a plant process, a product, a formula, an invention, a system or similar items, and the improvement of already existing items of a like nature; amounts expended in connection with the proposed development and/or proposed delivery of substitute or synthetic gas supplies (alternate fuel sources for example, an experimental coal gasification plant or an experimental plant synthetically producing gas from liquid hydrocarbons); and the costs of obtaining its own patent, such as attorney's fees expended in making and perfecting a patent application. The term includes preliminary investigations and detailed planning of specific projects for securing for customers non-conventional pipeline gas supplies that rely on technology that has not been verified previously to be feasible. The term does not include expenditures for efficiency surveys; studies of management, management techniques and organization; consumer surveys, advertising, promotions, or items of a like nature. 


33. *Retained earnings* (formerly earned surplus) means the accumulated net income of the utility less distribution to stockholders and transfers to other capital accounts. 


34. *Retirement units* means those items of gas plant which, when retired, with or without replacement, are accounted for by crediting the book cost thereof to the gas plant account in which included. 


35. *Salvage value* means the amount received for property retired, less any expenses incurred in connection with the sale or in preparing the property for sale; or, if retained, the amount at which the material recoverable is chargeable to Materials and Supplies, or other appropriate account. 


36. *Service life* means the time between the date gas plant is includible in gas plant in service, or gas plant leased to others, and the date of its retirement. If depreciation is accounted for on a production basis rather than on a time basis, then service life should be measured in terms of the appropriate unit of production. 


37. *Service value* means the difference between original cost and net salvage value of gas plant. 


38. *Unsuccessful exploration and development costs,* means exploration and development costs related to efforts which do not directly result in the discovery of commercially recoverable hydrocarbon reserves. 


39. *Subsidiary company,* means a company which is controlled by the utility through ownership of voting stock. (See “Definitions”—item 5B “Control”). A corporate joint venture in which a corporation is owned by a small group of businesses as a separate and specific business or project for the mutual benefit of the members of the group is a subsidiary company for the purposes of this system of accounts. 


40. *Utility,* as used herein and when not otherwise indicated in the context, means any natural gas company to which this system of accounts is applicable. 


1. *Applicability.* Each natural gas company must apply the system of accounts prescribed by the Commission.


*Major* —Each natural gas company as defined in the Natural Gas Act, whose combined gas sold for resale and gas transported or stored for a fee exceeds 50 million Mcf at 14.73 psi (60 °F) in each of the three previous calendar years.


*Nonmajor*—Natural gas companies that are not classified as a “major company” (as defined above), and had total gas sales or volume transactions exceeding 200,000 Mcf at 14.73 psi (60 °F) in each of the three previous calendar years.


B. This system applies to both Major and Nonmajor natural gas companies. Provisions have been incorporated into this system for those entities which prior to January 1, 1984, were applying the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts Prescribed for Class C and Class D (part 104 of this chapter) now revoked. The notations “(Nonmajor)” and “(Major)” have been used to indicate those instructions and accounts from the previous systems and classifications, which by definition, are not interchangeable without causing a loss of detail for the *Major* (previous Class A and Class B) or an increase in detail burden for the *Nonmajor* (previous Class C and Class D).


C. The class to which any natural gas company belongs shall originally be determined by its annual gas volume in each of the last three consecutive years, or, in the case of a newly established entity, the projected data shall be the basis. Subsequent changes in classification shall be made when the volume for each of the three immediately preceding years exceeds the upper limit, or is less than the lower limit of the classification previously applicable to the natural gas company.


D. Any utility may, at its option, adopt the system of accounts prescribed by the Commission for any larger class of utilities.


2. *Records.* A. Each utility shall keep its books of account, and all other books, records, and memoranda which support the entries in such books of account so as to be able to furnish readily full information as to any item included in any account. Each entry shall be supported by such detailed information as will permit ready identification, analysis, and verification of all facts relevant thereto. 


B. The books and records referred to herein include not only accounting records in a limited technical sense, but all other records, such as minute books, stock books, reports, correspondence, memoranda, etc., which may be useful in developing the history of or facts regarding any transaction. 


C. No utility shall destroy any such books or records unless the destruction thereof is permitted by rules and regulations of the Commission. 


D. In addition to prescribed accounts, clearing accounts, temporary or experimental accounts, and subdivisions of any accounts, may be kept, provided the integrity of the prescribed accounts is not impaired. 


E. All amounts included in the accounts prescribed herein for gas plant and operating expenses shall be just and reasonable and any payments or accruals by the utility in excess of just and reasonable charges shall be included in account 426.5, Other Deductions. 


F. The arrangement or sequence of the accounts prescribed herein shall not be controlling as to the arrangement or sequence in report forms which may be prescribed by the Commission. 


3. *Numbering system.* A. The account numbering plan used herein consists of a system of three-digit whole numbers as follows: 


B. In certain instances, numbers have been skipped in order to allow for possible later expansion or to permit better coordination with the numbering system for other utility departments. 


C. The numbers prefixed to account titles are to be considered as part of the titles. Each utility, however, may adopt for its own purposes a different system of account numbers (See also general instruction 2D) provided that the numbers herein prescribed shall appear in the descriptive headings of the ledger accounts and in the various sources of original entry; however, if a utility uses a different group of account numbers and it is not practicable to show the prescribed account numbers in the various sources of original entry, such reference to the prescribed account numbers may be omitted from the various sources of original entry. Moreover, each utility using different account numbers for its own purposes shall keep readily available a list of such account numbers which it uses and a reconciliation of such account numbers with the account numbers provided herein. It is intended that the utility's records shall be so kept as to permit ready analysis by prescribed accounts (by direct reference to sources of original entry to the extent practicable) and to permit preparation of financial and operating statements directly from such records at the end of each accounting period according to the prescribed accounts. 


4. *Accounting period.* Each utility shall keep its books on a monthly basis so that for each month all transactions applicable thereto, as nearly as may be ascertained, shall be entered in the books of the utility. Amounts applicable or assignable to specific utility departments shall be so segregated monthly. Each utility shall close its books at the end of each calendar year unless otherwise authorized by the Commission. 


5. *Submittal of questions.* To maintain uniformity of accounting, utilities shall submit questions of doubtful interpretation to the Commission for consideration and decision. 


6. *Item lists.* Lists of “items” appearing in the texts of the accounts or elsewhere herein are for the purpose of more clearly indicating the application of the prescribed accounting. The lists are intended to be representative, but not exhaustive. The appearance of an item in a list warrants the inclusion of the item in the account mentioned only when the text of the account also indicates inclusion inasmuch as the same item frequently appears in more than one list. The proper entry in each instance must be determined by the texts of the accounts. 


7. *Extraordinary items.* It is the intent that net income shall reflect all items of profit and loss during the period with the exception of prior period adjustments as described in paragraph 7.1 and long-term debt as described in paragraph 17 below. Those items related to the effects of events and transactions which have occurred during the current period and which are of unusual nature and infrequent occurrence shall be considered extraordinary items. Accordingly, they will be events and transactions of significant effect which are abnormal and significantly different from the ordinary and typical activities of the company, and which would not reasonably be expected to recur in the foreseeable future. (In determining significance, items should be considered individually and not in the aggregate. However, the effects of a series of related transactions arising from a single specific and identifiable event or plan of action should be considered in the aggregate.) To be considered as extraordinary under the above guidelines, an item should be more than approximately 5 percent of income, computed before extraordinary items. Commission approval must be obtained to treat an item of less than 5 percent, as extraordinary. (See accounts 434 and 435.) 


*7.1 Prior period items.* A. Items of profit and loss related to the following shall be accounted for as prior period adjustments and excluded from the determination of net income for the current year.


(1) Correction of an error in the financial statements of a prior year.


(2) Adjustments that result from realization of income tax benefits of pre-acquisition operating loss carryforwards of purchased subsidiaries.


B. All other items of profit and loss recognized during the year shall be included in the determination of net income for that year.


8. *Unaudited items.* Whenever a financial statement is required by the Commission, if it is known that a transaction has occurred which affects the accounts but the amount involved in the transaction and its effect upon the accounts cannot be determined with absolute accuracy, the amount shall be estimated and such estimated amount included in the proper accounts. The utility is not required to anticipate minor items which would not appreciably affect the accounts. 


9. *Distribution of pay and expenses of employees.* The charges to gas plant, operating expense and other accounts for services and expenses of employees engaged in activities chargeable to various accounts, such as construction, maintenance, and operations, shall be based upon the actual time engaged in the respective classes of work, or in case that method is impracticable, upon the basis of a study of the time actually engaged during a representative period. 


10. *Payroll distribution.* Underlying accounting data shall be maintained so that the distribution of the cost of labor charged direct to the various accounts will be readily available. Such underlying data shall permit a reasonably accurate distribution to be made of the cost of labor charged initially to clearing accounts so that the total labor cost may be classified among construction, cost of removal, gas operating functions (manufactured gas production, natural gas production and gathering, products extraction, underground storage, transmission, distribution, etc.), and nonutility operations. 


11. *Accounting to be on accrual basis.* A. The utility is required to keep its accounts on the accrual basis. This requires the inclusion in its accounts of all known transactions of appreciable amount which affect the accounts. If bills covering such transactions have not been received or rendered, the amounts shall be estimated and appropriate adjustments made when the bills are received.


B. When payments are made in advance for items such as insurance, rents, taxes or interest, the amount applicable to future periods shall be charged to account 165, Prepayments, and spread over the periods to which applicable by credits to account 165, and charges to the accounts appropriate for the expenditure.


12. *Records for each plant.* A. Separate records shall be maintained by gas plant accounts of the book cost of each plant owned, including additions by the utility to plant leased from others, and of the cost of operating and maintaining each plant owned or operated. The term “plant,” as here used, means each manufactured gas production plant, the wells and gathering lines of each distinct production area, each system of interconnected transmission mains, each system of wells and lines of an underground storage project, each large purification or dehydration plant, each compressor station, other than a distribution compressor station, and each products extraction plant. 


B. A natural gas company may, with the approval of the Commission, group certain of its systems of gathering lines and wells, small compressor stations, systems of underground storage lines and wells, and systems of interconnected transmission mains for the purpose of complying with the portion of this instruction requiring a segregation of the cost of operating and maintaining each plant. 


13. *Accounting for other departments.* If the utility also operates other utility departments, such as electric, water, etc., it shall keep such accounts for the other departments as may be prescribed by proper authority and in the absence of prescribed accounts, it shall keep such accounts as are proper or necessary to reflect the results of operating each such department. It is not intended that proprietary and similar accounts which apply to the utility as a whole shall be departmentalized. 


14. *Transactions with associated companies.* Each utility shall keep its accounts and records so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously statements of all transactions with associated companies. The statements may be required to show the general nature of the transactions, the amounts involved therein and the amounts included in each account prescribed herein with respect to such transactions. Transactions with associated companies shall be recorded in the appropriate accounts for transactions of the same nature. Nothing herein contained, however, shall be construed as restraining the utility from subdividing accounts for the purpose of recording separately transactions with associated companies. 


15. *Contingent assets and liabilities.* Contingent assets represent a possible source of value to the utility contingent upon the fulfillment of conditions regarded as uncertain. Contingent liabilities include items which may under certain conditions become obligations of the utility but which are neither direct nor assumed liabilities at the date of the balance sheet. The utility shall be prepared to give a complete statement of significant contingent assets and liabilities (including cumulative dividends on preference stock) in its annual report and at such other times as may be requested by the Commission. 


16. [Reserved]


17. *Long-term debt: Premium, discount and expense, and gain or loss on reacquisition*— A. *Premium, discount and expense.* A separate premium, discount and expense account shall be maintained for each class and series of long-term debt (including receivers' certificates) issued or assumed by the utility. The premium will be recorded in account 225, Unamortized Premium on Long-Term Debt, the discount will be recorded in account 226, Unamortized Discount on Long-Term Debt—Debit, and the expense of issuance shall be recorded in account 181, Unamortized Debt Expense. 


The premium, discount and expense shall be amortized over the life of the respective issues under a plan which will distribute the amounts equitably over the life of the securities. The amortization shall be on a monthly basis, and amounts thereof relating to discount and expense shall be charged to account 428, Amortization of Debt Discount and Expense. The amounts relating to premium shall be credited to account 429, Amortization of Premium on Debt—Credit. 


B. *Reacquisition, without refunding.* When long-term debt is reacquired or redeemed without being converted into another form of long-term debt and when the transaction is not in connection with a refunding operation (primarily redemptions for sinking fund purposes), the difference between the amount paid upon reacquisition and the face value; plus any un- amortized premium less any related unamortized debt expense and reacquisition costs; or less any unamortized discount, related debt expense and reacquisition costs applicable to the debt redeemed, retired and canceled, shall be included in account 189, Unamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt, or account 257, Unamortized Gain on Reacquired Debt, as appropriate. The utility shall amortize the recorded amounts equally on a monthly basis over the remaining life of the respective security issues (old original debt). The amounts so amortized shall be charged to account 428.1, Amortization of Loss on Reacquired Debt, or credited to account 429.1, Amortization of Gain on Reacquired Debt—Credit, as appropriate. 


C. *Reacquisition, with refunding.* When the redemption of one issue or series of bonds or other long-term obligations is financed by another issue or series before the maturity date of the first issue, the difference between the amount paid upon refunding and the face value; plus any unamortized premium less related debt expense or less any unamortized discount and related debt expense, applicable to the debt refunded, shall be included in account 189, Unamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt, or account 257, Unamortized Gain on Reacquired Debt, as appropriate. The utility may elect to account for such amounts as follows: 


(1) Write them off immediately when the amounts are insignificant. 


(2) Amortize them by equal monthly amounts over the remainder of the original life of the issue retired, or 


(3) Amortize them by equal monthly amounts over the life of the new issue. 


Once an election is made, it shall be applied on a consistent basis. The amounts in (1), (2), or (3) above shall be charged to account 428.1, Amortization of Loss on Reacquired Debt, or credited to account 429.1, Amortization of Gain on Reacquired Debt—Credit, as appropriate. 


D. Under methods (2) and (3) above, the increase or reduction in current income taxes resulting from the reacquisition should be apportioned over the remainder of the original life of the issue retired or over the life of the new issue, as appropriate, as directed more specifically in paragraphs E and F below. 


E. When the utility recognizes the loss in the year of reacquisition as a tax deduction, account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, shall be debited and account 283, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other, shall be credited with the amount of the related tax effect, such amount to be allocated to the periods affected in accordance with the provisions of account 283. 


F. When the utility chooses to recognize the gain in the year of reacquisition as a taxable gain, account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Utility Operating Income, shall be credited and account 190, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes, shall be debited with the amount of the related tax effect, such amount to be allocated to the periods affected in accordance with the provisions of account 190. 


G. When the utility chooses to use the optional privilege of deferring the tax on the gain attributable to the reacquisition of debt by reducing the depreciable basis of utility property for tax purposes, pursuant to Section 108 of the Internal Revenue Code, the related tax effects shall be deferred as the income is recognized for accounting purposes, and the deferred amounts shall be amortized over the life of the associated property on a vintage year basis. Account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, shall be debited, and account 282, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other Property, shall be credited with an amount equal to the estimated income tax effect applicable to the portion of the income, attributable to reacquired debt, recognized for accounting purposes during the period. Account 282 shall be debited and account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Utility Operating Income, shall be credited with an amount equal to the estimated income tax effects, during the life of the property, attributable to the reduction in the depreciable basis for tax purposes. 


H. The tax effects relating to gain or loss shall be allocated as above to utility operations except in cases where a portion of the debt reacquired is directly applicable to nonutility operations. In that event, the related portion of the tax effects shall be allocated to nonutility operations. Where it can be established that reacquired debt is generally applicable to both utility and nonutility operations, the tax effects shall be allocated between utility and nonutility operations based on the ratio of net investment in utility plant to net investment in non- utility plant. 


I. Premium, discount, or expense on debt shall not be included as an element in the cost of construction or acquisition of property (tangible or intangible), except under the provisions of account 432, Allowance for Borrowed Funds Used During Construction—Credit. 


J. *Alternate method.* Where a regulatory authority or a group of regulatory authorities having prime rate jurisdiction over the utility specifically disallows the rate principle of amortizing gains or losses on reacquisition of long-term debt without refunding, and does not apply the gain or loss to reduce interest charges in computing the allowed rate of return for rate purposes, then the following alternate method may be used to account for gains or losses relating to reacquisition of long-term debt, with or without refunding. 


(1) The difference between the amount paid upon reacquisition of any long-term debt and the face value, adjusted for unamortized discount, expenses or premium, as the case may be, applicable to the debt redeemed shall be recognized currently in income and recorded in account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or account 426.5, Other Deductions. 


(2) When this alternate method of accounting is used, the utility shall include a footnote to each financial statement, prepared for public use, explaining why this method is being used along with the treatment given for ratemaking purposes. 


18. *Comprehensive interperiod income tax allocation.* A. Where there are timing differences between the periods in which transactions affect taxable income and the periods in which they enter into the determination of pretax accounting income, the income tax effects of such transactions are to be recognized in the periods in which the differences between book accounting income and taxable income arise and in the periods in which the differences reverse using the deferred tax method. In general, comprehensive interperiod tax allocation should be followed whenever transactions enter into the determination of pretax accounting income for the period even though some transactions may affect the determination of taxes payable in a different period, as further qualified below. 


B. Utilities are not required to utilize comprehensive interperiod income tax allocation until the deferred income taxes are included as an expense in the rate level by the regulatory authority having rate jurisdiction over the utility. Where comprehensive interperiod tax allocation accounting is not practiced the utility shall include as a note to each financial statement, prepared for public use, a footnote explanation setting forth the utility's accounting policies with respect to interperiod tax allocation and describing the treatment for ratemaking purposes of the tax timing differences by regulatory authorities having rate jurisdiction. 


C. Should the utility be subject to more than one agency having rate jurisdiction, its accounts shall appropriately reflect the ratemaking treatment (deferral or flow through) of each jurisdiction. 


D. Once comprehensive interperiod tax allocation has been initiated either in whole or in part it shall be practiced on a consistent basis and shall not be changed or discontinued without prior Commission approval. 


E. Tax effects deferred currently will be recorded as deferred debits or deferred credits in accounts 190, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes, 281, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Accelerated Amortization Property, 282, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other Property, and 283, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other, as appropriate. The resulting amounts recorded in these accounts shall be disposed of as prescribed in this system of accounts or as otherwise authorized by the Commission. 


19. *Criteria for classifying leases.* A. If at its inception a lease meets one or more of the following criteria, the lease shall be classified as a capital lease. Otherwise, it shall be classified as an operating lease.


(1) The lease transfers ownership of the property to the leasee by the end of the lease term.


(2) The lease contains a bargain purchase option.


(3) The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated economic life of the leased property. However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the lease property, including earlier years of use, this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease.


(4) the present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, including any profit thereon, equals or exceeds 90 percent of the excess of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at the inception of the lease over any related investment tax credit retained by the lessor and expected to be realized by the lessor. However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the lease property, including earlier years of use, this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease. The lessee utility shall compute the present value of the minimum lease payments using his incremental borrowing rate, unless (a) it is practicable for the utility to learn the implicit rate computed by the lessor, and (b) the implicit rate computed by the lessor is less than the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. If both of those conditions are met, the lessee shall use the implicit rate.


B. If at any time the lessee and lessor agree to change the provisions of the lease, other than by renewing the lease or extending its term, in a manner that would have resulted in a different classification of the lease under the criteria in paragraph A had the changed terms been in effect at the inception of the lease, the revised agreement shall be considered as a new agreement over its term, and the criteria in paragraph A shall be applied for purposes of classifying the lease. Likewise, any action that extends the lease beyond the expiration of the existing lease term, such as the exercise of a lease renewal option other than those already included in the lease term, shall be considered as a new agreement, and shall be classified according to the above provisions, Changes in estimates (for example, changes in estimates of the economic life or of the residual value of the leased property) or changes in circumstances (for example, default by the lessee), shall not give rise to a new classification of a lease for accounting purposes.


20. *Accounting for leases.* A. All leases shall be classified as either capital or operating leases. The accounting for capitalized leases is effective January 1, 1984, except for the retroactive classification of certain leases which, in accordance with FASB No. 71, will not be required to be capitalized until after a three year transition period. For the purpose of reporting to the FERC, the transition period shall be deemed to end December 31, 1986.


B. The utility shall record a capital lease as an asset in account 101.1, Property under Capital Leases (or account 121, Non-utility Property, if appropriate), and an obligation in account 227, Obligations under Capital Leases—Noncurrent, or account 243, Obligations under Capital Leases—Current, at an amount equal to the present value at the beginning of the lease term of minimum lease payments during the lease term, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, together with any profit thereon. However, if the amount so determined exceeds the fair value of the leased property at the inception of the lease, the amount recorded as the asset and obligation shall be the fair value.


C. The utility, as a lessee, shall recognize an asset retirement obligation (See General Instruction 24) arising from the plant under a capital lease unless the obligation is recorded as an asset and liability under a capital lease. The utility shall record the asset retirement cost by debiting account 101.1, Property under capital leases, or account 121, Nonutility property, as appropriate, and crediting the liability for the asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset retirement obligations. Asset retirement costs recorded in account 101.1 or account 121 shall be amortized by charging rent expense (See Operating Expense Instruction 3) or account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, as appropriate, and crediting a separate subaccount of the account in which the asset retirement costs are recorded. Charges for the periodic accretion of the liability in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, shall be recorded by a charge to account 411.10, Accretion expense, for gas utility plant, and account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, for nonutility plant and a credit to account 230, Asset retirement obligations. 


D. Rental payments on all leases shall be charged to rent expense, fuel expense, construction work in progress, or other appropriate accounts as they become payable.


E. For a capital lease, for each period during the lease term, the amounts recorded for the asset and obligation shall be reduced by an amount equal to the portion of each lease payment which would have been allocated to the reduction of the obligation, if the payment had been treated as a payment on an installment obligation (liability) and allocated between interest expense and a reduction of the obligation so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance.


21. *Gas well records.* Each utility with natural gas operations shall maintain operating or accounting records for each well showing: (a) Acreage on which drilled, (b) dates of drilling period, (c) cost of drilling, (d) depth of well, (e) particulars and depth of each stratum drilled through, (f) geological formation from which gas is obtained, (g) initial rock pressure and open flow capacity, (h) sizes of casing used and lengths of each size, (i) total cost of well as recorded in gas plant accounts, (j) date well abandoned, for wells once productive, (k) date transferred to underground storage plant, for wells converted to storage use, and (l) date drilling discontinued, for wells determined to be nonproductive. The foregoing data, as appropriate, shall also be maintained for each subsequent change in the depth of each well.


22. *Accounting for other comprehensive income.*

A. Utilities shall record items of other comprehensive income in account 219, accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts included in this account shall be maintained by each category of other comprehensive income. Examples of categories of other comprehensive income include, foreign currency items, minimum pension liability adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale type securities and cash flow hedge amounts. Supporting records shall be maintained for account 219 so that the company can readily identify the cumulative amount of other comprehensive income for each item included in this account.


B. When an item of other comprehensive income enters into the determination of net income in the current or subsequent periods, a reclassification adjustment shall be recorded in account 219 to avoid double counting of that amount. 


C. When it is probable that an item of other comprehensive income will be included in the development of cost of service rates in subsequent periods, that amount of unrealized losses or gains shall be recorded in accounts 182.3 or 254 as appropriate. 


23. *Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities.*

A. Utilities shall recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the financial statements and measure those instruments at fair value, except those falling within recognized exceptions, the most common of which being the normal purchases and sales scope exception. Normal purchases or sales are contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of goods that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold by the utility over a reasonable period in the normal course of business. A derivative instrument is a financial instrument or other contract with all three of the following characteristics: 


(1) It has one or more underlyings and a notional amount or payment provision. Those terms determine the amount of the settlement or settlements, and, in some cases, whether or not a settlement is required. 


(2) It requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have similar response to changes in market factors. 


(3) Its terms require or permit net settlement, can readily be settled net by a means outside the contract, or provides for delivery of an asset that puts the recipient in a position not substantially different from net settlement. 


B. The accounting for the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends upon its intended use and designation. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges will be recorded in account 175, derivative instrument assets, or account 244, derivative instrument liabilities, as appropriate, with the gains recorded in account 421, miscellaneous nonoperating income, and losses recorded in account 426.4, other deductions. 


C. A derivative instrument may be specifically designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge. A hedge may be used to manage risk to price, interest rates, or foreign currency transactions. Utilities shall maintain documentation of the hedge relationship at the inception of the hedge that details the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how hedge effectiveness will be determined. 


D. If the utility designates the derivative instrument as a fair value hedge against exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment, it will record the change in fair value of the derivative instrument to account 176, derivative instrument assets—hedges, or account 245, derivative instrument liabilities—hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding adjustment to the subaccount of the item being hedged. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the same income or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income. In the case of a fair value hedge of a firm commitment a new asset or liability is created. As a result of the hedge relationship, the new asset or liability will become part of the carrying amount of the item being hedged. 


E. If the utility designates the derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge against exposure to variable cash flows of a probable forecasted transaction, it shall record changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument in account 176, derivative instrument assets—hedges, or account 245, derivative instrument liabilities—hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding amount in account 219, accumulated other comprehensive income, for the effective portion of the hedge. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the same income or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income shall be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged forecasted item enters into the determination of net income. 


24. *Accounting for asset retirement obligations.*

A. An *asset retirement obligation* represents a liability for the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that a utility is required to settle as a result of an existing or enacted law, statute, ordinance, or written or oral contract or by legal construction of a contract under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. An *asset retirement cost* represents the amount capitalized when the liability is recognized for the long-lived asset that gives rise to the legal obligation. The amount recognized for the liability and an associated asset retirement cost shall be stated at the fair value of the asset retirement obligation in the period in which the obligation is incurred. 


B. The utility shall initially record a liability for an asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, and charge the associated asset retirement costs to gas utility plant and nonutility plant, as appropriate, related to the plant that gives rise to the legal obligation. The asset retirement cost shall be depreciated over the useful life of the related asset that gives rise to the obligations. For periods subsequent to the initial recording of the asset retirement obligation, a utility shall recognize the period to period changes of the asset retirement obligation that result from the passage of time due to the accretion of the liability and any subsequent measurement changes to the initial liability for the legal obligation recorded in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, as follows: 


(1) The utility shall record the accretion of the liability by debiting account 411.10, Accretion expense, for gas utility plant, account 413, Expenses of gas plant leased to others, for gas plants leased to others, and account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, for nonutility plant and crediting account 230, Asset retirement obligations; and 


(2) The utility shall recognize any subsequent measurement changes of the liability initially recorded in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, for each specific asset retirement obligation as an adjustment of that liability in account 230 with the corresponding adjustment to gas utility plant, gas plant leased to others, and nonutility plant, as appropriate. The utility shall on a timely basis monitor any measurement changes of the asset retirement obligations. 


C. Gains or losses resulting from the settlement of asset retirement obligations associated with utility plant resulting from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation included in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, and the actual amount paid to settle the obligation shall be accounted for as follows: 


(1) Gains shall be credited to account 411.6, Gains from disposition of utility plant, and; 


(2) Losses shall be charged to account 411.7, Losses from disposition of utility plant. 


D. Gains or losses on the settlement of the asset retirement obligations associated with nonutility plant resulting from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, and the amount paid to settle the obligation, shall be accounted for as follows: 


(1) Gains shall be credited to account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, and; 


(2) Losses shall be charged to account 426.5, Other deductions. 


E. Separate subsidiary records shall be maintained for each asset retirement obligation showing the initial liability and associated asset retirement cost, any incremental amounts of the liability incurred in subsequent reporting periods for additional layers of the original liability and related asset retirement cost, the accretion of the liability, the subsequent measurement changes to the asset retirement obligation, the depreciation and amortization of the asset retirement costs and related accumulated depreciation, and the settlement date and actual amount paid to settle the obligation. For purposes of analyses a utility shall maintain supporting documentation so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously with respect to each asset retirement obligation the full details of the identity and nature of the legal obligation, the year incurred, the identity of the plant giving rise to the obligation, the full particulars relating to each component and supporting computations related to the measurement of the asset retirement obligation. 


1. *Classification of gas plant at the effective date of the system of accounts.*

A. The gas plant accounts provided herein are generally the same as those contained in the prior system of accounts except for some changes in classification in the general equipment accounts. Except for these changes, the balances in the various plant accounts, as determined under the prior system of accounts, should be carried forward. Any remaining balance of plant which has not yet been classified pursuant to the requirements of the prior system, shall be classified in accordance with the following instructions. 


B. The cost to the utility of its unclassified plant shall be ascertained by analysis of the utility's records. Adjustments shall not be made to record in utility plant accounts amounts previously charged to operating expenses or to income deductions in accordance with the uniform system of accounts in effect at the time or in accordance with the discretion of management as exercised under a uniform system of accounts, or under accounting practices previously followed. 


C. The detailed gas plant accounts (301 to 399, inclusive) shall be stated on the basis of cost to the utility of plant constructed by it and the original cost, estimated if not known, of plant acquired as an operating unit or system. The difference between the original cost as above, and the cost to the utility of gas plant after giving effect to any accumulated provision for depreciation, depletion, or amortization shall be recorded in account 114, Gas Plant Acquisition Adjustments. The original cost of gas plant shall be determined by analysis of the utility's records or those of the predecessor or vendor companies with respect to gas plant previously acquired as operating units or systems and the differences between the original cost so determined, less accumulated provisions for depreciation, depletion and amortization, and the cost to the utility, with necessary adjustments for retirements from the date of acquisition, shall be entered in account 114, Gas Plant Acquisition Adjustments. Any difference between the cost of gas plant and its book cost, when not properly includable in other accounts, shall be recorded in account 116, Other Gas Plant Adjustments. 


D. Plant acquired by lease which qualifies as capital lease property under General Instruction 19. *Criteria for Classifying Leases,* shall be recorded in Account 101.1, Property under Capital Leases.


2. *Gas plant to be recorded at cost.* A. All amounts included in the accounts for gas plant acquired as an operating unit or system, except as otherwise provided in the texts of the intangible plant accounts, shall be stated at the cost incurred by the person who first devoted the property to utility service. All other gas plant shall be included in the accounts at the cost incurred by the utility, except for property acquired by lease which qualifies as capital lease property under General Instruction 19. *Criteria for Classifying Leases,* and is recorded in Account 101.1, Property under Capital Leases. Where the term “cost” is used in the detailed plant accounts, it shall have the meaning stated in this paragraph. 


B. When the consideration given for property is other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be determined on a cash basis. (See, however, definition 8.) In the entry recording such transaction, the actual consideration shall be described with sufficient particularity to identify it. The utility shall be prepared to furnish the Commission the particulars of its determination of the cash value of the consideration if other than cash. 


C. When property is purchased under a plan involving deferred payments, no charge shall be made to the gas plant accounts for interest, insurance, or other expenditures occasioned solely by such form of payment. 


D. The gas plant accounts shall not include the cost or other value of gas plant contributed to the company. Contributions in the form of money or its equivalent toward the construction of gas plant shall be credited to the accounts charged with the cost of such construction. Plant constructed from contributions of cash or its equivalent shall be shown as a reduction to gross plant constructed when assembling cost data in work orders for posting to plant ledger of accounts. The accumulated gross costs of plant accumulated in the work order shall be recorded as a debit in the plant ledger of accounts along with the related amount of contributions concurrently being recorded as a credit. 


3. *Components of construction cost.* A. The cost of construction properly includable in the gas plant accounts shall include, where applicable, the direct and overhead costs as listed and defined hereunder: 


(1) “Contract work” includes amounts paid for work performed under contract by other companies, firms, or individuals, costs incident to the award of such contracts, and the inspection of such work. 


(2) “Labor” includes the pay and expenses of employees of the utility engaged on construction work, and related workmen's compensation insurance, payroll taxes and similar items of expense. It does not include the pay and expenses of employees which are distributed to construction through clearing accounts nor the pay and expenses included in other items hereunder. 


(3) “Materials and supplies” includes the purchase price at the point of free delivery plus customs duties, excise taxes, the cost of inspection, loading and transportation, the related stores expenses, and the cost of fabricated materials from the utility's shop. In determining the cost of materials and supplies used for construction, proper allowance shall be made for unused materials and supplies, for materials recovered from temporary structures used in performing the work involved, and for discounts allowed and realized in the purchase of materials and supplies. 


(4) “Transportation” includes the cost of transporting employees, materials and supplies, tools, purchased equipment, and other work equipment (when not under own power) to and from points of construction. It includes amounts paid to others as well as the cost of operating the utility's own transportation equipment. (See item 5 following.) 


(5) “Special machine service” includes the cost of labor (optional), materials and supplies, depreciation, and other expenses incurred in the maintenance, operation and use of special machines, such as steam shovels, pile drivers, derricks, ditchers, scrapers, material unloaders, and other labor saving machines; also expenditures for rental maintenance and operation of machines of others. It does not include the cost of small tools and other individual items of small value or short life which are included in the cost of materials and supplies. (See item 3, above.) When a particular construction job requires the use for an extended period of time of special machines, transportation or other equipment, the net book cost thereof, less the appraised or salvage value at time of release from the job, shall be included in the cost of construction. 


(6) “Shop service” includes the proportion of the expense of the utility's shop department assignable to construction work except that the cost of fabricated materials from the utility's shop shall be included in “materials and supplies.” 


(7) “Protection” includes the cost of protecting the utility's property from fire or other casualties and the cost of preventing damages to others, or to the property of others, including payments for discovery or extinguishment of fires, cost of apprehending and prosecuting incendiaries, witness fees in relation thereto, amounts paid to municipalities and others for fire protection, and other analogous items of expenditures in connection with construction work. 


(8) “Injuries and damages” includes expenditures or losses in connection with the construction work on account of injuries to persons and damages to the property of others; also the cost of investigation of and defense against actions for such injuries and damages. Insurance recovered or recoverable on account of compensation paid for injuries to persons incident to construction shall be credited to the account or accounts to which such compensation is charged. Insurance recovered or recoverable on account of property damages incident to construction shall be credited to the account or accounts charged with the cost of the damages. 


(9) “Privileges and permits” includes payments for and expenses incurred in securing temporary privileges, permits or rights in connection with construction work, such as for the use of private or public property, streets, or highways, but it does not include rents, or amounts chargeable as franchises and consents for which see account 302, Franchises and Consents. 


(10) “Rents” includes amounts paid for the use of construction quarters and office space occupied by construction forces and amounts properly includible in construction costs for such facilities jointly used. 


(11) “Engineering and supervision” includes the portion of the pay and expenses of engineers, surveyors, draftsmen, inspectors, superintendents and their assistants applicable to construction work. 


(12) “General administration capitalized” includes the portion of the pay and expenses of the general officers and administrative and general expenses applicable to construction work. 


(13) “Engineering services” includes amounts paid to other companies, firms, or individuals engaged by the utility to plan, design, prepare estimates, supervise, inspect, or give general advice and assistance in connection with construction work. 


(14) “Insurance” includes premiums paid or amounts provided or reserved as self-insurance for the protection against loss and damages in connection with construction, by fire or other casualty, injury to or death of persons other than employees, damages to property of others, defalcation of employees and agents, and the nonperformance of contractual obligations of others. It does not include workmen's compensation or similar insurance on employees included as “labor” in item 2, above. 


(15) “Law expenditures” includes the general law expenditures incurred in connection with construction and the court and legal costs directly related thereto, other than law expenses included in protection, item 7, and in injuries and damages, item 8. 


(16) “Taxes” includes taxes on physical property (including land) during the period of construction and other taxes properly includible in construction costs before the facilities become available for service. 


(17) “Allowance for funds used during construction” includes the net cost for the period of construction of borrowed funds used for construction purposes and a reasonable rate on other funds when so used, not to exceed without prior approval of the Commission allowances computed in accordance with the formula prescribed in paragraph (a) below, except when such other funds are used for exploration and development or leases acquired after October 7, 1969, no allowance on such other funds shall be included in these accounts. No allowance for funds used during construction charges shall be included in these accounts upon expenditures for construction projects which have been abandoned. 


(a) The formula and elements for the computation of the allowance for funds used during construction shall be: 





(b) The rates shall be determined annually. The balances for long-term debt, preferred stock and common equity shall be the actual book balances as of the end of the prior year. The cost rates for long-term debt and preferred stock shall be the weighted average cost determined in the manner indicated in subpart D of part 154 of the Commission's Regulations Under the Natural Gas Act. The cost rate for common equity shall be the rate granted common equity in the last rate proceeding before the ratemaking body having primary rate jurisdiction. If such cost rate is not available, the average rate actually earned during the preceding three years shall be used. The short-term debt balances and related cost and the average balance for construction work in progress shall be estimated for the current year with appropriate adjustments as actual data becomes available. 


(18) “Earnings and expenses during construction” includes (a) all revenues derived during the construction period from property which is included in the cost of a project under construction and (b) all expenses which are attributable to the revenues received. 


(19) “Training costs”. When it is necessary that employees be trained to operate or maintain plant facilities that are being constructed and such facilities are not conventional in nature or are new to the company's operations, these costs may be capitalized as a component of construction cost. Once plant is placed in service, the capitalization of training costs shall cease, and subsequent training costs shall be expensed. (See Operating Expense Instruction 4.) 


(20) “Line pack gas.” Line pack includes the first cost of that quantity of gas introduced into the utility's system necessary to bring the system up to its designed operating capacity or increases therein and which must be maintained in the system in order to sustain such design operating capacity.


(21) LNG “heel” is the first cost of that minimum quantity of liquefied natural gas necessary to be retained in holding tanks and other facilities for purposes of temperature and/or pressure maintenance. 


(22) “Studies” includes the costs of studies such as operational, safety or environmental studies relative to plant under construction. Studies mandated by regulatory bodies relative to facilities in service, shall be charged to Account 183.2, Other Preliminary Survey and Investigation Charges.


(23) “Asset retirement costs.” The costs recognized as a result of asset retirement obligations incurred during the construction and testing of utility plant shall constitute a component of construction costs.


4. *Overhead construction costs.* A. All overhead construction costs, such as engineering, supervision, general office salaries and expenses, construction engineering and supervision by others than the accounting utility, law expenses, insurance, injuries and damages, relief and pensions, taxes and interest, shall be charged to particular jobs or units on the basis of the amounts of such overheads reasonably applicable thereto, to the end that each job or unit shall bear its equitable proportion of such costs and that the entire cost of the unit, both direct and overhead, shall be deducted from the plant accounts at the time the property is retired. 


B. As far as practicable, the determination of pay roll charges includible in construction overheads shall be based on time card distributions thereof. Where this procedure is impractical, special studies shall be made periodically of the time of supervisory employees devoted to construction activities to the end that only such overhead costs as have a definite relation to construction shall be capitalized. The addition to direct construction costs of arbitrary percentages or amounts to cover assumed overhead costs is not permitted. 


C. The record supporting the entries for overhead construction costs shall be so kept as to show the total amount of each overhead for each year, the nature and amount of each overhead expenditure charged to each construction work order and to each utility plant account, and the bases of distribution of such costs. 


5. *Gas plant purchased or sold.* A. When gas plant constituting an operating unit or system is acquired by purchase, merger, consolidation, liquidation, or otherwise, after the effective date of this system of accounts, the costs of acquisition, including expenses incidental thereto properly includible in gas plant, shall be charged to account 102, Gas Plant Purchased or Sold. 


B. The accounting for the acquisition shall then be completed as follows: 


(1) The original cost of plant, estimated if not known, shall be credited to account 102, Gas Plant Purchased or Sold, and concurrently charged to the appropriate gas plant in service accounts and to account 104, Gas Plant Leased to Others, account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use, 105.1, Production Properties Held for Future Use, and account 107, Construction Work in Progress—Gas, as appropriate. 


(2) The depreciation, depletion, and amortization applicable to the original cost of the properties purchased, shall be charged to account 102, Gas Plant Purchased or Sold, and concurrently credited to the appropriate account for accumulated provision for depreciation, depletion or amortization. 


(3) The cost to the utility of any property includible in account 121, Nonutility Property, shall be transferred thereto. 


(4) The amount remaining in account 102, Gas Plant Purchased or Sold, shall then be closed to account 114, Gas Plant Acquisition Adjustments. 


C. If property acquired in the purchase of an operating unit or system is in such physical condition when acquired that it is necessary substantially to rehabilitate it in order to bring the property up to the standards of the utility, the cost of such work, except replacements, shall be accounted for as a part of the purchase price of the property. 


D. When any property acquired as an operating unit or system includes duplicate or other plant which will be retired by the accounting utility in the reconstruction of the acquired property or its consolidation with previously owned property, the proposed accounting for such property shall be presented to the Commission. 


E. In connection with the acquisition of gas plant constituting an operating unit or system, the utility shall procure, if possible, all existing records relating to the property acquired, or certified copies thereof, and shall preserve such records in conformity with regulations or practices governing the preservation of records of its own construction. 


F. When gas plant constituting an operating unit or system is sold, conveyed, or transferred to another by sale, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, the book cost of the property sold or transferred to another shall be credited to the appropriate utility plant accounts, including amounts carried in account 114, Gas Plant Acquisition Adjustments. The amounts (estimated if not known) carried with respect thereto in the accounts for accumulated provision for depreciation, depletion, and amortization and in account 252, Customer Advances for Construction, shall be charged to such accounts and the contra entries made to account 102, Gas Plant Purchased or Sold. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, the difference, if any, between (a) the net amount of debits and credits and (b) the consideration received for the property (less commissions and other expenses of making the sale) shall be included in account 421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property, or account 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property. (See account 102, Gas Plant Purchased or Sold.) 


6. *Expenditures on leased property.* A. The cost of substantial initial improvements (including repairs, rearrangements, additions, and betterments) made in the course of preparing for utility service property leased for a period of more than one year, and the cost of subsequent substantial additions, replacements, or betterments to such property, shall be charged to the gas plant account appropriate for the class of property leased. If the service life of the improvements is terminable by action of the lease, the cost, less net salvage, of the improvements shall be spread over the life of the lease by charges to account 404.3, Amortization of Other Limited-Term Gas Plant. However, if the service life is not terminated by action of the lease but by depreciation proper, the cost of the improvements, less net salvage, shall be accounted for as depreciable plant. The provisions of this paragraph are applicable to property leased under either capital leases or operating leases. 


B. If improvements made to property leased for a period of more than one year are of relatively minor cost, or if the lease is for a period of not more than one year, the cost of the improvements shall be charged to the account in which the rent is included, either directly or by amortization thereof. 


7. *Land and land rights.* A. The accounts for land and land rights shall include the cost of land owned in fee by the utility and rights, interests, and privileges held by the utility in land owned by others, such as leaseholds, easements, rights-of-way, natural gas rights, and other like interests in land. Do not include in the accounts for land and land rights and rights-of-way costs incurred in connection with first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with the construction and installation of plant. Such costs shall be included in the appropriate plant accounts directly benefited. 


B. Where special assessments for public improvements provide for deferred payments, the full amount of the assessments shall be charged to the appropriate land account and the unpaid balance shall be carried in an appropriate liability account. Interest on unpaid balances shall be charged to the appropriate interest account. If any part of the cost of public improvement is included in the general tax levy, the amount thereof shall be charged to the appropriate tax account. 


C. The net profit from the sale of timber, cord wood, sand, gravel, other resources or other property acquired with the rights-of-way or other lands shall be credited to the appropriate plant account to which related. Where land is held for a considerable period of time and timber and other natural resources on the land at the time of purchase increases in value, the net profit (after giving effect to the cost of the natural resources) from the sales of timber or its products or other natural resources shall be credited to the appropriate utility operating income account when such land has been recorded in account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use, account 105.1, Production Properties Held for Future Use, or classified as plant in service otherwise to account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income. 


D. Separate entries shall be made for the acquisition, transfer, or retirement of each parcel of land, and each land right, or gas right (except rights-of-way for distribution mains), having a life of more than one year. A record shall be maintained showing the nature of ownership, full legal description, area, map reference, purpose for which used, city, county, and tax district in which situated, from whom purchased or to whom sold, payment given or received, other costs, contract date and number, date of recording of deed, and book and page of record. Entries transferring or retiring land or land rights shall refer to the original entry recording its acquisition. A parcel of land acquired and carried on the books as a unit is not required to be subdivided with transfers to other land accounts merely because of the erection thereon of an incidental structure to be used in gas operations but for a purpose differing from that for which the land is chiefly employed; for example, a small storehouse on production plant land. 


E. Any difference between the amount received from the sale of land or land rights, less agents' commissions and other costs incident to the sale, and the book cost of such land or rights shall be included in account 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant or 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant when such property has been recorded in account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use, 105.1, Production Properties Held for Future Use, otherwise to account 421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property or 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property, as appropriate, unless a reserve therefor has been authorized and provided. Appropriate adjustments of the accounts shall be made with respect to any structures or improvements located on land sold. 


F. The cost of buildings and other improvements (other than public improvements) shall not be included in the land accounts. If at the time of acquisition of an interest in land such interest extends to buildings or other improvements (other than public improvements), which are then devoted to utility operations, the land and improvements shall be separately appraised and the cost allocated to land and buildings or improvements on the basis of the appraisals. If the improvements are removed or wrecked without being used in operations, the cost of removing or wrecking shall be charged and the salvage credited to the account in which the cost of the land is recorded. 


G. When the purchase of land for gas operations requires the purchase of more land than needed for such purposes, the charge to the specific land account shall be based upon the cost of the land purchased, less the fair market value of that portion of the land which is not to be used in utility operations. The portion of the cost measured by the fair market value of the land not to be used shall be included in account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use or, account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate. Regarding land and land rights held for the production of natural gas, account 101, Gas Plant in Service, shall include (1) the cost of lands owned in fee upon which producing natural gas wells are located on lands owned in fee which are being drained through the operation by the utility of wells on the other land, and (2) the first cost of lands held under lease upon which the utility pays royalties for the natural gas obtained therefrom. The cost of all other land and land rights held for the production of natural gas under a plant for such use shall be included in account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use, or 105.1, Production Properties Held for Future Use, as appropriate. 


H. Provision shall be made for amortizing amounts carried in the accounts for limited-term interests in land, so as to apportion equitably the cost of each interest over the life thereof. For the purposes of amortization of natural gas rights, separate interests in land which comprise an interest in a production area may be grouped to form a depletion unit. (See account 111, Accumulated Provision for Amortization and Depletion of Gas Utility Plant, account 404.1, Amortization and Depletion of Producing Natural Gas Land and Land Rights, account 404.3, Amortization of Other Limited-Term Gas Plant, and account 797, Abandonment, leases.) 


I. The items of cost to be included in the accounts for land and land rights are as follows: 


8. *Structures and improvements.* A. The accounts for structures and improvements shall include the cost of all buildings and facilities to house, support, or safeguard property or persons, including all fixtures permanently attached to and made a part of buildings and which cannot be removed therefrom without cutting into the walls, ceilings, or floors, or without in some way impairing the buildings, and improvements of a permanent character on or to land. Also include those costs incurred in connection with the first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way, and the damage costs associated with construction and installation of plant. 


B. The cost of specially provided foundations not intended to outlast the machinery or apparatus for which provided, and the cost of angle irons, castings, etc., installed at the base of an item of equipment, shall be charged to the same account as the cost of the machinery, apparatus, or equipment. 


C. Minor buildings and structures may be considered a part of the facility in connection with which constructed or operated and the cost thereof accounted for accordingly when the nature of the structure and facility indicates the correctness of such accounting. 


D. Where furnaces and boilers are used primarily for furnishing steam for some particular department and only incidentally for furnishing steam for heating a building and operating the equipment therein, the entire cost of such furnaces and boilers shall be charged to the appropriate plant account, and no part to the building account. 


E. The cost of disposing of materials excavated in connection with construction of structures shall be considered as a part of the cost of such work, except as follows: (a) When such material is used for filling, the cost of loading, hauling, and dumping shall be equitably apportioned between the work in connection with which the removal occurs and the work in connection with which the material is used; (b) when such material is sold, the net amount realized from such sales shall be credited to the work in connection with which the removal occurs. If the amount realized from the sale of excavated materials exceeds the removal costs and the costs in connection with the sale, the excess shall be credited to the land account in which the site is carried. 


F. Lighting or other fixtures temporarily attached to buildings for purposes of display or demonstration shall not be included in the cost of the building but in the appropriate equipment account. 


G. The items of cost to be included in the accounts for structures and improvements are as follows: 


9. *Equipment.* A. The cost of equipment chargeable to the gas plant accounts, unless otherwise indicated in the text of an equipment account, includes the net purchase price thereof, sales taxes, investigation and inspection expenses necessary to such purchase, expenses of transportation when borne by the utility, labor employed, materials and supplies consumed, and expenses incurred by the utility in unloading and placing the equipment in readiness to operate. Also include those costs incurred in connection with the first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with construction and installation of plant. 


B. Exclude from equipment accounts hand and other portable tools which are likely to be lost or stolen or which have relatively small value (for example, $500 or less) or short life, unless the correctness of the accounting therefor as gas plant is verified by current inventories. Special tools acquired and included in the purchase price of equipment shall be included in the appropriate plant account. Portable drills and similar tool equipment when used in connection with the operation and maintenance of a particular plant or department, such as production, transmission, distribution, etc., or in “stores,” shall be charged to the plant account appropriate for their use. 


C. The equipment accounts shall include angle irons and similar items which are installed at the base of an item of equipment, but piers and foundations which are designed to be as permanent as the buildings which house the equipment, or which are constructed as a part of the building and which cannot be removed without cutting into the walls, ceilings or floors or without in some way impairing the building, shall be included in the building accounts. 


D. The equipment accounts shall include the necessary costs of testing or running a plant or part thereof during an experimental or test period prior to becoming available for service. The utility shall furnish the Commission with full particulars of and justification for any test or experimental run extending beyond a period of thirty days. 


E. The cost of efficiency or other tests made subsequent to the date equipment becomes available for service shall be charged to the appropriate expense accounts, except that tests to determine whether equipment meets the specifications and requirements as to efficiency, performance, etc., guaranteed by manufacturers, made after operations have commenced and within the period specified in the agreement or contract of purchase, may be charged to the appropriate gas plant account. 


10. *Additions and retirements of gas plant.*

A. For the purpose of avoiding undue refinement in accounting for additions to and retirements and replacements of gas plant, all property shall be considered as consisting of (1) retirement units and (2) minor items of property. Each utility shall maintain a written property units listing for use in accounting for additions and retirements of gas plant and apply the listing consistently.


B. The addition and retirement of retirement units shall be accounted for as follows: 


(1) When a retirement unit is added to gas plant, the cost thereof shall be added to the appropriate gas plant account, except that when units are acquired in the acquisition of any gas plant constituting an operating system, they shall be accounted for as provided in gas plant instruction 5. 


(2) When a retirement unit is retired from gas plant, with or without replacement, the book cost thereof shall be credited to the gas plant account in which it is included, determined in the manner set forth in paragraph D, below. If the retirement unit is of a depreciable class, the book cost of the unit retired and credited to gas plant shall be charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation applicable to such property. The cost of removal and the salvage shall be charged or credited, as appropriate, to such depreciation account. 


C. The addition and retirement of minor items of property shall be accounted for as follows: 


(1) When a minor item of property which did not previously exist is added to plant, the cost thereof shall be accounted for in the same manner as for the addition of a retirement unit, as set forth in paragraph B(1), above, if a substantial addition results, otherwise the charge shall be to the appropriate maintenance expense account. 


(2) When a minor item of property is retired and not replaced, the book cost thereof shall be credited to the gas plant account in which it is included; and, in the event the minor item is a part of depreciable plant, the account for accumulated provision for depreciation shall be charged with the book cost and cost of removal and credited with the salvage. If, however, the book cost of the minor item retired and not replaced has been or will be accounted for by its inclusion in the retirement unit of which it is a part when such unit is retired, no separate credit to the property account is required when such minor item is retired. 


(3) When a minor item of depreciable property is replaced independently of the retirement unit of which it is a part, the cost of replacement shall be charged to the maintenance account appropriate for the item, except that if the replacement effects a substantial betterment (the primary aim of which is to make the property affected more useful, more efficient, or of greater durability, or of greater capacity), the excess cost of the replacement over the estimated cost at current prices of replacing without betterment shall be charged to the appropriate gas plant account. 


D. The book cost of gas plant retired shall be the amount at which such property is included in the gas plant accounts, including all components of construction costs. The book cost shall be determined from the utility's records and if this cannot be done it shall be estimated. Utilities must furnish the particulars of such estimates to the Commission, if requested. When it is impracticable to determine the book cost of each unit, due to the relatively large number or small cost thereof, an appropriate average book cost of the units, with due allowance for any differences in size and character, shall be used as the book cost of the units retired.


E. The book cost of land retired shall be credited to the appropriate land account. If the land is sold, the difference between the book cost (less any accumulated provision for depreciation, depletion or amortization therefor which has been authorized and provided) and the sale price of the land (less commissions and other expenses of making the sale) shall be recorded in account 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant or 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant when the property has been recorded in account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use account 105.1, Production Properties Held for Future Use, otherwise to accounts 421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property or 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property, as appropriate. If the land is not used in utility service but is retained by the utility, the book cost shall be charged to account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use, or account 121, Nonutility Property as appropriate. 


F. The book cost less net salvage of depreciable gas plant retired shall be charged in its entirety to account 108. Accumulated Provision for Depreciation of Gas Plant in Service. Any amounts which, by approval or order of the Commission, are charged to account 182, Extraordinary Property Losses, shall be credited to account 108. 


G. The accounting for the retirement of amounts included in account 302, Franchises and Consents, and account 303, Miscellaneous Intangible Plant, and the item of limited-term interest in land included in the accounts for land and land rights, shall be as provided for in the text of account 111, Accumulated Provision for Amortization and Depletion of Gas Utility Plant, account 404.3, Amortization of Other Limited-Term Gas Plant, and account 405, Amortization of Other Gas Plant. 


11. *Work order and property record system required.* A. Each utility shall record all construction and retirements of gas plant by means of work orders or job orders. Separate work orders may be opened for additions to and retirements of gas plant or the retirements may be included with the construction work order, provided, however, that all items relating to the retirements shall be kept separate from those relating to construction and provided, further, that any maintenance costs involved in the work shall likewise be segregated. 


B. Each utility shall keep its work order system so as to show the nature of each addition to or retirement of gas plant, the total cost thereof, the source or sources of costs, and the gas plant account or accounts to which charged or credited. Work orders covering jobs of short duration may be cleared monthly. 


C. Each utility shall maintain records in which, for each plant account, the amounts of the annual additions and retirements are classified so as to show the number and cost of the various record units or retirement units.


12. *Transfers of property.* When property is transferred from one gas plant account to another, from one utility department to another (such as from gas to electric), from one operating division or area to another, to or from account 101, Gas Plant in Service, 104, Gas Plant Leased to Others, 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use, 105.1, Production Properties held for Future Use, and 121, Nonutility Property, the transfer shall be recorded by transferring the original cost thereof from the one account, department, or location to the other. Any related amounts carried in the accounts for accumulated provisions for depreciation, depletion, or amortization shall be transferred in accordance with the segregation of such accounts. 


13. *Common utility plant.* A. If the utility is engaged in more than one utility service such as gas, electric, and water, and any of its utility plant is used in common for several utility services or for other purposes to such an extent and in such manner that it is impracticable to segregate it by utility services currently in the accounts, such property, with the approval of the Commission, may be designated and classified as “common utility plant.” 


B. The book amount of utility plant designated as common plant shall be included in account 118, Other Utility Plant, and if applicable in part to gas department, shall be segregated and accounted for in subaccounts as gas plant is accounted for in accounts 101 to 107, inclusive, and gas plant adjustments in account 116; any amounts classifiable as common plant acquisition adjustments or common plant adjustments shall be subject to disposition as provided in paragraph C and B of accounts 114 and 116, respectively, for amounts classified in those accounts. The original cost of common utility plant in service shall be classified according to detailed utility plant accounts appropriate for the property. 


C. The utility shall be prepared to show at any time and to report to the Commission annually, or more frequently, if required, and by utility plant accounts (301 to 399) the following: (1) The book cost of common utility plant, (2) the allocation of such cost to the respective departments using the common utility plant, and (3) the basis of the allocation. 


D. The accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization of the utility shall be segregated so as to show the amount applicable to the property classified as common utility plant. 


E. The expenses of operation maintenance, rents, depreciation and amortization of common utility plant shall be recorded in the accounts prescribed herein, but designated as common expenses, and the allocation of such expenses to the departments using the common utility plant shall be supported in such manner as to reflect readily the basis of allocation used. 


14. *Employee villages and living quarters.* Where employee villages or living quarters are provided for operators and attendants of a functional installation such as a compressor station or gasoline plant, the structures and improvements shall be classified in the related functional structures and improvements account. The furnishings of such residential and recreational facilities shall be classified in the equipment account of the related function. 


15. *Fees for applications filed with the Commission.* A. Fees for applications involving construction of property shall be accounted for as follows: 


(1) All fees paid prior to the final disposition of the certificate application shall be charged to account 186, Miscellaneous Deferred Debits. 


(2) If the certificate is granted and accepted, the amounts recorded in account 186 shall be cleared to account 107, Construction Work in Progress—Gas, and subsequently cleared to the appropriate plant accounts. 


(3) If the certificate requested is not granted or is not accepted by the applicant, the fees recorded in account 186 shall be cleared to account 928, Regulatory Commission Expenses. 


(4) All amounts paid after the Commission has granted the certificate shall be recorded in account 107, Construction Work in Progress—Gas, and subsequently cleared to the appropriate plant accounts. 


B. All amounts paid related to certificate applications involving the acquisitions of facilities including those acquired by merger or pooling of interests shall be charged to account 928, Regulatory Commission Expenses. 


C. All other fees for applications not involving construction or acquisition of facilities shall be charged to account 928, Regulatory Commission Expenses. 


1. *Supervision and engineering.* The supervision and engineering includible in the operating expense accounts shall consist of the pay and expenses of superintendents, engineers, clerks, other employees and consultants engaged in supervising and directing the operation and maintenance of each utility function. Wherever allocations are necessary in order to arrive at the amount to be included in any account the method and basis of allocation shall be reflected by underlying records. 


2. *Maintenance.* A. The cost of maintenance chargeable to the various operating expense and clearing accounts, includes labor, materials, overheads and other expenses incurred in maintenance work. A list of work operations applicable generally to utility plant is included hereunder. Other work operations applicable to specific classes of plant are listed in functional maintenance expense accounts. 


B. Materials recovered in connection with the maintenance of property shall be credited to the same account to which the maintenance cost was charged. 


C. If the book cost of any property is carried in account 102, Gas Plant Purchased or Sold, the cost of maintaining such property shall be charged to the accounts for maintenance of property of the same class and use, the book cost of which is carried in other gas plant in service accounts. Maintenance of property leased from others shall be treated as provided in operating expense instruction 3. 


3. *Rents.* A. The rent expense accounts provided under the several functional groups of expense accounts shall include all rents, including taxes paid by the lessee on leased property, for property used in utility operations, except (1) minor amounts paid for occasional or infrequent use of any property or equipment and all amounts paid for use of equipment that, if owned, would be includible in plant accounts 391 to 398, inclusive, which shall be treated as an expense item and included in the appropriate functional account and (2) rents which are chargeable to clearing accounts, and distributed therefrom to the appropriate account. If rents cover property used for more than one function, such as production and transmission, or by more than one department, the rents shall be apportioned to the appropriate rent expense or clearing accounts of each department on an actual, or, if necessary, an estimated basis. 


B. When a portion of property or equipment rented from others for use in connection with utility operations is subleased, the revenue derived from such subleasing shall be credited to the rent revenue account in operating revenues: *Provided, however,* That in case the rent was charged to a clearing account, amounts received from subleasing the property shall be credited to such clearing account. 


C. The cost, when incurred by the lessee, of operating and maintaining leased property, shall be charged to the accounts appropriate for the expense if the property were owned. 


D. The cost incurred by the lessee of additions and replacements to gas plant leased from other shall be accounted for as provided in gas plant instruction 6. 


4. *Training costs.* When it is necessary that employees be trained to specifically operate or maintain plant facilities that are being constructed, the related costs shall be accounted for as a current operating and maintenance expense. These expenses shall be charged to the appropriate functional accounts currently as they are incurred. However, when the training costs involved relate to facilities which are not conventional in nature, or are new to the company's operations, then see Gas Plant Instruction 3(19) for accounting. 


A. This account shall include the original cost of gas plant, included in accounts 301 to 399 prescribed herein, owned and used by the utility in its gas operations, and having an expectation of life in service of more than one year from date of installation. Including such property owned by the utility but held by nominees. (See also account 106 for unclassified construction costs of completed plant actually in service.) 


B. The cost of additions to and betterments of property leased from others, which are includible in this account, shall be recorded in subdivisions separate and distinct from those relating to owned property. (See gas plant instruction 6.) 

101.1 Property under capital leases.


A. This account shall include the amount recorded under capital leases for plant leased from others and used by the utility in its utility operations.


B. The gas property included in this account shall be classified separately according to the detailed accounts (301 to 399) prescribed for gas plant in service.


C. Records shall be maintained with respect to each capital lease reflecting: (1) Name of lessor, (2) basic details of lease, (3) terminal date, (4) original cost fair market value of property leased, (5) future minimum lease payments, (6) executory costs, (7) present value of minimum lease payments, (8) the amounts representing interest and the interest rate used, and (9) expenses paid. Records shall also be maintained for plant under a lease, to identify the asset retirement obligation and cost originally recognized for each lease and the periodic charges and credits made to the asset retirement obligations and asset retirement costs. 

102 Gas plant purchased or sold. 


A. This account shall be charged with the cost of gas plant acquired as an operating unit or system by purchase, merger, consolidation, liquidation, or otherwise, and shall be credited with the selling price of like property transferred to others pending the distribution to appropriate accounts in accordance with gas plant instruction 5. 


B. Within six months from the date of acquisition or sale of property recorded herein, the utility shall file with the Commission the proposed journal entries to clear from this account the amounts recorded herein. 

103 Experimental gas plant unclassified. 


A. This account shall include the cost of gas plant which was constructed as a research, development, and demonstration project under the provisions of paragraph C, Account 107, Construction Work in Progress—Gas, and due to the nature of the plant it is desirous to operate it for a period of time in an experimental status. 


B. Amounts in this account shall be transferred to Account 101, Gas Plant in Service, or Account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate, when the project is no longer considered as experimental. Prior to transfer to account 101 the subject plant must be certified by the Commission for use as gas plant in service. 


C. The depreciation on plant in this account shall be charged to account 403, Depreciation expense, and account 403.1, Depreciation expense for asset retirement costs, as appropriate, and credited to account 108, Accumulated provision for depreciation of gas utility plant. The amounts herein shall be depreciated over a period which corresponds to the estimated useful life of the relevant project considering the characteristics involved. However, when projects are transferred to account 101, Gas plant in service, a new depreciation rate based on the remaining service life and undepreciated amounts, will be established. 


D. Records shall be maintained with respect to each unit of experiment so that full details may be obtained as to the cost, depreciation, and the experimental status. 


E. Should it be determined that experimental plants recorded in this account will fail to satisfactorily perform its function, the costs thereof shall be accounted for as directed or authorized by the Commission. 

104 Gas plant leased to others. 


A. This account shall include the original cost of gas plant owned by the utility but leased to others as operating units or systems, where the lessee has exclusive possession. 


B. The property included in this account shall be classified according to the detailed accounts (301 to 399) prescribed for gas plant in service and this account shall be maintained in such detail as though the property were used by the owner in its utility operations. 

105 Gas plant held for future use. 


A. This account shall include the original cost of gas plant (except land and land rights) owned and held for future use in gas service under a definite plan for such use, to include: (1) Property acquired (except land and land rights) but never used by the utility in gas service, but held for such service in the future under a definite plan, and (2) property (except land and land rights) previously used by the utility in gas service, but retired from such service and held pending its reuse in the future, under a definite plan, in gas service. This includes production properties relating to leases acquired on or before October 7, 1969. 


B. This account shall also include the original cost of land and land rights owned and held for future use in gas service relating to leases acquired on or before October 7, 1969, under a plan for such use, to include land and land rights: (1) Acquired but never used by the utility in gas service, but held for such service in the future under a plan, and (2) previously held by the utility in gas service, but retired from such service and held pending its reuse in the future under a plan, in gas service. (See Gas Plant Instruction 7.) 


C. In the event that property recorded in this account shall no longer be needed or appropriate for future utility operations, the company shall request Commission approval of journal entries to remove such property from this account when the gain realized from the sale or other disposition of the property is $100,000 or more, prior to their being recorded. Such filings shall include the description and original cost of individual properties removed from this account, the accounts charged upon removal, and any associated gains realized upon disposition of such property.


D. Gains or losses from the sale of land and land rights or other disposition of such property previously recorded in this account and not placed in utility service shall be recorded directly in accounts 411.6 or 411.7, as appropriate, except when determined to be significant by the Commission. Upon such a determination, the amounts shall be transferred to account 256, Deferred Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant, or account 187, Deferred Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant, and amortized to accounts 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant, or 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant, as appropriate. 


E. The property included in this account shall be classified according to the detail accounts (301 to 399) prescribed for gas plant in service and the account shall be maintained in such detail as though the property were in service. 


A. This account shall include the cost of production properties (except land and land rights) relating to leases acquired on or after October 8, 1969, held under a definite plan for future use to insure a future supply of natural gas for use in pipeline operations, to include: (1) Production property (except land and land rights) acquired but never used by the utility in gas service, but held for such service in the future under a definite plan, and (2) production property (except land and land rights) previously used by the utility in gas service, but retired from such service and held pending its reuse in the future, under a definite plan, in gas service. 


B. This account shall also include the original cost of land and land rights held under a plan for future use to insure a future supply of natural gas for use in pipeline operations, relating to leases acquired on or after October 8, 1969, to include land and land rights: (1) Acquired but never used by the utility in gas service, but held for service in the future under a plan, and (2) previously used by the utility in gas service, but retired from such service and held pending its reuse in the future under a plan, in gas service. (See Gas Plant Instruction 7.) 


C. In the event that property recorded in this account shall no longer be needed or appropriate for future utility operations, the company shall request Commission approval of journal entries to remove such property from this account when the gain realized from the sale or other disposition of the property is $100,000 or more, prior to their being recorded. Such filings shall include the description and original cost of individual properties removed from this account, the accounts charged upon removal, and any associated gains realized upon disposition of such property.


D. Gains or losses from the sale of land and land rights or other disposition of such property previously recorded in this account and not placed in utility service shall be recorded directly in accounts 411.6 or 411.7, as appropriate, except when determined to be significant by the Commission. Upon such determination, the amounts shall be transferred to account 256, Deferred Gains from Sale of Utility Plant, or account 187, Deferred Losses from Sale of Utility Plant, and amortized to accounts 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant or 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant, as appropriate. 


E. The property included in this account shall be classified according to the detailed accounts prescribed for natural gas production and gathering plant in service and such classification shall be maintained in the same detail as though the property were in service. 


At the end of the year or such other date as a balance sheet may be required by the Commission, this account shall include the total of the balances of work orders for gas plant which have been completed and placed in service but which work orders have not been classified for transfer to the detailed gas plant accounts. 


A. This account shall include the total of the balances of work orders for gas plant in process of construction. 


B. Work orders shall be cleared from this account as soon as practicable after completion of the job. Further, if a project, such as a gas production plant, a compressor station, or a transmission line, is designed to consist of two or more units which may be placed in service at different dates, any expenditures which are common to and which will be used in the operation of the project as a whole shall be included in gas plant in service upon the completion and the readiness for service of the first unit. Any expenditures which are identified exclusively with units of property not yet in service shall be included in this account. 


C. Expenditures on research, development, and demonstration projects for construction of utility facilities are to be included in a separate subdivision in this account. Records must be maintained to show separately each project along with complete detail of the nature and purpose of the research, development, and demonstration project together with the related costs. 


A. This account shall be credited with the following: 


(1) Amounts charged to account 403, Depreciation Expense, or to clearing accounts for current depreciation expense for gas plant in service.

(3) Amounts charged to account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, for depreciation expense on property included in account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use, or 105.1, Production Properties Held for Future Use. Include also, the balance of accumulated provision for depreciation on property when transferred to account 105 or 105.1, from other property accounts. Normally, account 108 will not be used for current depreciation provisions because, as provided herein, the service life during which depreciation is computed commences with the date property is includible in gas plant in service; however, if special circumstances indicate the propriety of current accruals for depreciation, such charges shall be made to account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income. 


(4) Amounts charged to account 413, Expenses of Gas Plant Leased to Others, for gas plant included in account 104, Gas Plant Leased to Others. 


(5) Amounts charged to account 416, Costs and Expenses of Merchandising, Jobbing and Contract Work, or to clearing accounts for current depreciation expense.

(7) Amounts charged to account 182.1, Extraordinary Property Losses, when authorized by the Commission. 


(8) Amounts of depreciation applicable to gas plant donated to the utility.


B. At the time of retirement of depreciable gas utility plant, this account shall be charged with the book cost of the property retired and the cost of removal and shall be credited with the salvage value and any other amounts recovered, such as insurance. When retirements, cost of removal and salvage are entered originally in retirement work orders, the net total of such work orders may be included in a separate subaccount hereunder. Upon completion of the work order, the proper distribution to subdivision of this account shall be made as provided in the following paragraph. 


C. For general ledger and balance sheet purposes, this account shall be regarded and treated as a single composite provision for depreciation. For purposes of analysis, however, each utility shall maintain subsidiary records in which this account is segregating according to the following functional classification for gas plant:


(1) Production—manufactured gas, (2) production and gathering—natural gas, (3) products extraction—natural gas, (4) underground gas storage, (5) other storage, (6) base load LNG terminaling and processing plant, (7) transmission, (8) distribution, and (9) general. These subsidiary records shall reflect the current credits and debits to this account in sufficient detail to show separately for each such functional classification (a) the amount of provision for depreciation, (b) the book cost of property retired, (c) cost of removal, (d) salvage, and (e) other items, including recoveries from insurance. Separate subsidiary records shall be maintained for the amount of accrued cost of removal other than legal obligations for the retirement of plant recorded in account 108, Accumulated provision for depreciation of gas utility plant. 


D. When transfers of plant are made from one gas plant account to another, or from or to another utility department, or from or to nonutility property accounts, the accounting for the related accumulated provision for depreciation shall be as provided in gas plant instruction 12. 


E. The utility is restricted in its use of the provision for depreciation to the purposes set forth above. It shall not transfer any portion of this account to retained earnings or make any other use thereof without authorization by the Commission. 

109 [Reserved]
111 Accumulated provision for amortization and depletion of gas utility plant. 


A. This account shall be credited with the following: 


(1) Amounts charged to account 404.1, Amortization and Depletion of Producing Natural Gas Land and Land Rights, for current amortization and depletion of such land and land rights. 


(2) Amounts charged to account 404.2, Amortization of Underground Storage Land and Land Rights, for current amortization. 


(3) Amounts charged to account 404.3, Amortization of Other Limited-Term Gas Plant, for the current amortization of limited-term gas plant. 


(4) Amounts charged to account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, for amortization expense on property included in account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use, or 105.1, Production Properties Held for Future Use. Include also, the balance of accumulated provision for amortization on property when transferred to account 105 or 105.1 from other property accounts. 


(5) Amounts charged to account 405, Amortization of Other Gas Plant. 


(6) Amounts charged to account 413, Expenses of Gas Plant Leased to Others, for current amortization thereof. 


(7) Amounts charged to account 797, Abandoned Leases, to provide for the abandonment of nonproductive natural gas leases. 


(8) Amounts charged to account 425, Miscellaneous Amortization, for the amortization of intangible or other gas plant which does not have a definite or terminable life and is not subject to charges for depreciation expense, with Commission approval.


B. When any property to which this account applies is sold, relinquished, or otherwise retired from service, this account shall be charged with the amount previously credited in respect to such property. The book cost of the property so retired less the amount chargeable to this account and less the net proceeds realized at retirement shall be included in account 421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property, or account 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property, as appropriate. 


C. For general ledger and balance sheet purposes, this account shall be regarded and treated as a single composite provision for amortization.


(1) Production—manufactured gas, (2) production and gathering—natural gas, (3) products extraction—natural gas, (4) underground gas storage, (5) other storage, (6) base load LNG terminaling and processing plant, (7) transmission, (8) distribution, and (9) general. These subsidiary records shall reflect the current credits and debits to this account in sufficient detail to show separately for each such functional classification (a) the amount of provision for amortization, (b) the book cost of property retired, (c) cost of removal, (d) salvage, and (e) other items, including recoveries from insurance. Records shall be maintained so as to show separately the balance applicable to each item of land and land rights which is being amortized or depleted except that natural gas land and land rights which comprise an interest in a production area may be grouped to form a unit for amortization and depletion and the accumulated provision applicable thereto need not be segregated to show the amount related to each gas right included therein. Records shall also be maintained so as to show separately the balance applicable to each underground gas storage project. 


D. The utility is restricted in its use of the accumulated provision for amortization to the purposes set forth above. It shall not transfer any portion of this account to retained earnings or make any other use thereof without authorization by the Commission. 

112-113 [Reserved]
114 Gas plant acquisition adjustments. 


A. This account shall include the difference between (a) the cost to the accounting utility of gas plant acquired as an operating unit or system by purchase, merger, consolidation, liquidation, or otherwise, and (b) the original cost, estimated, if not known, of such property, less the amount or amounts credited by the accounting utility at the time of acquisition to accumulated provisions for depreciation, depletion, and amortization and contributions in aid of construction with respect to such property. 


B. With respect to acquisitions after the effective date of this system of accounts, this account shall be subdivided so as to show the amounts included herein for each property acquisition and to gas plant in service, gas plant held for future use and gas plant leased to others. (See gas plant instruction 5.) 


C. Debit amounts recorded in this account related to plant and land acquisition may be amortized to account 425, Miscellaneous Amortization, over a period not longer than the estimated remaining life of the properties to which such amounts relate. Amounts related to the acquisition of land only may be amortized to account 425 over a period of not more than 15 years. Should a utility wish to account for debit amounts in this account in any other manner, it shall petition the Commission for authority to do so. Credit amounts recorded in this account shall be accounted for as directed by the Commission. 

115 Accumulated provision for amortization of gas plant acquisition adjustments. 


This account shall be credited or debited with amounts which are includible in account 406, Amortization of Gas Plant Acquisition Adjustments or account 425, Miscellaneous Amortization, for the purpose of providing for the extinguishment of amounts in account 114, Gas Plant Acquisition Adjustments, in instances where the amortization of account 114 is not being made by direct write-off of the account. 

116 Other gas plant adjustments. 


A. This account shall include the difference between the original cost, estimated if not known, and the book cost of gas plant to the extent that such difference is not properly includible in account 114 Gas Plant Acquisition Adjustments. (See gas plant instruction 1C.) 


B. Amounts included in this account shall be classified in such manner as to show the origin of each amount and shall be disposed of as the Commission may approve or direct. 


The investment in and use of system gas included in Account 117.1, Gas Stored—Base Gas, and Account 117.2, System Balancing Gas, may be accounted for using either the “fixed asset” method or an “inventory” method as set forth below. The cost of stored gas included in Account 117.3 must be accounted for using an inventory method. 


(a) *Inventory Method*—Gas stored during the year must be priced at cost according to generally accepted methods of cost determination consistently applied from year to year. Transmission expenses for facilities of the utility used in moving the gas to the storage area and expenses of storage facilities cannot be included in the inventory of gas except as may be authorized or directed by the Commission.


Withdrawals of gas must be priced using the first-in-first-out, last-in-first-out, or weighted average cost method, provided the method adopted by the utility is used consistently from year to year and appropriate inventory records are maintained. Approval of the Commission must be obtained for any other pricing method, or change in the pricing method adopted by the utility. 


Adjustments for inventory losses related to gas held in underground reservoirs due to cumulative inaccuracies of gas measurements, or from other causes, must be charged to Account 823, Gas Losses. Losses of system gas not associated with underground reservoirs must be charged to Account 813, Other Gas Supply Expenses. 


(b) *Fixed Asset Method*—When replacement of the gas is made, the amount carried in Account 117.4 for such volumes must be cleared with a contra entry to Account 808.2, Gas Delivered to Storage—Credit. Any difference between the utility's cost of replacement gas volumes and the amount cleared from Account 117.4 must be recognized as a gain in Account 495, Other gas revenues, or as a loss in Account 813, Other gas supply expenses, with contra entries to Account 808.2. 


Adjustments for inventory losses related to gas held in underground reservoirs due to cumulative inaccuracies of gas measurements, or from other causes, must be charged to Account 823, Gas Losses. Losses of system gas not associated with underground reservoirs must be charged to Account 813, Other Gas Supply Expenses. Gas losses must be priced at the market price of gas available to the utility in the month the loss is recognized. 


Gas owned by the utility and injected into its system will be deemed to satisfy any encroachment on system gas first before any other use. 

117.1 Gas stored-base gas.


This account is to include the cost of recoverable gas volumes that are necessary, in addition to those volumes for which cost are properly includable in Account 101, Gas plant in service, to maintain pressure and deliverability requirements for each storage facility. Nonrecoverable gas volumes used for this purpose are to be recorded in Account 352.3, Nonrecoverable natural gas. For utilities using the fixed asset method of accounting, the cost of base gas applicable to each gas storage facility shall not be changed from the amount initially recorded except to reflect changes in volumes designated as base gas. If an inventory method is used to account for gas included herein, the utility may, at its election, price withdrawals in accordance with the instructions to Account 117.4. 

117.2 System balancing gas.


This account is to be used to record the cost of system gas designated as available for transmission load balancing (including no-notice transportation) and other uses associated with maintaining efficient transmission operations other than gas properly recordable in Account 117.1 or the plant accounts. Detailed records must be kept separately identifying volumes and unit prices of system gas held in underground storage facilities and held in pipelines. 


For utilities using fixed asset accounting, the cost initially recorded herein cannot be changed except for adjustments to volumes designated as system gas. Encroachments upon system gas must be accounted for in accordance with the instructions to Account 117.4, Gas owed to system gas. 

117.3 Gas stored in reservoirs and pipelines—noncurrent.


This account is to include the cost of stored gas owned by the utility and available for sale or other purposes. Gas included in this account must be accounted for using an inventory method in accordance with the Special Instructions to Accounts 117.1, 117.2, and 117.3 above. 

117.4 Gas owed to system gas.


This account is to be used to record encroachments of system gas under the fixed asset method. This account may also be used to record encroachments of base gas for utilities electing to use an inventory method of accounting for system gas. Utilities may revalve cumulative net imbalances, net all transactions, and record one monthly entry with one month-end price for valuation purposes. 

118 Other utility plant. 


This account shall include the balance in accounts for utility plant, other than gas plant, such as electric, railway, etc.

This account shall include the book cost of fuel on hand. 


A. This account may include the cost of labor and of supplies used and expenses incurred in unloading fuel from the shipping medium and in the handling thereof prior to its use, if such expenses are sufficiently significant in amount to warrant being treated as a part of the cost of fuel inventory rather than being charged direct to expense as incurred. 


B. Amounts included herein shall be charged to expense as the fuel is used to the end that the balance herein, shall not exceed the expenses attributable to the inventory of fuel on hand. 


This account shall include the book cost of residuals or extracted products produced in the manufacture of gas or in natural gas products extraction operations including like products purchased for resale. 

154 Plant materials and operating supplies. 


A. This account shall include the cost of materials purchased primarily for use in the utility business for construction, operation and maintenance purposes.

(1) Reusable materials consisting of large individual items shall be included in this account at original cost, estimated if not known. The cost of repairing such items shall be charged to the maintenance account appropriate for the previous use. 


(2) Reusable materials consisting of relatively small items, the identity of which (from the date of original installation to the final abandonment or sale thereof) cannot be ascertained without undue refinement in accounting, shall be included in this account at current prices new for such items. The cost of repairing such items shall be charged to the appropriate expense account as indicated by previous use. 


(3) Scrap and nonusable materials included in this account shall be carried at the estimated net amount realizable therefrom. The difference between the amounts realized for scrap and nonusable materials sold and the net amount at which the materials were carried in this account, as far as practicable, shall be adjusted to the accounts credited when the materials were charged to this account. 


B. Materials and supplies issued shall be credited hereto and charged to the appropriate construction, operating expense, or other account on the basis of a unit price determined by the use of cumulative average, first-in-first out, or such other method of inventory accounting as conforms with accepted accounting standards consistently applied. 


This account shall include the book cost of materials and supplies, and appliances and equipment held primarily for merchandising, jobbing, and contract work. The principles prescribed in accounting for utility materials and supplies shall be observed in respect to items carried in this account. 

156 Other materials and supplies.

163 Stores expense undistributed. 


A. This account shall include the cost of supervision, labor and expenses incurred in the operation of general storerooms, including purchasing, storage, handling and distribution of materials and supplies. 


B. This account shall be cleared by adding to the cost of materials and supplies issued a suitable loading charge which will distribute the expense equitably over stores issues. The balance in the account at the close of the year shall not exceed the amount of stores expenses reasonably attributable to the inventory of materials and supplies exclusive of fuel, as any amount applicable to fuel cost should be included in account 152, Fuel Stock Expenses Undistributed. 


This account shall be debited with such amounts as are credited to Account 117.2, System balancing gas, (for utilities using an inventory method of accounting for system gas) and Account 117.3, Gas Stored in Reservoirs and Pipelines-Noncurrent, to reflect classification for balance sheet purposes of such portion of the inventory of gas stored as represents a current asset according to conventional rules for classification of current assets. 


A. This account shall include the cost of liquefied natural gas stored in above or below ground facilities. 


B. Natural gas purchased in a liquefied form shall be priced at the cost of such gas to the utility. Natural gas liquefied by the utility shall be priced according to generally accepted methods of cost determination consistently applied from year to year. Transmission expenses for facilities to the utility used in moving the gas to the storage facilities shall not be included in the inventory of gas except as may be authorized by the Commission. 


C. Amounts debited to this account for natural gas placed in stored shall be credited to account 808.2, Gas Delivered to Storage—Credit. Amounts credited to this account for gas withdrawn from storage shall be debited to account 808.1, Gas Withdrawn from Storage—Debit. 


D. Withdrawals of gas may be priced according to the first-in-first-out, last-in-first-out, or weighted average cost method provided the method adopted by the utility is used consistently from year to year and inventory records are maintained in accordance therewith. Commission approval must be obtained for any other pricing method or for any change in the pricing method adopted by the utility. Separate records shall be maintained for each storage project of the Dth of gas delivered to storage and remaining in storage. 


E. Adjustments for inventory losses shall be charged to account 842.3, Gas Losses. 

164.3 Liquefied natural gas held for processing.


A. This account shall include the cost of base load liquefied natural gas available for vaporization and injection into the utility's natural gas system.


B. Natural gas purchased in a liquefied form shall be priced at the cost of such gas to the utility. 


C. Amounts debited to this account for liquefied natural gas purchased for processing shall be credited to account 809.2, Deliveries of Natural Gas for Processing—Credit. Amounts credited for liquefied natural gas processed shall be debited to account 809.1, Withdrawals of Liquefied Natural Gas Held for Processing—Debit.


D. Withdrawals of gas held for vaporization may be priced according to the first-in-first-out, last-in-first-out or weighted average cost method provided the method adopted by the utility is used consistently from year to year and inventory records are maintained in accordance therewith. Commission approval must be obtained for any other pricing method or for any change from the pricing method adopted by the utility. Separate records shall be maintained for Dth of gas purchased for processing, processed, and remaining for processing.


E. Adjustments for inventory losses shall be charged to account 846.1, Gas Losses. 

165 Prepayments. 


A. This account shall include payments for undelivered gas and other prepayments of rents, taxes, insurance, interest, and like disbursements made prior to the period to which they apply. Prepayments for gas are those amounts paid to a seller of gas under “take or pay” provisions of a gas purchase contract for a sale certificated by the Commission where future makeup of the gas not taken in the current period is provided for by the contract. 


B. As the periods covered by such prepayments expire, credit this account and charge the proper operating expense or other appropriate account with the amount applicable to the period. 


C. This account shall be kept or supported in such a manner as to disclose the amount of each class of prepayments. 

166 Advances for gas exploration, development and production.


A. This account shall include all advances made for gas (whether called “advances,” “contributions” or otherwise) to independent producers, affiliated or associated companies, or others operating within the lower 48 states and Alaska; for exploration, development or production (but not to include lease acquisition) of natural gas. Under each agreement with payee, such payments must be made prior to initial gas deliveries, or if the agreement provides for advances on a well by well basis, each incremental payment must be made prior to deliveries from an incremental well, or prior to Federal and/or State authorization, as appropriate. All agreements executed after June 17, 1975, (issuance date of Order No. 529) shall specify that (1) the pipeline shall have first call on any gas produced, attributable to the advance payment, under a long-term contract which is for a minimum initial term computed as the lesser of fifteen years or the life of the reserve in the field, and (2) the selling price of the gas committed by producers whose sales are subject to price regulation shall be governed by and limited to the area rate or national rate or, under appropriate showing of special circumstance, such other rate as may be authorized by the Commission under the provisions of optional pricing and special relief. As a determination of the initial rate, the time of first delivery in interstate commerce to the purchaser shall govern. Non-current advances not to be repaid within a two-year period shall be reclassified and transferred to account 124, Other Investments, for balance sheet purposes. This transfer is for reporting purposes only and has no effect on accounting and ratemaking. 


B. When a pipeline obtains a working interest as a result of funds advanced to producers, such amounts shall be included in appropriate production accounts for formal contractual agreements executed prior to the date of issuance of Order No. 499. When an associated company obtains a working interest as a result of funds advanced from a pipeline company, the pipeline shall include such amounts in Account 123, Investment in Associated Companies, or Account 146, Accounts receivable from Associated Companies, as appropriate, for formal contractual commitments made during the period on or after November 10, 1971 (effective date of Order 441) but prior to December 29, 1972, the date of issuance of Order No. 465. 


C. Outstanding advances shall be fully reduced within 5 years, or as otherwise authorized by the Commission, from the date gas deliveries commence or the date it is determined that recovery will be in other than gas. This account shall be credited with advances not fully recovered within the five-year period, and the unrecovered portion charged directly to Account 426.5, Other Deductions. A sufficient portion of all gas taken should be credited to the related outstanding advance so as to eliminate the advance within the 5-year period or as otherwise authorized by the Commission upon request by the pipeline company. The reduction of the outstanding advance should not be dependent on a buyer purchasing more than 100 percent of the minimum take or pay quantity provided in the contract. In those instances where the five-year recovery period has lapsed, but recovery of the advance continues beyond the five-year period, the unrecovered advances shall be removed from this account and transferred to Account 167, Other Advances for Gas. 


D. Where recovery is by gas, the recovered advance shall be credited to this account and charged to the appropriate gas purchase account. 


E. When an advance which is or has been included in this account and in rate base results in a source of proven reserves of natural gas, gas deliveries commence but no gas flows to the pipeline company making such advance, the amount of the advance shall be removed from this account (and from rate base) and recorded in account 167, Other Advances for Gas. Any revenues collected as a result of the advance being included in rate base shall be refunded by the pipeline company to its customers, together with interest, per annum, at the rate established by Order No. 513, issued October 10, 1974, or as subsequently revised by Commission Order, from the date of payment until refunded, within 12 months after the removal of the advance from this account, unless otherwise directed by the Commission. Where there is partial recovery of the advance by gas, in this situation, the amount of the advance transferred from this account to account 167 and the amount of revenues refunded, with interest, shall be appropriately apportioned. 


F. However, if 5 years elapses from the time the advance has been included in this account and during such time no gas deliveries have commenced or no determination has been made that the recovery will be in economic consideration other than gas, the pipeline shall at the end of the 5-year period, transfer the advance from this account to Account 167, and cease rate base treatment thereof, unless otherwise directed by the Commission. 


G. Whenever as a result of an advance included in this account, a pipeline receives any amount in excess of a full recovery of the advance, e.g. interest income, such amount must be credited to Account 813, Other Gas Supply Expenses, or as otherwise directed by the Commission. If the income or return is received in other than money, it shall be included at the market value of the assets received. 


H.
