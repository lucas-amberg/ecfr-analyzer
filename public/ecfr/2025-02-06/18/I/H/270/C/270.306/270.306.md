# ยง 270.306   Devonian shale wells in Michigan.

A person seeking a determination that natural gas is being produced from the Devonian Age Antrim shale in Michigan shall file an application that contains the following items: 


(a) FERC Form No. 121; 


(b) All well completion reports; 


(c) A gamma ray log from the closest available well bore (producing or dry hole) that is within a one mile radius of the well for which a determination is sought, with superimposed indications of: 


(1) The shale base line and the gamma ray index of 0.7 over the Devonian age stratigraphic section penetrated by the well bore; and 


(2) The boundary between the Antrim shale and the overlying formation (Berea Sandstone, Ellsworth, Bedford, or Sunbury shales, or their equivalents); 


(d) A location plat showing the well for which the determination is sought and the well for which a gamma ray log has been filed; 


(e) A mud log from the well for which the determination is sought, with a detailed description of samples taken from 10-foot, or less, intervals through-out the Devonian age stratigraphic section penetrated by the well bore; 


(f) A driller's log, or similar report, from the well for which the determination is sought, indicating the general characteristics of the strata penetrated and the corresponding depths at which they are encountered throughout the Devonian age stratigraphic section penetrated by the well bore; 


(g) A reference to a standard stratigraphic chart or text establishing that the producing interval is a shale of Devonian age; and 


(h) A sworn statement: 


(1) Calculating the percentage of footage of the producing interval (or the Antrim Shale in the event the well is a dry hole) in the well for which a gamma ray log was submitted which is not Devonian shall as indicated by a gamma ray index of less than 0.7; 


(2) Demonstrating that the percentage of potentially disqualifying non-shale footage for the Devonian age stratigraphic section penetrated by the well bore for which the submitted gamma ray log is equal to or less than 5 percent; 


(3) Attesting that the natural gas is being produced from the Devonian Age Antrim shale through: 


(i) A well the surface drilling of which began after December 31, 1979, but before January 1, 1993; 


(ii) A recompletion commenced after January 1, 1993, in a well the surface drilling of which began after December 31, 1979, but before January 1, 1993; or 


(iii) A recompletion that was commenced after December 31, 1979 but before January 1, 1993, where such gas could not have been produced from any completion location in existence in the well bore before January 1, 1980 and


(4) Attesting the applicant has no knowledge of any information not described in the application which is inconsistent with his conclusion.
