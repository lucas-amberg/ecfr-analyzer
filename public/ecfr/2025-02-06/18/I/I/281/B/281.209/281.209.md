(a) *Applicability.* (1) This section sets forth the rules for attributing total essential agricultural requirements by an essential agricultural user, indirect essential agricultural requirements of an essential agricultural user by its local distribution company supplier and priority 1 and 2 entitlements by an interstate pipeline purchaser.


(2) This section does not apply to an essential agricultural user or local distribution company which receives all its natural gas supplies from a single source, or an interstate pipeline purchaser which does not receive natural gas from any other interstate pipeline.


(b) *Natural gas supplies included for purposes of attribution.* (1) For purposes of attribution in accordance with this section, natural gas from all direct sources, including but not limited to pipeline production, production by independent producers, production by affiliates, SNG facilities and natural gas purchased from local distribution companies, and interstate pipelines shall be included.


(2)(i) An essential agricultural user, which attributes under paragraph (d) a portion of the volumes which are its total essential agricultural requirements to a direct source of natural gas other than a direct supplier may not seek classification to priority 2 under ยง 281.207 for such portion of its total essential agricultural requirements.


(ii) A local distribution company which attributes under paragraph (e) a portion of the volumes which are its indirect essential agricultural requirements to a direct source of natural gas other than a direct supplier may not seek classification to priority 2 under ยง 281.207 for such portion of its indirect essential agricultural requirements.


(iii) An interstate pipeline purchaser which attributes under paragraph (f) a portion of the volumes of its priority 1 or 2 entitlements to a direct source of natural gas other than a direct supplier may not seek reclassification to priority 1 or classification to priority 2, respectively, for such portion of its priority 1 and 2 entitlements.


(c) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section:


(1) *Direct supplier* means, with respect to an essential agricultural user, an interstate pipeline or local distribution company which directly supplies such essential agricultural user, with respect to a local distribution company, an interstate pipeline which directly supplies such local distribution company and, with respect to an interstate pipeline purchaser, and interstate pipeline which directly supplies the interstate pipeline purchaser.


(2) *Base period* of a direct supplier means the fixed historical period in which entitlements of the customer of the direct supplier were established for purposes of the currently effective curtailment plan of such direct supplier.


(3) *Annual quantity entitlements* with respect to a particular direct supplier means the total entitlements an essential agricultural user, local distribution company or interstate pipeline is entitled to purchase from that direct supplier in a calendar year under the currently effective curtailment plan. 


(d) *Essential agricultural user.* (1) An essential agricultural user shall calculate its attributable essential agricultural requirements attributable to a particular direct supplier by multiplying its total essential agricultural requirements by the Annual Quantity Entitlements from such direct supplier and dividing the product (numerator) by the sum of all Annual Quantity Entitlements and all volumes received from sources not providing an Annual Quantity Entitlement to such user (denominator). 


(2) If an essential agricultural user does not have annual quantity entitlements only with respect to one of its direct suppliers, the attributable essential agricultural requirements attributable to such direct supplier shall be that part of the total essential agricultural requirements not attributed under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. 


(3) If an essential agricultural user does not have Annual Quantity Entitlements with respect to more than one of its direct suppliers, the attributable essential agricultural requirements attributable to a particular direct supplier shall be calculated by multiplying its total essential agricultural requirements by the total volume of natural gas received from such supplier in 1972 and dividing the product (numerator) by the total supplies of natural gas received from all sources in 1972 (denominator). 


(e) *Local distribution company.* A local distribution company shall calculate its attributable indirect essential agricultural requirements among its direct suppliers in the same manner as it attributed its supplies to its direct suppliers for purposes of establishing entitlements in the currently effective curtailment plans of such direct supplier. 


(f) *Interstate pipelines.* An interstate pipeline shall attribute Priority 1 and 2 entitlements respectively among its direct pipeline suppliers in the same manner as it attributed its supplies to its direct pipeline suppliers for purposes of establishing entitlements in the currently effective curtailment plans of such direct suppliers.
