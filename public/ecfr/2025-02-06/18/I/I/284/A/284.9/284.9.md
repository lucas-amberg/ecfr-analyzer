(2) An intrastate pipeline that provides transportation service under Subpart C may offer such transportation service on an interruptible basis.


(3) *Service on an interruptible basis* means that the capacity used to provide the service is subject to a prior claim by another customer or another class of service and receives a lower priority than such other classes of service.


(b) The provisions regarding non-discriminatory access, reasonable operational conditions, and limitations contained in ยง 284.7 (b), (c), and (f) apply to pipelines providing interruptible service under this section.
