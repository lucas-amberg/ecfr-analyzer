(a) *Method.* Service companies must use a method of depreciation that allocates in a systematic and rational manner the service value of depreciable property over the service life of the property.

(c) *Rate.* Service companies must use percentage rates of depreciation that are based on a method of depreciation that allocates the service value of depreciable property over the service life of the property.
