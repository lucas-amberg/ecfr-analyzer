# § 367.82   Rents.

(a) The rent expense accounts provided under the several functional groups of expense accounts must include all rents, including taxes paid by the lessee on leased property, for property used in the operations of the service company, except:


(1) Minor amounts paid for occasional or infrequent use of any property or equipment and all amounts paid for use of equipment that, if owned, would be includible in property accounts 391 to 398 (§§ 367.3910 to 367.3980), inclusive, that must be treated as an expense item and included in the appropriate functional account, and


(2) Rents that are chargeable to clearing accounts, and distributed from the clearing accounts to the appropriate account. If rents cover property used for more than one function, such as production and transmission, or by more than one department, the rents must be apportioned to the appropriate rent expense or clearing accounts of each department on an actual, or, if necessary, an estimated basis.


(b) When a portion of property or equipment rented from others for use in connection with service company operations is subleased, the revenue derived from the subleasing must be credited to the rent revenue account in operating revenues. However, if the rent was charged to a clearing account, amounts received from subleasing the property must be credited to the clearing account.


(c) The cost, when incurred by the lessee, of operating and maintaining leased property, must be charged to the accounts appropriate for the expense if the property were owned.


(d) The cost incurred by the lessee of additions and replacements to property leased from others must be accounted for as provided in Service Company Property Instruction in § 367.54.
