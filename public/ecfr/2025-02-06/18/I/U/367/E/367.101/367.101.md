# ยง 367.101   Accounts 231-243, Current and accrued liabilities.

Current and accrued liabilities are those obligations which have either matured or which become due within one year from the date of issuance or assumption, except for: bonds, receivers' certificates and similar obligations which must be classified as long-term debt until date of maturity; accrued taxes, such as income taxes, which must be classified as accrued liabilities even though payable more than one year from date; compensation awards, which must be classified as current liabilities regardless of date due; and minor amounts payable in installments which may be classified as current liabilities. If a liability is due more than one year from date of issuance or assumption by the service company, it shall be credited to a long-term debt account appropriate for the transaction, except, however, the current liabilities previously mentioned.
