(c) This account must be debited, and accounts 411.1, Provision for deferred income taxes-Credit, operating income (§ 367.4111), or 411.2, Provision for deferred income taxes-Credit, other income and deductions (§ 367.4112), as appropriate, must be credited with tax effects related to items described in paragraph (a) of this account where taxable income is higher than pretax accounting income due to differences between the periods in which revenue and expense transactions affect taxable income and the periods in which they enter into the determination of pretax accounting income.


(d) Records with respect to entries to this account, as described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, and the account balance, must be maintained so as to show the factors of calculation with respect to each annual amount of the item or class of items.


(e) The service company is restricted in its use of this account to the purposes described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. It must not transfer the balance in the account or any portion of the account to retained earnings or to any other account or make any use of the account except as provided in the text of this account, without prior approval of the Commission. Upon the disposition by sale, exchange, transfer, abandonment or premature retirement of items on which there is a related balance herein, this account must be charged with an amount equal to the related income tax effect, if any, arising from the disposition and accounts 411.1, Provision for deferred income taxes-Credit, operating income (§ 367.4111), or 411.2, Provision for deferred income taxes—Credit, other income and deductions (§ 367.4112), as appropriate, must be credited.


(f) When property is disposed of by transfer to a wholly-owned subsidiary, the related balance in this account also must be transferred. When the disposition relates to retirement of an item or items under a group method of depreciation where there is no tax effect in the year of retirement, no entries are required in this account if it can be determined that the related balance must be retained to offset future group item tax deficiencies.
