Include in this account the offsetting entry to the recording of amortization of discount or premium on interest bearing investments. (*See* account 419, Interest and dividend income (§ 367.4190).)


(b) This account must be maintained in a manner so as to show the investment in securities of, and advances to, each associate company together with full particulars regarding any of the investments that are pledged.
