# § 376.209   Continuity of Operations Plan and suspension of Commission operations.

(a)(1)(i) *Activation of COOP and suspension of Commission operations.* The Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan may be activated by the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate pursuant to § 376.205, as appropriate). In circumstances in which the Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan is activated, Commission headquarters operations may be temporarily disrupted in whole or in part or communications with Commission headquarters may be temporarily unavailable, either of which may prevent the public or the Commission from meeting regulatory or statutory requirements. After the Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan is activated, Commission operations other than emergency functions may be suspended in whole or in part by the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate, as appropriate). The provisions of this section are effective upon activation of the Continuity of Operations Plan and the subsequent suspension of Commission operations, in whole or in part, and shall remain in effect up to 30 days, or such shorter time than 30 days as the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate, as appropriate) determines to be appropriate, or such longer time than 30 days as the Commission (or the Commission's delegate pursuant to section 376.204 of this Part, as appropriate) determines to be appropriate. Resumption of Commission operations following activation of the Continuity of Operations Plan and any subsequent suspension of Commission operations, in whole or in part, may occur either simultaneously for all activities, or over time for just some activities, and in such manner and at such time, as the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate, as appropriate) or the Commission (or the Commission's delegate, as appropriate) determines to be appropriate.


(ii) *Notification of COOP activation and, following such activation, notification of suspension of Commission operations.* During periods when the Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan is activated and, following such activation, when Commission operations are subsequently suspended in whole or in part, the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate pursuant to § 376.205, as appropriate) will notify the public that the Continuity of Operations Plan has been activated and that Commission operations have been suspended in whole or in part by sending a press release announcing that fact to major wire services, industry press, and appropriate metropolitan area radio stations The Commission's Web site (*http://www.ferc.gov*) or the Commission's alternative Web site (*http://www.fercalt.gov*), as appropriate, will be activated and a notice that the Continuity of Operations Plan has been activated and that Commission operations have been suspended in whole or in part will be prominently displayed thereon. The Web site or alternative Web site, as appropriate, will act as a resource for the press, industry, and general public. An additional press release will be sent to appropriate media outlets and a notice will be prominently displayed on the Commission's Web site or alternative Web site, as appropriate, when the Continuity of Operations Plan is deactivated and the Commission's headquarters are reopened or reconstituted and Commission operations resume.


(2) *Activities continued during COOP.* Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, during periods when the Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan is activated and, following such activation, when Commission operations are subsequently suspended in whole or in part, the Commission will continue to conduct emergency functions. As part of its emergency functions, the Commission will act on requests to ensure continued construction of essential natural gas facilities with sensitive construction timelines, on Commencement of Service requests, and on completion of dam safety work, in a manner consistent with the maintenance of environmental protections. Also as part of its emergency functions, the Commission will ensure that its personnel are available to respond to plant accidents or reportable incidents at LNG facilities, and to address dam safety, public safety, and security incidents at jurisdictional hydropower projects and to address other matters involving the safety of human life or protection of property. Alternate channels of communication will include measures to ensure that these activities can go forward unhindered.


(b) *Standards of conduct for transmission service providers.* During periods when the Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan is activated and, following such activation, when Commission operations are suspended in whole or in relevant part, a Transmission Provider affected by the same emergency affecting the Commission may, for up to 30 days, or such other time as the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate pursuant to § 376.205, as appropriate) may direct, delay compliance with the requirement to report to the Commission each emergency that resulted in any deviation from the standards of conduct within 24 hours of such deviation. If the emergency prevents such Transmission Provider from posting information on its OASIS or Internet Web site, the Transmission Provider may, for up to 30 days, or such shorter time as the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate, as appropriate) may direct or such longer time as the Commission (or the Commission's delegate pursuant to § 376.204, as appropriate) may direct, also delay compliance with the requirements of § 358.4(a)(2) of this chapter to post this information on its OASIS or Internet Web site, as applicable.


(c) *Tolling of time periods for Commission action.* Unless otherwise directed, for those pending matters where the date that the Commission must act falls during the period when the Continuity of Operations Plan is activated and, following such activation, when Commission operations are suspended in whole or in relevant part and also during the 14 days thereafter, the Commission tolls, for purposes of further consideration, the time period in which the Commission must act.
