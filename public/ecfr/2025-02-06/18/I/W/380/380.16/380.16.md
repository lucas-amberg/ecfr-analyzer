(a) *Introduction.* (1) The applicant must submit an environmental report with any application that proposes the construction or modification of any facility identified in § 380.3(c)(3). The environmental report must include the 14 resource reports and related material described in this section.


(2) The detail of each resource report must be commensurate with the complexity of the proposal and its potential for environmental impact. Each topic in each resource report must be addressed or its omission justified, unless the data is not required for that type of proposal. If material required for one resource report is provided in another resource report or in another exhibit, it may be cross referenced. If any resource report topic is required for a particular project but is not provided at the time the application is filed, the environmental report must explain why it is missing and when the applicant anticipates it will be filed.


(b) *General requirements.* As appropriate, each resource report must:


(1) Address conditions or resources that are likely to be directly or indirectly affected by the project;


(2) Identify significant environmental effects expected to occur as a result of the project;


(3) Identify the effects of construction, operation (including malfunctions), and maintenance, as well as cumulative effects resulting from the incremental effects of the project when added to the effects of other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions;


(4) Identify measures proposed to enhance the environment or to avoid, mitigate, or compensate for adverse effects of the project; and


(5) Provide a list of publications, reports, and other literature or communications, including agency contacts, that were cited or relied upon to prepare each report. This list must include the names and titles of the persons contacted, their affiliations, and telephone numbers.

(iii) An identification of all borrow areas and quarry sites and an estimate of required quantities of suitable construction material; and


(iv) Stability and stress analyses for all major transmission structures and conductors under all probable loading conditions, including seismic, wind, and ice loading, as appropriate, in sufficient detail to permit independent staff evaluation.
