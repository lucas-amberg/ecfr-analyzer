# ยง 385.509   Admissibility of evidence (Rule 509).

(a) *General standard.* The presiding officer should exclude from evidence any irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious material. The presiding officer may also exclude from evidence any other material which the presiding officer determines is not of the kind which would affect reasonable and fair-minded persons in the conduct of their daily affairs.


(b) *Ruling on evidence.* (1) The presiding officer will rule on the admissibility of any evidence offered.


(2) If any participant objects to the admission or exclusion of evidence, the participant must state briefly the grounds for the objection.


(3) The presiding officer will not permit formal exceptions to any ruling on evidence. This prohibition against formal exceptions does not preclude a participant from raising, as an issue, the validity of any ruling on evidence later in the proceeding, consistent with Rule 711.
