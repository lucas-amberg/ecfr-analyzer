(1)(i) Were not known and could not, with the exercise of due care, have been known to the participant at the time they could have been raised in prior proceedings; or


(ii) Are facts or issues that the participant was not permitted to raise in prior proceedings on the contested order due to an adverse procedural ruling alleged to be erroneous; and


(2) Are necessary for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
