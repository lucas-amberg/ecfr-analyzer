# § 385.1109   Orders (Rule 1109).

(a) Staff will issue a decision and an order granting or denying the petition in whole or in part. The order will articulate the basis for the decision, noting any dispute with the factual assertions of the petitioner.


(b) In addition to service otherwise required under this subpart, Staff will serve the decision and order on the persons who sought and were denied an opportunity to participate in the proceeding under this subpart.


(c) If Staff fails to issue an order granting or denying the petition for adjustment within the determination period, the petitioner may treat the application as having been denied and may, within 30 days after the close of the determination period, request review thereof as prescribed in Rule 1110(a) (review of denials). For purposes of this paragraph, “determination period” means the 150 days commencing with the filing of the petition, unless Staff for good cause extends such period.


(d) An order of Staff issued under paragraph (a) of this section granting an adjustment, in whole or in part, is final 30 days after it is issued, unless, during such 30-day period:


(1) A petition for review is filed under subpart J of this subchapter in accordance with Rule 1110(a) (review of denials) in which case the order is final when the review process under subpart J has been completed; or


(2) The Commission directs that the order be reviewed under subpart J in accordance with Rule 1110(b), in which case the order is final when the review process under subpart J has been completed unless the Commission expressly states that the order shall be effective pending review proceeding.
