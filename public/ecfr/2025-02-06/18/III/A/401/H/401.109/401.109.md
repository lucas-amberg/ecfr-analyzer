# ยง 401.109   Time limitations.

(a) All time limitations established pursuant to this section shall begin as of the time at which a request for records is logged in by the Records Access Officer pursuant to ยง 401.108(c). An oral request for records shall not begin any time requirement. A written request for records sent elsewhere within the Commission shall not begin any time requirement until it is redirected to the Records Access Officer and is logged in accordance with ยง 401.108(c). A request that is expected to involve fees in excess of $50.00 will not be deemed received until the requester is promptly notified and agrees to bear the cost or has so indicated on the initial request.




(b) Within 10 working days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after a request for records is logged by the Records Access Officer, the record shall be furnished or a letter shall be sent to the person making the request determining whether, or the extent to which, the Commission will comply with the request, and, if any records are denied, the reasons therefor.




(1) If all of the records requested have been located and a final determination has been made with respect to disclosure of all of the records requested, the letter shall so state. 


(2) If all of the records have not been located or a final determination has not yet been made with respect to disclosure of all of the records requested, the letter shall state the extent to which the records involved shall be disclosed pursuant to the rules established in this part. 


(3) In the following unusual circumstances, the time for sending this letter may be extended by the Executive Director for up to an additional ten (10) working days by written notice to the person making the request setting forth the reasons for such extension and the time within which a determination is expected to be dispatched: 


(i) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the Commission's Headquarters. 


(ii) The need to search for, collect and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request. 


(iii) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the Commission having substantial subject-matter interest therein. 


(c) If any record is denied, the letter shall state the right of the person requesting such records to appeal any adverse determination to the Executive Director of the Commission. Such an appeal shall be filed within 30 days from receipt of the Records Access Officer's determination denying the requested information (where the entire request has been denied), or from the receipt of any information made available pursuant to the request (where the request has been denied in part). Within 20 working days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after receipt of any appeal, or any authorized extension, the Executive Director or the Executive Director's designee shall make a determination and notify the appellant of such determination. If the appeal is decided in favor of the appellant the requested information shall be promptly supplied as provided in this part. If on appeal the denial of the request for records is upheld in whole or in part, the appellant shall be entitled to appeal to the Commission at its regular meeting. In the event that the Commission confirms the Executive Director's denial the appellant shall be notified of the provisions for judicial review.




(d) If the request for records will result in a fee of more than $25, determination letter under paragraph (b) of this section shall specify or estimate the fee involved and may require prepayment, as well as payment of any amount not yet received as a result of any previous request, before the records are made available. If the fee is less than $25, prepayment shall not be required unless payment has not yet been received for records disclosed as a result of a previous request.




(e) Whenever possible, the determination letter required under paragraph (b) of this section, relating to a request for records that involves a fee of less than $25.00, shall be accompanied by the requested records. Where this is not possible, the records shall be forwarded as soon as possible thereafter. For requests for records involving a fee of more than $25.00, the records shall be forwarded as soon as possible after receipt of payment.
