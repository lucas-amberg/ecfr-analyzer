# § 430.9   Comprehensive plan policies.

The water resources within the Southeastern Pennsylvania Ground Water Protected Area shall be managed consistent with the Comprehensive Plan policies. For purposes of this ground water protected area, section 2.20.4 of the Water Code of the Delaware River Basin shall be applied using the following definition of the term “withdrawal limits”: 


(a) *Withdrawal limits.* Except as may be otherwise determined by the Commission to be in the public interest, withdrawals from the underground waters of the basin shall be limited to the maximum draft of all withdrawals from a ground water basin, aquifer, or aquifer system that can be sustained without rendering supplies unreliable, causing long-term progressive lowering of ground water levels, water quality degradation, permanent loss of storage capacity, or substantial impact on low flows of perennial streams. 


(b) [Reserved]
