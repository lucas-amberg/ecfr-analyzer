# ยง 701.53   Council decisions by Members.

Council decisions by Members may be made by direct vote at Council meetings or by a written communication which may provide for either a written or telephone response. Written communications shall state the time limit for voting on issues which they contain; however, extensions of time may be granted by the Director or Chairman when it is deemed necessary. Issues raised at Council meetings shall be decided by majority vote of Members present and voting. Issues identified in written communications must receive approval of all Members. If an action item does not receive approval of all Members, it will be considered as an agenda item at the next Council meeting. For purposes of this section, approval of all Members shall be defined as approval without a negative vote within the time limit for voting provided within each action memorandum.
