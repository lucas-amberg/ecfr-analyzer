# ยง 701.207   Extension of time limits for WRC initial and final determinations.

(a) In unusual circumstances, as specified in this section, the time limits prescribed in either ยง 701.203 or ยง 701.204 may be extended by written notice from the responsible WRC official (i.e., the Public Information Officer in instances of initial requests and the Director in instances of appeals) to the requester setting forth the reasons for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. No such notice shall specify a date that would result in an extension for more than ten (10) working days, and in no event shall the total extended time exceed ten (10) working days with respect to a particular request. 


(b) As used in this section, *unusual circumstances* means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request: 


(1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request; 


(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or 


(3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.
