The maintenance of unusually high standards of honesty, integrity, impartiality, and conduct by employees and special Government employees is essential to assure the proper performance of the Water Resources Council's (hereafter referred to as the Council) business and the maintenance of confidence by citizens in their Government. The avoidance of misconduct and conflicts of interest on the part of employees and special Government employees through informed judgment is indispensable to the maintenance of these standards. To accord with these concepts, this part sets forth the Council's regulations prescribing standards of conduct and responsibilities and governing statements of employment and financial interests for employees and special Government employees.
