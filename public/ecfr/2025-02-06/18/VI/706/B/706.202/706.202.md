# ยง 706.202   Gifts, entertainment, and favors.

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, an employee shall not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of monetary value, from a person who: 


(1) Has, or is seeking to obtain, contractual or other business or financial relations with the Council; 


(2) Conducts operations or activities that are regulated by the Council; or 


(3) Has interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of his official duty. 


(b) The restrictions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to: 


(1) Obvious family or personal relationships, such as those between the employee and his parents, children, or spouse, when the circumstances make it clear that those relationships rather than the business of the persons concerned are the motivating factors; 


(2) The acceptance of food and refreshments of nominal value on infrequent occasions in the ordinary course of a luncheon or dinner meeting or other meeting or on an inspection tour where an employee may be properly in attendance; 


(3) The acceptance of loans from banks or other financial institutions on customary terms to finance proper and usual activities of employees, such as home mortgage loans; and 


(4) The acceptance of unsolicited advertising or promotional material, such as pens, pencils, note pads, calendars, and other items of nominal intrinsic value. 


(c) An employee shall not solicit a contribution from another employee for a gift to an official superior, make a donation as a gift to an official superior, or accept a gift from an employee receiving less pay than himself (5 U.S.C. 7351). However, this paragraph does not prohibit a voluntary gift of nominal value or donation in a nominal amount made on a special occasion such as marriage, illness, or retirement. 


(d) An employee shall not accept a gift, present, decoration, or other thing from a foreign government unless authorized by Congress as provided by the Constitution and in 5 U.S.C. 7342. 


(e) Neither this section nor ยง 706.203 precludes an employee from receipt of bona fide reimbursement, unless prohibited by law, for expenses of travel and such other necessary subsistence as is compatible with this part for which no Government payment or reimbursement is made. However, this paragraph does not allow an employee to be reimbursed, or payment to be made on his behalf, for excessive personal living expenses, gifts, entertainment, or other personal benefits, nor does it allow an employee to be reimbursed by a person for travel on official business under Council orders when reimbursement is proscribed by Decision B-128527 of the Comptroller General dated March 7, 1967.
