(c) If an application is not approved by the Council, it shall be returned by registered mail with a full explanation of the reasons for that determination.

Should the State determine that further review is required by the State clearinghouse under OMB Circular A-95, an additional 30 days will be allowed.

The Council will review the proposed revision and notify the State of its decision no later than 30 days from the date of receipt of the request.
