# ยง 806.7   Concurrent project review by member jurisdictions.

(a) The Commission recognizes that agencies of the member jurisdictions will exercise their review and approval authority and evaluate many proposed projects in the basin. The Commission will adopt procedures to assure compatibility between jurisdictional review and Commission review.


(b) To avoid duplication of work and to cooperate with other government agencies, the Commission may develop administrative agreements or other cooperative arrangements, in accordance with the procedures outlined in this part, with appropriate agencies of the member jurisdictions regarding joint review of projects. These agreements or arrangements may provide for joint efforts by staff, delegation of authority by an agency or the Commission, or any other matter to support cooperative review activities. Permits issued by a member jurisdiction agency shall be considered Commission approved if issued pursuant to an administrative agreement or other cooperative arrangement with the Commission specifically providing therefor.
