(3) Maintain metering or other approved methods so as to provide a continuous, accurate record of the withdrawal or consumptive use.


(4) Measure groundwater levels in all approved production and other wells, as specified by the Commission.


(5) Measure groundwater levels at additional monitoring locations, as specified by the Commission.


(6) Measure water levels in surface storage facilities, as specified by the Commission.


(7) Measure stream flows, passby flows or conservation releases, as specified by the Commission, using methods and at frequencies approved by the Commission.


(8) Perform other monitoring for impacts to water quantity, water quality and aquatic biological communities, as specified by the Commission.


(b) *Reporting.* (1) Project sponsors whose projects are approved under this section shall report to the Commission on a quarterly basis on forms and in a manner prescribed by the Commission all information recorded under paragraph (a) of this section, unless otherwise specified by the Commission.


(2) Project sponsors whose projects are approved under this section shall report to the Commission:
