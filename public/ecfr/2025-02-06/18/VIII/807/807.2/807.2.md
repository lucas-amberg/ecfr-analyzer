# ยง 807.2   Time limits.

(a) Except for agricultural water use projects, all registration forms shall be submitted within one year after May 11, 1995, or within six months of initiation of the water withdrawal or diversion, whichever is later; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall limit the responsibility of a project sponsor to apply for and obtain an approval as may be required under part 806 of this chapter. All registered withdrawals shall re-register with the Commission within five years of their initial registration, and at five-year intervals thereafter, unless the withdrawal is sooner discontinued. Upon notice by the Executive Director, compliance with a registration or reporting requirement, or both, of a member state that is substantially equivalent to this requirement shall be considered compliance with this requirement.


(b) Project sponsors whose existing agricultural water use projects i.e., projects coming into existence prior to March 31, 1997) withdraw or divert in excess of an average of 10,000 gpd for any consecutive 30-day period from a ground or surface water source shall register their use no later than March 31, 1997. Thereafter, project sponsors of new projects proposing to withdraw or divert in excess of 10,000 gpd for any consecutive 30-day period from a ground or surface water source shall be registered prior to project initiation.
