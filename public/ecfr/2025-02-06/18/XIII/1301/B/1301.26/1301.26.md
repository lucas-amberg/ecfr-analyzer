# § 1301.26   Special procedures—medical records.

If, in the judgment of TVA, the transmission of medical records, including psychological records, directly to a requesting individual could have an adverse effect upon such individual, TVA may refuse to disclose such information directly to the individual. TVA will, however, disclose this information to a licensed health care provider or legal representative designated by the individual in writing who should then provide the records to the individual along with any necessary interpretations.
