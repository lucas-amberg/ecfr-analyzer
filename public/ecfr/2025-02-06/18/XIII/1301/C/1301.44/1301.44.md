(a) TVA shall make a public announcement of the time, place, and subject matter of each meeting, whether it is to be open or closed to the public, and the name and telephone number of a TVA official who can respond to requests for information about the meeting. 


(b) Such public announcement shall be made at least one week before the meeting unless a majority of the members determines by a recorded vote that TVA business requires that such meeting be called at an earlier date. If an earlier date is so established, TVA shall make such public announcement at the earliest practicable time.


(c) Following a public announcement required by paragraph (a) of this section, the time or place of the meeting may be changed only if TVA publicly announces the change at the earliest practicable time. The subject matter of a meeting or the determination to open or close a meeting or portion of a meeting to the public may be changed following the public announcement required by paragraph (a) of this section only if a majority of the entire membership determines by a recorded vote that TVA business so requires and that no earlier announcement of the change was possible and if TVA publicly announces such change and the vote of each member upon such change at the earliest, practicable time. 


(d) Immediately following each public announcement required by this section, notice of the time, place, and subject matter of a meeting, whether the meeting is open or closed, any change in one of the preceding, and the name and phone number of the TVA official designated to respond to requests for information about the meeting shall be submitted for publication in the _Federal Register._
