# ยง 1302.10   Decisions and notices.

(a) *Decision by a member of the TVA Board or a hearing examiner.* A member of the TVA Board or a hearing examiner who holds the hearing shall either make an initial decision or certify the entire record, including the Board member's or examiner's recommended findings and proposed decision, to the TVA Board for a final decision. A copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the recipient. Where the initial decision is made by a member of the TVA Board or a hearing examiner, the recipient may file exceptions to the initial decision, together with a statement of reasons therefor. Such exceptions and statement shall be filed with the TVA Board within 30 days of the date the notice of initial decision was mailed to the recipient. In the absence of exceptions, the TVA Board may on its own motion within 45 days after the initial decision serve on the recipient a notice that the TVA Board will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of such notice of review, the TVA Board shall review the initial decision and issue its own decision thereon including the reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of review, the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the TVA Board.


(b) *Decisions on record or review by the TVA Board.* Whenever a record is certified to the TVA Board for decision or it reviews the decision of a member of the TVA Board or a hearing examiner pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or whenever the TVA Board conducts the hearing, the recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with the Board briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the Board shall be given in writing to the recipient and to the complainant, if any. 


(c) *Decisions on record where a hearing is waived.* Whenever a hearing is waived pursuant to ยง 1302.8(a) a decision shall be made by the TVA Board on the record and a copy of such decision shall be given to the recipient, and to the complainant, if any. 


(d) *Rulings required.* Each decision shall set forth a ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is found that the recipient has failed to comply. 


(e) *Approval by TVA Board.* Any final decision (other than a decision by the TVA Board) which provides for the suspension or termination of, or the refusal to grant or continue financial assistance, or the imposition of any other sanction available under this regulation or the Act, shall promptly be transmitted to the TVA Board, which may approve such decision, may vacate it, or remit or mitigate any sanction imposed. 


(f) *Content of orders.* The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this part, including provisions designed to assure that no financial assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be extended to the recipient determined by such decision to have failed to comply with this part, unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies TVA that it will fully comply with this part. 


(g) *Posttermination proceedings.* (1) A recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this regulation and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this regulation.


(2) Any recipient or proposed recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request TVA to restore fully the recipient's eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If TVA determines that those requirements have been satisfied, TVA shall restore such eligibility.


(3) If TVA denies any such request, the recipient may submit a written request for a hearing specifying why it believes TVA to have been in error. The recipient shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by TVA. The recipient will be restored to such eligibility if the recipient proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.
