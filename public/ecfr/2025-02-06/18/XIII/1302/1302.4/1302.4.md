(5) *White, not of Hispanic origin.* A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, North Africa, or the Middle East.


(b) *Specific discriminatory actions prohibited.* (1) A recipient receiving Federal financial assistance from TVA may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, on ground of race, color, or national origin:


(i) Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program; 


(ii) Provide any service, financial aid or other benefit to an individual which is different, or is provided in a different manner, from that provided to others under the program; 


(iii) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in any manner related to that individual's receipt of any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;


(iv) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program; 


(v) Treat an individual differently from others in determining whether any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, membership, or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program has been satisfied.


(vi) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program through the provision of services or otherwise or afford that individual an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program.


(2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respect individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin. 


(3) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this regulation. 


(4) As used in this section the services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under a program receiving financial assistance shall be deemed to include any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of the financial assistance. 


(5) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in this paragraph does not limit the generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section. 


(6) This regulation does not prohibit the consideration of race, color, or national origin if the purpose and effect are to remove or overcome the consequences of practices or impediments which have restricted the availability of, or participation in, the program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin. Where previous discriminatory practice or usage tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to which this regulation applies, the recipient has an obligation to take reasonable action to remove or overcome the consequences of the prior discriminatory practice or usage, and to accomplish the purposes of the Act.
