(a) The Contractor may elect to have the appeal processed under this section if the amount in dispute is $50,000 or less. The amount shall be determined by totalling the amounts claimed by TVA and Contractor.

In such case, the Hearing Officer will promptly furnish the parties a typed copy of the decision, which shall constitute the final decision.
