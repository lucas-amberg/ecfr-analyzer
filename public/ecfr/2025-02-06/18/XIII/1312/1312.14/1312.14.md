# ยง 1312.14   Determination of archaeological or commercial value and cost of restoration and repair.

(a) *Archaeological value.* For purposes of this part, the archaeological value of any archaeological resource involved in a violation of the prohibitions in ยง 1312.4 of this part or conditions of a permit issued pursuant to this part shall be the value of the information associated with the archaeological resource. This value shall be appraised in terms of the costs of the retrieval of the scientific information which would have been obtainable prior to the violation. These costs may include, but need not be limited to, the cost of preparing a research design, conducting field work, carrying out laboratory analysis, and preparing reports as would be necessary to realize the information potential.


(b) *Commercial value.* For purposes of this part, the commercial value of any archaeological resource involved in a violation of the prohibitions in ยง 1312.4 of this part or conditions of a permit issued pursuant to this part shall be its fair market value. Where the violation has resulted in damage to the archaeological resource, the fair market value should be determined using the condition of the archaeological resource prior to the violation, to the extent that its prior condition can be ascertained.

(1) Reconstruction of the archaeological resource;


(2) Stabilization of the archaeological resource;


(3) Ground contour reconstruction and surface stabilization; 


(4) Research necessary to carry out reconstruction or stabilization; 


(5) Physical barriers or other protective devices, necessitated by the disturbance of the archaeological resource, to protect it from further disturbance;
