# ยง 10.104   Temporary importation entries for United States Government agencies.

The entry of articles brought into the United States temporarily by an agency or office of the United States Government and claimed to be exempt from duty under Chapter 98, Subchapter XIII, Heading 9813, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), shall be made on Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent.
