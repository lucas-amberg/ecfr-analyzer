(c) If the shipment is from any beneficiary country to the U.S. through the territory of any non-beneficiary country, and the invoices and other documents do not show the U.S. as the final destination, the articles in the shipment upon arrival in the U.S. are imported directly only if they:


(1) Remained under the control of the customs authority of the intermediate country;


(2) Did not enter into the commerce of the intermediate country except for the purpose of sale other than at retail, and the Center director is satisfied that the importation results from the original commericial transaction between the importer and the producer or the latter's sales agent; and
