(a) *General.* A spirituous beverage that is imported directly from the territory of Canada and that is classifiable under subheading 2208.40 or 2208.90, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), will be entitled, upon entry or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption, to duty-free treatment under section 213(a)(6) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (19 U.S.C. 2703(a)(6)), also known as the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), if the spirituous beverage has been produced in the territory of Canada from rum, provided that the rum: 


(1) Is the growth, product, or manufacture either of a beneficiary country or of the U.S. Virgin Islands; 


(2) Was imported directly into the territory of Canada from a beneficiary country or from the U.S. Virgin Islands; and

(b) *Claim for exemption from duty under CBI.* A claim for an exemption from duty for a spirituous beverage under section 213(a)(6) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (19 U.S.C. 2703(a)(6)) may be made by entering such beverage under subheading 9817.22.05, HTSUS, on the entry summary document or its electronic equivalent. In order to claim the exemption, the importer must have the records described in paragraphs (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this section so that, upon Customs request, the importer can establish that: 


(1) The rum used to produce the beverage is the growth, product or manufacture either of a beneficiary country or of the U.S. Virgin Islands; 


(2) The rum was shipped directly from a beneficiary country or from the U.S. Virgin Islands to Canada;

(ii) If the shipment is from the territory of Canada to the U.S. through the territory of any other country, the spirituous beverages do not enter into the commerce of any other country while en route to the U.S.; or 


(iii) If the shipment is from the territory of Canada to the U.S. through the territory of another country, and the invoices and other documents do not show the U.S. as the final destination, the spirituous beverages in the shipment are imported directly only if they: 


(A) Remained under the control of the customs authority of the intermediate country; 


(B) Did not enter into the commerce of the intermediate country except for the purpose of sale other than at retail, and the Center director is satisfied that the importation results from the original commercial transaction between the importer and the producer or the latter's sales agent; and 


(C) Were not subjected to operations other than loading and unloading, and other activities necessary to preserve the products in good condition. 


(2) “Imported directly” from a beneficiary country or from the U.S. Virgin Islands into the territory of Canada means: 


(i) Direct shipment from a beneficiary country or from the U.S. Virgin Islands into the territory of Canada without passing through the territory of any non-beneficiary country; or 


(ii) If the shipment is from a beneficiary country or from the U.S. Virgin Islands into the territory of Canada through the territory of any non-beneficiary country, the rum does not enter into the commerce of any non-beneficiary country while en route to Canada; or 


(iii) If the shipment is from a beneficiary country or from the U.S. Virgin Islands into the territory of Canada through the territory of any non-beneficiary country, the rum in the shipment is imported directly into the territory of Canada only if it:

(B) Did not enter into the commerce of the intermediate country except for the purpose of sale other than at retail; and 


(C) Was not subjected to operations in the intermediate country other than loading and unloading, and other activities necessary to preserve the product in good condition.

This evidence may include documents such as a bill of lading, invoice, air waybill, freight waybill, or cargo manifest. Any evidence of the direct shipment of these spirituous beverages from Canada into the U.S. may be subject to such verification as deemed necessary by the Center director. 


(2) *Rum imported into Canada from beneficiary country or U.S. Virgin Islands.* The importer must be prepared to provide to the Center director, if requested, evidence that the rum used in producing the spirituous beverages was imported directly into the territory of Canada from a beneficiary country or from the U.S. Virgin Islands, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. This evidence may include documents such as a Canadian customs entry, Canadian customs invoice, Canadian customs manifest, cargo manifest, bill of lading, landing certificate, airway bill, or freight waybill.

(e) *Origin of rum used in production of the spirituous beverage*—(1) *Origin criteria.* In order for a spirituous beverage covered by this section to be entitled to duty-free entry under the CBI, the rum used in producing the spirituous beverage in the territory of Canada must be wholly the growth, product, or manufacture either of a beneficiary country under the CBI or of the U.S. Virgin Islands, or must constitute a new or different article of commerce that was produced or manufactured in a beneficiary country or in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Such rum will not be considered to have been grown, produced, or manufactured in a beneficiary country or in the U.S. Virgin Islands by virtue of having merely undergone blending, combining or packaging operations, or mere dilution with water or mere dilution with another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the product. 


(2) *Evidence of origin of rum*—(i) *Declaration.* The importer must be prepared to submit directly to the Center director, if requested, a declaration prepared and signed by the person who produced or manufactured the rum, affirming that the rum is the growth, product or manufacture of a beneficiary country or of the U.S. Virgin Islands. While no particular form is prescribed for the declaration, it must include all pertinent information concerning the processing operations by which the rum was produced or manufactured, the address of the producer or manufacturer, the title of the party signing the declaration, and the date it is signed. 


(ii) *Records supporting declaration.* The supporting records, including those production records, that are necessary for the preparation of the declaration must also be available for submission to the Center director if requested. The declaration and any supporting evidence as to the origin of the rum may be subject to such verification as deemed necessary by the Center director. 


(f) *Canadian processor declaration; supporting documentation*—(1) *Canadian processor declaration.* The importer must be prepared to submit directly to the Center director, if requested, a declaration prepared by the person who produced the spirituous beverage(s) in Canada, setting forth all pertinent information concerning the production of the beverages.

(2) *Availability of supporting documents.* The information, including any supporting documents and records, necessary for the preparation of the declaration, as described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, must be available for submission to the Center director, if requested. The declaration and any supporting evidence may be subject to such verification as deemed necessary by the Center director. The specific documentary evidence necessary to support the declaration consists of those documents and records which satisfactorily establish: 


(i) The receipt of the rum by the Canadian processor, including the date of receipt and the name and address of the party from whom the rum was received (the owner or exporter in the beneficiary country or the U.S. Virgin Islands); and 


(ii) For each lot of beverage produced and included in the declaration, the specific identification of the production lot(s) involved; the quantity of qualifying rum that is used in producing the finished beverage, including a description of the processing and of the finished products; the alcoholic content by volume of the finished beverage; and the alcoholic content by volume of the finished beverage, expressed as a percentage, that is attributable to the qualifying rum. 


(g) *Importer system for review of necessary recordkeeping.* The importer will establish and implement a system of internal controls which demonstrate that reasonable care was exercised in its claim for duty-free treatment under the CBI. These controls should include tests to assure the accuracy and availability of records that establish: 


(1) The origin of the rum; 


(2) The direct shipment of the rum from a beneficiary country or from the U.S. Virgin Islands to Canada; 


(3) The alcohol content of the finished beverage imported from Canada; and
