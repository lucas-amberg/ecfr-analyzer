# § 10.204   Imported directly.

In order to be eligible for duty-free treatment under the ATPA, an article shall be imported directly from a beneficiary country into the customs territory of the United States. For purposes of this requirement, the words “imported directly” mean:


(a) Direct shipment from any beneficiary country to the United States without passing through the territory of any non-beneficiary country; or


(b) If shipment from any beneficiary country to the United States was through the territory of a non-beneficiary country, the articles in the shipment did not enter into the commerce of the non-beneficiary country while en route to the United States, and the invoices, bills of lading, and other shipping documents show the United States as the final destination; or


(c) If shipment from any beneficiary country to the United States was through the territory of a non-beneficiary country and the invoices and other documents do not show the United States as the final destination, then the articles in the shipment, upon arrival in the United States, are imported directly only if they:


(1) Remained under the control of the customs authority in the intermediate country;


(2) Did not enter into the commerce of the intermediate country except for the purpose of sale other than at retail, and the articles are imported into the United States as a result of the original commercial transaction between the importer and the producer or the latter's sales agent; and


(3) Were not subjected to operations in the intermediate country other than loading and unloading, and other activities necessary to preserve the articles in good condition.
