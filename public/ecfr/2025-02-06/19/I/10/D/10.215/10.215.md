# ยง 10.215   Filing of claim for preferential treatment.

(a) *Declaration.* In connection with a claim for preferential treatment for a textile or apparel article described in ยง 10.213, the importer must make a written declaration that the article qualifies for that treatment. The inclusion on the entry summary, or equivalent documentation, of the subheading within Chapter 98 of the HTSUS under which the article is classified will constitute the written declaration. Except in any of the circumstances described in ยง 10.216(d)(1), the declaration required under this paragraph must be based on an original Certificate of Origin that has been completed and properly executed in accordance with ยง 10.214, that covers the article being imported, and that is in the possession of the importer.


(b) *Corrected declaration.* If, after making the declaration required under paragraph (a) of this section, the importer has reason to believe that a Certificate of Origin on which a declaration was based contains information that is not correct, the importer must within 30 calendar days after the date of discovery of the error make a corrected declaration and pay any duties that may be due. A corrected declaration will be effected by submission of a letter or other written statement to the CBP port where the declaration was originally filed.
