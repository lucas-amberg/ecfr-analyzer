# § 10.255   Filing of claim for preferential treatment.

(a) *Declaration.* In connection with a claim for preferential treatment for an article described in § 10.253(a), the importer must make a written declaration that the article qualifies for that treatment. The written declaration should be made by including on the entry summary, or equivalent documentation, the symbol “J + ” as a prefix to the subheading of the HTSUS in which the article in question is classified. Except in any of the circumstances described in § 10.256(d)(1), the declaration required under this paragraph must be based on a complete and properly executed original Certificate of Origin that covers the article being imported and that is in the possession of the importer.


(b) *Corrected declaration.* If, after making the declaration required under paragraph (a) of this section, the importer has reason to believe that a Certificate of Origin on which a declaration was based contains information that is not correct, the importer must within 30 calendar days after the date of discovery of the error make a corrected declaration and pay any duties that may be due. A corrected declaration will be effected by submission of a letter or other written statement to the Customs port where the declaration was originally filed.
