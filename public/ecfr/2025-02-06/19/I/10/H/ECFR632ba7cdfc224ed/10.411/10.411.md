(iii) The legal name, address, telephone and e-mail address of the producer of the good (if known);


(iv) A description of the good for which preferential tariff treatment is claimed, which must be sufficiently detailed to relate it to the invoice and the HS nomenclature;


(v) The HTSUS tariff classification, to six or more digits, as necessary for the specific change in tariff classification rule for the good set forth in General Note 26(n), HTSUS;

The certification must include the legal name and address of the responsible official or authorized agent signing the certification, and should include that person's telephone and e-mail address, if available. If the person making the certification is not the producer of the good, or the producer's authorized agent, the person may sign the certification of origin based on:
