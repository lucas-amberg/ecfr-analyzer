# ยง 10.423   Certificate of eligibility not required.

(a) *General.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an importer will not be required to submit a certificate of eligibility for:


(1) A non-commercial importation of a good; or


(2) A commercial importation of a good whose value does not exceed U.S. $2,500, or the equivalent amount in Chilean currency.


(b) *Exception.* If the Center director determines that an importation described in paragraph (a) of this section may reasonably be considered to have been carried out or planned for the purpose of evading compliance with the rules and procedures governing TPL claims for preference under the US-CFTA, the Center director will notify the importer in writing that for that importation the importer must submit to CBP a valid certificate of eligibility. The importer must submit such a certificate within 30 calendar days from the date of the written notice. Failure to timely submit the certificate will result in denial of the claim for preferential tariff treatment.
