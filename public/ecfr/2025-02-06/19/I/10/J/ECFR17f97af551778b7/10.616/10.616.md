(1) Written requests for information from the importer, exporter, or producer;


(2) Written questionnaires to the importer, exporter, or producer;


(3) Visits to the premises of the exporter or producer in the territory of the Party in which the good is produced, to review the records of the type referred to in ยง 10.589(c)(1) of this subpart or to observe the facilities used in the production of the good, in accordance with the framework that the Parties develop for conducting verifications; and


(4) Such other procedures to which the United States and the exporting Party may agree.
