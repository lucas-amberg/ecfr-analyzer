# § 10.708   Effect of noncompliance; failure to provide documentation regarding third-country transportation.

(a) *Effect of noncompliance.* If the importer fails to comply with any requirement under this subpart, including submission of a complete declaration under § 10.704 of this subpart, when requested, the Center director may deny preferential tariff treatment to the imported good.


(b) *Failure to provide documentation regarding third country transportation.* Where the requirements for preferential tariff treatment set forth elsewhere in this subpart are met, the Center director nevertheless may deny preferential treatment to a good if the good is shipped through or transshipped in a country other than Jordan or the United States, and the importer of the good does not provide, at the request of the Center director, evidence demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Center director that the good was “imported directly”, as that term is defined in § 10.711(a) of this subpart.
