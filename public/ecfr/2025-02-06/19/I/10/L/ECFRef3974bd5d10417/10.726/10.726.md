# ยง 10.726   Supporting statement not required.

(a) *General.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an importer will not be required to submit a supporting statement under ยง 10.724 for:


(1) A non-commercial importation of a good; or


(2) A commercial importation for which the value of the originating goods does not exceed U.S. $2,500.


(b) *Exception.* If the port director determines that an importation described in paragraph (a) of this section may reasonably be considered to have been carried out or planned for the purpose of evading compliance with the rules and procedures governing claims for preference under the AFTA, the port director will notify the importer that for that importation the importer must submit to CBP a supporting statement. The importer must submit such a statement within 30 days from the date of the notice. Failure to timely submit the supporting statement will result in denial of the claim for preferential tariff treatment.
