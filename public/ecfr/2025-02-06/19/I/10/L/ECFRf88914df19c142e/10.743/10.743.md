# § 10.743   Special rule for verifications in Australia of U.S. imports of textile and apparel goods.

(a) *Procedures to determine whether a claim of origin is accurate.* For the purpose of determining that a claim of origin for a textile or apparel good is accurate, CBP may request that the government of Australia conduct a verification, regardless of whether a claim is made for preferential tariff treatment. While a verification under this paragraph is being conducted, CBP, if directed by the President, may take appropriate action which may include suspending the application of preferential tariff treatment to the textile or apparel good for which a claim of origin has been made. If an exporter, producer, or other person refuses to consent to a visit as provided for in this paragraph, or if CBP is unable to make the determination described in this paragraph within 12 months after a request for a verification, or CBP makes a negative determination, CBP, if directed by the President, may take appropriate action which may include denying the application of preferential tariff treatment to the textile or apparel good subject to the verification, and to similar goods exported or produced by the entity that exported or produced the good.


(b) *Procedures to determine compliance with applicable customs laws and regulations of the U.S.* For purposes of enabling CBP to determine that an exporter or producer is complying with applicable customs laws, regulations, and procedures in cases in which CBP has a reasonable suspicion that an Australian exporter or producer is engaging in unlawful activity relating to trade in textile and apparel goods, CBP may request that the government of Australia conduct a verification, regardless of whether a claim is made for preferential tariff treatment. A “reasonable suspicion” for the purpose of this paragraph will be based on relevant factual information, including information of the type set forth in Article 6.5 of the AFTA, which indicates circumvention of applicable laws, regulations or procedures regarding trade in textile and apparel goods. While a verification under this paragraph is being conducted, CBP, if directed by the President, may take appropriate action which may include suspending the application of preferential tariff treatment to the textile and apparel goods exported or produced by the Australian entity where the reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity relates to those goods. If an exporter, producer, or other person refuses to consent to a visit as provided for in this paragraph, or if CBP is unable to make the determination described in this paragraph within 12 months after a request for a verification, or makes a negative determination, CBP, if directed by the President, may take appropriate action which may include denying the application of preferential tariff treatment to any textile or apparel goods exported or produced by the entity subject to the verification.


(c) *Assistance by U.S. officials to Australian authorities.* U.S. officials may undertake or assist in a verification under this section by conducting visits in Australia, along with the competent authorities of Australia, to the premises of an exporter, producer or any other enterprise involved in the movement of textile or apparel goods from Australia to the United States.


(d) *Treatment of documents and information provided to CBP.* Any production, trade and transit documents and other information necessary to conduct a verification under this section, provided to CBP by the government of Australia consistent with the laws, regulations, and procedures of Australia, will be treated as confidential in accordance with Article 22.4 of the AFTA (Disclosure of Information).


(e) *Continuation of appropriate action.* CBP may continue to take appropriate action under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section until it receives information sufficient to enable it to make the determination described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
