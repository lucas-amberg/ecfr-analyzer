# § 10.844   Value-content requirement.

(a) *Certain apparel articles*—(1) *General.* Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, apparel articles described in § 10.843(a) of this subpart will be eligible for duty-free treatment only if, for each entry of such articles in the applicable one-year period for which a duty-free claim is made for such articles under § 10.847(a) of this subpart, the sum of the cost or value of the materials produced in Haiti or one or more eligible countries described in paragraph (c) of this section, or any combination thereof, plus the direct costs of processing operations performed in Haiti or one or more eligible countries described in paragraph (c) of this section, or any combination thereof, is not less than (as applicable):


(i) 50 percent or more of the declared customs value of the articles entered during the initial applicable one-year period, the second applicable one-year period, and the third applicable one-year period;


(ii) 55 percent or more of the declared customs value of the articles entered during the fourth applicable one-year period; and


(iii) 60 percent or more of the declared customs value of the articles entered during the fifth applicable one-year period.


(2) *Annual aggregation*—(i) *Initial applicable one-year period.* In the initial applicable one-year period, the applicable value-content requirement set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may also be met for apparel articles of a producer or an entity controlling production that are entered during the initial applicable one-year period and for which duty-free treatment is claimed under § 10.847(a) of this subpart by aggregating the cost or value of materials and the direct costs of processing operations, as those terms are used in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, with respect to all apparel articles of that producer or entity controlling production that are wholly assembled or knit-to-shape in Haiti and are entered during the initial applicable one-year period (except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section).


(ii) *Other applicable one-year periods.* In each of the second, third, fourth, and fifth applicable one-year periods, the applicable value-content requirement set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may also be met for apparel articles of a producer or an entity controlling production that are entered during the applicable one-year period and for which duty-free treatment is claimed under § 10.847(a) of this subpart by aggregating the cost or value of materials and the direct costs of processing, as those terms are used in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, with respect to all apparel articles of that producer or entity controlling production that are wholly assembled or knit-to-shape in Haiti and are entered during the preceding applicable one-year period (except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section).


(iii) *Exclusions from annual aggregation calculation.* The entry of an apparel article that is wholly assembled or knit-to-shape in Haiti and is receiving preferential tariff treatment under any provision of law other than section 213A(b)(1) of the CBERA (19 U.S.C. 2703A(b)(1)) or is subject to the “General” subcolumn of column 1 of the HTSUS will only be included in an annual aggregation under paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section if the producer or entity controlling production elects, at the time the annual aggregation calculation is made, to include such entry in the aggregation.


(3) *Election to use the annual aggregation method for an applicable one-year period.* A producer or entity controlling production may elect to use the individual entry or annual aggregation method in any applicable one-year period and then elect to use the other method during the subsequent applicable one-year period, provided that all applicable requirements are met during the applicable one-year period preceding the period in which the switch is made. If a producer or entity controlling production using the individual entry method in an applicable one-year period elects to use the annual aggregation method during the subsequent applicable one-year period, the declaration of compliance described in § 10.848 of this subpart must be submitted to CBP within 30 days following the end of the applicable one-year period in which the individual entry method was used.


(4) *Failure to meet applicable requirements*—(i) *Initial applicable one-year period.* Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section, if CBP determines that apparel articles of a producer or entity controlling production that are entered as articles described in § 10.843(a) of this subpart during the initial applicable one-year period have not met the requirements of § 10.843(a) of this subpart or the applicable value-content requirement set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, then:


(A) All apparel articles of the producer or entity controlling production for which duty-free treatment is claimed under § 10.847(a) of this subpart that are entered under the annual aggregation method during that initial applicable one-year period will be denied duty-free treatment;


(B) Those apparel articles of the producer or entity controlling production for which duty-free treatment is claimed under § 10.847(a) of this subpart that are entered on an individual entry basis and that fail to meet the requirements of § 10.843(a)(1) of this subpart or the applicable value-content requirement set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section during that initial applicable one-year period will be denied duty-free treatment. However, apparel articles of the producer or entity controlling production for which duty-free treatment is claimed under § 10.847(a) of this subpart that are entered on an individual entry basis prior to an election being made by the producer or entity controlling production to use the annual aggregation method will be considered to have met the applicable value-content requirement if that requirement is met through application of the individual entry method; and


(C) All apparel articles of the producer or entity controlling production for which duty-free treatment is claimed under § 10.847(a) of this subpart, whether entered on an individual entry or annual aggregation basis, will be not be eligible for duty-free treatment during the succeeding applicable one-year periods until the increased percentage in the value-content requirement specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section has been met by all the apparel articles of that producer or entity controlling production that are wholly assembled or knit-to-shape in Haiti and are entered during the immediately preceding applicable one-year period, unless the articles qualify for tariff benefits pursuant to the provisions of § 10.845 of this subpart.


(ii) *Other applicable one-year periods.* Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section, if CBP determines that apparel articles of a producer or entity controlling production that are entered as articles described in § 10.843(a) of this subpart during any applicable one-year period following the initial applicable one-year period have not met the requirements of § 10.843(a) or the applicable value-content requirement set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, then:


(A) Those apparel articles of the producer or entity controlling production for which duty-free treatment is claimed under § 10.847(a) of this subpart that are entered on an individual entry basis and that fail to meet the requirements of § 10.843(a)(1) or the applicable value-content requirement set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this subpart during that applicable one-year period will be denied duty-free treatment; and


(B) All apparel articles of the producer or entity controlling production for which duty-free treatment is claimed under § 10.847(a) of this subpart, whether entered on an individual entry or annual aggregation basis, will not be eligible for duty-free treatment during the succeeding applicable one-year periods until the increased percentage in the value-content requirement specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section has been met by all the apparel articles of that producer or entity controlling production that are wholly assembled or knit-to-shape in Haiti and are entered during the immediately preceding applicable one-year period, unless the articles qualify for tariff benefits pursuant to the provisions of § 10.845 of this subpart.


(iii) *Entity controlling production of apparel articles of a producer also producing for its own account.* Where an entity controlling production controls the production of apparel articles, as described in § 10.843(a) of this subpart, of a producer that also produces for its own account, the failure of apparel articles of that producer to meet the requirements of § 10.843(a) of this subpart or the applicable value-content requirement set forth in paragraph (a) of this section in an applicable one-year period, either under the annual aggregation method or the individual entry method, will not affect the eligibility for duty-free treatment under § 10.843(a) of this subpart of those apparel articles of that producer which are part of a claim for such treatment made on behalf of the entity controlling production.


(iv) *Increased percentage.* For apparel articles of a producer or entity controlling production to meet the increased percentage referred to in paragraphs (a)(4)(i)(C) and (a)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, the sum of the cost or value of the materials produced in Haiti or one or more eligible countries described in paragraph (c) of this section, or any combination thereof, plus the direct costs of processing operations performed in Haiti or one or more eligible countries described in paragraph (c) of this section, or any combination thereof, must not be less than the applicable percentage under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, plus 10 percent, of the aggregate declared customs value of all apparel articles of that producer or entity controlling production that are wholly assembled or knit-to-shape in Haiti and are entered during the immediately preceding applicable one-year period. Once the increased value-content percentage has been met for the articles of a producer or entity controlling production that are entered during an applicable one-year period, the articles of that producer or entity controlling production that are entered during the next succeeding applicable one-year period will be subject to the applicable value-content percentage specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


(v) *Articles of a new producer or entity controlling production.* Apparel articles of a new producer or entity controlling production electing to use the annual aggregation method for purposes of meeting the applicable value-content requirement must first meet the increased value-content percentage specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section as a prerequisite to receiving duty-free treatment during a succeeding applicable one-year period. Apparel articles of a new producer or entity controlling production electing to use the individual entry method are not subject to the requirement of first meeting the increased value-content percentage as a prerequisite to receiving duty-free treatment during the first year of participation or in any succeeding applicable one-year period. For purposes of this paragraph, a “new producer or entity controlling production” is a producer or entity controlling production that did not produce or control production of articles that were entered as articles pursuant to § 10.843(a) of this subpart during the immediately preceding applicable one-year period.


(vi) *Notification of compliance with the increased percentage*—(A) *General.* If apparel articles of a producer or entity controlling production are required to meet the increased value-content percentage described in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section, either because of failure to meet the requirements of § 10.843(a) or the applicable value-content requirement set forth in paragraph (a) of this section in an applicable one-year period, or because the producer or entity controlling production is a new producer or entity controlling production, as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(v) of this section, that elects to use the annual aggregation method, the importer of such articles must notify CBP that the increased percentage has been met in an applicable one-year period by submitting to CBP the declaration of compliance described in § 10.848 of this subpart within 30 days following the end of the applicable one-year period. An importer that is required to submit a declaration of compliance under this paragraph must submit such a declaration for each importer of record identification number used by that importer. A declaration of compliance required under this paragraph must be sent to the address set forth in § 10.848(a) of this subpart.


(B) *Contents.* A declaration of compliance required under paragraph (a)(4)(v)(A) of this section must include, in addition to the information specified in § 10.848(c) of this subpart, a statement as to whether the increased value-content percentage was required because the apparel articles failed to meet the production standards or the applicable value-content requirement or because the producer or entity controlling production was a new producer or entity controlling production that elected to use the annual aggregation method.


(C) *Effect of noncompliance.* If an importer fails to submit to CBP the declaration of compliance required under paragraph (a)(4)(v)(A) of this section within 30 days following the end of the applicable one-year period during which the increased value-content percentage was met for apparel articles of a producer or entity controlling production, CBP may deny duty-free treatment to all apparel articles, as described in § 10.843(a) of this subpart, of that producer or entity controlling production that are entered by that importer during the next succeeding applicable one-year period. Additionally, the timely submission of a declaration of compliance is a prerequisite for a producer or entity controlling production to request retroactive application of duty-free treatment under § 10.845 of this subpart for apparel articles that meet the increased value-content percentage during an applicable one-year period. However, the submission of a declaration of compliance is not a substitute for filing a request for liquidation or reliquidation of an entry for which retroactive duty-free treatment is sought under § 10.845 of this subpart.


(5) *Inclusion of the cost of fabrics or yarns not available in commercial quantities in value-content requirement.* For purposes of meeting the applicable value-content requirement set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, either in regard to individual entries or entries entered in the aggregate, the following costs may be included:


(i) The cost of fabrics or yarns to the extent that apparel articles of such fabrics or yarns would be eligible for preferential treatment, without regard to the source of the fabrics or yarns, under Annex 401 of the NAFTA; and


(ii) The cost of fabrics or yarns (without regard to their source) that are designated as not being available in commercial quantities for purposes of:


(A) Section 213(b)(2)(A)(v) of the CBERA (19 U.S.C. 2703(b)(2)(A)(v));


(B) Section 112(b)(5) of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (19 U.S.C. 3721(b)(5));


(C) Section 204(b)(3)(B)(i)(III) or 204(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Andean Trade Preference Act (19 U.S.C. 3203(b)(3)(B)(i)(III) or 3203(b)(3)(B)(ii)); or


(D) Any other provision, relating to determining whether a textile or apparel article is an originating good eligible for preferential treatment, of a law that implements a free trade agreement that enters into force with respect to the United States.


(b) *Wiring sets.* An article described in § 10.843(d) of this subpart will be eligible for duty-free treatment during the five-year period ending on December 19, 2011, only if the sum of the cost or value of the materials produced in Haiti or one or more eligible countries described in paragraph (c) of this section, or any combination thereof, plus the direct costs of processing operations performed in Haiti or the United States, or both, is not less than 50 percent of the declared customs value of the article.


(c) *Eligible countries described.* As used in this section, the term “eligible countries” includes:


(1) The United States;


(2) Israel, Canada, Mexico, Jordan, Singapore, Chile, Australia, Morocco, Bahrain, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, and any other country that is a party to a free trade agreement with the United States that is in effect on December 20, 2006, or that enters into force thereafter; and


(3) The designated beneficiary countries listed in General Notes 11 (Andean Trade Preference Act), 16 (African Growth and Opportunity Act), and 17 (Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act) of the HTSUS.

(B) Substantially transformed in Haiti or one or more eligible countries described in paragraph (c) of this section into a new or different article of commerce which is then used in Haiti in the production of a new or different article of commerce that is imported into the United States.


(2) *Determination of cost or value of materials*—(i) *Costs included.* (A) For purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and subject to paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(B) and (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the cost or value of materials produced in Haiti or one or more eligible countries described in paragraph (c) of this section includes:

(*2*) An amount for profit; and


(*3*) Freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the material to the manufacturer's plant.


(ii) *Costs deducted in regard to certain apparel articles.* For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, in calculating the cost or value of materials produced in Haiti or one or more eligible countries described in paragraph (c) of this section, either in regard to individual entries or entries entered in the aggregate, deductions are to be made for the cost or value of:
