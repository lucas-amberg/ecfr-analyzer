# ยง 10.873   Originating goods.

(a) *General.* A good will be considered an originating good under the OFTA when imported directly from the territory of a Party into the territory of the other Party only if:


(1) The good is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of one or both of the Parties;


(2) The good is a new or different article of commerce, as defined in ยง 10.872(i) of this subpart, that has been grown, produced, or manufactured in the territory of one or both of the Parties, is provided for in a heading or subheading of the HTSUS that is not covered by the product-specific rules set forth in General Note 31(h), HTSUS, and meets the value-content requirement specified in paragraph (b) of this section; or


(3) The good is provided for in a heading or subheading of the HTSUS covered by the product-specific rules set forth in General Note 31(h), HTSUS, and:


(i)(A) Each of the non-originating materials used in the production of the good undergoes an applicable change in tariff classification specified in General Note 31(h), HTSUS, as a result of production occurring entirely in the territory of one or both of the Parties; or


(B) The good otherwise satisfies the requirements specified in General Note 31(h), HTSUS; and


(ii) The good meets any other requirements specified in General Note 31, HTSUS.


(b) *Value-content requirement.* A good described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section will be considered an originating good under the OFTA only if the sum of the value of materials produced in one or both of the Parties, plus the direct costs of processing operations performed in one or both of the Parties, is not less than 35 percent of the appraised value of the good at the time the good is entered into the territory of the United States.


(c) *Combining, packaging, and diluting operations.* For purposes of this subpart, a good will not be considered a new or different article of commerce by virtue of having undergone simple combining or packaging operations, or mere dilution with water or another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the good. The principles and examples set forth in ยง 10.195(a)(2) of this part will apply equally for purposes of this paragraph.
