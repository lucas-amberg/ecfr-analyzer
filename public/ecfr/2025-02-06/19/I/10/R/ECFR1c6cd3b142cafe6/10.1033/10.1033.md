# § 10.1033   Framework for correcting claims or certifications.

(a) “*Promptly and voluntarily” defined.* Except as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, for purposes of this subpart, the making of a corrected claim or certification by an importer or the providing of written notification of an incorrect certification by an exporter or producer in the United States will be deemed to have been done promptly and voluntarily if:


(1)(i) Done before the commencement of a formal investigation, within the meaning of § 162.74(g) of this chapter; or


(ii) Done before any of the events specified in § 162.74(i) of this chapter have occurred; or


(iii) Done within 30 days after the importer, exporter, or producer initially becomes aware that the claim or certification is incorrect; and


(2) Accompanied by a statement setting forth the information specified in paragraph (c) of this section; and


(3) In the case of a corrected claim or certification by an importer, accompanied or followed by a tender of any actual loss of duties and merchandise processing fees, if applicable, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.


(b) *Exception in cases involving fraud or subsequent incorrect claims*—(1) *Fraud.* Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a person who acted fraudulently in making an incorrect claim or certification may not make a voluntary correction of that claim or certification. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “fraud” will have the meaning set forth in paragraph (C)(3) of appendix B to part 171 of this chapter.


(2) *Subsequent incorrect claims.* An importer who makes one or more incorrect claims after becoming aware that a claim involving the same merchandise and circumstances is invalid may not make a voluntary correction of the subsequent claims pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.


(c) *Statement.* For purposes of this subpart, each corrected claim or certification must be accompanied by a statement, submitted in writing or via an authorized electronic data interchange system, which:


(1) Identifies the class or kind of good to which the incorrect claim or certification relates;


(2) In the case of a corrected claim or certification by an importer, identifies each affected import transaction, including each port of importation and the approximate date of each importation;


(3) Specifies the nature of the incorrect statements or omissions regarding the claim or certification; and


(4) Sets forth, to the best of the person's knowledge, the true and accurate information or data which should have been covered by or provided in the claim or certification, and states that the person will provide any additional information or data which is unknown at the time of making the corrected claim or certification within 30 days or within any extension of that 30-day period as CBP may permit in order for the person to obtain the information or data.


(d) *Tender of actual loss of duties.* A U.S. importer who makes a corrected claim must tender any actual loss of duties at the time of making the corrected claim, or within 30 days thereafter, or within any extension of that 30-day period as CBP may allow in order for the importer to obtain the information or data necessary to calculate the duties owed.
