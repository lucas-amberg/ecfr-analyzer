The terms “Centers of Excellence and Expertise” or “Centers” refer to national CBP offices that are responsible for performing certain trade functions and making certain determinations as set forth in particular regulatory provisions regarding importations by importers that are considered by CBP to be in the industry sector, regardless of the ports of entry at which the importations occur. Industry sectors are categorized by the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) numbers representing an industry sector.

*Exportation.* “Exportation” means a severance of goods from the mass of things belonging to this country with the intention of uniting them to the mass of things belonging to some foreign country. The shipment of merchandise abroad with the intention of returning it to the United States with a design to circumvent provisions of restriction or limitation in the tariff laws or to secure a benefit accruing to imported merchandise is not an exportation. Merchandise of foreign origin returned from abroad under these circumstances is dutiable according to its nature, weight, and value at the time of its original arrival in this country.


*Importer.* “Importer” means the person primarily liable for the payment of any duties on the merchandise, or an authorized agent acting on his behalf. The importer may be:

The terms “port” and “port of entry” incorporate the geographical area under the jurisdiction of a port director. (The customs ports in the Virgin Islands, although under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Treasury, have their own customs laws (48 U.S.C. 1406(i)). These ports, therefore, are outside the customs territory of the United States and the ports thereof are not “ports of entry” within the meaning of these regulations).


*Port director*. The term “port director” means the person who has jurisdiction within the geographical boundaries of their port of entry unless the regulations provide that particular trade functions or determinations are exclusively within the purview of a Center Director or other CBP personnel.
