# § 111.13   Examination for individual license.

(a) *Scope of examination.* The examination for an individual broker's license will be designed to determine the individual's knowledge of customs and related laws, regulations and procedures, bookkeeping, accounting, and all other appropriate matters necessary to render valuable service to importers and exporters. The examination will be prepared by Customs and Border Protection (CBP). 


(b) *Basic requirements, date, and place of examination.* In order to be eligible to take the examination, an individual must on the date of examination be a citizen of the United States who has attained the age of 18 years and who is not an officer or employee of the United States Government. CBP will publish a notice announcing each examination on its Web site. Examinations will be given on the fourth Wednesday in April and October unless the regularly scheduled examination date conflicts with a national holiday, religious observance, or other foreseeable event and the agency publishes in the _Federal Register_ an appropriate notice of a change in the examination date. An individual who intends to take the examination must complete the electronic application at least 30 calendar days prior to the scheduled examination date and must remit the examination fee prescribed in § 111.96(a) at that time. CBP will give notice of the time and place for the examination, including whether alternatives to on-site testing will be available, which is at CBP's sole discretion.


(c) *Special examination.* If a partnership, association, or corporation loses the required member or officer having an individual broker's license (see § 111.11(b) and (c)(2)) and its license would be revoked by operation of law under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1641(b)(5) and § 111.45(a) before the next scheduled examination, CBP may authorize a special examination for a prospective applicant for an individual license who would serve as the required licensed member or officer. CBP may also authorize a special examination for an individual for purposes of continuing the business of a sole proprietorship broker. A special examination for an individual may also be authorized by CBP if a brokerage firm loses the individual broker who was exercising responsible supervision and control over the transaction of customs business before the next scheduled examination. A request for a special examination must be submitted to the Executive Assistant Commissioner, Office of Trade, in writing and must describe the circumstances giving rise to the need for the examination. If the request is granted, the Executive Assistant Commissioner, Office of Trade or his/her designee, will notify the prospective examinee of the exact time and place for the examination. If the individual attains a passing grade on the special examination, the application for the license may be submitted in accordance with § 111.12. The examinee will be responsible for all additional costs incurred by CBP in preparing and administering the special examination that exceed the examination fee prescribed in § 111.96(a), and those additional costs must be reimbursed to CBP before the examination is given.


(d) *Failure to appear for examination.* If a prospective examinee advises the Office of Trade at the Headquarters of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Attn: Broker Management Branch, electronically in a manner specified by CBP at least 2 working days prior to the date of a regularly scheduled examination that he will not appear for the examination, CBP will refund the examination fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this section. No refund of the examination fee or additional reimbursed costs will be made in the case of a special written examination provided for under paragraph (c) of this section.


(e) *Notice of examination result.* CBP will provide to each examinee written or electronic notice of the result of the examination taken under this section. A failure of an examinee to attain a passing grade on the examination will preclude the submission of an application under § 111.12 but will not preclude the examinee from taking an examination again at a later date in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. 


(f) *Appeal of failing grade on examination.* If an examinee fails to attain a passing grade on the examination taken under this section, the examinee may challenge that result by filing a written or electronic appeal with the Office of Trade at the Headquarters of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Attn: Broker Management Branch, within 60 calendar days after the date of the written or electronic notice provided for in paragraph (e) of this section. CBP will provide to the examinee written or electronic notice of the decision on the appeal. If the CBP decision on the appeal affirms the result of the examination, the examinee may request review of the decision on the appeal by submitting a written or electronic request to the appropriate Executive Director, Office of Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, within 60 calendar days after the date of the notice on that decision.
