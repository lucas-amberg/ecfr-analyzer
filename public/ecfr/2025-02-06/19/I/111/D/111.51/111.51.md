# § 111.51   Cancellation of license or permit.

(a) *Without prejudice.* The appropriate Executive Director, Office of Trade, may cancel a broker's license or permit “without prejudice” upon written application by the broker if the appropriate Executive Director, Office of Trade, determines that the application for cancellation was not made in order to avoid proceedings for the suspension or revocation of the license or permit. If the appropriate Executive Director, Office of Trade, determines that the application for cancellation was made in order to avoid those proceedings, he or she may cancel the license or permit “without prejudice” only with authorization from the Executive Assistant Commissioner.

 


(b) *With prejudice.* The appropriate Executive Director, Office of Trade may cancel a broker's license or permit “with prejudice” when specifically requested to do so by the broker. The effect of a cancellation “with prejudice” is in all respects the same as if the license or permit had been revoked for cause by the Executive Assistant Commissioner except that it will not give rise to a right of appeal.
