# ยง 111.60   Request for additional information.

If, in order to prepare his response, the broker desires additional information as to the time and place of the alleged misconduct, or the means by which it was committed, or any other more specific information concerning the alleged misconduct, he may request that information in writing. The broker's request must set forth in what respect the proposed statement of charges leaves him in doubt and must describe the particular language of the proposed statement of charges as to which additional information is needed. If in the opinion of the processing Center that information is reasonably necessary to enable the broker to prepare his response, he will furnish the broker with that information.
