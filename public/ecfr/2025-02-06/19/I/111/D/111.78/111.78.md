# ยง 111.78   Reprimands.

If a broker fails to observe and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of a broker as set forth in this part but that failure is not sufficiently serious to warrant initiation of suspension or revocation proceedings, Headquarters, or the processing Center with the approval of Headquarters, may serve the broker with a written reprimand. The reprimand, and the facts on which it is based, may be considered in connection with any future disciplinary proceeding that may be instituted against the broker in question.
