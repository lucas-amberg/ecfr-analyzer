# ยง 113.4   Bonds and carnets.

(a) *Bonds.* All bonds required to be given under the customs laws or CBP regulations will be known as CBP bonds.


(b) *Carnets.* A carnet is an international customs document which serves simultaneously as a customs entry document and as a customs bond. Therefore, carnets, provided for in part 114 of this chapter, are ordinarily acceptable without posting further security under the customs laws or CBP regulations requiring bonds.
