# § 12.44   Disposition.

(a) *Export and abandonment.* Merchandise detained pursuant to § 12.42(e) may be exported at any time prior to seizure pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, or before it is deemed to have been abandoned as provided in this section, whichever occurs first. Provided no finding has been issued by the Commissioner of CBP under § 12.42(f) and the merchandise has not been exported within 3 months after the date of importation, the port director will ascertain whether the proof specified in § 12.43 has been submitted within the time prescribed in that section. If the proof has not been timely submitted, or if the Commissioner of CBP advises the port director that the proof furnished does not establish the admissibility of the merchandise, the port director will promptly advise the importer in writing that the merchandise is excluded from entry. Upon the expiration of 60 days after the delivery or mailing of such advice by the port director, the merchandise will be deemed to have been abandoned and will be destroyed, unless it has been exported or a protest has been filed as provided for in section 514, Tariff Act of 1930. 


(b) *Seizure and summary forfeiture.* In the case of merchandise covered by a finding under § 12.42(f), if the Commissioner of CBP advises the port director that the proof furnished under § 12.43 does not establish the admissibility of the merchandise, or if no proof has been timely furnished, the port director shall seize the merchandise for violation of 19 U.S.C. 1307 and commence forfeiture proceedings pursuant to part 162, subpart E, of this chapter. 


(c) *Prison-labor goods.* Nothing in this chapter precludes CBP from seizing for forfeiture merchandise imported in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1761 and 1762 concerning prison-labor goods.
