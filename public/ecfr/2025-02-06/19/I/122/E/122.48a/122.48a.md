# § 122.48a   Electronic information for air cargo required in advance of arrival.

(a) *General requirement.* Pursuant to section 343(a), Trade Act of 2002, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2071 note), for any inbound aircraft required to make entry under § 122.41, that will have commercial cargo aboard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) must electronically receive from the inbound air carrier and, if applicable, an approved party as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, certain information concerning the inbound cargo, as enumerated, respectively, in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section. CBP must receive such information according to the time frames prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section. However, a subset of these data elements known as ACAS data and identified in paragraph (d) of this section, is also subject to the requirements and time frame described in § 122.48b. The advance electronic transmission of the required cargo information to CBP must be effected through a CBP-approved electronic data interchange system.


(1) *Cargo remaining aboard aircraft; cargo to be entered under bond.* Air cargo arriving from and departing for a foreign country on the same through flight and cargo that is unladen from the arriving aircraft and entered, in bond, for exportation, or for transportation and exportation (see subpart J of this part), are subject to the advance electronic information filing requirement under paragraph (a) of this section. 


(2) *Diplomatic Pouches and Diplomatic Cargo.* When goods comprising a diplomatic or consular bag (including cargo shipments, containers, and the like identified as Diplomatic Pouch) that belong to the United States or to a foreign government are shipped under an air waybill, such cargo is subject to the advance reporting requirements, but the description of the shipment as Diplomatic Pouch will be sufficient detail for description. Shipments identified as Diplomatic Cargo, such as office supplies or unaccompanied household goods, are subject to the advance reporting requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. 


(b) *Time frame for presenting data*—(1) *Nearby foreign areas.* In the case of aircraft under paragraph (a) of this section that depart for the United States from any foreign port or place in North America, including locations in Mexico, Central America, South America (from north of the Equator only), the Caribbean, and Bermuda, CBP must receive the required cargo information no later than the time of the departure of the aircraft for the United States (the trigger time is no later than the time that wheels are up on the aircraft, and the aircraft is en route directly to the United States). 


(2) *Other foreign areas.* In the case of aircraft under paragraph (a) of this section that depart for the United States from any foreign area other than that specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, CBP must receive the required cargo information no later than 4 hours prior to the arrival of the aircraft in the United States. 


(c) *Party electing to file advance electronic cargo data*—(1) *Other filer.* In addition to incoming air carriers for whom participation is mandatory, one of the following parties meeting the qualifications of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, may elect to transmit to CBP the electronic data for incoming cargo that is listed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section: 


(i) An Automated Broker Interface (ABI) filer (importer or its Customs broker) as identified by its ABI filer code; 


(ii) A Container Freight Station/deconsolidator as identified by its FIRMS (Facilities Information and Resources Management System) code; 


(iii) An Express Consignment Carrier Facility as identified by its FIRMS code; or, 


(iv) An air carrier as identified by its carrier IATA (International Air Transport Association) code, that arranged to have the incoming air carrier transport the cargo to the United States. 


(2) *Eligibility.* To be qualified to file cargo information electronically, a party identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section must establish the communication protocol required by CBP for properly presenting cargo information through the approved data interchange system. Also, other than a broker or an importer (see § 113.62(k)(2) of this chapter), the party must possess a Customs international carrier bond containing all the necessary provisions of § 113.64 of this chapter. 


(3) *Nonparticipation by other party.* If another party as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not participate in advance electronic cargo information filing, the party that arranges for and/or delivers the cargo shipment to the incoming carrier must fully disclose and present to the carrier the cargo information listed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section; and the incoming carrier must present this information electronically to CBP under paragraph (a) of this section. 


(4) *Required information in possession of third party.* Any other entity in possession of required cargo data that is not the incoming air carrier or a party described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section must fully disclose and present the required data for the inbound air cargo to either the air carrier or other electronic filer, as applicable, which must present such data to CBP. 


(5) *Party receiving information believed to be accurate.* Where the party electronically presenting the cargo information required in paragraph (d) of this section receives any of this information from another party, CBP will take into consideration how, in accordance with ordinary commercial practices, the presenting party acquired such information, and whether and how the presenting party is able to verify this information. Where the presenting party is not reasonably able to verify such information, CBP will permit the party to electronically present the information on the basis of what that party reasonably believes to be true. 


(d) *Non-consolidated/consolidated shipments.* For non-consolidated shipments, the incoming air carrier must transmit to CBP all of the information for the air waybill record, as enumerated in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. For consolidated shipments: the incoming air carrier must transmit to CBP the information listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section that is applicable to the master air waybill; and the air carrier must transmit cargo information for all associated house air waybills as enumerated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, unless another party as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section electronically transmits this information directly to CBP.
