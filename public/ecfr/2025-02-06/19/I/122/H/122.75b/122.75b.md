# § 122.75b   Electronic manifest requirement for crew members and non-crew members onboard commercial aircraft departing from the United States.

(a) *Definitions.* The definitions set forth in § 122.49a(a) also apply for purposes of this section, except that the definitions of “all-cargo flight,” “carrier,” “crew member,” and “non-crew member” applicable to this section are found in § 122.49b(a).


(b) *Electronic departure manifest*—(1) *General requirement.* Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, an appropriate official of each commercial aircraft departing from the United States to any port or place outside the United States must transmit to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) an electronic crew member departure manifest and, for all-cargo flights only, an electronic non-crew member departure manifest covering any crew members and non-crew members onboard. Each manifest must be transmitted to CBP at the place and time specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section by means of an electronic data interchange system approved by CBP and must set forth the information specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Where both a crew member departure manifest and a non-crew member departure manifest are required for an all-cargo flight, they must be combined in one departure manifest covering both crew members and non-crew members. Where a passenger departure manifest under § 122.75a and a crew member departure manifest under this section are required, they must be transmitted separately if the transmission is in US EDIFACT format.


(2) *Place and time for submission; certification; change to manifest*—(i) *Place and time for submission.* The appropriate official specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must transmit the electronic departure manifest required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to the CBP Data Center, CBP Headquarters, no later than 60 minutes prior to departure of the aircraft, except that for an air ambulance in service of a medical emergency, the manifest must be transmitted to CBP no later than 30 minutes after departure.


(ii) *Certification.* Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the appropriate official, by transmitting the manifest as required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, certifies that the flight's crew members and non-crew members are included, respectively, on the master crew member list or master non-crew member list previously submitted to CBP in accordance with § 122.49c. If a crew member or non-crew member on the manifest is not also included on the appropriate master list, the flight may be denied clearance to depart.


(iii) *Changes to manifest.* The appropriate official is obligated to make necessary changes to the crew member or non-crew member departure manifest after transmission of the manifest to CBP. Necessary changes include adding a name, with other required information, to the manifest or amending previously submitted information. If changes are submitted less than 60 minutes before scheduled flight departure, the air carrier must receive approval from TSA before allowing the flight to depart or the flight may be denied clearance to depart.


(3) *Information required.* The electronic crew member and non-crew member departure manifests required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must contain the following information for all crew members and non-crew members, except that the information specified in paragraphs (b)(iii), (v), (vi), (xii), and (xiv) of this section must be included on the manifest only on or after October 4, 2005:


(i) Full name (last, first, and, if available, middle);


(ii) Date of birth;


(iii) Place of birth (city, state—if applicable, country);


(iv) Gender (F = female; M = male);


(v) Citizenship;


(vi) Address of permanent residence;


(vii) Status on board the aircraft;


(viii) Pilot certificate number and country of issuance (if applicable);


(ix) Travel document type (*e.g.*, P = passport; A = alien registration card);


(x) Passport number, if a passport is required;


(xi) Passport country of issuance, if a passport is required;


(xii) Passport expiration date, if a passport is required;


(xiii) Alien registration number, where applicable;


(xiv) Passenger Name Record locator, if available;


(xv) International Air Transport Association (IATA) departure port code;


(xvi) IATA code of port/place of final arrival (foreign port code);


(xvii) Airline carrier code;


(xviii) Flight number; and


(xix) Date of aircraft departure.


(c) *Exceptions.* The electronic departure manifest requirement specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is subject to the following conditions:


(1) Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Aviation Safety Inspectors with valid credentials and authorization are not subject to the requirement, but the manifest requirement of § 122.75a applies to these inspectors, as they are considered passengers on departing flights;


(2) For crew members traveling onboard departing aircraft chartered by the U.S. Department of Defense, the provisions of this section apply regarding electronic transmission of the manifest, except that:


(i) The manifest certification provision of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section is inapplicable; and


(ii) The TSA manifest change approval requirement of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section is inapplicable; and


(3) For non-crew members traveling onboard a departing all-cargo flight chartered by the U.S. Department of Defense, the manifest is not required, but the manifest requirement of § 122.75a applies to these persons, as, in this instance, they are considered passengers on departing flights.


(d) *Carrier responsibility for comparing information collected with travel document.* The carrier collecting the information described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section is responsible for comparing the travel document presented by the crew member or non-crew member with the travel document information it is transmitting to CBP in accordance with this section in order to ensure that the information is correct, the document appears to be valid for travel, and the crew member or non-crew member is the person to whom the travel document was issued.


(e) *Sharing of manifest information.* Information contained in the crew member and non-crew member manifests required under this section that is received by CBP electronically may, upon request, be shared with other Federal agencies for the purpose of protecting national security. CBP may also share such information as otherwise authorized by law.


(f) *Master crew member and non-crew member lists.* Air carriers subject to the requirements of this section must also comply with the requirements of § 122.49c pertaining to the electronic transmission of a master crew member list and a master non-crew member list as applied to flights departing from the United States.


(g) *Superseding amendments issued by TSA.* One or more of the requirements of this section may be superseded by provisions of, amendments to, or alternative procedures authorized by TSA for compliance with an aviation security program, emergency amendment, or security directive issued by the TSA to an air carrier subject to the provisions of 49 CFR part 1544, 1546, or 1550. The amendments will have superseding effect only for the airline to which issued and only for the period of time they remain in effect.
