# § 122.117   Requirements for transit air cargo transport.

(a) *Transportation*—(1) *Port to port.* Transit air cargo may be carried to another port only when a receipt is given, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. The receipt may be given only to an airline which:


(i) Is a common carrier for the transportation of bonded merchandise; and


(ii) Has the required Customs bond on file.


(2) *Exportation from port of arrival.* Transit air cargo may be exported from the port of arrival only if covered by a bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in subpart G of part 113 of this chapter, as provided in § 18.25 of this chapter.


(b) *Receipt*—(1) *Requirements.* When air cargo is to move from the port of arrival as transit air cargo, a receipt shall be given. The receipt shall be made by the airline responsible for transport or export within the general order period (see § 122.50).


(2) *Contents.* The receipt shall appear on each copy of the transit air cargo manifest, clearly signed and dated if required, in the following form:


(c) *Responsibility for transit air cargo*—(1) *Direct exportation.* The responsibility of the airline exporting transit air cargo for direct exportation begins when a receipt, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, is presented to Customs.


(2) *Other than direct exportation.* When the transit air cargo is not for direct exportation, the responsibility of the airline receiving the cargo begins when a receipt, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, is presented to Customs.


(3) *Carting.* When carting is used to deliver transit air cargo to receiving airlines, the importing airline is responsible for the cargo under its own bond until a receipt is filed by the receiving airline. This does not apply when the carting is done under part 112 of this chapter, at the expense of the parties involved.


(4) *Importing airlines.* An importing airline which has qualified as a carrier of bonded merchandise, whether registered in the U.S. or a foreign area, may:


(i) Give a receipt for the air cargo;


(ii) File an appropriate bond; and


(iii) Deliver the cargo to an authorized domestic carrier for in-bond transportation from the port of arrival. The importing carrier's bond covers the transportation.


(d) *Split shipments.* A receipt shall be given by one airline for all of the cargo shipments listed on one transit air cargo manifest sheet. Cargo shipments so listed shall be transported from the port of arrival on one aircraft or carrier unless the use of more than one aircraft or carrier would be allowed:


(1) By § 122.92(d) under a single combined entry and manifest;


(2) By § 122.118(d); or


(3) By § 122.119(e), permitting the use of a surface carrier for transport.
