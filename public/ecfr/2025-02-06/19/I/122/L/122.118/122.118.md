# § 122.118   Exportation from port of arrival.

(a) *Application.* Transit air cargo may be transferred for exportation from any port of arrival under this section. The port director may require any supervision necessary to enforce the regulations of other Federal agencies.


(b) *Time.* Transit air cargo must be exported from the port of arrival within 15 days from the date the exporting airline receives the cargo. After the 15-day period, the individual cargo shipments must be made the subject of individual entries, as appropriate.


(c) *Transit air cargo manifest copies.* Three copies of the transit air cargo manifest shall be filed with Customs.


(1) *Review copy.* The importing airline shall file a copy of each transit air cargo manifest sheet covering any cargo shipment that will be transferred for direct exportation. This filing shall be made as soon as the exporting airline has been chosen. The exporting airline need not give receipt on the review copy for the cargo to be transferred, but the name of the exporting airline shall be placed on the copy.


(2) *Exportation copy.* The exportation copy shall be filed by the exporting airline when clearance documents are presented to Customs.


(3) *Clearance copy.* The clearance copy shall be filed with the exporting aircraft's clearance documents.


(d) *Direct export on different aircraft.* Transit air cargo shipments which are listed on one aircraft transit air cargo manifest sheet may be directly exported on different aircraft of the exporting airline. If this occurs, two additional copies of the transit air cargo manifest shall be filed for each shipment or group of shipments transported in other aircraft. Each copy of the transit air cargo manifest shall be clearly marked to show which shipment or shipments listed are covered by the manifest copy.


(e) *Direct export by another airline.* If shipments listed on one transit air cargo manifest sheet are not exported from the same port on the same airline, separate export entries on Customs Form 7512, as required by § 18.25 of this chapter, shall be filed.


(f) *Post entered air cargo.* Air cargo not listed on the manifest (i.e., overages) which has been post entered under § 122.49(b) may be exported from the port of origin under this subpart. If this occurs, four copies of the air cargo manifest, Customs Form 7509, marked “Post Entry”, shall be provided. All requirements of § 122.44(b) shall be followed in using this procedure.


(g) *Review.* The review copy of the transit air cargo manifest sheets must be reviewed by Customs as required for the carrier manifest copy in § 122.120(g). The reviewing officer shall take the proper action if a license is necessary for any cargo. The exporting airline shall be notified that any transit air cargo which is not covered by the required license must be placed under constructive Customs custody in a special area of the airline's terminal until the license is obtained.
