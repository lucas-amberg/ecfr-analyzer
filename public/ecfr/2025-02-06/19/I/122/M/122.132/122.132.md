(a) *Sealing required.* Aircraft liquor kits shall be sealed on board the aircraft by crewmembers before the aircraft lands in the U.S. The liquor kits shall be kept under seal while on the ground unless taken to an authorized airline in-bond liquor storeroom.


(b) *Exception.* When an aircraft is traveling between airports in the U.S., in a trade for which duty-free and tax-free liquor is used during flight, sealing the liquor kits on board during transporting stopovers is not required if:


(1) The liquor kits are kept on board the aircraft; and


(2) The port director finds that sealing is not required for revenue protection.


(c) *Seals to be used.* Aircraft liquor kits shall be sealed with serially numbered, Customs approved seals. The airline shall use seals supplied by an approved manufacturer, as provided in part 24 of this chapter. A small number of seals may be obtained from the port director.


(d) *Removing seals.* When sealed liquor kits are on the ground, the Customs seals may be broken only by:


(1) A Customs officer; or


(2) Authorized airline personnel, in an authorized airline in-bond liquor storeroom.


(e) *Resealing.* When a Customs officer breaks the seal of a liquor kit to check the contents, the action shall be recorded on the liquor kit stores list, and the liquor kit must be resealed with an approved seal.
