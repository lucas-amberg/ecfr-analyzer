# § 122.162   Failure to notify and explain differences in air cargo manifest.

(a) *Application.* Penalties shall be assessed if differences in an air cargo manifest (overages or shortages) are discovered and:


(1) The required notice and explanation are not made in time;


(2) The port director is not satisfied that the differences were caused by clerical error or other mistake;


(3) There has been a loss of revenue to the U.S.; or


(4) The port director is not satisfied that there was a valid reason for delay in reporting any differences.


(b) *Definition.* Under this section, “clerical error or other mistake” means a non-negligent, inadvertant, or typographical mistake in the preparation, assembly, or submission (electronically or otherwise) of the manifest.


(c) *Repeated differences.* If repeated differences are found in manifests filed by the same person, it may be determined that the differences were a result of negligence and not clerical error or other mistake.


(d) *Knowledge.* A penalty may be assessed for differences in a manifest that are unknown to the aircraft commander or owner.
