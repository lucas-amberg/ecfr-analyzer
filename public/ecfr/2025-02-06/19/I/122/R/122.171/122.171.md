# ยง 122.171   Description of program.

The Air Carrier Smuggling Prevention Program (ACSPP) is designed to enlist the cooperation of the air carriers, as defined in 19 U.S.C. 1584 note, in Customs efforts to prevent the smuggling of controlled substances. If carriers develop and implement thorough and complete internal security procedures at ACSPP designated terminals and foreign departure and intermediate points, the opportunity for their conveyances being used for transportation of controlled substances will be greatly reduced. Participation in the program is voluntary, and may be limited to specific routes. Should a controlled substance be introduced into the United States on a conveyance owned or operated by a participating carrier however, the carrier will be exempt from seizure and penalties should it satisfy the provisions of ยง 122.175 of this part. The program will be operational for a period of 2 years from December 18, 1989, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1584 note.
