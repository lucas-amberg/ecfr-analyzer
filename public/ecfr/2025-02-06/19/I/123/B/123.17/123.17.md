# § 123.17   Foreign repairs to domestic trucks, busses, taxicabs and their equipment.

(a) *Domestic trucks, busses, and taxicabs and their equipment defined.* For the purpose of this section, trucks, busses, and taxicabs and their equipment manufactured in, or regularly imported into the United States, shall be considered “domestic” if not subsequently formally entered and cleared through foreign customs into another country, nor used in foreign local traffic otherwise than as an incident of their return to the United States.


(b) *Report of arrival and payment of duty on repairs.* A report of the first arrival in the United States of domestic trucks, busses, and taxicabs and their equipment after repairs have been made in a foreign country, other than those required to restore such vehicle or equipment to the condition in which it last left the United States (“running repairs”), shall be made by the driver or person in charge of the vehicle promptly, in writing, to the Customs officer at the port of reentry. The report shall state the time and place of arrival and the nature and value of the repairs. Each such vehicle or its equipment when withdrawn from international traffic shall be subject to duty upon the value of the repairs (other than “running repairs”) made abroad at the rate at which the repaired article would be dutiable if imported.
