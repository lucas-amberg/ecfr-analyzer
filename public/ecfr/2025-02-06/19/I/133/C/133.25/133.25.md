Extensions of the 30-day time period may be freely granted for good cause shown.


(b) *Notice of detention and disclosure of information.* From the time merchandise is presented for CBP examination until the time a notice of detention is issued, CBP may disclose to the owner of the recorded mark or trade name any of the following information in order to obtain assistance in determining whether an imported article bears an infringing trademark or trade name. Once a notice of detention is issued, CBP shall disclose to the owner of the recorded mark or trade name the following information, if available, within 30 days, excluding weekends and holidays, of the date of detention:
