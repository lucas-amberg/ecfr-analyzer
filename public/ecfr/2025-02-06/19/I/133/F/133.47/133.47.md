# § 133.47   Articles suspected of violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

(a) *Definitions*—(1) *Copyright protection measure.* A technological measure that effectively controls access to, or effectively protects a right of a copyright owner in, a copyrighted work for which the copyright has been recorded with CBP.


(2) *Articles that violate the DMCA.* Articles that violate the importation prohibitions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), 17 U.S.C. 1201, consist of products, devices, components, or parts thereof primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a copyright protection measure, or which have only a limited commercially significant purpose or use other than such circumvention, or which are knowingly marketed by the manufacturer, importer, consignee, or other trafficker in such articles, or another acting in concert with the manufacturer importer, consignee, or trafficker for use in such circumvention.


(3) *Eligible person.* The owner of a recorded copyright, who employs a copyright protection measure that may have been circumvented or attempted to be circumvented by articles that violate the importation prohibitions of the DMCA.


(4) *Injured person.* The owner of a recorded copyright, who employs a copyright protection measure that has been circumvented or attempted to be circumvented by articles seized for violation of the importation prohibitions of the DMCA, and who has successfully applied to CBP for DMCA protections pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section.


(b) *Detention, notice, and disclosure of information*—(1) *Detention period.* CBP may detain any article of domestic or foreign manufacture imported into the United States that it suspects is in violation of the DMCA, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The detention will be for a period of up to 30 days from the date on which the merchandise is presented for examination. In accordance with 19 U.S.C. 1499(c), if, after the detention period, the article is not released, the article will be deemed excluded for the purposes of 19 U.S.C. 1514(a)(4).


(2) *Notice of detention to importer and disclosure to eligible persons*—(i) *Notice and seven business day response period.* Within five business days from the date of a decision to detain suspect merchandise, CBP will notify the importer in writing of the detention as set forth in § 151.16(c) of this chapter and 19 U.S.C. 1499. CBP will also inform the importer that for purposes of assisting CBP in determining whether the detained merchandise violates the DMCA:


(A) CBP may have previously disclosed to the eligible person, prior to issuance of the notice of detention, limited importation information concerning the detained merchandise, as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, and, in any event, such information may be released to the eligible person, if available, no later than the date of issuance of the notice of detention; and


(B) CBP may disclose to the eligible person information that appears on the detained merchandise and/or its retail packaging, including unredacted photographs, images, or samples, as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, unless the importer provides information within seven business days of the notification establishing that the detained merchandise does not violate the DMCA.


(ii) *Failure of importer to respond or insufficient response to notice.* Where the importer does not provide information within the seven business day response period, or the information provided is insufficient for CBP to determine that the merchandise does not violate the DMCA, CBP will proceed with the disclosure of information, as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, to the eligible person if CBP concludes that the disclosure would assist CBP in its determination, and provided that the disclosure would not compromise an ongoing law enforcement investigation or national security. CBP will notify the importer in case of any such disclosure.


(iii) *Request for DMCA protections and establishment of a list of persons approved for post-seizure disclosures.* Eligible persons may apply to receive post-seizure disclosures from CBP by attaching a letter requesting such disclosures to an application to record or renew a copyright. Owners of existing copyright recordations may similarly apply for protection by submitting a letter requesting such disclosures to CBP. CBP will add those persons CBP approves for such disclosures to a list that CBP will maintain. CBP will provide the post-seizure disclosures described in this section to injured persons, as defined in this part, appearing on the list. CBP will publish a notice, signed by the Executive Director, Regulations and Rulings, of the establishment of the list in the _Federal Register._ After the list has been established, CBP will publish a notice of revisions to the list, signed by the Executive Director, Regulations and Rulings, in the _Federal Register_.


(3) *Disclosure to eligible persons of information appearing on detained merchandise and/or its retail packaging, including unredacted photographs, images or samples.* CBP will disclose information appearing on the merchandise and/or its retail packaging (including labels) and images (including photographs) of the merchandise and/or its retail packaging in its condition as presented for examination (*i.e.,* an unredacted condition) if CBP concludes that the disclosure of information to the eligible person as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section would assist CBP in its determination, and provided that the disclosure would not compromise an ongoing law enforcement investigation or national security. CBP may also provide a sample of the merchandise and/or its retail packaging in its condition as presented for examination to the eligible person. The release of a sample will be in accordance with, and subject to, the bond and return requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. The disclosure may include any serial numbers, dates of manufacture, lot codes, batch numbers, universal product codes, or other identifying markings appearing on the merchandise or its retail packaging (including labels), in alphanumeric or other formats.


(4) *Disclosure to eligible person of limited importation information.* From the time merchandise is presented for examination, CBP may disclose to the eligible person limited importation information in order to obtain assistance in determining whether an imported article violates the DMCA. CBP may release the information prior to the issuance of the notice of detention, concurrently with the notice of detention, or, if the information is unavailable at the time the notice of detention is issued, CBP may release the information after issuance of the notice of detention. The limited importation information CBP may disclose to the eligible person consists of:


(i) The date of importation;


(ii) The port of entry;


(iii) The description of the merchandise, for merchandise not yet detained, from the paper or electronic equivalent of the entry (as defined in § 142.3(a)(1) or (b) of this chapter), the CBP Form 7512, cargo manifest, advance electronic information or other entry document as appropriate, or, for detained merchandise, from the notice of detention;

Identifying information includes, but is not limited to, serial numbers, dates of manufacture, lot codes, batch numbers, universal product codes, the name or address of the manufacturer, exporter, or importer of the merchandise, or any markings that could reveal the name or address of the manufacturer, exporter, or importer of the merchandise, in alphanumeric or other formats. CBP may release a sample under this paragraph (b)(5) when the eligible person furnishes to CBP a bond in an amount specified by CBP and containing the conditions set forth in § 113.70(a) of this chapter. CBP may demand the return of the sample at any time. The eligible person must return the sample to CBP upon demand or at the conclusion of any examination, testing, or similar procedure performed on the sample, whichever occurs sooner. In the event that the sample is damaged, destroyed, or lost while in the possession of the eligible person, the eligible person must, in lieu of return of the sample, certify to CBP that: “The sample described as [insert description] and provided pursuant to 19 CFR 133.47(b)(5) was (damaged/destroyed/lost) during examination, testing, or other use.”
