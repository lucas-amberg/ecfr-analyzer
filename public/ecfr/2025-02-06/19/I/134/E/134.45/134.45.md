# § 134.45   Approved markings of country name.

(a) *Language.* (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the markings required by this part shall include the full English name of the country of origin, unless another marking to indicate the English name of the country of origin is specifically authorized by the Commissioner of Customs. Notice of acceptable markings other than the full English name of the country of origin shall be published in the _Federal Register_ and the Customs Bulletin.


(2) A good of a NAFTA or USMCA country may be marked with the name of the country of origin in English, French or Spanish.


(b) *Abbreviations and variant spellings.* Abbreviations which unmistakably indicate the name of a country, such as “Gt. Britain” for “Great Britain” or “Luxemb” and “Luxembg” for “Luxembourg” are acceptable. Variant spellings which clearly indicate the English name of the country of origin, such as “Brasil” for “Brazil” and “Italie” for “Italy,” are acceptable.


(c) *Adjectival form.* The adjectival form of the name of a country shall be accepted as a proper indication of the name of the country of origin of imported merchandise provided the adjectival form of the name does not appear with other words so as to refer to a kind or species of product. For example, such terms as “English walnuts” or “Brazil nuts” are unacceptable.


(d) *Colonies, possessions, or protectorates.* The name of a colony, possession, or protectorate outside the boundaries of the mother country shall usually be considered acceptable marking. When the Commissioner of Customs finds that the name is not sufficiently well known to insure that the ultimate purchasers will be fully informed of the country of origin, or where the name appearing alone may cause confusion, deception, or mistake, clarifying words shall be required. In such cases, the Commissioner of Customs shall specify in decisions published in the _Federal Register_ and the Customs Bulletin the additional wording to be used in conjunction with the name of the colony, possession, or protectorate.
