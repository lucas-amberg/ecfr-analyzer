The following procedures shall be followed if an importer is substantially or habitually delinquent in the payment of Customs bills:


(a) *Notice.* The importer shall be advised in writing by the director of the port in which he is substantially or habitually delinquent that his immediate delivery privileges have been suspended. The notice shall state the reason for the action and advise the importer that if payment of all his delinquent Customs bills is not made within 10 working days from the date of the notice, the importer's immediate delivery privileges also shall be suspended at all Customs ports.


(b) *Reinstatement of privileges by port.* If the importer pays all his delinquent Customs bills within 10 working days after the date of the notice, the suspension shall be removed, and the importer's immediate delivery privileges shall be reinstated.


(c) *Reinstatement of privileges by Headquarters.* If the importer has not paid all his delinquent Customs bills within 10 working days after the date of the notice, his immediate delivery privileges shall be suspended at all Customs ports. This suspension shall remain in effect in each port of entry until notification is received from Headquarters that the suspension is removed and that the importer's immediate delivery privileges have been reinstated.
