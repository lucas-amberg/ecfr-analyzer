(a) *Remote Location Filing (RLF)*—“RLF” is an elective method of making entry by which a customs broker with a national permit electronically transmits all data information associated with an entry that CBP can process in a completely electronic data interchange system to a RLF-operational CBP location from a remote location other than where the goods are being entered. (Importers filing on their own behalf may file electronically in any port, subject to ABI filing requirements.)


(b) *RLF-operational CBP location*—“RLF-operational CBP location” means a CBP location within the customs territory of the United States that is staffed with CBP personnel who have been trained in RLF procedures and who have operational experience with the Electronic Invoice Program (EIP).
