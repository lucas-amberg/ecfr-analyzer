# § 146.52   Manipulation, manufacture, exhibition or destruction; Customs Form 216.

(a) *Application.* Prior to any action, the operator shall file with the port director an application (or blanket application) on Customs Form 216 for permission to manipulate, manufacture, exhibit, or destroy merchandise in a zone. After Customs approves the application (or blanket application), the operator will retain in his recordkeeping system the approved application.


(b) *Approval.* (1) The port director shall approve the application unless (i) the proposed operation would be in violation of law or regulation; (ii) the place designated for its performance is not suitable for preventing confusion of the identity or status of the merchandise, or for safeguarding the revenue; (iii) the port director is not satisfied that the destruction will be effective; or (iv) the Executive Secretary of the Board has not granted approval of a new manufacturing operation.


(2) The port director is authorized to approve a blanket application for a period of up to one year for a continuous or repetitive operation. The port director may disapprove or revoke approval of any application, or may require the operator to file an individual application.


(c) *Appeal of adverse ruling.* If an approved application is subsequently rescinded by the port director for any reason, the applicant or grantee may appeal the adverse ruling pursuant to the hearing provisions of § 146.82(b)(2). The rescission shall remain in effect pending the decision on the appeal.


(d) *Report results*—(1) *Separate application.* The operator shall report on Customs Form 216 the results of an approved manipulation, manufacture, exhibition, or certification of destruction (other than by a blanket application), unless the port director chooses physically to supervise the operation.


(2) *Blanket application.* The operator shall maintain a record of an approved manipulation, manufacture, exhibition, or certification of destruction, in its inventory control and recordkeeping system so as to provide an accounting and audit trail of the merchandise through the approved operation.


(e) *Destruction.* The port director may permit destruction to be done outside the zone, in whole or in part and at the risk and expense of the applicant, and under such conditions as are necessary to protect the revenue, if proper destruction cannot be accomplished within the zone. Any residue from the destruction within a zone, which is determined to be without commercial value, may be removed to Customs territory for disposal.
