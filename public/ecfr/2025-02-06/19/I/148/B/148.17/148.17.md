# ยง 148.17   Declaration on arrival incidental to further foreign travel.

(a) *Declaration on incidental arrival.* A resident who enters the United States merely as an incident of foreign travel and who will continue his foreign travel before finally returning to the United States from a continuous trip must declare, but need not clear through CBP, any articles he has acquired or had repaired or altered while abroad. The incidental character of the arrival must be made known to the CBP officer. 


(b) *Treatment of articles on incidental arrival.* In order that a resident may claim the $800 or $1,600 exemption upon his final arrival in the United States from a continuous trip, articles accompanying him at the time of an incidental arrival may be exported directly from CBP custody or after transportation in bond, or the articles may be left in CBP custody if the resident upon his final return is to arrive at the CBP facility where the articles are deposited. 


(c) *Failure to advise of incidental character of arrival.* If the traveler fails to advise the CBP officer of the incidental character of his arrival, or for other reason declares any articles for allowance of the $800 or $1,600 exemption, such declaration will mark the beginning of the respective period or periods during which a further exemption cannot be granted.
