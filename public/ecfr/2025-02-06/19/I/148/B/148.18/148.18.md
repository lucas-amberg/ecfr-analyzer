# ยง 148.18   Failure to declare.

(a) *Penalty incurred.* Any article in the baggage of a passenger arriving from a foreign country which is not declared as required by this subpart shall be seized if it is available for seizure at the time the violation is detected, and the personal penalty prescribed by section 497, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1497), shall be demanded from the passenger. If the article is not seized, a claim for the personal penalty shall be made against the person who imported the article without declaration. No duty shall be collected, because undeclared articles are treated as smuggled.


(b) *Remission of liability.* When an article not declared as required by this subpart is found in the baggage of a person arriving in the United States, the personal penalty and forfeiture may be mitigated or remitted in accordance with the Guidelines for Disposition of Violations of 19 U.S.C. 1497 in the appendix to part 171 of this chapter.
