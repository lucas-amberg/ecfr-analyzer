This paragraph does not pertain to any laboratory which has had its accreditation suspended or revoked. Laboratories which have had their accreditations continued under this section will have their status reevaluated on their next triennial inspection date which is no earlier than three years after the effective date of this regulation. At the time of reaccreditation, these laboratories must meet the requirements of this section and remit to Customs, at the address specified in the billing, within the 30 day billing period, the fixed reaccreditation fee. Failure to meet these requirements will result in revocation or suspension of the accreditation.


(j) *How will Customs-accredited laboratories operate?*—(1) *Samples for testing.* Upon request by the importer of record of merchandise, the port director will release a representative sample of the merchandise for testing by a Customs-accredited laboratory at the expense of the importer. Under Customs supervision, the sample will be split into two essentially equal parts and given to the Customs-accredited laboratory. One portion of the sample may be used by the Customs-accredited laboratory for its testing. The other portion must be retained by the laboratory, under appropriate storage conditions, for Customs use, as necessary, unless Customs requires other specific procedures. Upon request, the sample portion reserved for Customs purposes must be surrendered to Customs.


(i) *Retention of non-perishable samples.* Non-perishable samples reserved for Customs and sample remnants from any testing must be retained by the accredited laboratory for a period of four months from the date of the laboratory's final analysis report, unless other instructions are issued in writing by Customs. At the end of this retention time period, the accredited laboratory may dispose of the retained samples and sample remnants in a manner consistent with federal, state, and local statutes.


(ii) *Retention of perishable samples.* Perishable samples reserved for Customs and sample remnants from any testing can be disposed of more expeditiously than provided for at paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section, if done in accordance with acceptable laboratory procedures, unless other instructions are issued in writing by Customs.


(2) *Reports*—(i) *Contents of reports.* Testing data must be obtained using methods approved by the Executive Director. The testing results from a Customs-accredited laboratory that are submitted by an importer of record with respect to merchandise in an entry, in the absence of testing conducted by Customs laboratories, will be accepted by Customs, provided that the importer of record certifies that the sample tested was taken from the merchandise in the entry and the report establishes elements relating to the admissibility, quantity, composition, or characteristics of the merchandise entered, as required by law.


(ii) *Status of commercial reports where Customs also tests merchandise.* Nothing in these regulations will preclude Customs from sampling and testing merchandise from a shipment which has been sampled and tested by a Customs-accredited laboratory at the request of an importer. In cases where a shipment has been analyzed by both Customs and a Customs-accredited laboratory, all Customs actions will be based upon the analysis provided by the Customs laboratory, unless the Executive Director advises otherwise. If Customs tests merchandise, it will release the results of its test to the importer of record or its agent upon request unless the testing information is proprietary to the holder of a copyright or patent, or developed by Customs for enforcement purposes.


(3) *Recordkeeping requirements.* Customs-accredited laboratories must maintain records of the type normally kept in the ordinary course of business in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and any other applicable provision of law, and make them available during normal business hours for Customs inspection. In addition, these laboratories must maintain all records necessary to permit the evaluation and verification of all Customs-related work, including, as appropriate, those described below. All records must be maintained for five years, unless the laboratory is notified in writing by Customs that a longer retention time is necessary for particular records.
