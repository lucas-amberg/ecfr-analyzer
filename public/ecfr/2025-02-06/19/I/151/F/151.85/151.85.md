# ยง 151.85   Importer's request for redetermination.

If the importer is dissatisfied with the port director's or Center director's determination made before January 19, 2017, or the Center director's determination made on or after January 19, 2017, he may file with the Center director, within 14 calendar days after the mailing of the notice, a written request in duplicate for a redetermination of the staple length. Each such request shall include a statement of the claimed staple length for the cotton in question and a clear statement of the basis for the claim. The request shall be granted if it appears to the Center director to be made in good faith. In making the redetermination of staple length, the Center director may obtain an opinion of a board of cotton examiners from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, if he deems such action advisable. All expenses occasioned by any redetermination of staple length, exclusive of the compensation of CBP officers, shall be reimbursed to the Government by the importer.
