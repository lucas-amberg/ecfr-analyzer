# § 152.107   Value if other values cannot be determined or used.

(a) *Reasonable adjustments.* If the value of imported merchandise cannot be determined or otherwise used for the purposes of this subpart, the imported merchandise will be appraised on the basis of a value derived from the methods set forth in §§ 152.103 through 152.106, reasonably adjusted to the extent necessary to arrive at a value. Only information available in the United States will be used.

Customs values of identical merchandise, or similar merchandise, already determined on the basis of deductive value or computed value may be used.


(c) *Deductive value.* The “90 days” requirement for the sale of merchandise referred to in § 152.105(c) may be administered flexibly.
