# § 159.12   Extension of time for liquidation.

(a) *Reasons*—(1) *Extension.* The Center director may extend the 1-year statutory period for liquidation for an additional period not to exceed 1 year if:


(i) *Information needed by CBP.* Information needed by CBP for the proper appraisement or classification of the merchandise is not available, or


(ii) *Importer's request.* The importer requests an extension in writing before the statutory period expires and shows good cause why the extension should be granted. “Good cause” is demonstrated when the importer satisfies the Center director that more time is needed to present to CBP information which will affect the pending action, or there is a similar question under review by CBP.


(2) *Suspension.* The 1-year liquidation period may be suspended as required by statute or court order.


(b) *Notice of extension.* If the Center director extends the time for liquidation, as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the official notice of extension and reasons therefor will be posted on *www.cbp.gov.* The notice of extension will be maintained on *www.cbp.gov* for a minimum of 15 months from the date of posting. The Center director will also endeavor to transmit a courtesy notice of extension to the entry filer or its agent and the surety on an entry through a CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system.


(c) *Notice of suspension.* If the liquidation of an entry is suspended as required by statute or court order, as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the official notice of suspension will be posted on *www.cbp.gov.* The notice of suspension will be maintained on *www.cbp.gov* for a minimum of 15 months from the date of posting. The Center director will also endeavor to transmit a courtesy notice of suspension to the entry filer or its agent and the surety on an entry through a CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system.


(d) *Additional extensions*—(1) *Information needed by CBP.* If an extension has been granted because CBP needs more information and the Center director thereafter determines that more time is needed, he may extend the time for liquidation for an additional period not to exceed 1 year provided he issues the notice required by paragraph (b) of this section before termination of the prior extension period.


(2) *At importer's request.* If the statutory period has been extended for one year at the importer's request, and the importer thereafter determines that additional time is necessary, it may request another extension in writing before the original extension expires, giving reasons for its request. If the Center director finds that good cause (as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section) exists, the official notice of extension extending the time for liquidation for an additional period not to exceed one year will be posted on *www.cbp.gov,* and CBP will provide courtesy notice of the extension to the entry filer or its agent and the surety on an entry through a CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system.


(e) *Limitation on extensions.* The total time for which extensions may be granted by the Center director may not exceed 3 years.


(f) *Time limitation.* An entry not liquidated within four years from either the date of entry, or the date of final withdrawal of all the merchandise covered by a warehouse entry, will be deemed liquidated by operation of law at the rate of duty, value, quantity, and amount of duty asserted by the importer of record, unless liquidation continues to be suspended by statute or court order. CBP will endeavor to provide a courtesy notice of liquidation, in accordance with § 159.9(d), in addition to the notice specified in § 159.9(c)(2)(i).
