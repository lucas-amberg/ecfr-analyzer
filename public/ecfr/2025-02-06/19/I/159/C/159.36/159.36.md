# § 159.36   Multiple certified rates.

The following procedures shall apply when the Federal Reserve Bank of New York certifies two or more rates of exchange (e.g., official and free) for a foreign currency: 


(a) *Rates to be published.* When the Federal Reserve Bank of New York certifies two or more rates of exchange for the currency of any country, those rates will be published in the Customs Bulletin. 


(b) *Laws of country of exportation followed.* When multiple rates have been certified for a foreign currency, the rate to be used for Customs purposes shall be the type of certified rate which the Center director is satisfied, from information in his own files, information obtained and presented to him by the importer, or information obtained from other sources, is uniformly applicable under the laws and regulations of the country of exportation to the particular class of merchandise on the date of exportation. In cases where two or more types of certified rates are uniformly applicable on a percentage bases, each type of certified rate shall be used for the percentage of value to which it is applicable. The percentages used shall be those which reflect realistically the percentage for which each type of rate is uniformly applicable under the laws and regulations of the country of exportation on the date of exportation. 


(c) *Procedure when multiple certified rates not uniformly applicable.* If the Center director has credible information that a type of rate or combination of types of rates which would otherwise be applicable under paragraph (b) of this section were not required or permitted, as the case may be, under the laws and regulations of the country of exportation to be used uniformly during any period in connection with the payment for all merchandise of the class involved, he shall immediately submit a detailed report to the Commissioner of Customs, and shall suspend appraisement and liquidation as to all merchandise of the class involved exported to the United States during the period involved, until instructions are received from the Commissioner of Customs. 


(d) *Rate for merchandise different from rate for costs.* If the Center director has credible information that a type of rate or combination of types of rates not applicable to payment for the merchandise was required or permitted in payment of costs, charges, or expenses, the currency conversions for the exchange covering payment for the merchandise and for the exchange covering such costs, charges, or expenses shall be calculated separately. In deducting nondutiable costs, charges, or expenses, the foreign exchange shall be at the rate or rates actually used in payment of such costs, charges, or expenses, whether or not certified in accordance with § 159.34 or § 159.35. If the costs, charges or expenses are dutiable, they shall be calculated according to the rules set forth in this subpart. In the event that any type of rate uniformly applicable to payment of such dutiable costs, charges, or expenses for merchandise of the class involved was a type of rate not certified in accordance with § 159.34 or § 159.35, the Center director shall immediately submit a detailed report to the Commissioner of Customs, and shall suspend appraisement and liquidation as to all merchandise of the class involved exported to the United States during the period involved, until instructions are received from the Commissioner.
