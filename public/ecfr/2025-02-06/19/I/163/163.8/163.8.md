# § 163.8   Third-party recordkeeper summons.

(a) *Notice required.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f) of this section, if a summons issued under § 163.7 to a third-party recordkeeper requires the production of, or the giving of testimony relating to, records pertaining to transactions of any person, other than the person summoned, who is identified in the description of the records contained in the summons, then notice of the summons shall be provided to the person so identified in the summons.


(b) *Time of notice.* The notice of service of summons required by paragraph (a) of this section should be provided by the issuing officer immediately after service of summons is obtained under § 163.7(c), but in no event shall notice be given less than 10 business days before the date set in the summons for the production of records or the giving of testimony.


(c) *Contents of notice.* The issuing officer shall ensure that any notice issued under this section includes a copy of the summons and provides the following information:


(1) That compliance with the summons may be stayed if written direction not to comply with the summons is given by the person receiving notice to the person summoned;


(2) That a copy of any such direction to not comply and a copy of the summons shall be sent by registered or certified mail to the person summoned and to the Customs officer who issued the summons; and


(3) That the actions under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section shall be accomplished not later than the day before the day fixed in the summons as the day upon which the records are to be examined or the testimony is to be given.


(d) *Service of notice.* The Customs officer who issues the summons shall serve the notice required by paragraph (a) of this section in the same manner as is prescribed in § 163.7(c)(2) for the service of a summons, or by certified or registered mail to the last known address of the person entitled to notice.


(e) *Examination of records precluded.* If notice is required by this section, no record may be examined before the date fixed in the summons as the date to produce the records. If the person entitled to notice under paragraph (a) of this section issues a stay of compliance with the summons in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, no examination of records shall take place except with the consent of the person staying compliance or pursuant to an order issued by a U.S. district court.


(f) *Exceptions to notice and stay of summons provisions*—(1) *Personal liability for duties, fees, or taxes.* The notice provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to any summons served on the person, or on any officer or employee of the person, with respect to whose liability for duties, fees, or taxes the summons is issued.


(2) *Verification of existence of records.* The notice provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to any summons issued to determine whether or not records of transactions of an identified person have been made or kept.


(3) *Judicial determination.* The notice provisions of paragraph (a) of this section and the stay of compliance provisions of paragraph (c) of this section shall not apply with respect to a summons described in paragraph (a) of this section if a U.S. district court determines, upon petition by the issuing Customs officer, that reasonable cause exists to believe that the giving of notice may lead to an attempt:


(i) To conceal, destroy, or alter relevant records;


(ii) To prevent the communication of information from other persons through intimidation, bribery, or collusion; or


(iii) To flee to avoid prosecution, testifying, or production of records.
