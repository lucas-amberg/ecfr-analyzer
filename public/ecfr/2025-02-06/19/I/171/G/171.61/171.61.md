# ยง 171.61   Time and place of filing.

If the petitioner is not satisfied with a decision of the deciding official on an original petition for relief, a supplemental petition may be filed with the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer having jurisdiction in the port where the violation occurred. Such supplemental petition must be filed within 60 days from the date of notice to the petitioner of the decision from which further relief is requested or within 60 days following an administrative or judicial decision with respect to the entries involved in a penalty case which reduces the loss of duties upon which the mitigated penalty amount was based (whichever is later) unless another time to file such a supplemental petition is prescribed in the decision. The filing of a supplemental petition may be subject to the conditions prescribed in ยง 171.64 of this part. A supplemental petition may be filed whether or not the mitigated penalty or forfeiture remission amount designated in the decision on the original petition is paid.
