# ยง 172.21   Decisions effective for limited time.

A decision to mitigate a penalty or to cancel a claim for liquidated damages upon condition that a stated amount is paid will be effective for not more than 60 days from the date of notice to the petitioner of such decision unless the decision itself prescribes a different effective period. If payment of the stated amount is not made or a petition or a supplemental petition is not filed in accordance with regulation, the full penalty or claim for liquidated damages will be deemed applicable and will be enforced by promptly transmitting the matter, after required collection action, if appropriate, to the appropriate office of the Chief Counsel for preparation for referral to the Department of Justice unless other action has been directed by the Commissioner of Customs. Any such case may also be the basis for a sanction action commenced in accordance with regulations in this chapter.
