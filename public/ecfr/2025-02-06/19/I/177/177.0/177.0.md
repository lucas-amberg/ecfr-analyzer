# ยง 177.0   Scope.

This part relates to the issuance of rulings to importers and other interested persons by the CBP, other than advance rulings under Article 509 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (see subpart I of part 181 of this chapter). It describes the situations in which a ruling may be requested, the procedures to be followed in requesting a ruling, the conditions under which a ruling will be issued, the effect of a ruling when it is issued, and the publication of rulings in the Customs Bulletin. The rulings issued under the provisions of this part will usually be prospective in application and, consequently, will usually not relate to specific matters or situations presently or previously under consideration by any CBP field office. Accordingly, the rulings requested under the provisions of this part should be distinguished from the administrative rulings, determinations, or decisions which may be requested under procedures set forth elsewhere in this chapter, including, but not limited to, those set forth in part 12 (relating to submissions of proof of admissibility of articles detained under section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307)), part 103 (relating to disclosure of information in Customs files), subpart C of part 152 (relating to determinations concerning the dutiable value of merchandise by Customs field officers), part 153 (relating to enforcement of the Antidumping Act, 1921, as amended), part 159 (insofar as it relates to countervailing duties), part 171 (relating to fines, penalties, and forfeitures), part 172 (relating to liquidated damages), part 174 (relating to protests), and part 175 (relating to petitions filed by American manufacturers, producers, or wholesalers pursuant to section 516 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended). Nor do the provisions of part 177 apply to requests for decisions of an operational, administrative, or investigative nature which are properly within the cognizance of a CBP Headquarters Office other than Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade.
