# ยง 177.5   Change in status of transaction.

Each person submitting a request for a ruling in connection with a Customs transaction shall immediately advise Customs in writing of any change in the status of that transaction, as defined in ยง 177.1(d)(3). In particular, the Customs Service office to which the request was made must be advised when any transaction described in the ruling request as prospective becomes current and under the jurisdiction of a Customs Service field office. In addition, any person engaged in a Customs transaction coming under the jurisdiction of a Customs Service field office and having previously requested a ruling with respect to that transaction shall advise the field office of that fact. The field office will normally withhold action with respect to any transaction for which a ruling has previously been requested pending the disposition of the ruling request.
