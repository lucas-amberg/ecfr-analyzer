# § 18.10   Special manifest.

(a) *General.* Merchandise for which no other type of bonded movement is appropriate (e.g., prematurely discharged or overcarried merchandise and other such types of movements whereby the normal transportation-in-bond procedures are not applicable) may be shipped in-bond from the port of unlading to the port of destination, port of exportation or port of diversion where applicable, upon approval by CBP.


(b) *Filing requirements.* The carrier or any of the parties named in § 18.1(c) may, in accordance with the filing requirements of § 18.1, submit an in-bond application, requesting permission to transport merchandise described in paragraph (a) of this section in-bond as a special manifest. Authorization for the movement of merchandise will be transmitted via a CBP-approved EDI system. The party submitting the in-bond application must identify the relevant merchandise and also identify the date and entry number of any entry made at the port of destination covering the merchandise to be returned, if known. For diversion of cargo, see §§ 4.33, 4.34, and 18.5 of this chapter. When no entry is identified, the port director may approve the shipment pursuant to this section.
