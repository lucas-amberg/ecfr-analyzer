Such merchandise delivered to a bonded common carrier, contract carrier, or freight forwarder may be transported with the use of facilities of other bonded or non-bonded carriers; however, the responsibility for the merchandise will remain with the common carrier, contract carrier, or freight forwarder that obligated its bond for that purpose.
