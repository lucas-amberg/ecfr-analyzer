# § 18.11   General rules.

(a) *Delivery outside port limits.* Merchandise covered by an entry for immediate transportation, including a TIR carnet, or a manifest of baggage shipped in-bond (other than baggage to be forwarded in-bond to a CBP station—see § 18.13(a)), may be delivered to a place outside a port of entry for examination and release as contemplated by 19 U.S.C. 1484(c), and in accordance with the provisions of § 151.9 of this chapter.


(b) *Divided shipments.* One or more entire packages of merchandise covered by an invoice from one consignor to one consignee may be entered for consumption or warehouse at the port of first arrival, and the remainder entered for immediate transportation, provided that all of the merchandise covered by the invoice is entered and a TIR carnet which may cover such merchandise is discharged as to that merchandise.


(c) *Consolidated loads and combined shipments.* Several importations may be consolidated into one immediate transportation entry when bills of lading or carrier's certificates name only one consignee at the port of first arrival. However, merchandise moving under cover of a TIR carnet may not be consolidated with other merchandise.


(d) *Textiles.* Textiles and textile products subject to § 204, Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854) must be described in such detail as to enable the port director to estimate the duties and taxes, if any, due. The port director may require evidence to satisfy him or her of the approximate correctness of the value and quantity stated in the entry (e.g., detailed quantity description: 14 cartons, 2 dozen per carton); detailed description of the textiles or textile products including type of commodity and chief fiber content (e.g., men's cotton jeans or women's wool sweaters); net weight of the textiles or textile products (including immediate packing but excluding pallet); total value of the textiles or textile products; manufacturer or supplier; country of origin; and name(s) and address(es) of the person(s) to whom the textiles and textile products are consigned.
