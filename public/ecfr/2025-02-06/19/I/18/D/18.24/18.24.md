# § 18.24   Retention of goods within port limits; dividing of shipments.

(a) *Retention of goods within port limits.* Upon receipt of a written request by the carrier or any of the parties provided for in § 18.1(c), the port director, in his or her discretion, may allow in-transit merchandise, including merchandise covered by a (TIR) carnet, to remain within the port limits of the port of exportation under CBP supervision without extra expense to the Government for a period not exceeding 90 days. Upon obtaining CBP approval, the carrier or any of the parties provided for in § 18.1(c) must submit an immediate exportation in-bond application pursuant to §§ 18.1 and 18.25 of this chapter. Upon further requests, additional extensions of 90 days or less may be granted by the port director, but the merchandise may not remain in the port limits for more than one year from the date of arrival of the importing conveyance at the port of first arrival. Any merchandise that remains in the port limits without authorization is subject to general order requirements under § 4.37, § 122.50, or § 123.10 of this chapter, as applicable.


(b) *Divided shipments at the port of exportation.* The dividing of an in-bond shipment after it has arrived at the port of exportation will be permitted when exportation in its entirety is not possible by reason of the different destinations to which portions of the shipment are destined, when the exporting vessel cannot properly accommodate the entire quantity, or in similar circumstances. The carrier or any of the parties named in § 18.1(c) must update the in-bond record with the new information regarding the divided shipment within two business days of the dividing of the shipment. In the case, however, of merchandise being transported under cover of a carnet, the dividing of a shipment is not permitted.
