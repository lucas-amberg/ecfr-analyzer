# § 18.31   Pipeline transportation of bonded merchandise.

(a) *General procedures*—(1) *Applicability.* Merchandise may be transported by pipeline under the procedures in this part, as appropriate, and unless otherwise specifically provided for in this section.


(2) *In-bond application.* For purposes of this section, the in-bond application will be made by submitting a CBP Form 7512 or by electronic submission via a CBP-approved EDI system.


(b) *Bill of lading to account for merchandise.* Unless CBP has reasonable cause to suspect fraud, CBP will accept a bill of lading or equivalent document of receipt issued by the pipeline operator to the shipper and accepted by the consignee to account for the quantity of merchandise transported by pipeline and to maintain the identity of the merchandise.


(c) *Procedures when pipeline is only carrier.* When a pipeline is the only carrier of the in-bond merchandise and there is no transfer to another carrier, the bill of lading or equivalent document of receipt issued by the pipeline operator to the shipper must be submitted with the in-bond application. If there are no discrepancies between the bill of lading or equivalent document of receipt and the in-bond application for the merchandise, and provided that CBP has no reasonable cause to suspect fraud, the bill of lading or equivalent document of receipt will be accepted by CBP as establishing the quantity and identity of the merchandise transported. The pipeline operator is responsible for any discrepancies, including shortages, irregular deliveries, or nondeliveries at the port of destination or exportation (see § 18.8).


(d) *Procedures when there is more than one carrier (i.e., transfer of the merchandise)*—(1) *Pipeline as initial carrier.* When a pipeline is the initial carrier of merchandise to be transported in-bond and the merchandise is transferred to another conveyance (either a different mode of transportation or a pipeline operated by another operator), the procedures for transfers in § 18.3 and paragraph (c) of this section must be followed, except that—


(i) When the merchandise is to be transferred to one conveyance, a copy of the bill of lading or equivalent document issued by the pipeline operator to the shipper must be delivered to the person in charge of the conveyance for transmission to CBP; or


(ii) When the merchandise is to be transferred to more than one conveyance, a copy of the bill of lading or equivalent document issued by the pipeline operator to the shipper must be delivered to the person in charge of each additional conveyance, for transmission to CBP.


(2) *Transfer to pipeline from initial carrier other than a pipeline.* When merchandise initially transported in-bond by a carrier other than a pipeline is transferred to a pipeline, the procedures in § 18.3 and paragraph (c) of this section must be followed, except that the bill of lading or other equivalent document of receipt issued by the pipeline operator to the shipper must be transmitted to CBP.


(3) *Initial carrier liable for discrepancies.* In the case of either paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, the initial carrier will be responsible for any discrepancies, including shortages, irregular deliveries, or nondeliveries, at the port of destination or failure to export at the port of exportation (see generally § 18.8).


(e) *Recordkeeping.* The shipper, pipeline operator, and consignee are subject to the recordkeeping requirements in 19 U.S.C. 1508 and 1509, as provided for in part 163 of this chapter.
