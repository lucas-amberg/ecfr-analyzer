# Appendix to Part 181—Rules of Origin Regulations




This appendix may be cited as the *NAFTA Rules of Origin Regulations.*

Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces Good A. In the production process, Producer A uses originating Material X and non-originating Material Y to produce Material Z. Material Z is a self-produced material that will be used to produce Good A. 


The rule set out in Schedule I for the heading under which Good A is classified specifies a change in tariff classification from any other heading. In this case, both Good A and the non-originating Material Y are of the same heading. However, the self-produced Material Z is of a heading different than that of Good A. 


For purposes of determining whether the non-originating materials that are used in the production of Good A undergo the applicable change in tariff classification, Producer A has the option to consider the self-produced Material Z as the material that must undergo a change in tariff classification. As Material Z is of a heading different than that of Good A, Material Z satisfies the applicable change in tariff classification and Good A would qualify as an originating good.




Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, uses originating materials and non-originating materials in the production of copper anodes provided for in heading 7402. The rule set out in Schedule I for heading 7402 specifies a change in tariff classification from any other chapter. There is no applicable regional value-content requirement for this heading. Therefore, in order for the copper anode to qualify as an originating good under the rule set out in Schedule I, Producer A may not use in the production of the copper anode any non-originating material provided for in Chapter 74. 


All of the materials used in the production of the copper anode are originating materials, with the exception of a small amount of copper scrap provided for in heading 7404, that is in the same chapter as the copper anode. Under section 5(1), if the value of the non-originating copper scrap does not exceed seven percent of the transaction value of the copper anode or the total cost of the copper anode, whichever is applicable, the copper anode would be considered an originating good. 


Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, uses originating materials and non-originating materials in the production of ceiling fans provided for in subheading 8414.51. There are two alternative rules set out in Schedule I for subheading 8414.51, one of which specifies a change in tariff classification from any other heading. The other rule specifies both a change in tariff classification from the subheading under which parts of the ceiling fans are classified and a regional value-content requirement. Therefore, in order for the ceiling fan to qualify as an originating good under the first of the alternative rules, all of the materials that are classified under the subheading for parts of ceiling fans and used in the production of the completed ceiling fan must be originating materials. 


In this case, all of the non-originating materials used in the production of the ceiling fan satisfy the change in tariff classification set out in the rule that specifies a change in tariff classification from any other heading, with the exception of one non-originating material that is classified under the subheading for parts of ceiling fans. Under section 5(1), if the value of the non-originating material that does not satisfy the change in tariff classification specified in the first rule does not exceed seven percent of the transaction value of the ceiling fan or the total cost of the ceiling fan, whichever is applicable, the ceiling fan would be considered an originating good. Therefore, under section 5(2), the ceiling fan would not be required to satisfy the alternative rule that specifies both a change in tariff classification and a regional value-content requirement. 


Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, uses originating materials and non-originating materials in the production of plastic bags provided for in subheading 3923.29. The rule set out in Schedule I for subheading 3923.29 specifies both a change in tariff classification from any other heading, except from subheadings 3920.20 or 3920.71, under which certain plastic materials are classified, and a regional value-content requirement. Therefore, with respect to that part of the rule that specifies a change in tariff classification, in order for the plastic bag to qualify as an originating good, any plastic materials that are classified under subheading 3920.20 or 3920.71 and that are used in the production of the plastic bag must be originating materials. 


In this case, all of the non-originating materials used in the production of the plastic bag satisfy the specified change in tariff classification, with the exception of a small amount of plastic materials classified under subheading 3920.71. Section 5(1) provides that the plastic bag can be considered an originating good if the value of the non-originating plastic materials that do not satisfy the specified change in tariff classification does not exceed seven percent of the transaction value of the plastic bag or the total cost of the plastic bag, whichever is applicable. In this case, the value of those non-originating materials that do not satisfy the specified change in tariff classification does not exceed the seven percent limit. 


However, the rule set out in Schedule I for subheading 3923.29 specifies both a change in tariff classification and a regional value-content requirement. Therefore, under section 5(1)(c), in order to be considered an originating good, the plastic bag must also, except as otherwise provided in section 5(5), satisfy the regional value-content requirement specified in that rule. As provided in section 5(1)(c), the value of the non-originating materials that do not satisfy the specified change in tariff classification, together with the value of all other non-originating materials used in the production of the plastic bag, will be taken into account in calculating the regional value content of the plastic bag. 


Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, primarily uses originating materials in the production of shoes provided for in heading 6405. The rule set out in Schedule I for heading 6405 specifies both a change in tariff classification from any subheading other than subheadings 6401.10 through 6406.10 and a regional value-content requirement. 


With the exception of a small amount of materials provided for in Chapter 39, all of the materials used in the production of the shoes are originating materials. 


Under section 5(5), if the value of all of the non-originating materials used in the production of the shoes does not exceed seven percent of the transaction value of the shoes or the total cost of the shoes, whichever is applicable, the shoes are not required to satisfy the regional value-content requirement specified in the rule set out in Schedule I in order to be considered originating goods. 


Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces barbers' chairs provided for in subheading 9402.10. The rule set out in Schedule I for goods provided for in heading 9402 specifies a change in tariff classification from any other chapter. All of the materials used in the production of these chairs are originating materials, with the exception of a small quantity of non-originating materials that are classified as parts of barbers' chairs. These parts undergo no change in tariff classification because subheading 9402.10 provides for both barbers' chairs and their parts. 


Although Producer A's barbers' chairs do not qualify as originating goods under the rule set out in Schedule I, section 4(4)(b) provides, among other things, that, where there is no change in tariff classification from the non-originating materials to the goods because the subheading under which the goods are classified provides for both the goods and their parts, the goods shall qualify as originating goods if they satisfy a specified regional value-content requirement. 


However, under section 5(5), if the value of the non-originating materials does not exceed seven percent of the transaction value of the barbers' chairs or the total cost of the barbers' chairs, whichever is applicable, the barbers' chairs will be considered originating goods and are not required to satisfy the regional value-content requirement set out in section 4(4)(b)(v). 


Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces women's dresses provided for in subheading 6204.41 from fine wool fabric of heading 5112. This fine wool fabric, also produced by Producer A, is the component of the dress that determines its tariff classification under subheading 6204.41. 


The rule set out in Schedule I for subheading 6204.41, under which the dress is classified, specifies both a change in tariff classification from any other chapter, except from those headings and chapters under which certain yarns and fabrics, including combed wool yarn and wool fabric, are classified, and a requirement that the good be cut and sewn or otherwise assembled in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries. 


Therefore, with respect to that part of the rule that specifies a change in tariff classification, in order for the dress to qualify as an originating good, the combed wool yarn and the fine wool fabric made therefrom that are used by Producer A in the production of the dress must be originating materials. 


At one point Producer A uses a small quantity of non-originating combed wool yarn in the production of the fine wool fabric. Under section 5(6), if the total weight of the non-originating combed wool yarn does not exceed seven percent of the total weight of all the yarn used in the production of the component of the dress that determines its tariff classification, that is, the wool fabric, the dress would be considered an originating good.




A producer has only one factory, at which the producer manufactures finished office chairs. Because the factory is located close to transportation facilities, all units of the finished good are stored in a factory warehouse 200 meters from the end of the production line. Goods are shipped worldwide from this warehouse. The point of direct shipment is the warehouse. 


A producer has six factories, all located within the territory of one of the NAFTA countries, at which the producer produces garden tools of various types. These tools are shipped worldwide, and orders usually consist of bulk orders of various types of tools. Because different tools are manufactured at different factories, the producer decided to consolidate storage and shipping facilities and ships all finished products to a large warehouse located near the seaport, from which all orders are shipped. The distance from the factories to the warehouse varies from 3 km to 130 km. The point of direct shipment for each of the goods is the warehouse. 


A producer has only one factory, located near the center of one of the NAFTA countries, at which the producer manufactures finished office chairs. The office chairs are shipped from that factory to three warehouses leased by the producer, one on the west coast, one near the factory and one on the east coast. The office chairs are shipped to buyers from these warehouses, the shipping location depending on the shipping distance from the buyer. Buyers closest to the west coast warehouse are normally supplied by the west coast warehouse, buyers closest to the east coast are normally supplied by the warehouse located on the east coast and buyers closest to the warehouse near the factory are normally supplied by that warehouse. In this case, the point of direct shipment is the location of the warehouse from which the office chairs are normally shipped to customers in the location in which the buyer is located. 


A producer located in NAFTA country A sells Good A that is subject to a regional value-content requirement to a buyer located in NAFTA country B. The producer of Good A chooses that the regional value content of that good be calculated using the net cost method. All applicable requirements of this appendix, other than the regional value-content requirement, have been met. The applicable regional value-content requirement is 50 percent. 


In order to calculate the regional value-content of Good A, the producer first calculates the net cost of Good A. Under section 6(11)(a), the net cost is the total cost of Good A (the aggregate of the product costs, period costs and other costs) per unit, minus the excluded costs (the aggregate of the sales promotion, marketing and after-sales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs and non-allowable interest costs) per unit. The producer uses the following figures to calculate the net cost:


The net cost is the total cost of Good A, per unit, minus the excluded costs.


The value for net cost ($88) and the value of non-originating materials ($40) are needed in order to calculate the regional value content. The producer calculates the regional value content of Good A under the net cost method in the following manner: 


Therefore, under the net cost method, Good A qualifies as an originating good, with a regional value-content of 54.5 percent. 


On January 15, 1994, a producer located in NAFTA country A sells 1,000 units of Good A to a related person, located in NAFTA country B. During the six month period beginning on July 1, 1993 and ending on December 31, 1993, the producer sold 90,000 units of identical goods and similar goods to related persons from various countries, including that buyer. The producer's total sales of those identical goods and similar goods to all persons from all countries during that six month period were 100,000 units. 


The total quantity of identical goods and similar goods sold by the producer to related persons during that six month period was 90 percent of the producer's total sales of those identical goods and similar goods to all persons. Under section 6(6)(c), the producer must use the net cost method to calculate the regional value content of Good A sold in January 1994, because the 85 percent limit was exceeded. 


A producer in a NAFTA country produces Good A and Good B during the producer's fiscal year. 


The producer uses the following figures, which are recorded on the producer's books and represent all of the costs incurred with respect to both Good A and Good B, to calculate the net cost of those goods:


The net cost must then be reasonably allocated, in accordance with Schedule VII, to Good A and Good B. 


A producer located in a NAFTA country produces Good A and Good B during the producer's fiscal year. In order to calculate the regional value content of Good A and Good B, the producer uses the following figures that are recorded on the producer's books and incurred with respect to those goods:


Under section 6(11)(b), the total cost of Good A and Good B is then reasonably allocated, in accordance with Schedule VII, to those goods. The costs are allocated in the following manner:


The excluded costs ($1,200) that are included in total cost allocated to Good A and Good B, in accordance with Schedule VII, are subtracted from that amount.


The net cost of Good A is thus $4,524, and the net cost of Good B is $3,276. 


A Producer located in a NAFTA country produces Good C and Good D. The following costs are recorded on the producer's books for the months of January, February and March, and each cost that forms part of the total cost are reasonably allocated, in accordance with Schedule VII, to Good C and Good D.


Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces Good A that is subject to a regional value-content requirement. The producer chooses that the regional value content of that good be calculated using the net cost method. Producer A buys Material X from Producer B, located in a NAFTA country. Material X is a non-originating material and is used in the production of Good A. Producer A provides Producer B, at no charge, with tools to be used in the production of Material X. The cost of the tools that is recorded on the books of Producer A has been expensed in the current year. Pursuant to section 5(1)(b)(ii) of Schedule VIII, the value of the tools is included in the value of Material X. Therefore, the cost of the tools that is recorded on the books of Producer A and that has been expensed in the current year cannot be included as a separate cost in the net cost of Good A because it has already been included in the value of Material X.


Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces Good A that is subject to a regional value-content requirement. The producer chooses that the regional value content of that good be calculated using the net cost method and averages the calculation over the producer's fiscal year under section 6(15). Producer A determines that during that fiscal year Producer A incurred a gain on foreign currency conversion of $10,000 and a loss on foreign currency conversion of $8,000, resulting in a net gain of $2,000. Producer A also determines that $7,000 of the gain on foreign currency conversion and $6,000 of the loss on foreign currency conversion is related to the purchase of non-originating materials used in the production of Good A, and $3,000 of the gain on foreign currency conversion and $2,000 of the loss on foreign currency conversion is not related to the production of Good A. The producer determines that the total cost of Good A is $45,000 before deducting the $1,000 net gain on foreign currency conversion related to the production of Good A. The total cost of Good A is therefore $44,000. That $1,000 net gain is not included in the value of non-originating materials under section 7(1).


Given the same facts as in example 10, except that Producer A determines that $6,000 of the gain on foreign currency conversion and $7,000 of the loss on foreign currency conversion is related to the purchase of non-originating materials used in the production of Good A. The total cost of Good A is $45,000, which includes the $1,000 net loss on foreign currency conversion related to the production of Good A. That $1,000 net loss is not included in the value of non-originating materials under section 7(1).


Producer A, located in NAFTA country A, imports material A into NAFTA country A. Producer A purchased material A from a middleman located in country B. The middleman purchased the material from a manufacturer located in country B. Under the laws in NAFTA country A that implement the *Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,* the customs value of material A was based on the price actually paid or payable by the middleman to the manufacturer. Producer A uses material A to produce Good C, and exports Good C to NAFTA country D. Good C is subject to a regional value-content requirement. 


Under section 4(1) of Schedule VIII, the price actually paid or payable is the total payment made or to be made by the producer to or for the benefit of the seller of the material. Section 1 of that Schedule defines producer and seller for purposes of the Schedule. A producer is the person who uses the material in the production of a good that is subject to a regional value-content requirement. A seller is the person who sells the material being valued to the producer. 


The customs value of material A was not determined in a manner consistent with Schedule VIII because it was based on the price actually paid or payable by the middleman to the manufacturer, rather than on the price actually paid or payable by Producer A to the middleman. Thus, section 7(2) applies and material A is valued in accordance with Schedule VIII. 


A producer located in a NAFTA country produces Good B, which is subject to a regional value-content requirement under section 4(2)(b). The producer also produces Material A, which is used in the production of Good B. Both originating materials and non-originating materials are used in the production of Material A. Material A is subject to a change in tariff classification requirement under section 4(2)(a). The costs to produce Material A are the following:


The producer designates Material A as an intermediate material and determines that, because all of the non-originating materials that are used in the production of Material A undergo an applicable change in tariff classification set out in Schedule I, Material A would, under paragraph 4(2)(a) qualify as an originating material. The cost of the non-originating materials used in the production of Material A is therefore not included in the value of non-originating materials that are used in the production of Good B for the purpose of determining the regional value content of Good B. Because Material A has been designated as an intermediate material, the total cost of Material A, which is $10.60, is treated as the cost of originating materials for the purpose of calculating the regional value content of Good B. The total cost of Good B is determined in accordance with the following figures:


The ability to designate intermediate materials helps to put the vertically integrated producer who is self-producing materials that are used in the production of a good on par with a producer who is purchasing materials and valuing those materials in accordance with subsection 7(1). The following situations demonstrate how this is achieved:


*Situation 1*

A producer located in a NAFTA country produces Good B, which is subject to a regional value-content requirement of 50 percent under the net cost method. Good B satisfies all other applicable requirements of these Regulations. The producer purchases Material A, which is used in the production of Good B, from a supplier located in a NAFTA country. The value of Material A determined in accordance with subsection 7(1) is $11.00. Material A is an originating material. All other materials used in the production of Good B are non-originating materials. The net cost of Good B is determined as follows:


The regional value content of Good B is calculated as follows: 


The regional value content of Good B is 76.5 percent, and Good B, therefore, qualifies as an originating good. 


*Situation 2*

A producer located in a NAFTA country produces Good B, which is subject to a regional value-content requirement of 50 percent under the net cost method. Good B satisfies all other applicable requirements of these Regulations. The producer self-produces Material A which is used in the production of Good B. The costs to produce Material A are the following:


Additional costs to produce Good B are the following:


The producer does not designate Material A as an intermediate material under subsection 7(4). The net cost of Good B is calculated as follows:


The regional value content of Good B is calculated as follows:


The regional value content of Good B is 42.9 percent, and Good B, therefore, does not qualify as an originating good. 


*Situation 3*

A producer located in a NAFTA country produces Good B, which is subject to a regional value-content requirement of 50 percent under the net cost method. Good B satisfies all other applicable requirements of these Regulations. The producer self-produces Material A, which is used in the production of Good B. The costs to produce Material A are the following:


Additional costs to produce Good B are the following:


The producer designates Material A as an intermediate material under subsection 7(4). Material A qualifies as an originating material under paragraph 4(2)(a). Therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of Material A is not included in the value of non-originating materials for the purposes of calculating the regional value content of Good B. The net cost of Good B is calculated as follows:


The regional value content of Good B is calculated as follows: 


The regional value content of Good B is 76.1 percent, and Good B, therefore, qualifies as an originating good. 


Producer A, located in NAFTA country A, produces switches. In order for the switches to qualify as originating goods, Producer A designates subassemblies of the switches as intermediate materials. The subassemblies are subject to a regional value-content requirement. They satisfy that requirement, and qualify as originating materials. The switches are also subject to a regional value-content requirement, and, with the subassemblies designated as intermediate materials, are determined to have a regional value content of 65 percent. 


Producer A sells the switches to Producer B, located in NAFTA country B, who uses them to produce switch assemblies that are used in the production of Good B. The switch assemblies are subject to a regional value-content requirement. Producers A and B are not accumulating their production within the meaning of section 14. Producer B is therefore able, under section 7(4), to designate the switch assemblies as intermediate materials. 


If Producers A and B were accumulating their production within the meaning of section 14, Producer B would be unable to designate the switch assemblies as intermediate materials, because the production of both producers would be considered to be the production of one producer. 


Producer A, located in NAFTA country, produces Material X and uses Material X in the production of Good B. Material X qualifies as an originating material because it satisfies the applicable regional value-content requirement. Producer A designates Material A as an intermediate material. 


Producer A uses Material X in the production of Material Y, which is also used in the production of Good B. Material Y is also subject to a regional value-content requirement. Under the proviso set out in section 7(4), Producer A cannot designate Material Y as an intermediate material, even if Material Y satisfies the applicable regional value-content requirement, because Material X was already designated by Producer A as an intermediate material. 


Producer X, who is located in NAFTA country X, uses non-originating materials in the production of self-produced materials A, B, and C. None of the self-produced materials are used in the production of any of the other self-produced materials. 


Producer X uses the self-produced materials in the production of Good O, which is exported to NAFTA country Y. Materials A, B and C qualify as originating materials because they satisfy the applicable regional value-content requirements. 


Because none of the self-produced materials are used in the production of any of the other self-produced materials, then even though each self-produced material is subject to a regional value-content requirement, Producer X may, under section 7(4), designate all of the self-produced materials as intermediate materials. The proviso set out in section 7(4) only applies where self-produced materials are used in the production of other self-produced materials and both are subject to a regional value-content requirement. 


The following are examples of accessories, spare parts or tools that are delivered with a good and form part of the good's standard accessories, spare parts or tools: 


Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces Good A that is subject to a regional value-content requirement. The producer chooses that the regional value content of that good be calculated using the net cost method. Producer A buys Material X from Producer B, located in a NAFTA country, and uses it in the production of Good A. Producer A provides to Producer B, at no charge, tools to be used in the production of Material X. The tools have a value of $100 which is expensed in the current year by Producer A. 


Material X is subject to a regional value-content requirement which Producer B chooses to calculate using the net cost method. For purposes of determining the value of non-originating materials in order to calculate the regional value content of Material X, the tools are considered to be an originating material because they are an indirect material. However, pursuant to section 7(11) they have a value of nil because the cost of the tools with respect to Material X is not recorded on the books of Producer B. 


It is determined that Material X is a non-originating material. The cost of the tools that is recorded on the books of producer A is expensed in the current year. Pursuant to section 5 of Schedule VIII, the value of the tools (see section 5(1)(b)(ii) of Schedule VIII) must be included in the value of Material X by Producer A when calculating the regional value content of Good A. The cost of the tools, although recorded on the books of producer A, cannot be included as a separate cost in the net cost of Good A because it is already included in the value of Material X. The entire cost of Material X, which includes the cost of the tools, is included in the value of non-originating materials for purposes of the regional value content of Good A.


For purposes of this part, 


Nuts and bolts provided for in heading 7318 are imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries and are used in the territory of a NAFTA country in the production of a light-duty automotive good referred to in section 9(1). Heading 7318 is not listed in Schedule IV so the nuts and bolts are not traced materials. 


Because the nuts and bolts are not traced materials the value, under section 9(1), of the nuts and bolts is not included in the value of non-originating materials used in the light-duty automotive good even though the nuts and bolts are imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries. 


The value, under section 9(9)(b), of the nuts and bolts is included in the net cost of the light-duty automotive good for the purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), regional value content of the motor vehicle. 


A rear view mirror provided for in subheading 7009.10 is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries and is used in the territory of a NAFTA country as original equipment in the production of a light-duty vehicle. 


Subheading 7009.10 is listed in Schedule IV. The rear view mirror is a traced material. For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), regional value content of the light-duty vehicle, the value of the mirror is included in the value of non-originating materials in accordance with sections 9(2) through (9). 


Glass provided for in heading 7005 is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries and is used in the territory of NAFTA country A in the production of a rear view mirror. The rear view mirror is a non-originating good because it fails to satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification. 


That rear view mirror is exported to NAFTA country B where it is used as original equipment in the production of a light-duty vehicle. Even though the rear view mirror is a non-originating material and is provided for in a tariff item listed in Schedule IV, it is not a traced material because it was not imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries. 


For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of a light-duty vehicle in which the rear view mirror is incorporated, the value of the rear view mirror, under section 9(1), is not included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the light-duty vehicle. 


Even though the glass provided for in heading 7005 that was used in the production of the rear view mirror and incorporated into the light-duty vehicle was imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, the glass is not a traced material because heading 7005 is not listed in Schedule IV. For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle that incorporates the glass, the value of the glass is not included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the light-duty vehicle. The value of the rear view mirror would be included in the net cost of the light-duty vehicle, but the value of the imported glass would not be separately included in the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle. 


An electric motor provided for in subheading 8501.10 is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries and is used in the territory of a NAFTA country in the production of a seat frame provided for in subheading 9401.90. The seat frame, with the electric motor attached, is sold to a producer of seats provided for in subheading 9401.20. The seat producer sells the seat to a producer of light-duty vehicles. The seat is to be used as original equipment in the production of that light-duty vehicle. 


Subheadings 8501.10 and 9401.20 are listed in Schedule IV; subheading 9401.90 is not. The electric motor is a traced material; the seat is not a traced material because it was not imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries. 


The seat is a light-duty automotive good referred to in section 9(1). For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the seat, the value of traced materials incorporated into it is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the seat. The value of the electric motor is included in that value. (However, the value of the motor would not be included separately in the net cost of the seat because the value of the motor is included as part of the cost of the seat frame.) 


For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle, the value of the electric motor is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the light-duty vehicle, even if the seat is an originating material. 


Cast blocks, cast heads and connecting rod assemblies provided for in heading 8409 are imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries by an engine producer, who has title to them at the time of importation, and are used by the producer in the territory of NAFTA country A in the production of an engine provided for in heading 8407. After the regional value content of the engine is calculated, the engine is an originating good. It is not a traced material because it was not imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries. The engine is exported to NAFTA country B, to be used as original equipment by a producer of light-duty vehicles. 


For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle that incorporates the engine, because heading 8409 is listed in Schedule IV and because the cast blocks, cast heads and connecting rod assemblies were imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and are incorporated into the light-duty vehicle, the value of those materials, which are traced materials, is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the light-duty vehicle, even though the engine is an originating material. 


The producer of the light-duty vehicle did not import the traced materials. However, because that producer has a statement referred to in section 9(2)(c) and that statement states the value of non-originating materials of the traced materials in accordance with section 12(2), the producer of the light-duty vehicle may, in accordance with section 9(8), use that value as the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle with respect to that engine. 


Aluminum ingots provided for in subheading 7601.10 and piston assemblies provided for in heading 8409 are imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries by an engine producer and are used by that producer in the territory of NAFTA country A in the production of an engine provided for in heading 8407. The aluminum ingots are used by the producer to produce an engine block; the piston assembly is then incorporated into the engine block and the producer designates, in accordance with section 7(4), a short block provided for in heading 8409 as an intermediate material. The intermediate material qualifies as an originating material. The engine that incorporates the short block is exported to NAFTA country B and used as original equipment in the production of a light-duty vehicle. The piston assemblies provided for in heading 8409 are traced materials; neither the engine nor the short block are traced materials because they were not imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries. 


For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the engine, the value of the piston assemblies is included, under section 9(9)(a)(ii), in the value of non-originating materials, even if the intermediate material is an originating material. However, the value of the aluminum ingots is not included in the value of non-originating materials because subheading 7601.10 is not listed in Schedule IV. The value of the aluminum ingots does not need to be included separately in the net cost of the engine because that value is included in the value of the intermediate material, and the total cost of the intermediate material is included in the net cost of the engine. 


For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle that incorporates the engine (and the piston assemblies), the value of the piston assemblies incorporated into that light-duty vehicle is included in the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle. 


An engine provided for in heading 8407 is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries. The producer of the engine, located in the country from which the engine is imported, used in the production of the engine a piston assembly provided for in heading 8409 that was produced in a NAFTA country and is an originating good. The engine is used in the territory of a NAFTA country as original equipment in the production of a light-duty vehicle. The engine is a traced material. 


For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of a light-duty vehicle that incorporates that engine, the value of the engine is included in the value of non-originating materials of that light-duty vehicle. The value of the piston assembly, which was, before its exportation to outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, an originating good, shall not be deducted from the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the light-duty vehicle. Under section 18 (transshipment), the piston assembly is no longer considered to be an originating good because it was used in the production of a good outside the territories of the NAFTA countries. 


A wholesaler, located in City A in the territory of a NAFTA country, imports from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries rubber hoses provided for in heading 4009, which is listed in Schedule IV. The wholesaler takes title to the goods at the wholesaler's place of business in City A. The customs value of the imported goods is $500. All freight, taxes and duties associated with the good to the wholesaler's place of business total $100; the cost of the freight, included in that $100, from the place where it was received in the territory of a NAFTA country to the location of the wholesaler's place of business in City A is $25. The wholesaler sells the rubber hoses for $650 to a producer of light-duty vehicles who uses the goods in the territory of a NAFTA country as original equipment in the production of a light-duty vehicle. The light-duty vehicle producer pays $50 to have the goods shipped from the location of the wholesaler's place of business in City A to the location at which the light-duty vehicle is produced. 


The rubber hoses are traced materials and they are incorporated into a light-duty automotive good. For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle, 


A wholesaler, located in City A in the territory of a NAFTA country, imports from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries rubber hose provided for in heading 4009, which is listed in Schedule IV. The wholesaler sells the good to a producer located in the territory of the NAFTA country who uses the hose to produce a power steering hose assembly, also provided for in heading 4009. The power steering hose assembly is then sold to a producer of light-duty vehicles who uses that good in the production of a light-duty vehicle. The rubber hose is a traced material; the power steering hose assembly is not a traced material because it was not imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries. 


The wholesaler who imported the rubber hose from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries has title to it at the time of importation. The customs value of the good is $3, including freight and insurance and all other costs incurred in transporting the good to the first place at which it was received in the territory of the NAFTA country. Duties and fees and all other costs referred to in section 9(4), paid by the wholesaler with respect to the good, total an additional $1. The wholesaler sells the good to the producer of the power steering hose assemblies for $5, not including freight to the location of that producer. The power steering hose producer pays $2 to have the good delivered to the location of production. The value of the power steering hose assembly sold to the light-duty vehicle producer is $10, including freight for delivery of the goods to the location of the light-duty vehicle producer. 


For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle: 


A producer of light-duty vehicles located in City C in the territory of a NAFTA country imports from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries rubber hose provided for in heading 4009, which is listed in Schedule IV, and uses that good as original equipment in the production of a light-duty vehicle. 


The rubber hose arrives at City A in the NAFTA country, but the producer of the light-duty vehicle does not have title to the good; it is transported under bond to City B, and on its arrival in City B, the producer of the light-duty vehicle takes title to it and the good is received in the territory of a NAFTA country. The good is then transported to the location of the light-duty vehicle producer in City C. 


The customs value of the imported good is $4, the transportation and other costs referred to in subparagraph 9(2)(b)(ii) to City A are $3 and to City B are $2, and the cost of duties, taxes and other fees referred to in section 9(4) is $1. The cost of transporting the good from City B to the location of the producer in City C is $1. The rubber hose is traced material. 


For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle, the value, under section 9(2)(b), of non-originating materials of that vehicle is the customs value of the traced material and, where not included in that value, the cost of taxes, duties, fees and the cost of transporting the traced material to the place where title is taken. In this situation, the value of non-originating materials would be the customs value of the traced material, $4, the cost of duties taxes and other fees, $1, the cost of transporting the material to City A, $3, and the cost of transporting that material from City A to City B, $2, for a total of $10. The $1 cost of transporting the good from City B to the location of the producer in City C would not be included in the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle because a person of a NAFTA country has taken title to the traced material. 


A radiator provided for in subheading 8708.91 is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries by a producer of light-duty vehicles and is used in the territory of a NAFTA country as original equipment in the production of a light-duty vehicle. 


The radiator is transported by ship from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries and arrives in the territory of the NAFTA country at City A. The radiator is not, however, unloaded at City A and although the radiator is physically present in the territory of the NAFTA country, it has not been received in the territory of a NAFTA country. 


The ship sails in territorial waters from City A to City B and the radiator is unloaded there. The light-duty vehicle producer files, from City C in the same country, the entry for the radiator; the radiator enters the territory of the NAFTA country at City B. 


Subheading 8708.91 is listed in Schedule IV. The radiator is a traced material. 


For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle, the value of the radiator is included in the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle. The costs of any freight, insurance, packing and other costs incurred in transporting the radiator to City B are included in the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle, including the cost of transporting the radiator from City A to City B. The costs of any freight, insurance, packing and other costs that were incurred in transporting the radiator from City B to the location of the producer are not included in the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle. 


Producer X, located in NAFTA country A, produces a car seat of subheading No. 9401.20 that is used in the production of a light-duty vehicle. The only non-originating material used in the production of the car seat is an electric motor of subheading No. 8501.20 that was imported by Producer X from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries. The electric motor is a material of a tariff provision listed in Schedule IV and thus is a traced material. 


Producer X sells the car seat as original equipment to Producer Y, a light-duty vehicle producer, located in NAFTA country B. The car seat is an originating good because the non-originating material in the car seat (the electric motor) undergoes the applicable change in tariff classification set out in a rule that specifies only a change in tariff classification. Consequently, Producer X does not choose to calculate the regional value content of the car seat in accordance with section 12(1). 


For purposes of determining, under section 9(1), the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the light-duty vehicle that incorporates the car seat, the value of the electric motor is included even though the car seat qualifies as an originating material. 


Producer X provides Producer Y with a statement described in section 9(2)(c), with the value of non-originating material used in the production of the car seat determined in accordance with section 12(3), as is permitted by section 9(8). Producer Y uses that value as the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the light-duty vehicle with respect to the car seat. 


This example has the same facts as in Example 12, except that the car seat does not qualify as an originating good under the rule that specifies only a change in tariff classification. Instead, it qualifies as an originating good under a rule that specifies a regional value-content requirement and a change in tariff classification. For purposes of that rule, Producer X chose to calculate the regional value content of the car seat in accordance with section 12(1) over a period set out in section 12(5)(a) and using a category set out in section 12(4)(a). 


For purposes of the statement described in section 9(2)(c), Producer X determined, as is permitted under section 9(8), the value of non-originating material used in the production of the car seat in accordance with section 12(3) over a period set out in section 12(5)(a) and using a category set out in section 12(4)(e).


A cast head, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and used in that country in the production of an engine that will be used as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. No other non-originating materials are used in the production of the engine. The cast head is a listed material; the engine is an automotive component. 


*Situation 1:* Use of the listed material in an automotive component 


For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the engine, the value of listed materials imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the engine. Because the cast head was produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, its value, under section 10(1)(c), is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the engine. 


*Situation 2:* Use of an originating automotive component incorporating the listed material 


The engine is an originating material acquired by the producer of the heavy-duty vehicle. For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates that engine (and incorporates the cast head), the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle is determined under section 10(1)(d) with respect to that engine. The producer may choose to include in the value of non-originating materials of the heavy-duty vehicle 


The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the first option if that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(d)(i), from the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation, the value, determined under section 10(1)(c), of the cast head, is included in the value of non-originating materials of the heavy-duty vehicle, with respect to the engine that is used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle. 


The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the second option if that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(d)(ii), from the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation, because of the application of the equation, the value of the cast head will be included in the amount determined under section 10(1)(d)(ii) and is, consequently, included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle. 


The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the third option if that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(d)(iii), from the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation, because of the application of the equation, the value of the cast head will be included in the amount determined under section 10(1)(d)(iii) and is, consequently, included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle. 


*Situation 3:* Use of a non-originating automotive component incorporating the listed material 


The engine is a non-originating material acquired by the producer of the heavy-duty vehicle. For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates that engine (and incorporates the cast head), the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle is determined under section 10(1)(e) with respect to that engine. The producer of the heavy-duty vehicle may choose to include in the value of non-originating materials either 


The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the first option if that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(e)(i), from the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation, the value of the cast head, as determined under section 10(1)(c), is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle, with respect to the engine that is used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle. 


A rocker arm assembly, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and used in that country in the production of an engine that will be used as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. No other non-originating materials are used in the production of the engine. The rocker arm assembly is neither a listed material nor a sub-component; the engine is an automotive component. 


*Situation 1:* Use of the material in an automotive component 


For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the engine, the value of non-originating materials that are not listed materials is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the engine. Because the rocker arm assembly was produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, it is a non-originating material and its value, under section 10(1)(f), is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the engine. 


*Situation 2:* Use of an originating automotive component incorporating the material 


The engine is an originating material acquired by the producer of the heavy-duty vehicle. For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates that engine (and incorporates the rocker arm assembly), the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle is determined under section 10(1)(d) with respect to that engine. The producer may choose to include in the value of non-originating materials of the heavy-duty vehicle 


The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the first option if that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(d)(i), from the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation, the value of the rocker arm assembly, as determined under section 10(1)(f), is not included in the value of non-originating materials of the heavy-duty vehicle, with respect to the engine that is used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle. 


The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the second option if that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(d)(ii), from the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation, because of the application of the equation, the value of the rocker arm assembly will be included in the amount determined under section 10(1)(d)(ii) and will, consequently, be included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle. 


The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the third option if that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(d)(iii), from the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation, because of the application of the equation, the value of the rocker arm assembly will be included in the amount determined under section 10(1)(d)(iii) and will, consequently, be included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle. 


*Situation 3:* Use of a non-originating automotive component incorporating the material 


The engine is a non-originating material acquired by the producer of the heavy-duty vehicle. For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates that engine (and incorporates the rocker arm assembly), the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle is determined under section 10(1)(e) with respect to that engine. The producer of the heavy-duty vehicle may choose to include in the value of non-originating materials either 


The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the first option if that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(e)(i), from the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation, the value of the rocker arm assembly, as determined under section 10(1)(f), is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle, with respect to the engine that is used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle. 


*Situation 4:* Use of the material in a self-produced automotive component 


If the engine is a self-produced material rather than an acquired material, the heavy-duty vehicle producer is using the rocker arm assembly in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle rather than in the production of the engine, because, under section 7(4), the engine cannot be designated as an intermediate material. For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle, the value, under section 10(1)(f), of the rocker arm assembly is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle. 


A transmission, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and used in that country as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. The transmission is an automotive component. 


*Situation:* Use of the automotive component 


For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle in which the transmission is used, the value of the transmission is included in the value of the non-originating materials under section 10(1)(c), regardless of whether the producer imported the transmission or acquired it from someone else in the territory of a NAFTA country. 


A transmission, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and combined with an engine to produce an engine-transmission assembly that will be used as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. The transmission is an automotive component; the engine-transmission assembly is an automotive component assembly. 


*Situation:* Use of the automotive component assembly 


The automotive component assembly is acquired by a producer who uses it in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. If the automotive component assembly that incorporates the imported transmission is an originating material, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the automotive component assembly is determined, at the choice of the producer, under any of section 10(1)(d) (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv). (See example 1 for more detailed explanations of these provisions.) If the automotive component assembly that incorporates the imported transmission is a non-originating material, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the automotive component assembly is determined, at the choice of the producer, under section 10(1)(e) (i) or (ii). (See example 1 for more detailed explanations of these provisions.) 


Regardless of whether the automotive component assembly is an originating material or a non-originating material, the value of the automotive component that was imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle. The transmission is a non-originating material, and, for purposes of calculating the regional value content of an automotive component assembly or heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates that transmission, the value of the transmission is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the automotive component assembly or heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates it. 


An aluminum ingot, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and used in that country in the production of cast block that will be used in an engine that will be used as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. The aluminum ingot is not a listed material; the cast block is a listed material; the engine is an automotive component. 


*Situation 1:* Use of the material in an intermediate material that is a listed material 


The engine producer designates the cast block as an intermediate material under section 7(4). For purposes of determining the origin of that cast block, because the aluminum ingot is classified under a different heading than the cast block, the cast block satisfies the applicable change in tariff classification and is an originating material. 


*Situation 2:* Use of the listed material incorporating the material 


For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the engine that incorporates that cast block (and thus incorporates the aluminum ingot), the value of non-originating materials is determined under section 10(1). Because none of sections 10(1) (a) through (f) require that a listed material that is an originating material be included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of a good, the value of the cast block is not included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the engine or in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of an automotive component assembly or heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates the engine. 


Because section 10(1)(d) does not refer to a listed material that is an originating material, the value of the non-originating aluminum ingot used in the production of the originating cast block is not included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of any good or material that incorporates the originating cast block. 


A crankshaft, produced in the territory of NAFTA country A from a forging imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is a non-originating material. The crankshaft is sold to another producer, located in the same country, who uses it to produce an originating block assembly. That block assembly is sold to another producer, also located in the same country, who uses it to produce a finished block. The finished block is sold to a producer of engines, who is located in NAFTA country B, for use in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. The crankshaft is a listed material; the block assembly is a sub-component, as is the finished block. 


*Situation 1:* Calculating the regional value content of the finished block 


A sub-component is not a heavy-duty automotive good. As referred to in section 10(9)(c), for purposes of calculating the regional value content of the sub-component before it is incorporated into a heavy-duty automotive good, such as when the sub-component is exported from the territory of one NAFTA country to the territory of another NAFTA country, the value of non-originating materials of the sub-component includes only the value of non-originating materials used in the production of that sub-component. Because the block assembly is an originating material, its value is not included in the value of non-originating materials of the finished block, nor is the value of the non-originating crankshaft included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the finished block because the crankshaft was used in the production of the block assembly and was not used in the production of the finished block. 


*Situation 2:* Calculating the regional value content of the component that incorporates the finished block 


For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates a sub-component, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the sub-component is determined under section 10(1) (d) or (e) with respect to that sub-component. In this situation, the value, under section 10(1)(b), of the non-originating crankshaft is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the engine. (See examples 1 and 2 for more detailed explanations of sections 10(1) (d) and (e).) 


A bumper part, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and is used in the production of a bumper. The bumper is used in the territory of a NAFTA country as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. Neither a bumper part nor a bumper is a listed material, sub-component, automotive component or automotive component assembly. 


*Situation 1:* The non-listed material is an originating material 


The bumper is an originating material. For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle, neither the value of the imported bumper part nor the value of the bumper is included in the value of the non-originating materials. 


*Situation 2:* The non-listed material is a non-originating material


The bumper is a non-originating material. For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle is determined under section 10(1)(f) with respect to the bumper. In this situation, the value of the bumper is included in the value of non-originating materials of the heavy-duty vehicle. Because a bumper is not a listed material, the producer of the heavy-duty vehicle does not have the option, under section 10(1)(b)(ii), to include only the value of the imported bumper part in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.


*Situation:* Transhipment of a listed material


A producer, located in the territory of a NAFTA country, produces, in that country, a cast head that is an originating good. The producer exports the cast head to outside the territories of the NAFTA territories, where valves, springs, valve lifters, a camshaft and gears are added to it to create a cast head assembly. An engine producer, located in the territory of a NAFTA country, imports the cast head assembly into that country and uses it in the production of an engine that will be used as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. A cast head is a listed material; a cast head assembly is a sub-component.


For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the engine, the value of the imported cast head assembly is included in the value of non-originating materials under section 10(1)(c). The value of the cast head cannot be deducted from the value determined under section 10(1)(c). Although the cast head was once an originating good, under section 18 when further production was performed with respect to the cast head outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, it was no longer an originating good.


A material, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and used in that country in the production of a water pump that will be used as original equipment by the same producer in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. Although the producer, under section 7(4), designates the water pump as an intermediate material it is a non-originating material because it fails to satisfy the regional value-content requirement. A water pump is a listed material.


For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle, the value of non-originating materials includes, at the choice of the producer, either the total cost, determined under section 10(1)(a)(i), of the water pump or the value, determined under section 10(1)(a)(iii)(A), of the material imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries.


A material, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is acquired in the territory of a NAFTA country and is used in that country in the production of a water pump that will be used as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. The producer of the water pump and the producer of the heavy-duty vehicle are separate, unrelated producers, located in the same country. A water pump is a listed material. The producer of the water pump chose to calculate the regional value content of the water pump in accordance with section 12(1) over a period set out in section 12(5)(a) and using a category set out in section 12(4)(b). The water pump is a non-originating material because it fails to satisfy the regional value-content requirement.


For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle, the value of non-originating materials includes, at the choice of the producer, either the value, determined under section 10(1)(b)(i), of the water pump or, if the producer has a statement referred to in section 10(1)(b)(ii)(B), the value, determined under that section, of the material imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries.


The producer has a statement referred to in section 10(1)(b)(ii)(B) and chooses to use the value of non-originating material determined under that section. The statement states, as is permitted under section 10(8), the value of non-originating material used in the production of the water pump in accordance with section 12(3) over a period set out in section 12(5)(a) and using a category set out in section 12(4)(e).


A motor vehicle producer located in NAFTA country A produces vehicles that fall within a category set out in section 11(5) that is chosen by the producer. The motor vehicles are to be sold in NAFTA countries A, B and C, as well as in country D, which is not a NAFTA country. Under section 11(1), the motor vehicle producer may choose that the sum of the net costs incurred and the sum of the values of non-originating materials used by the producer be calculated over the producer's fiscal year. The producer may state in the choice the basis of the calculation as described in section 11(9)(a), in which case the calculation would be on the basis of all the motor vehicles produced regardless of where they are destined. Alternatively, the producer may state in the choice the basis of the calculation as described in section 11(9)(b). In this case, the producer would also need to state that the calculation is on the basis of 


The calculation would be on the basis as described in the choice.


Producer A, located in NAFTA country A, imports unfinished bearing rings provided for in subheading 8482.99 into NAFTA country A from a non-NAFTA territory. Producer A further processes the unfinished bearing rings into finished bearing rings, which are of the same subheading. The finished bearing rings of Producer A do not satisfy an applicable change in tariff classification and therefore do not qualify as originating goods. The net cost of the finished bearing rings (per unit) is calculated as follows:


Producer A sells the finished bearing rings to Producer B who is located in NAFTA country A for $1.50 each. Producer B further processes them into bearings, and intends to export the bearings to NAFTA country B. Although the bearings satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification, the bearings are subject to a regional value-content requirement. 


*Situation A:*

Producer B does not choose to accumulate costs incurred by Producer A with respect to the bearing rings used in the production of the bearings. The net cost of the bearings (per unit) is calculated as follows:


Under the net cost method, the regional value content of the bearings is 


Therefore, the bearings are non-originating goods. 


*Situation B:*

Producer B chooses to accumulate costs incurred by Producer A with respect to the bearing rings used in the production of the bearings. Producer A provides a statement described in section 14(2)(a) to Producer B. The net cost of the bearings (per unit) is calculated as follows:


Under the net cost method, the regional value content of the bearings is


Therefore, the bearings are originating goods. 


*Situation C:*

Producer B chooses to accumulate costs incurred by Producer A with respect to the bearing rings used in the production of the bearings. Producer A provides to Producer B a statement described in section 14(2)(b) that specifies an amount equal to the net cost minus the value of non-originating materials used to produce the finished bearing rings ($1.40−$0.75 = $0.65). The net cost of the bearings (per unit) is calculated as follows:


Under the net cost method, the regional value content of the bearings is


Therefore, the bearings are originating goods.


*Situation D:*

Producer B chooses to accumulate costs incurred by Producer A with respect to the bearing rings used in the production of the bearings. Producer A provides to Producer B a statement described in section 14(2)(b) that specifies an amount equal to the value of other product costs used in the production of the finished bearing rings ($0.35). The net cost of the bearings (per unit) is calculated as follows:


Under the net cost method, the regional value content of the bearings is


Therefore, the bearings are originating goods. 


*Example 2:* section 14(1) 


Producer A, located in NAFTA country A, imports non-originating cotton, carded or combed, provided for in heading 5203 for use in the production of cotton yarn provided for in heading 5205. Because the change from cotton, carded or combed, to cotton yarn is a change within the same chapter, the cotton does not satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification for heading 5205, which is a change from any other chapter, with certain exceptions. Therefore, the cotton yarn that Producer A produces from non-originating cotton is a non-originating good. 


Producer A then sells the non-originating cotton yarn to Producer B, also located in NAFTA country A, who uses the cotton yarn in the production of woven fabric of cotton provided for in heading 5208. The change from non-originating cotton yarn to woven fabric of cotton is insufficient to satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification for heading 5208, which is a change from any heading outside headings 5208 through 5212, except from certain headings, under which various yarns, including cotton yarn provided for in heading 5205, are classified. Therefore, the woven fabric of cotton that Producer B produces from non-originating cotton yarn produced by Producer A is a non-originating good. 


However, under section 14(1), if Producer B chooses to accumulate the production of Producer A, the production of Producer A would be considered to have been performed by Producer B. The rule for heading 5208, under which the cotton fabric is classified, does not exclude a change from heading 5203, under which carded or combed cotton is classified. Therefore, under section 15(1), the change from carded or combed cotton provided for in heading 5203 to the woven fabric of cotton provided for in heading 5208 would satisfy the applicable change of tariff classification for heading 5208. The woven fabric of cotton would be considered as an originating good. 


Producer B, in order to choose to accumulate Producer A's production, must have a statement described in section 14(4)(a)(ii).


For purposes of this Schedule, unless otherwise stated: 


For purposes of Article 402(2) of the Agreement, as implemented by section 6(2) of this appendix, the transaction value of a good shall be the price actually paid or payable for the good, determined in accordance with section 3 and adjusted in accordance with section 4. 


For purposes of this Schedule, unless otherwise stated 


In this Schedule, 


For purposes of section 11 of this appendix, for purposes of determining the regional value content, in a fiscal year, of a motor vehicle of a class of motor vehicles or a model line produced by the producer in the territory of Canada and imported into the territory of the United States, the producer may choose to calculate the regional value content by 


The categories referred to in clauses 2(a)(i)(A) and (ii)(A) are the following: 


Where GM does not satisfy the requirement set out in section 2(d), the producer may choose that the regional value content be calculated in accordance with section 2 only for those motor vehicles that are acquired by GM for distribution under the GEO marque or another GM marque. 


For purposes of this Schedule, a motor vehicle producer shall be deemed to be GM where, as a result of an amalgamation, reorganization, division or similar transaction, that motor vehicle producer 


For purposes of this Schedule, 


Where costs are not reasonably allocated to a good under section 3, those costs are reasonably allocated to the good if they are allocated, 


Nothwithstanding section 3 and 7, where a producer allocates, for an internal management purpose, costs to a good that is not produced in the period in which the costs are expensed on the books of the producer (such as costs with respect to research and development, and obsolete materials), those costs shall be considered reasonably allocated if


Any cost allocation method referred to in section 3, 4 or 4.1 that is used by a producer for the purposes of this appendix shall be used throughout the producer's fiscal year.


The allocation to a good of any of the following is considered not to be reasonably allocated to the good: 


Any costs allocated under section 3 on the basis of a cost allocation method that is used for an internal management purpose that is solely for the purpose of qualifying a good as an originating good are considered not to be reasonably allocated.


For the overhead to be allocated, the producer may choose one or more allocation bases that reflect a relationship between the overhead and the good based on the criterion of benefit, cause or ability to bear. 


With respect to each allocation base that is chosen by the producer for allocating overhead, a cost ratio is calculated for each good produced by the producer in accordance with the following formula:


The costs with respect to which an allocation base is chosen are allocated to a good in accordance with the following formula:


Under section 6(11)(b) of this appendix, where excluded costs are included in costs to be allocated to a good, the cost ratio used to allocate that cost to the good is used to determine the amount of excluded costs to be subtracted from the costs allocated to the good.


The following is a non-exhaustive list of allocation bases that may be used by the producer to calculate cost ratios: 


The following examples illustrate the application of the cost ratio method to costs included in overhead.


A producer who produces Good A and Good B may allocate overhead on the basis of direct labor hours spent to produce Good A and Good B. A total of 8,000 direct labor hours have been spent to produce Good A and Good B: 5,000 hours with respect to Good A and 3,000 hours with respect to Good B. The amount of overhead to be allocated is $6,000,000. 


A producer who produces Good A and Good B may allocate overhead on the basis of direct labor costs incurred in the production of Good A and Good B. The total direct labor costs incurred in the production of Good A and Good B is $60,000: $50,000 with respect to Good A and $10,000 with respect to Good B. The amount of overhead to be allocated is $6,000,000. 


A producer of Good A and Good B may allocate overhead on the basis of units produced. The total units of Good A and Good B produced is 150,000: 100,000 units of Good A and 50,000 units of Good B. The amount of overhead to be allocated is $6,000,000. 


A producer who produces Good A and Good B may allocate machine-related overhead on the basis of machine-hours utilized in the production of Good A and Good B. The total machine-hours utilized for the production of Good A and Good B is 3,000 hours: 1,200 hours with respect to Good A and 1,800 hours with respect to Good B. The amount of machine-related overhead to be allocated is $6,000,000. 


A producer who produces Good A and Good B may allocate overhead on the basis of sales dollars. The producer sold 2,000 units of Good A at $4,000 and 200 units of Good B at $3,000. The amount of overhead to be allocated is $6,000,000. 


A producer who produces Good A and Good B may allocate overhead relating to utilities (heat, water and electricity) on the basis of floor space used in the production and storage of Good A and Good B. The total floor space used in the production and storage of Good A and Good B is 100,000 square feet: 40,000 square feet with respect to Good A and 60,000 square feet with respect to Good B. The amount of overhead to be allocated is $6,000,000. 


For each good produced by the producer, a direct labor and direct material ratio is calculated in accordance with the following formula: 


Overhead is allocated to a good in accordance with the following formula:


Under section 6(11)(b) of this appendix, where excluded costs are included in overhead to be allocated to a good, the direct labor and direct material ratio used to allocate overhead to the good is used to determine the amount of excluded costs to be subtracted from the overhead allocated to the good.


The following example illustrates the application of the direct labor and direct material ratio method used by a producer of a good to allocate overhead where the producer chooses to calculate the net cost of the good in accordance with section 6(11)(a) of this appendix. 


A producer produces Good A and Good B. Overhead (O) minus excluded costs (EC) is $30 and the other relevant costs are set out in the following table:


The following example illustrates the application of the direct labor and direct material ratio method used by a producer of a good to allocate overhead where the producer chooses to calculate the net cost of the good in accordance with section 6(11)(b) of this appendix and where excluded costs are included in overhead. 


A producer produces Good A and Good B. Overhead (O) is $50 (including excluded costs (EC) of $20). The other relevant costs are set out in the table of Example 1. 


Direct overhead is allocated to a good on the basis of a method based on the criterion of benefit, cause or ability to bear. 


Indirect overhead is allocated on the basis of a direct cost ratio. 


For each good produced by the producer, a direct cost ratio is calculated in accordance with the following formula:


Indirect overhead is allocated to a good in accordance with the following formula:


Under section 6(11)(b) of this appendix, where excluded costs are included in 


The following example illustrates the application of the direct cost ratio method used by a producer of a good to allocate indirect overhead where the producer chooses to calculate the net cost of the good in accordance with section 6(11)(a) of this appendix. 


A producer produces Good A and Good B. Indirect overhead (IO) minus excluded costs (EC) is $30. The other relevant costs are set out in the following table:


The following example illustrates the application of the direct cost ratio method used by a producer of a good to allocate indirect overhead where the producer has chosen to calculate the net cost of the good in accordance with section 6(11)(b) of this appendix and where excluded costs are included in indirect overhead. 


A producer produces Good A and Good B. The indirect overhead (IO) is $50 (including excluded costs (EC) of $20). The other relevant costs are set out in the table to Example 1. 


If there is no transaction value under section 2(2) or the transaction value is unacceptable under section 2(3), and the value of the material cannot be determined under section 6 or 7, the value of the material, referred to in Article 402(9)(b) of the Agreement, as implemented by section 7(1)(b)(ii) of part IV of this appendix, shall be determined under section 9 or, when the value cannot be determined under that section, under section 10 except that, at the request of the producer, the order of application of sections 9 and 10 shall be reversed. 


The greatest number of units sold at a particular price is 80; therefore, the unit price in the greatest aggregate quantity is 90. 


As another illustration of this, two sales occur. In the first sale 500 units are sold at a price of 95 currency units each. In the second sale 400 units are sold at a price of 90 currency units each. In this illustration, the greatest number of units sold at a particular price is 500; therefore, the unit price in the greatest aggregate quantity is 95. 


For purposes of this Schedule, 


For purposes of sections 5(11) and (12) and 6(10) of this appendix, the following are the methods for determining the value of non-originating materials that are identical materials and are used in the production of a good: 


The following “examples” are based on the figures set out in the table below and on the following assumptions: 


By applying the FIFO method: 


By applying the LIFO method: 


The following table identifies the average value of non-originating Materials A as determined under the rolling average method. For purposes of this example, a new average value of non-originating Materials A is calculated after each receipt.


For purposes of this part, 


The inventory management methods for determining whether fungible materials referred to in section 7(16)(a) of this appendix are originating materials are the following: 


A producer of a good, or a person from whom the producer acquired the fungible materials that are used in the production of the good, may choose only one of the inventory management methods referred to in section 2, and, if the averaging method is chosen, only one averaging period in each fiscal year of that producer or person for the materials inventory.


Where the producer or person referred to in section 3 chooses the average method, the origin of fungible materials withdrawn from materials inventory is determined on the basis of the ratio of originating materials and non-originating materials in materials inventory that is calculated under sections 6 through 8. 


For purposes of this part, 


The inventory management methods for determining whether fungible goods referred to in section 7(16)(b) of this appendix are originating goods are the following: 


An exporter of a good, or a person from whom the exporter acquired the fungible good, may choose only one of the inventory management methods referred to in section 11, including only one averaging period in the case of the average method, in each fiscal year of that exporter or person for each finished goods inventory of the exporter or person.


The following “examples” are based on the figures set out in the table below and on the following assumptions: 


Good A is subject to a regional value-content requirement. Producer A is using the transaction value method to determine the regional value content of Good A. 


By applying the FIFO method: 


Good A is subject to a change in tariff classification requirement and the non-originating Material A used in the production of Good A does not undergo the applicable change in tariff classification. Therefore, where originating Material A is used in the production of Good A, Good A is an originating good and, where non-originating Material A is used in the production of Good A, Good A is a non-originating good. 


By applying the LIFO method: 


Good A is subject to an applicable regional value-content requirement. Producer A is using the transaction value method to determine the regional value content of Good A. Producer A determines the average value of non-originating Material A and the ratio of originating Material A to total value of originating Material A and non-originating Material A in the following table.


By applying the average method: 


The following “examples” are based on the figures set out in the table below and on the assumption that Exporter A acquires originating Good A and non-originating Good A that are fungible goods and physically combines or mixes Good A before exporting those goods to the buyer of those goods.


By applying the FIFO method: 


By applying the LIFO method: 


*Example 3:* Average method 


Exporter A chooses to determine the origin of Good A on a monthly basis. Exporter A exported 3,000 units of Good A during the month of February 1994. The origin of the units of Good A exported during that month is determined on the basis of the preceding month, that is January 1994. 


By applying the average method: 


For purposes of this Schedule,


For purposes of calculating non-allowable interest costs 


The following example is based on the figures set out in the table below and on the following assumptions:
