# § 181.12   Maintenance and availability of records.

(a) *Maintenance of records*—(1) *General.* An exporter or producer in the United States who completes and signs a Certificate of Origin shall maintain in the United States, for five years after the date on which the Certificate was signed, the Certificate (or copy thereof) and all other records relating to the origin of a good for which preferential tariff treatment may be claimed in Canada or Mexico, including records associated with: 


(i) The purchase of, cost of, value of, and payment for, the good that is exported from the United States; 


(ii) The purchase of, cost of, value of, and payment for, all materials, including indirect materials, used in the production of the good that is exported from the United States; and 


(iii) The production of the good in the form in which the good is exported from the United States. 


(2) *Method of maintenance.* The records referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall be maintained in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles applied in the United States and may be maintained in hard-copy form, on microfilm or microfiche or in automated record storage devices (for example, magnetic discs and tapes) if associated computer programs are available to facilitate retrieval of the data in a usable form. 


(b) *Availability of records*—(1) *To Customs.* For purposes of determining compliance with the provisions of this part, the records required to be maintained under this section shall be made available for examination and inspection by the Center director or other appropriate Customs officer in the same manner as provided in part 163 of this chapter in the case of U.S. importer records. 


(2) *To the Canadian or Mexican customs administration.* If a U.S. exporter or producer receives notification of, and consents to, an origin verification visit by the Canadian or Mexican customs administration under Article 506 of the NAFTA (see § 181.74(e) of this part), such consent shall constitute agreement by the U.S. exporter or producer to make available to an officer of that customs administration all records required to be maintained under this section and to provide facilities for the inspection thereof. If, during the course of an origin verification of a U.S. producer, the Canadian or Mexican customs administration finds that the U.S. producer has failed to maintain its records in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles applied in the United States, that customs administration will so inform the U.S. producer in writing and will give the U.S. producer 60 calendar days to conform the records to those Principles. If a U.S. exporter or producer fails to maintain records or make records available to the Canadian or Mexican customs administration in accordance with the provisions of this section, or if a U.S. producer fails to conform its records to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as provided in this paragraph, the Canadian or Mexican customs administration may deny preferential tariff treatment to the good that is the subject of the verification visit.
