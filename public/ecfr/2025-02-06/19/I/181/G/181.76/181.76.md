# § 181.76   Application of origin determinations.

(a) *General.* Except as otherwise provided in this section, an origin determination may be applied upon issuance of the determination under § 181.75 of this part. 


(b) *Negative origin determinations.* In the case of a negative origin determination issued under § 181.75(b) of this part: 


(1) The date on which preferential tariff treatment may be denied shall be no earlier than 30 calendar days from the date on which: 


(i) Receipt of the written determination by the exporter or producer is confirmed, if a request under § 181.75(b)(1) of this part has been made; or 


(ii) The written determination is sent by Customs, if no request under § 181.75(b)(1) of this part has been made; and 


(2) Before denying preferential tariff treatment, Customs shall take into account any comments or additional information provided by the exporter or producer during the period established in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section. 


(c) *Cases involving a pattern of conduct.* Where multiple origin verifications initiated under § 181.72(a) of this part indicate a pattern of conduct by an exporter or producer involving false or unsupported representations on Certificates of Origin that a good imported into the United States qualifies as an originating good, Customs may deny subsequent claims for preferential tariff treatment on identical goods exported or produced by such person until that person establishes compliance with the rules applicable to originating goods as set forth in General Note 12, HTSUS, and in this part, provided that advance written notice of the intent to deny such claims is given to the importer. For purposes of this paragraph, a “pattern of conduct” means repeated instances of false or unsupported representations by an exporter or producer as established by Customs on the basis of not fewer than two origin verifications of two or more importations of the good that result in the issuance of not fewer than two written determinations issued to that exporter or producer pursuant to § 181.75 of this part which conclude, as a finding of fact, that Certificates of Origin completed and signed by that exporter or producer with respect to identical goods contain false or unsupported representations. 


(d) *Differing determinations.* Where Customs determines, either as a result of an origin verification initiated under § 181.72(a) of this part or under any other circumstance, that a certain good imported into the United States does not qualify as an originating good based on a tariff classification or a value applied in the United States to one or more materials used in the production of the good, including a material used in the production of another material that is used in the production of the good, which differs from the tariff classification or value applied to the materials by the country from which the good was exported, the Customs determination shall not become effective until Customs provides written notification thereof both to the U.S. importer of the good and to the person who completed and signed the Certificate of Origin upon which the claim for preferential tariff treatment for the good was based. 


(e) *Applicability of a determination to prior importations.* Customs shall not apply a determination made under paragraph (d) of this section to an importation made before the effective date of the determination if, prior to notification of the determination, the customs administration of the country from which the good was exported either issued an advance ruling under Article 509 of the NAFTA or any other ruling on the tariff classification or on the value of such materials, or gave consistent treatment to the entry of the materials under the tariff classification or value at issue, on which a person is entitled to rely and on which that person did in fact rely. For purposes of this paragraph, the person who received notification of the determination shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of Customs, in writing within 30 calendar days of receipt of the notification, that the conditions set forth herein have been met. For purposes of this paragraph: 


(1) A “ruling” on which a person is entitled to rely in the case of Canada must be issued pursuant to section 43.1(1) of the Customs Act (Advance Rulings) or in accordance with Departmental Memorandum 11-11-1 (National Customs Rulings) and in the case of Mexico must be issued pursuant to Article 34 of the Codigo Fiscal de la Federacion and pursuant to Article 30 of the Ley Aduanera or the applicable provision of Mexican law related to advance rulings under Article 509 of the NAFTA; and 


(2) “Consistent treatment” means the established application by the Canadian or Mexican customs administration that can be substantiated by the continued acceptance by the customs administration of the tariff classification or value of identical materials on importations of the materials into Canada or Mexico by the same importer over a period of not less than two years immediately prior to the date of signature of the Certificate of Origin for the good that is the subject of the determination referred to in paragraph (d) of this section, provided that with regard to those importations: 


(i) The tariff classification or value of the materials was not the subject of a verification, review or appeal by that customs administration on the date of the determination under paragraph (d) of this section; and 


(ii) The materials had not been accorded a different tariff classification or value by one or more district, regional or local offices of that customs administration on the date of the determination under paragraph (d) of this section. 


(f) *Detrimental reliance.* If Customs proposes to deny preferential tariff treatment to a good pursuant to a determination made under paragraph (d) of this section, Customs shall postpone the application of the determination for a period not exceeding 90 calendar days from the date of issuance of the determination where the U.S. importer of the good, or the person who completed and signed the Certificate of Origin upon which the claim for preferential tariff treatment for the good was based, demonstrates to the satisfaction of Customs that it has relied in good faith to its detriment on the tariff classification or value applied to such materials by the customs administration of the country from which the good was exported.
