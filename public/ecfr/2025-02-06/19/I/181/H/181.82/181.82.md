# § 181.82   Exceptions to application of penalties.

(a) *General.* A U.S. importer who makes a corrected declaration under § 181.21(b) of this part shall not be subject to civil or administrative penalties for having made an incorrect declaration, provided that the corrected declaration was voluntarily made. In addition, civil or administrative penalties provided for under the U.S. Customs laws and regulations shall not be imposed on an exporter or producer in the United States who voluntarily provides written notification pursuant to § 181.11(d) of this part with respect to the making of an incorrect certification.


(b) *“Voluntarily” defined*—(1) *General.* For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the making of a corrected declaration or the providing of written notification of an incorrect certification will be deemed to have been done voluntarily if: 


(i) Done before the commencement of a formal investigation; 


(ii) Done before any of the events specified in § 162.74(i) of this chapter have occurred; 


(iii) Done within 30 calendar days after either the U.S. importer with respect to a declaration that an imported good qualified as an originating good, or the U.S. exporter or producer with respect to a certification pertaining to a good exported to Canada or Mexico, had reason to believe that the declaration or certification was not correct; 


(iv) Accompanied by a written statement setting forth the information specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section; and 


(v) In the case of a corrected declaration, accompanied or followed by a tender of any actual loss of duties in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section. 


(2) *Cases involving fraud.* Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a person who acted by means of fraud in making an incorrect declaration or certification may not make a voluntary correction thereof. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), the term “fraud” shall have the meaning set forth in paragraph (B)(3) of appendix B to part 171 of this chapter. 


(3) *Written statement.* For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, each corrected declaration or notification of an incorrect certification shall be accompanied by a written statement which: 


(i) Identifies the class or kind of good to which the incorrect declaration or certification relates; 


(ii) Identifies each import or export transaction affected by the incorrect declaration or certification with reference to each port of importation or exportation and the approximate date of each importation or exportation. A U.S. producer who provides written notification that certain information in a Certificate of Origin is incorrect and who is unable to identify the specific export transactions under this paragraph shall provide as much information concerning those transactions as the producer, by the exercise of good faith and due diligence, is able to obtain; 


(iii) Specifies the nature of the incorrect statements or omissions regarding the declaration or certification; and 


(iv) Sets forth, to the best of the person's knowledge, the true and accurate information or data which should have been covered by or provided in the declaration or certification, and states that the person will provide any additional information or data which is unknown at the time of making the corrected declaration or certification within 30 calendar days or within any extension of that 30-day period as Customs may permit in order for the person to obtain the information or data. 


(4) *Substantial compliance.* For purposes of this section, a person shall be deemed to have voluntarily corrected a declaration or certification even though that person provides corrected information in a manner which does not conform to the requirements of the written statement specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, provided that: 


(i) Customs is satisfied that the information was provided before the commencement of a formal investigation; and 


(ii) The information provided includes, orally or in writing, substantially the same information as that specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. 


(5) *Tender of actual loss of duties.* A U.S. importer who makes a corrected declaration shall tender any actual loss of duties at the time of making the corrected declaration, or within 30 calendar days thereafter, or within any extension of that 30-day period as Customs may allow in order for the importer to obtain the information or data necessary to calculate the duties owed. 


(6) *Applicability of prior disclosure provisions.* Where a person fails to meet the requirements of this section because the correction of the declaration or the written notification of an incorrect certification is not considered to be done voluntarily as provided in this section, that person may nevertheless qualify for prior disclosure treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1592(c)(4) and the regulations issued thereunder.
