# § 182.73   Notification and response procedures.

(a) *Requests for information and questionnaires.* When conducting a verification through a request for information or a questionnaire as provided for in § 182.72(a)(1), CBP will send the importer, exporter or producer a written request for information, a written questionnaire, or its electronic equivalent, including a request for specific documentation to support the claim for preferential tariff treatment.


(1) *Contents.* The written request for information, written questionnaire, or its electronic equivalent will contain the following:


(i) The objective and scope of the verification, including the specific issue that the verification is seeking to resolve; and


(ii) Sufficient information to identify the good or material that is the subject of the verification.


(2) *Availability of records*—(i) *Verification of a good.* The importer, exporter, or producer must make the records, which are required to be maintained to demonstrate that the good qualifies for preferential tariff treatment under the USMCA, available for inspection by a CBP official conducting a verification. CBP may deny the claim for preferential tariff treatment of the good for failure to maintain the required records or if a CBP official is denied access to the records.


(ii) *Verification of a material.* During the verification of a material, any records in the material producer's possession demonstrating that the material qualifies as originating must be made available for inspection by a CBP official conducting a verification. CBP may consider the material that is used in the production of the good and is the subject of the verification to be non-originating material if a CBP official is denied access to these records.


(b) *Notification of a verification visit.* Prior to conducting a verification visit in Canada or Mexico, CBP will provide the exporter or producer, using one of the communication means specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, with a notification stating the intent to conduct a verification visit and containing the following:


(1) The objective and scope of the verification, including the specific issue that the verification is seeking to resolve;


(2) Sufficient information to identify the good or material that is the subject of the verification;


(3) A request for the written consent of the exporter or producer whose premises are going to be visited;


(4) The legal authority for the visit;


(5) The proposed date and location of the visit;


(6) The specific purpose of the visit; and


(7) The names and titles of the U.S. officials conducting the visit.


(c) *Importer notification.* When CBP initiates a verification by sending a request for information or questionnaire under paragraph (a) of this section to an exporter or producer or by sending a notification of a verification visit under paragraph (b) of this section, CBP will notify the importer claiming preferential tariff treatment of the good that CBP has initiated a verification of that good, subject to the confidentiality provisions in § 182.2.


(d) *Means of communications.* (1) For purposes of a verification, it is sufficient for CBP to use the contact information provided in the certification of origin for any communication sent to the importer, exporter, or producer.


(2) For purposes of a verification, CBP will send all communication to the exporter or producer by any means that can produce a confirmation of receipt including:


(i) Electronic mail;


(ii) International courier services;


(iii) Certified or registered mail services; or


(iv) A CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system.


(e) *Time periods.* Any time periods specified in this subpart begin from the date of confirmation of receipt, provided for in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, when sending communication to the exporter or producer, and begin from the date the communication is sent when sending communication to the importer.


(f) *Response time for a request for information, a questionnaire, and a notification of a verification visit*—(1) *Request for information and questionnaire.* When CBP sends a request for information or a questionnaire, the importer, exporter, or producer will have 30 days from the date specified in paragraph (e) of this section to respond and provide the requested documentation. CBP may deny the claim for preferential tariff treatment of the good, or consider the material that is used in the production of the good to be non-originating material, for failure to respond to the request for information subject to the conditions in § 182.75(c)(1), or for failure to respond to the questionnaire.


(2) *Notification of a verification visit.* When CBP sends a notification of a verification visit, the exporter or producer will have 30 days from the date specified in paragraph (e) of this section to consent to or deny the verification visit. CBP may deny the claim for preferential tariff treatment of the good, or consider the material that is used in the production of the good to be non-originating material, for failure to provide consent for a verification visit within the 30-day response period, unless a postponement is requested in accordance with § 182.74(b).
