This intent to deny will contain the preliminary results of the verification, the effective date of the denial of preferential tariff treatment, and a notice to the importer, exporter, or producer that CBP will provide 30 days to submit additional information, including documents, related to the preferential tariff treatment of the good.


(4) *Issuance of a negative determination of origin.* CBP will issue a negative determination of origin to the parties specified in paragraph (b) of this section if CBP determines, at least 30 days after receipt by the importer, exporter, or producer of the intent to deny issued pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, that one or more of the reasons for denial of preferential tariff treatment under paragraph (c)(2) of this section continues to apply.
