# § 182.111   Commercial samples of negligible value.

(a) *General.* Commercial samples of negligible value imported from Canada or Mexico may qualify for duty-free entry under subheading 9811.00.60, HTSUS. For purposes of this section, “commercial samples of negligible value” means commercial samples which have a value, individually or in the aggregate as shipped, of not more than one U.S. dollar, or the equivalent amount in the currency of Canada or Mexico, or which are so marked, torn, perforated, or otherwise treated that they are unsuitable for sale or for use except as commercial samples.


(b) *Qualification for duty-free entry.* Commercial samples of negligible value imported from Canada or Mexico will qualify for duty-free entry under subheading 9811.00.60, HTSUS, only if:


(1) The samples are imported solely for the purpose of soliciting orders for foreign goods or services; and


(2) If valued over one U.S. dollar, the samples are properly marked, torn, perforated or otherwise treated prior to arrival in the United States so that they are unsuitable for sale or for use except as commercial samples.
