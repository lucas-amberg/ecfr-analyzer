# ยง 190.12   Claim filed under incorrect provision.

A drawback claim filed under this part and pursuant to any provision of section 313 of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313), may be deemed filed pursuant to any other provision thereof should the drawback office determine that drawback is not allowable under the provision as originally filed, but that it is allowable under such other provision. To be allowable under such other provision, the claim must meet each of the requirements of such provision. The claimant may raise alternative provisions prior to liquidation and by protest (*see* part 174 of this chapter).
