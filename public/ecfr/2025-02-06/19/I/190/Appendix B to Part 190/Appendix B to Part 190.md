# Appendix B to Part 190—Sample Formats for Applications for Specific Manufacturing Drawback Rulings


Applications for specific manufacturing drawback rulings using these sample formats must be submitted to, reviewed, and approved by CBP Headquarters. *See* 19 CFR 190.8(d). Applications must be submitted electronically to *HQDrawback@cbp.dhs.gov.* In these application formats, remarks in parentheses and footnotes are for explanatory purposes only and should not be copied. Other material should be quoted directly in the applications.


U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Entry Process and Duty Refunds, Regulations and Rulings, Office of Trade, 90 K Street NE—10th Floor (Mail Stop 1177), Washington, DC 20229-1177.


Dear Sir or Madam: We, (Applicant's Name), a (State, e.g., Delaware) corporation (or other described entity) submit this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling that our manufacturing operations qualify for drawback under title 19, United States Code, §§ 1313(a) & (b), and part 190 of the CBP Regulations. We request that CBP authorize drawback on the basis of this application.


(Section 190.8(a) of the CBP Regulations provides that each manufacturer or producer of articles intended for exportation with the benefit of drawback must apply for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling, unless operating under a general manufacturing drawback ruling under § 190.7 of the CBP Regulations. CBP will not approve an application which shows an unincorporated division or company as the applicant (*see* § 190.8(a)).)


(Provide the address of the factory(s) where the process of manufacture or production will take place. Indicate if the factory is a different legal entity from the applicant, and indicate if operating under an Agent's general manufacturing drawback ruling.)


(List persons legally authorized to bind the corporation who will sign drawback documents. Section 190.6 of the CBP Regulations permits only the president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, and any employee legally authorized to bind the corporation to sign for a corporation. In addition, a person within a business entity with a customs power of attorney for the company may sign. A customs power of attorney may also be given to a licensed customs broker. This heading should be changed to Names of Partners or Proprietor in the case of a partnership or sole proprietorship, respectively (*see* footnote at end of this sample format for persons who may sign applications for specific manufacturing drawback rulings).)


(The following questions must be answered:)


1. Who will be the importer of the designated merchandise?


(If the applicant will not always be the importer of the designated merchandise, specify that the applicant understand its obligations to maintain records to support the transfer under § 190.10, and its liability under § 190.63.)


2. Will an agent be used to process the designated or the substituted merchandise into articles?


(If an agent is to be used, the applicant must state it will comply with T.D.s 55027(2) and 55207(1) and § 190.9, as applicable, and that its agent will submit a letter of notification of intent to operate under the general manufacturing drawback ruling for agents (*see* § 190.7 and Appendix A) or an application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling (*see* § 190.8 and this Appendix B).)


3. Will the applicant be the exporter? (If the applicant will not be the exporter in every case, but will be the claimant, the manufacturer must state that it will reserve the right to claim drawback with the knowledge and written consent of the exporter (19 CFR 190.82).)


(Following the items
 listed in the Parallel Columns, the applicant must make a statement affirming the same 8-digit HTSUS classification of the merchandise. This statement should be included in the application exactly as it is stated below:)


The imported merchandise designated in our claims will be classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS classification as the merchandise used in producing the exported articles on which we claim drawback.


(In order to successfully claim drawback it is necessary to prove that the duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic merchandise, which is to be substituted for the imported merchandise, is classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS classification. To enable CBP to rule on the same 8-digit HTSUS classification, the application must include a detailed description of the designated imported merchandise and of the substituted duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic merchandise to be used to produce the exported articles. The application must also include the Bill of Materials and/or formulas annotated with the HTSUS classifications.)


(It is essential that all the characteristics which determine the identity of the merchandise are specified in the application in order to substantiate that the merchandise meets the the same 8-digit HTSUS classification statutory requirement. These characteristics should clearly distinguish merchandise of different identities.)


(The descriptions should be sufficient to classify the merchandise in the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number included in the Parallel Columns. The left-hand column will consist of the name and the 8-digit HTSUS subheading number of the imported merchandise. The right-hand column will consist of the name and the 8-digit HTSUS subheading number for the duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic designated merchandise. Amendments to rulings will be required if any changes to the HTSUS classifications occur.)


(Name each article to be exported. When the identity of the product is not clearly evident by its name, state what the product is (e.g., a herbicide). There must be a match between each article described under the PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE OR PRODUCTION section below and each article listed here.)


(Drawback under § 1313(b) is not allowable except where a manufacture or production exists. Manufacture or production is defined, for drawback purposes, in § 190.2. In order to obtain drawback under § 1313(b), it is essential for the applicant to show use in manufacture or production by providing a thorough description of the manufacturing process. This description should include the name and exact condition of the merchandise listed in the Parallel Columns, a complete explanation of the processes to which it is subjected in this country, the effect of such processes, the name and exact description of the finished article, and the use for which the finished article is intended. When applicable, include equations of any chemical reactions. Including a flow chart in the description of the manufacturing process is an excellent means of illustrating how a manufacture or production occurs. Flow charts can clearly illustrate if and at what point during the manufacturing process by-products and wastes are generated.)


(This section should contain a description of the process by which each item of merchandise listed in the Parallel Columns above is used to make or produce every article that is to be exported.)


(Some processes result in the separation of the merchandise into two or more products. If applicable, list all of the products. State that you will record the market value of each product at the time it is first separated in the manufacturing process. If this section is not applicable to you, then state so.)


(Drawback law mandates the assignment of relative values when two or more products are necessarily produced in the same operation. For instance, the refining of flaxseed necessarily produces linseed oil and linseed husks (animal feed), and drawback must be distributed to each product in accordance with its relative value. However, the voluntary election of a steel fabricator, for instance, to use part of a lot of imported steel to produce automobile doors, and part of the lot to produce automobile fenders, does not call for relative value distribution.)


(The relative value of a product is its value divided by the total value of all products, whether or not exported. For example, 100 gallons of drawback merchandise are used to produce 100 gallons of products, including 60 gallons of product A, 20 gallons of product B, and 20 gallons of product C. At the time of separation, the unit values of products A, B, and C are $5, $10, and $50 respectively. The relative value of product A is $300 divided by $1,500 or 
1/5. The relative value of B is 
2/15 and of product C is 
2/3, calculated in the same manner. This means that 
1/5 of the drawback product payments will be distributed to product A, 
2/15 to product B, and 
2/3 to product C.)


(Drawback is allowable on exports of any of multiple products, but is not permitted on exports of valuable waste. In making this distinction between a product and valuable waste, the applicant should address the following significant elements: (1) The nature of the material of which the residue is composed; (2) the value of the residue as compared to the value of the principal manufactured product and the raw material; (3) the use to which it is put; (4) its status under the tariff laws, if imported; (5) whether it is a commodity recognized in commerce; (6) whether it must be subjected to some process to make it saleable.)


(Some processes result in the separation of fixed proportions of each product, while other processes afford the opportunity to increase or decrease the proportion of each product. An example of the latter is petroleum refining, where the refiner has the option to increase or decrease the production of one or more products relative to the others. State under this heading whether you can or cannot vary the proportionate quantity of each product.)


(The MULTIPLE PRODUCTS section consists of two sub-sections: Relative Values and Producibility. If multiple products do not result from your operation state “Not Applicable” for the entire section. If multiple products do result from your operation Relative Values will always apply. However, Producibility may or may not apply. If Producibility does not apply to your multiple product operation state “Not Applicable” for this sub-section.)


(Many processes result in residue materials which, for drawback purposes, are treated as wastes. Describe any residue materials which you believe should be so treated. If no waste results, include a statement to that effect.)


(If waste occurs, state: (1) Whether or not it is recovered, (2) whether or not it is valueless, and (3) what you do with it. This information is required whether claims are made on a “used in” or “appearing in” basis and regardless of the amount of waste incurred.)


(Irrecoverable wastes are those consisting of materials which are lost in the process. Valueless wastes are those which may be recovered but have no value. These irrecoverable and valueless wastes do not reduce the drawback claim provided the claim is based on the quantity of imported material used in manufacturing. If the claim is based upon the quantity of imported merchandise appearing in the exported article, irrecoverable and valueless waste will cause a reduction in the amount of drawback.)


(Valuable wastes are those recovered wastes which have a value either for sale or for use in a different manufacturing process. However, it should be noted that this standard applies to the entire industry and is not a selection on your part. An option by you not to choose to sell or use the waste in some different operation does not make it valueless if another manufacturer can use the waste. State what you do with the waste. If you have to pay someone to get rid of it, or if you have buyers for the waste, you must state so in your application regardless of what basis you are using.)


(If you recover valuable waste and you choose to claim on the basis of the quantity of merchandise used in producing the exported articles (less any valuable waste), state that you will keep records to establish the quantity and value of the waste recovered. *See* “Basis of Claim for Drawback” section below.)


(Some processes result in another type of residual material, namely, stock in process, which affects the allowance of drawback. Stock in process may exist when residual material resulting from a manufacturing or processing operation is reintroduced into a subsequent manufacturing or processing operation; e.g., trim pieces from a cast article. The effect of stock in process on a drawback claim is that the amount of drawback for the period in which the stock in process was withdrawn from the manufacturing or processing operation (or the manufactured article, if manufacturing or processing periods are not used) is reduced by the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process if the “used in” or “used in less valuable waste” methods are used (if the “appearing in” method is used, there will be no effect on the amount of drawback), and the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process is added to the merchandise or drawback products used in the subsequent manufacturing or production period (or the subsequently produced article)).


(If stock in process occurs and claims are to be based on stock in process, the application must include a statement to that effect. The application must also include a statement that merchandise is considered to be used in manufacture at the time it was originally processed, so that the stock in process will not be included twice in the computation of the merchandise used to manufacture the finished articles on which drawback is claimed.)


(Some manufacturing processes result in an intangible loss or gain of the net weight or measurement of the merchandise used. This loss or gain is caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors. If applicable, state the approximate usual percentage or quantity of such loss or gain. Note that percentage values will be considered to be measured by weight unless otherwise specified. Loss or gain does not occur during all manufacturing processes. If loss or gain does not apply to your manufacturing process, state “Not Applicable.”)


We will maintain records to establish:


1. The identity and 8-digit HTSUS subheading number of the merchandise we designate;


2. The quantity of merchandise classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number as the designated merchandise 
2 we used to produce the exported articles;


3. That, within 5 years after the date of importation, we used the designated merchandise to produce articles. During the same 5-year period, we produced 
3 the exported articles.


We realize that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the importation of the imported merchandise. Our records establishing our compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by CBP during business hours. We understand that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.


(Describe your inventory records and state how those records will meet the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) and part 190 of the CBP Regulations as discussed under the heading “PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED”. To insure compliance the following areas, as applicable, should be included in your discussion:)


(Proof of time frames may be specific or inclusive, e.g., within 120 days, but specific proof is preferable. Separate storage and identification of each article or lot of merchandise usually will permit specific proof of exact dates. Proof of inclusive dates of use, production or export may be acceptable, but in such cases it is best to describe very specifically the data you intend to use to establish each legal requirement, thereby avoiding misunderstandings at the time of audit.) (If you do not describe the inventory records that you will use, you must state: “All legal requirements will be met by our inventory procedures.” However, it should be noted that without a detailed description of the inventory procedures set forth in the application, a judgment as to the adequacy of such a statement cannot be made until a drawback claim is verified. Approval of this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling merely constitutes approval of the ruling application as submitted; it does not constitute approval of the applicant's recordkeeping procedures if those procedures are solely described as meeting the legal requirements, without specifically stating how the requirements will be met. Drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.)


(There are three different bases that may be used to claim drawback: (1) Used in; (2) appearing in; and (3) used in less valuable waste.)


(The “used in” basis may be employed only if there is either no waste, or the waste is valueless or unrecovered. Irrecoverable or valueless waste does not reduce the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “used in” basis. Drawback is payable in the amount of 99 percent of the duties, taxes, and fees, paid on the quantity of imported material designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on the exported articles. The designated quantity may not exceed the quantity of material actually used in the manufacture of the exported articles.) (For example, if 100 pounds of material, valued at $1.00 per pound, were used in manufacture resulting in 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste, the 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste would not reduce the drawback. In this case drawback would be payable on 99% of the duties, taxes, and fees paid on the 100 pounds of designated material used to produce the exported articles.)


(The “appearing in” basis may be used regardless of whether there is waste. If the “appearing in” basis is used, the claimant does not need to keep records of waste and its value. However, the manufacturer must establish the identity and quantity of the merchandise appearing in the exported product and provide this information. Waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are made on the “appearing in” basis. Drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duties, taxes, and fees paid on the quantity of material designated, which may not exceed the quantity of eligible material that appears in the exported articles. “Appearing in” may not be used if multiple products are involved.)


(Based on the previous example, drawback would be payable on the 90 pounds of merchandise which actually went into the exported product (appearing in) rather than the 100 pounds used in as set forth previously.)


(The “used in less valuable waste” basis may be employed when the manufacturer recovers valuable waste, and keeps records of the quantity and value of waste from each lot of merchandise. The value of the waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “used in less valuable waste” basis. When valuable waste is incurred, the drawback allowance on the exported article is based on the duties, taxes, and fees, paid on the quantity of merchandise used in the manufacture, as reduced by the quantity of such merchandise which the value of the waste would replace. In such a case, drawback is claimed on the quantity of eligible material actually used to produce the exported product, less the amount of such material which the value of the waste would replace. Note section 190.26(c) of the CBP Regulations.)


(Based on the previous examples, if the 10 pounds of waste had a value of $.50 per pound, then the 10 pounds of waste, having a total value of $5.00, would be equivalent in value to 5 pounds of the designated material. Thus the value of the waste would replace 5 pounds of the merchandise used, and drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duties, taxes, and fees paid on the 95 pounds of imported material designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on the exported article rather than on the 100 pounds “used in” or the 90 pounds “appearing in” as set forth in the above examples.)


(Two methods exist for the manufacturer to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported article: (1) Schedule or (2) Abstract.)


(A “schedule” shows the quantity of material used in producing each unit of product. The schedule method is usually employed when a standard line of merchandise is being produced according to fixed formulas. Some schedules will show the quantity of merchandise used to manufacture or produce each article and others will show the quantity appearing in each finished article. Schedules may be prepared to show the quantity of merchandise either on the basis of percentages or by actual weights and measurements. A schedule determines the amount of material that is needed to produce a unit of product before the material is actually used in production.)


(An “abstract” is the summary of the records which shows the total quantity of merchandise used in producing all articles during the period covered by the abstract. The abstract looks at a period of time, for instance 3 months, in which the quantity of material has been used. An abstract looks back at how much material was actually used after a production period has been completed.)


(An applicant who fails to indicate a “schedule” choice must base its claims on the “abstract” method. State which Basis and Method you will use. An example of Used In by Schedule follows:)


We will claim drawback on the quantity of (specify material) used in manufacturing (exported article) according to the schedule set forth below.


(Section 190.8(f) of the CBP Regulations requires submission of the schedule with the application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling. An applicant who desires to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office whenever there is a change in the quantity or material used should state:)


We request permission to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office covering changes in the quantities of material used to produce the exported articles, or different styles or capacities of containers of such exported merchandise.


(Neither the “appearing in” basis nor the “schedule” method for claiming drawback may be used where the relative value procedure is required.)


(List the imported merchandise or drawback products.)


(Name each article to be exported. When the identity of the product is not clearly evident by its name state what the product is, e.g., a herbicide. There must be a match between each article described under the PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE AND PRODUCTION section below and each article listed here.)


(If the merchandise used under § 1313(a) is not also used under § 1313(b), the sections entitled PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE OR PRODUCTION, BY-PRODUCTS, LOSS OR GAIN, and STOCK IN PROCESS should be included here to cover merchandise used under § 1313(a). However, if the merchandise used under § 1313(a) is also used under § 1313(b) these sections need not be repeated unless they differ in some way from the § 1313(b) descriptions.)


We will maintain records to establish:


1. That the exported articles on which drawback is claimed were produced with the use of the imported merchandise, and


2. The quantity of imported merchandise 
4 we used in producing the exported articles.


We realize that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after importation of the imported merchandise. We understand that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.


(This section must be completed separately from that set forth under the § 1313(b) portion of your application. The legal requirements under § 1313(a) differ from those under § 1313(b).) (Describe your inventory procedures and state how you will identify the imported merchandise from date of importation until it is incorporated in the articles to be exported. Also describe how you will identify the finished articles from the time of manufacture until shipment.)


(*See* section with this title for procedures under § 1313(b). Either repeat the same basis of claim or use a different basis of claim, as described above, specifically for drawback claimed under § 1313(a).)


The Applicant specifically agrees that it will:


1. Operate in full conformance with the terms of this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling when claiming drawback;


2. Open its factory and records for examination at all reasonable hours by authorized Government officers;


3. Keep its drawback related records and supporting data for at least 3 years from the date of liquidation of any drawback claim predicated in whole or in part upon this application;


4. Keep this application current by reporting promptly to the drawback office which liquidates its claims any changes in the number or locations of its offices or factories, the corporate name, the persons who will sign drawback documents, the basis of claim used for calculating drawback, the decision to use or not to use an agent under § 190.9 or the identity of an agent under that section, or the corporate organization by succession or reincorporation;


5. Keep this application current by reporting promptly to CBP Headquarters all other changes affecting information contained in this application;


6. Keep a copy of this application and the letter of approval by CBP Headquarters on file for ready reference by employees and require all officials and employees concerned to familiarize themselves with the provisions of this application and that letter of approval; and


7. Issue instructions to insure proper compliance with title 19, United States Code, section 1313, part 190 of the CBP Regulations and this application and letter of approval.


I declare that I have read this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling; that I know the averments and agreements contained herein are true and correct; and that my signature on this ____ day of ________ 20____, makes this application binding on


U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Entry Process and Duty Refunds Branch, Commercial and Trade Facilitation Division, Regulations and Rulings, Office of Trade, 90 K Street NE—10th Floor (Mail Stop 1177), Washington, DC 20229-1177.


Dear Sir or Madam: We, (Applicant's Name), a (State, e.g., Delaware) corporation (or other described entity) submit this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling that our manufacturing operations qualify for drawback under title 19, United States Code, section 1313(b), and part 190 of the CBP Regulations. We request that CBP authorize drawback on the basis of this application.


(Section 190.8(a) of the CBP Regulations provides that each manufacturer or producer of articles intended for exportation with the benefit of drawback will apply for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling, unless operating under a general manufacturing drawback ruling under § 190.7 of the CBP Regulations. CBP will not approve an application which shows an unincorporated division or company as the applicant (*see* § 190.8(a)).)


(Provide the address of the factory(s) where the process of manufacture or production will take place. Indicate if the factory is a different legal entity from the applicant, and indicate if the applicant is operating under an Agent's general manufacturing drawback ruling.)


(List persons legally authorized to bind the corporation who will sign drawback documents. Section 190.6 of the CBP Regulations permits only the president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, and any employee legally authorized to bind the corporation to sign for a corporation. In addition, a person within a business entity with a customs power of attorney for the company may sign. A customs power of attorney may also be given to a licensed customs broker. This heading should be changed to NAMES OF PARTNERS or PROPRIETOR in the case of a partnership or sole proprietorship, respectively (*see* footnote at end of this sample format for persons who may sign applications for specific manufacturing drawback rulings).)


(The following questions must be answered:)


1. Who will be the importer of the designated merchandise?


(If the applicant will not always be the importer of the designated merchandise, specify that the applicant understand its obligations to maintain records to support the transfer under § 190.10, and its liability under § 190.63.)


2. Will an agent be used to process the designated or the substituted merchandise into articles?


(If an agent is to be used, the applicant must state it will comply with T.D.s 55027(2) and 55207(1), and § 190.9, as applicable, and that its agent will submit a letter of notification of intent to operate under the general manufacturing drawback ruling for agents (*see* § 190.7 and Appendix A), or an application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling (*see* § 190.8 and this Appendix B).)


3. Will the applicant be the exporter?


(If the applicant will not be the exporter in every case, but will be the claimant, the manufacturer must state that it will reserve the right to claim drawback with the knowledge and written consent of the exporter (19 CFR 190.82).)


(Following the items listed in the Parallel Columns, the applicant must make a statement affirming the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading numberof the merchandise. This statement should be included in the application exactly as it is stated below:
)


The imported merchandise designated in our claims will be classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number as the merchandise used in producing the exported articles on which we claim drawback, such that the merchandise used would, if imported, be subject to the same rate of duty as the designated merchandise.


(In order to successfully claim drawback it is necessary to prove that the duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic merchandise, which is to be substituted for the imported merchandise, is “classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number.” To enable CBP to rule on the proper “same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number,” the application must include a detailed description of the designated imported merchandise, and of the substituted duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic merchandise used to produce the exported articles. The application must also include the Bill of Materials and/or formulas annotated with the HTSUS classification.)


(It is essential that all the characteristics which determine the identity of the merchandise are provided in the application in order to substantiate that the merchandise meets the “same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number” statutory requirement. These characteristics should clearly distinguish merchandise of different identities.


(The descriptions of the “same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number” merchandise should be included in the Parallel Columns. The left-hand column will consist of the name and 8-digit HTSUS subheading number of the imported merchandise. The right-hand column will consist of the name and 8-digit HTSUS subheading number for the duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic designated merchandise. Amendments to the ruling will be required if any changes to the HTSUS classifications occur.)


(Name each article to be exported. When the identity of the product is not clearly evident by its name state what the product is, e.g., a herbicide. There must be a match between each article described under the PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE AND PRODUCTION section below and each article listed here.)


(Drawback under § 1313(b) is not allowable except where a manufacture or production exists. Manufacture or production is defined, for drawback purposes, in § 190.2. In order to obtain drawback under § 1313(b), it is essential for the applicant to show use in manufacture or production by providing a thorough description of the manufacturing process. This description should include the name and exact condition of the merchandise listed in the Parallel Columns, a complete explanation of the processes to which it is subjected in this country, the effect of such processes, the name and exact description of the finished article, and the use for which the finished article is intended. When applicable, include equations of any chemical reactions. Including a flow chart in the description of the manufacturing process is an excellent means of illustrating how manufacture or production occurs. Flow charts can clearly illustrate if and at what point during the manufacturing process by-products and wastes are generated.)


(This section should contain a description of the process by which each item of merchandise listed in the Parallel Columns above is used to make or produce every article that is to be exported.)


(Some processes result in the separation of the merchandise into two or more products. If applicable, list all of the products. State that you will record the market value of each product or by-product at the time it is first separated in the manufacturing process. If this section is not applicable to you, then state so.)


(Drawback law mandates the assignment of relative values when two or more products are necessarily produced in the same operation. For instance, the refining of flaxseed necessarily produces linseed oil and linseed husks (animal feed), and drawback must be distributed to each product in accordance with its relative value. However, the voluntary election of a steel fabricator, for instance, to use part of a lot of imported steel to produce automobile doors, and part of the lot to produce automobile fenders, does not call for relative value distribution.)


(The relative value of a product is its value divided by the total value of all products, whether or not exported. For example, 100 gallons of drawback merchandise are used to produce 100 gallons of products, including 60 gallons of product A, 20 gallons of product B, and 20 gallons of product C. At the time of separation, the unit values of products A, B, and C are $5, $10, and $50 respectively. The relative value of product A is $300 divided by $1,500 or 
1/5. The relative value of B is 
2/15 and of product C is 
2/3, calculated in the same manner. This means that 
1/5 of the drawback product payments will be distributed to product A, 
2/15 to product B, and 
2/3 to product C.)


(Drawback is allowable on exports of any of multiple products, but is not permitted on exports of valuable waste. In making this distinction between a product and valuable waste, the applicant should address the following significant elements: (1) The nature of the material of which the residue is composed; (2) the value of the residue as compared to the value of the principal manufactured product and the raw material; (3) the use to which it is put; (4) its status under the tariff laws, if imported; (5) whether it is a commodity recognized in commerce; (6) whether it must be subjected to some process to make it saleable.)


(Some processes result in the separation of fixed proportions of each product, while other processes afford the opportunity to increase or decrease the proportion of each product. An example of the latter is petroleum refining, where the refiner has the option to increase or decrease the production of one or more products relative to the others. State under this heading whether you can or cannot vary the proportionate quantity of each product.)


(The MULTIPLE PRODUCTS section consists of two sub-sections: Relative Values and Producibility. If multiple products do not result from your operation state “Not Applicable” for the entire section. If multiple products do result from your operation Relative Values will always apply. However, Producibility may or may not apply. If Producibility does not apply to your multiple product operation, then state “Not Applicable” for this sub-section.)


(Many processes result in residue materials which, for drawback purposes, are treated as waste. Describe any residue materials which you believe should be so treated. If no waste results, include a statement to that effect.)


(If waste occurs, state: (1) Whether or not it is recovered, (2) whether or not it is valueless, and (3) what you do with it. This information is required whether claims are made on a “used in” or “appearing in” basis, and regardless of the amount of waste incurred.)


(Irrecoverable wastes are those consisting of materials which are lost in the process. Valueless wastes are those which may be recovered, but have no value. These irrecoverable and valueless wastes do not reduce the drawback claim provided the claim is based on the quantity of imported material used in manufacturing. If the claim is based upon the quantity of imported merchandise appearing in the exported article, irrecoverable and valueless waste will cause a reduction in the amount of drawback.)


(Valuable wastes are those recovered wastes which have a value either for sale or for use in a different manufacturing process. However, it should be noted that this standard applies to the entire industry and is not a selection on your part. An option by you not to choose to sell or use the waste in some different operation does not make it valueless if another manufacturer can use the waste. State what you do with the waste. If you have to pay someone to get rid of it, or if you have buyers for the waste, you must state so in your application regardless of what basis you are using.)


(If you recover valuable waste and if you choose to claim on the basis of the quantity of merchandise used in producing the exported articles less any valuable waste, state that you will keep records to establish the quantity and value of the waste recovered. *See* “Basis of Claim for Drawback” section below.)


(Some processes result in another type of residual material, namely, stock in process, which affects the allowance of drawback. Stock in process may exist when residual material resulting from a manufacturing or processing operation is reintroduced into a subsequent manufacturing or processing operation; e.g., trim pieces from a cast article. The effect of stock in process on a drawback claim is that the amount of drawback for the period in which the stock in process was withdrawn from the manufacturing or processing operation (or the manufactured article, if manufacturing or processing periods are not used) is reduced by the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process if the “used in” or “used in less valuable waste” methods are used (if the “appearing in” method is used, there will be no effect on the amount of drawback), and the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process is added to the merchandise or drawback products used in the subsequent manufacturing or production period (or the subsequently produced article)).


(If stock in process occurs and claims are to be based on stock in process, the application must include a statement to that effect. The application must also include a statement that merchandise is considered to be used in manufacture at the time it was originally processed, so that the stock in process will not be included twice in the computation of the merchandise used to manufacture the finished articles on which drawback is claimed.)


(Some manufacturing processes result in an intangible loss or gain of the net weight or measurement of the merchandise used. This loss or gain is caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors. If applicable, state the approximate usual percentage or quantity of such loss or gain. Note that percentage values will be considered to be measured “by weight” unless otherwise specified. Loss or gain does not occur during all manufacturing processes. If loss or gain does not apply to your manufacturing process, state “Not Applicable.”)


We will maintain records to establish:


1. The identity and 8-digit HTSUS subheading number of the merchandise we designate;


2. The quantity of merchandise classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number as the designated merchandise 
2 we used to produce the exported articles;


3. That, within 5 years after the date of importation, we used the designated merchandise to produce articles. During the same 5-year period, we produced 
3 the exported articles;


We realize that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the importation of the imported merchandise. Our records establishing our compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by CBP during business hours. We understand that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.


(Describe your inventory records and state how those records will meet the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) and part 190 of the CBP Regulations as discussed under the heading PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED. To help ensure compliance the following areas, as applicable, should be included in your discussion:)


(Proof of time frames may be specific or inclusive, e.g., within 120 days, but specific proof is preferable. Separate storage and identification of each article or lot of merchandise usually will permit specific proof of exact dates. Proof of inclusive dates of use, production or export may be acceptable, but in such cases it is better to describe very specifically the data you intend to use to establish each legal requirement, thereby avoiding misunderstandings at the time of audit.)


(If you do not describe the inventory records that you will use, you must state: “All legal requirements will be met by our inventory procedures.” However, it should be noted that without a detailed description of the inventory procedures set forth in the application, a judgment as to the adequacy of such a statement cannot be made until a drawback claim is verified. Approval of this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling merely constitutes approval of the ruling application as submitted; it does not constitute approval of the applicant's recordkeeping procedures if those procedures are solely described as meeting the legal requirements, without specifically stating how the requirements will be met. Drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.)


(There are three different bases that may be used to claim drawback: (1) Used in; (2) appearing in; and (3) used in less valuable waste.)


(The “used in” basis may be employed only if there is either no waste, or the waste is valueless or unrecovered. Irrecoverable or valueless waste does not reduce the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “used in” basis. Drawback is payable in the amount of 99 percent of the duties, taxes, and fees, paid on the quantity of imported material designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on the exported articles. The designated quantity may not exceed the quantity of material actually used in the manufacture of the exported articles.)


(For example, if 100 pounds of material, valued at $1.00 per pound, were used in manufacture resulting in 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste, the 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste would not reduce the drawback. In this case drawback would be payable on 99% of the duties, taxes, and fees, paid on the 100 pounds of designated material used to produce the exported articles.)


(The “appearing in” basis may be used regardless of whether there is waste. If the “appearing in” basis is used, the claimant does not need to keep records of waste and its value. However, the manufacturer must establish the identity and quantity of the merchandise appearing in the exported product and provide this information. Waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are made on the “appearing in” basis. Drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duties, taxes, and fees paid on the quantity of material designated, which may not exceed the quantity of eligible material that appears in the exported articles. “Appearing in” may not be used if multiple products are involved.)


(Based on the previous example, drawback would be payable on the 90 pounds of merchandise which actually went into the exported product (appearing in) rather than the 100 pounds used in as set forth previously.)


(The “used in less valuable waste” basis may be employed when the manufacturer recovers valuable waste, and keeps records of the quantity and value of waste from each lot of merchandise. The value of the waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “used in less valuable waste” basis. When valuable waste is incurred, the drawback allowance on the exported article is based on the duties, taxes, and fees paid on the quantity of merchandise used in the manufacture, as reduced by the quantity of such merchandise which the value of the waste would replace. In such a case, drawback is claimed on the quantity of eligible material actually used to produce the exported product, less the amount of such material which the value of the waste would replace. Note section 190.26(c) of the CBP Regulations.)


(Based on the previous examples, if the 10 pounds of waste had a value of $.50 per pound, then the 10 pounds of waste, having a total value of $5.00, would be equivalent in value to 5 pounds of the designated material. Thus the value of the waste would replace 5 pounds of the merchandise used, and drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duties, taxes, and fees paid on the 95 pounds of imported material designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on the exported article rather than on the 100 pounds “used in” or the 90 pounds “appearing in” as set forth in the above examples.)


(Two methods exist for the manufacturer to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported article: (1) Schedule or (2) Abstract.)


(A “schedule” shows the quantity of material used in producing each unit of product. The schedule method is usually employed when a standard line of merchandise is being produced according to fixed formulas. Some schedules will show the quantity of merchandise used to manufacture or produce each article and others will show the quantity appearing in each finished article. Schedules may be prepared to show the quantity of merchandise either on the basis of percentages, or by actual weights and measurements. A schedule determines the amount of material that is needed to produce a unit of product, before the material is actually used in production.)


(An “abstract” is the summary of the records which shows the total quantity of merchandise used in producing all articles during the period covered by the abstract. The abstract looks at a period of time, for instance 3 months, in which the quantity of material has been used. An abstract looks back at how much material was actually used after a production period has been completed.)


(An applicant who fails to indicate the “schedule” choice must base its claims on the “abstract” method. State which Basis and Method you will use. An example of Used In by Schedule would read:)


We will claim drawback on the quantity of (specify material) used in manufacturing (exported article) according to the schedule set forth below.


(Section 190.8(f) of the CBP Regulations requires submission of the schedule with the application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling. An applicant who desires to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office whenever there is a change in the quantity or material used should state:)


We request permission to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office covering changes in the quantities of material used to produce the exported articles, or different styles or capacities of containers of such exported merchandise.


(Neither the “appearing in” basis nor the “schedule” method for claiming drawback may be used where the relative value procedure is required.)


The Applicant specifically agrees that it will:


1. Operate in full conformance with the terms of this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling when claiming drawback;


2. Open its factory and records for examination at all reasonable hours by authorized Government officers;


3. Keep its drawback related records and supporting data for at least 3 years from the date of liquidation of any drawback claim predicated in whole or in part upon this application;


4. Keep this application current by reporting promptly to the drawback office which liquidates its claims any changes in the number or locations of its offices or factories, the corporate name, the persons who will sign drawback documents, the basis of claim used for calculating drawback, the decision to use or not to use an agent under § 190.9 or the identity of an agent under that section, or the corporate organization by succession or reincorporation;


5. Keep this application current by reporting promptly to CBP Headquarters, all other changes affecting information contained in this application;


6. Keep a copy of this application and the letter of approval by CBP Headquarters on file for ready reference by employees and require all officials and employees concerned to familiarize themselves with the provisions of this application and that letter of approval; and


7. Issue instructions to insure proper compliance with title 19, United States Code, section 1313, part 190 of the CBP Regulations and this application and letter of approval.


I declare that I have read this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling; that I know the averments and agreements contained herein are true and correct; and that my signature on this ____ day of ________ 20 ____, makes this application binding on


U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Entry Process and Duty Refunds Branch, Commercial and Trade Facilitation Division, Regulations and Rulings, Office of Trade, 90 K Street NE—10th Floor (Mail Stop 1177), Washington, DC 20229-1177.


Dear Sir or Madam: We, (Applicant's Name), a (State, e.g., Delaware) corporation (or other described entity) submit this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling that our manufacturing operations qualify for drawback under title 19, United States Code, section 1313(d), and part 190 of the CBP Regulations. We request that CBP authorize drawback on the basis of this application.


(Section 190.8(a) of the CBP Regulations provides that each manufacturer or producer of articles intended for exportation with the benefit of drawback must apply for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling, unless operating under a general manufacturing drawback ruling under § 190.7 of the CBP Regulations. CBP will not approve an application which shows an unincorporated division or company as the applicant (*see* § 190.8(a)).)


(Provide the address of the factory(s) where the process of manufacture or production will take place. Indicate if the factory is a different legal entity from the applicant, and indicate if the applicant is operating under an Agent's general manufacturing drawback ruling.)


(List persons legally authorized to bind the corporation who will sign drawback documents. Section 190.6 of the CBP Regulations permits only the president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, and any employee legally authorized to bind the corporation to sign for a corporation. In addition, a person within a business entity with a customs power of attorney for the company may sign. A customs power of attorney may also be given to a licensed customs broker. This heading should be changed to NAMES OF PARTNERS or PROPRIETOR in the case of a partnership or sole proprietorship, respectively (*see* footnote at end of this sample format for persons who may sign applications for specific manufacturing drawback rulings).)


(The exact material placed under this heading in individual cases will vary, but it should include such information as the type of business in which the manufacturer is engaged, whether the manufacturer is manufacturing for its own account or is performing the operation on a toll basis (including commission or conversion basis) for the account of others, whether the manufacturer is a direct exporter of its products or sells or delivers them to others for export, and whether drawback will be claimed by the manufacturer or by others.)


(If an agent is to be used, the applicant must state it will comply with T.D.s 55027(2) and 55207(1), and § 190.9, as applicable, and that its agent will submit a letter of notification of intent to operate under the general manufacturing drawback ruling for agents (*see* § 190.7 and Appendix A), or an application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling (*see* § 190.8 and this Appendix B).)


(Regarding drawback operations conducted under § 1313(d), the data may describe the flavoring extracts, medicinal, or toilet preparations (including perfumery) manufactured with the use of domestic tax-paid alcohol; and where such alcohol is obtained or purchased.)


(Describe or list the tax-paid material)


(Name each article to be exported)


(Drawback under § 1313(d) is not allowable except where a manufacture or production exists. “Manufacture or production” is defined, for drawback purposes, in § 190.2. In order to obtain drawback under § 1313(d), it is essential for the applicant to show use in manufacture or production by providing a thorough description of the manufacturing process. Describe how the tax-paid material is processed into the export article.)


(Many processes result in residue materials which, for drawback purposes, are treated as wastes. Describe any residue materials which you believe should be so treated. If no waste results, include a statement to that effect.)


(If waste occurs, state: (1) Whether or not it is recovered, (2) whether or not it is valueless, and (3) what you do with it. This information is required whether claims are made on a “used in” or “appearing in” basis and regardless of the amount of waste incurred.)


(Irrecoverable wastes are those consisting of materials which are lost in the process. Valueless wastes are those which may be recovered, but have no value. These irrecoverable and valueless wastes do not reduce the drawback claim provided the claim is based on the quantity of domestic tax-paid alcohol used in manufacturing. If the claim is based upon the quantity of domestic tax-paid alcohol appearing in the exported article, irrecoverable and valueless waste will cause a reduction in the amount of drawback.)


(Valuable wastes are those recovered wastes which have a value either for sale or for use in a different manufacturing process. However, it should be noted that this standard applies to the entire industry and is not a selection on your part. An option by you not to choose to sell or use the waste in some different operation, does not make it valueless if another manufacturer can use the waste. State what you do with the waste. If you have to pay someone to get rid of it, or if you have buyers for the waste, you must state so in your application regardless of what basis you are using.)


(If you recover valuable waste and if you choose to claim on the basis of the quantity of domestic tax-paid alcohol used in producing the exported articles (less any valuable waste), state that you will keep records to establish the quantity and value of the waste recovered. *See* “Basis of Claim for Drawback” section below.)


(Some processes result in another type of residual material, namely, stock in process, which affects the allowance of drawback. Stock in process may exist when residual material resulting from a manufacturing or processing operation is reintroduced into a subsequent manufacturing or processing operation; e.g., trim pieces from a cast article. The effect of stock in process on a drawback claim is that the amount of drawback for the period in which the stock in process was withdrawn from the manufacturing or processing operation (or the manufactured article, if manufacturing or processing periods are not used) is reduced by the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process if the “used in” or “used in less valuable waste” methods are used (if the “appearing in” method is used, there will be no effect on the amount of drawback), and the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to produce the stock in process is added to the merchandise or drawback products used in the subsequent manufacturing or production period (or the subsequently produced article)).


(If stock in process occurs and claims are to be based on stock in process, the application must include a statement to that effect. The application must also include a statement that the domestic tax-paid alcohol is considered to be used in manufacture at the time it was originally processed, so that the stock in process will not be included twice in the computation of the domestic tax-paid alcohol used to manufacture the finished articles on which drawback is claimed.)


(Some manufacturing processes result in an intangible loss or gain of the net weight or measurement of the merchandise used. This loss or gain is caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors. If applicable, state the approximate usual percentage or quantity of such loss or gain. Note that percentage values will be considered to be measured “by weight” unless otherwise specified. Loss or gain does not occur during all manufacturing processes. If loss or gain does not apply to your manufacturing process, state “Not Applicable.”)


We will maintain records to establish:


1. That the exported articles on which drawback is claimed were produced with the use of a particular lot (or lots) of domestic tax-paid alcohol, and


2. The quantity of domestic tax-paid alcohol 
1 we used in producing the exported articles.


We realize that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the tax has been paid on the domestic alcohol. Our records establishing our compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by CBP during business hours. We understand that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.


(Describe your inventory records and state how those records will meet the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(d) and part 190 of the CBP Regulations as discussed under the heading PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED. To help ensure compliance the following areas should be included in your discussion:)


(There are three different bases that may be used to claim drawback: (1) Used in; (2) appearing in; and (3) used in less valuable waste.)


(The “used in” basis may be employed only if there is either no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the operation. Irrecoverable or valueless waste does not reduce the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “used in” basis. Drawback is payable in the amount of 100% of the tax paid on the quantity of domestic alcohol used in the manufacture of flavoring extracts and medicinal or toilet preparation (including perfumery).)


(For example, if 100 gallons of alcohol, valued at $1.00 per gallon, were used in manufacture resulting in 10 gallons of irrecoverable or valueless waste, the 10 gallons of irrecoverable or valueless waste would not reduce the drawback. In this case drawback would be payable on 100% of the tax paid on the 100 gallons of domestic alcohol used to produce the exported articles.)


The “appearing in” basis may be used regardless of whether there is waste. If the “appearing in” basis is used, the claimant does not need to keep records of waste and its value. However, the manufacturer must establish the identity and quantity of the merchandise appearing in the exported product and provide this information. Waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are made on the “appearing in” basis. Drawback is payable on 100% of the tax paid on the quantity of domestic alcohol which appears in the exported articles.


(Based on the previous example, drawback would be payable on the 90 gallons of domestic alcohol which actually went into the exported product (appearing in) rather than the 100 gallons used in as set forth previously.)


(The “used in less valuable waste” basis may be employed when the manufacturer recovers valuable waste, and keeps records of the quantity and value of waste from each lot of domestic tax-paid alcohol. The value of the waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “used in less valuable waste” basis. When valuable waste is incurred, the drawback allowance on the exported article is based on the quantity of tax-paid alcohol used to manufacture the exported articles, as reduced by the quantity of such alcohol which the value of the waste would replace.)


(Based on the previous examples, if the 10 gallons of waste had a value of $.50 per gallon, then the 10 gallons of waste, having a total value of $5.00, would be equivalent in value to 5 gallons of the tax-paid alcohol. Thus the value of the waste would replace 5 gallons of the alcohol used, and drawback is payable on 100% of the tax paid on 95 gallons of alcohol rather than on the 100 gallons “used in” or the 90 gallons “appearing in” as set forth in the above examples.)


(Two methods exist for the manufacturer to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported article: (1) Schedule or (2) Abstract.)


(A “schedule” shows the quantity of material used in producing each unit of product. The schedule method is usually employed when a standard line of merchandise is being produced according to fixed formulas. Some schedules will show the quantity of merchandise used to manufacture or produce each article and others will show the quantity appearing in each finished article. Schedules may be prepared to show the quantity of merchandise either on the basis of percentages or by actual weights and measurements. A schedule determines the amount that will be needed to produce a unit of product before the material is actually used in production.)


(An “abstract” is the summary of the records which shows the total quantity used in producing all products during the period covered by the abstract. The abstract looks at a period of time, for instance 3 months, in which the quantity of material has been used. An abstract looks back at how much material was actually used after a production period has been completed.)


(An applicant who fails to indicate the “schedule” choice must base its claims on the “abstract” method. State which Basis and Method you will use. An example of Used In by schedule follows:)


We will claim drawback on the quantity of (specify material) used in manufacturing (exported article) according to the schedule set forth below.


(Section 190.8(f) of the CBP Regulations requires submission of the schedule with the application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling. An applicant who desires to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office whenever there is a change in the quantity or material used should state:)


We request permission to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office covering changes in the quantities of material used to produce the exported articles, or different styles or capacities of containers of such exported merchandise.


(Neither the “appearing in” basis nor the “schedule” method for claiming drawback may be used where the relative value procedure is required.)


The Applicant specifically agrees that it will:


1. Operate in full conformance with the terms of this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling when claiming drawback;


2. Open its factory and records for examination at all reasonable hours by authorized Government officers;


3. Keep its drawback related records and supporting data for at least 3 years from the date of liquidation of any drawback claim predicated in whole or in part upon this application;


4. Keep this application current by reporting promptly to the drawback office which liquidates its claims any changes in the number or locations of its offices or factories, the corporate name, the persons who will sign drawback documents, the basis of claim used for calculating drawback, the decision to use or not to use an agent under § 190.9 or the identity of an agent under that section, the drawback office where claims will be filed under the ruling, or the corporate organization by succession or reincorporation;


5. Keep this application current by reporting promptly to CBP Headquarters, all other changes affecting information contained in this application;


6. Keep a copy of this application and the letter of approval by CBP Headquarters on file for ready reference by employees and require all officials and employees concerned to familiarize themselves with the provisions of this application and that letter of approval; and


7. Issue instructions to insure proper compliance with title 19, United States Code, section 1313, part 190 of the CBP Regulations and this application and letter of approval.

Dear Sir or Madam: We, (Applicant's Name), a (State, e.g., Delaware) corporation (or other described entity) submit this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling that our manufacturing operations qualify for drawback under title 19, United States Code, section 1313(g), and part 190 of the CBP Regulations. We request that CBP authorize drawback on the basis of this application.


(Section 190.8(a) of the CBP Regulations provides that each manufacturer or producer of articles intended for exportation with the benefit of drawback must apply for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling, unless operating under a general manufacturing drawback ruling under § 190.7 of the CBP Regulations. CBP will not approve an application which shows an unincorporated division or company as the applicant (*see* § 190.8(a)).)


(Provide the address of the factory(s) or shipyard(s) at which the construction and equipment will take place. Indicate if the factory or shipyard is a different legal entity from the applicant, and indicate if the applicant is operating under an Agent's general manufacturing drawback ruling.)


(List persons legally authorized to bind the corporation who will sign drawback documents. Section 190.6 of the CBP Regulations permits only the president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, and any employee legally authorized to bind the corporation to sign for a corporation. In addition, a person within a business entity with a customs power of attorney for the company may sign. A customs power of attorney may also be given to a licensed customs broker. This heading should be changed to NAMES OF PARTNERS or PROPRIETOR in the case of a partnership or sole proprietorship, respectively (*see* footnote at end of this sample format for persons who may sign applications for specific manufacturing drawback rulings).)


(The following questions must be answered:)


1. Who will be the importer of the merchandise? (If the applicant will not always be the importer, specify that the applicant understands its obligations to maintain records to support the transfer under 19 CFR 190.10, and its liability under 19 CFR 190.63.)


2. Who is the manufacturer?


(Is the applicant constructing and equipping for his own account or merely performing the operation on a toll basis for others?)


(If an agent is to be used, the applicant must state it will comply with T.D.s 55027(2) and 55207(1), and § 190.9, as applicable, and that its agent will submit a letter of notification of intent to operate under the general manufacturing drawback ruling for agents (*see* § 190.7 and Appendix A), or an application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling (*see* § 190.8 and this Appendix B).)


3. Will the applicant be the drawback claimant? (State how the vessel will qualify for drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(g). Who is the foreign person or government for whom the vessel is being made or equipped?) (There must be included under this heading the following statement:


We are particularly aware of the terms of § 190.76(a)(1), and subpart M of part 190 of the CBP Regulations, and will comply with these sections where appropriate.)


(Describe the imported merchandise or drawback products.)


(Name the vessel or vessels to be made with imported merchandise or drawback products.)


(Provide a clear and concise description of the process of construction and equipment involved. The description should trace the flow of materials through the manufacturing process for the purpose of establishing physical identification of the imported merchandise or drawback products and of the articles resulting from the processing.)


(Many processes result in residue materials which, for drawback purposes, are treated as wastes. Describe any residue materials which you believe should be so treated. If no waste results, include a statement to that effect.)


(If waste occurs, state: (1) Whether or not it is recovered, (2) whether or not it is valueless, and (3) what you do with it. This information is required whether claims are made on a “used in” or “appearing in” basis and regardless of the amount of waste incurred.)

If the claim is based upon the quantity of imported merchandise appearing in the exported article, irrecoverable and valueless waste will cause a reduction in the amount of drawback.)


(Valuable wastes are those recovered wastes which have a value either for sale or for use in a different manufacturing process. However, it should be noted that this standard applies to the entire industry and is not a selection on your part. An option by you not to choose to sell or use the waste in some different operation does not make it valueless if another manufacturer can use the waste. State what you do with the waste. If you have to pay someone to get rid of it, or if you have buyers for the waste, you must state so in your application regardless of what basis you are using.)


(If you recover valuable waste, and you choose to claim on the basis of the quantity of merchandise used in producing the exported articles (less any valuable waste), state that you will keep records to establish the quantity and value of the waste recovered. *See* “Basis of Claim for Drawback” section below.)


(Some manufacturing processes result in an intangible loss or gain of the net weight or measurement of the merchandise used. This loss or gain is caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors. If applicable, state the approximate usual percentage or quantity of such loss or gain. Note that percentage values will be considered to be measured “by weight” unless otherwise specified. Loss or gain does not occur during all manufacturing processes. If loss or gain does not apply to your manufacturing process, state “Not Applicable.”)


We will maintain records to establish:


1. That the exported article on which drawback is claimed was constructed and equipped with the use of a particular lot (or lots) of imported material; and


2. The quantity of imported merchandise 
1 we used in producing the exported article.


We realize that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the importation of the imported merchandise. Our records establishing our compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by CBP during business hours. We understand that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.


(Describe your inventory records and state how those records will meet the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313 and part 190 of the CBP Regulations as discussed under the heading “PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED”. To help ensure compliance the following should be included in your discussion:)


(There are three different bases that may be used to claim drawback: (1) Used in; (2) appearing in; and (3) used in less valuable waste.)


(The “used in” basis may be employed only if there is either no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the operation. Irrecoverable or valueless waste does not reduce the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “used in” basis. Drawback is payable in the amount of 99 percent of the duties, taxes, and fees, paid on the quantity of imported material used to construct and equip the exported article.)


(For example, if 100 pounds of material, valued at $1.00 per pound, were used in manufacture resulting in 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste, the 10 pounds of irrecoverable or valueless waste would not reduce the drawback. In this case drawback would be payable on 99% of the duties, taxes, and fees, paid on the 100 pounds of imported material used in constructing and equipping the exported articles.)


(The “appearing in” basis may be used regardless of whether there is waste. If the “appearing in” basis is used, the claimant does not need to keep records of waste and its value. However, the manufacturer must establish the identity and quantity of the merchandise appearing in the exported product and provide this information. Waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are made on the “appearing in” basis. Drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duties, taxes, and fees, paid on the quantity of imported material which appears in the exported articles. “Appearing in” may not be used if multiple products are involved.)


(Based on the previous example, drawback would be payable on the 90 pounds of imported material which actually went into the exported product (appearing in) rather than the 100 pounds used in as set forth previously.)


(The “used in less valuable waste” basis may be employed when the manufacturer recovers valuable waste, and keeps records of the quantity and value of waste from each lot of merchandise. The value of the waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are based on the “used in less valuable waste” basis. When valuable waste is incurred, the drawback allowance on the exported article is based on the duties, taxes, and fees, paid on the quantity of imported material used to construct and equip the exported product, as reduced by the quantity of such material which the value of the waste would replace. In such a case, drawback is claimed on the quantity of eligible material actually used to produce the exported product, less the amount of such material which the value of the waste would replace. Note section 190.26(c) of the CBP Regulations.)


(Based on the previous examples, if the 10 pounds of waste had a value of $.50 per pound, then the 10 pounds of waste, having a total value of $5.00, would be equivalent in value to 5 pounds of the imported material. Thus the value of the waste would replace 5 pounds of the merchandise used, and drawback is payable on 99 percent of the duties, taxes, and fees, paid on the 95 pounds of imported material rather than on the 100 pounds “used in” or the 90 pounds “appearing in” as set forth in the above examples.)


(Two methods exist for the manufacturer to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported article: (1) Schedule or (2) Abstract.)


(A “schedule” shows the quantity of material used in producing each unit of product. The schedule method is usually employed when a standard line of merchandise is being produced according to fixed formulas. Some schedules will show the quantity of merchandise used to manufacture or produce each article and others will show the quantity appearing in each finished article. Schedules may be prepared to show the quantity of merchandise either on the basis of percentages or by actual weights and measurements. A schedule determines the amount of material that is needed to produce a unit of product before the material is actually used in production.)


(An “abstract' is the summary of the records which shows the total quantity of merchandise used in producing all articles during the period covered by the abstract. The abstract looks at a period of time, for instance 3 months, in which the quantity of material has been used. An abstract looks back at how much material was actually used after a production period has been completed.)


(An applicant who fails to indicate the “schedule” choice must base its claims on the “abstract' method. State which Basis and Method you will use. An example of Used In by Schedule would read:)


We will claim drawback on the quantity of (specify material) used in manufacturing (exported article) according to the schedule set forth below.


(Section 190.8(f) of the CBP Regulations requires submission of the schedule with the application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling. An applicant who desires to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office whenever there is a change in the quantity or material used should state:)


We request permission to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office covering changes in the quantities of material used to produce the exported articles, or different styles or capacities of containers of such exported merchandise.


(Neither the “appearing in” basis nor the “schedule method for claiming drawback may be used where the relative value procedure is required.)

1. Operate in full conformance with the terms of this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling when claiming drawback;


2. Open its factory and records for examination at all reasonable hours by authorized Government officers;
