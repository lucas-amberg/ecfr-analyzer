(i) The amount of duties, taxes, and fees paid with respect to the imported merchandise; or


(ii) The amount of duties, taxes, and fees that would apply to the exported article if the exported article were imported.


(2) *Destruction.* In the case of an article that is destroyed, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the total amount of drawback allowable will not exceed 99 percent of the lesser of:


(i) The amount of duties, taxes, and fees paid with respect to the imported merchandise (after the value of the imported merchandise has been reduced by the value of materials recovered during destruction as provided in 19 U.S.C. 1313(x)); or


(ii) The amount of duties, taxes, and fees that would apply to the destroyed article if the destroyed article had been imported (after the value of the imported merchandise has been reduced by the value of materials recovered during destruction as provided in 19 U.S.C. 1313(x)).


(3) *Federal excise tax.* For purposes of drawback of internal revenue tax imposed under Chapters 32, 38 (with the exception of Subchapter A of Chapter 38), 51, and 52 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (IRC), drawback granted on the export or destruction of substituted merchandise will be limited to the amount of taxes paid (and not returned by refund, credit, or drawback) on the substituted merchandise.

(2) *Allowable refund.* For any drawback claim for wine (as defined in § 190.2) based on 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(2), the total amount of drawback allowable will not exceed 99 percent of the duties, taxes, and fees paid with respect to the imported merchandise, without regard to the limitations in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.
