# ยง 190.35   Notice of intent to export or destroy; examination of merchandise.

(a) *Notice.* A notice of intent to export or destroy merchandise which may be the subject of an unused merchandise drawback claim (19 U.S.C. 1313(j)) must be provided to CBP to give CBP the opportunity to examine the merchandise. The claimant or the exporter (for destruction under CBP supervision, see ยง 190.71) must file at the port of intended examination a Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback on CBP Form 7553 at least 5 working days prior to the date of intended exportation unless CBP approves another filing period or the claimant has been granted a waiver of prior notice (*see* ยง 190.91).


(b) *Required information.* The notice must certify that the merchandise has not been used in the United States before exportation or destruction. In addition, if applicable, the notice must provide the bill of lading number, if known, the name and telephone number, mailing address, and, if available, fax number and email address of a contact person, and the location of the merchandise.


(c) *Decision to examine or to waive examination.* Within 2 working days after receipt of the Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback (*see* paragraph (a) of this section), CBP will notify the party designated on the Notice in writing of CBP's decision to either examine the merchandise to be exported, or to waive examination. If CBP timely notifies the designated party, in writing, of its decision to examine the merchandise (*see* paragraph (d) of this section), but the merchandise is exported without having been presented to CBP for examination, any drawback claim, or part thereof, based on the Notice will be denied. If CBP notifies the designated party, in writing, of its decision to waive examination of the merchandise, or, if timely notification of a decision by CBP to examine or to waive examination has not been received, the merchandise may be exported without delay.


(d) *Time and place of examination.* If CBP gives timely notice of its decision to examine the exported merchandise, the merchandise to be examined must be promptly presented to CBP. CBP must examine the merchandise within 5 working days after presentation of the merchandise. The merchandise may be exported without examination if CBP fails to timely examine the merchandise after presentation to CBP. If the examination is to be completed at a port other than the port of actual exportation or destruction, the merchandise must be transported in-bond to the port of exportation or destruction.


(e) *Extent of examination.* The appropriate CBP office may permit release of merchandise without examination, or may examine, to the extent determined to be necessary, the items to be exported or destroyed.
