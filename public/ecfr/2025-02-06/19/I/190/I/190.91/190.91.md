# § 190.91   Waiver of prior notice of intent to export or destroy.

(a) *General*—(1) *Scope.* The requirement in § 190.35 for prior notice of intent to export or destroy merchandise which may be the subject of an unused merchandise drawback claim under section 313(j) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(j)), or a rejected merchandise drawback claim under section 313(c), as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(c)), may be waived under the provisions of this section.


(2) *Effective date for claimants with existing approval.* For claimants approved for waiver of prior notice before February 24, 2019, and under 19 CFR part 191, such approval of waiver of prior notice will remain in effect, but only if the claimant provides the following certification as part of each complete claim filed on or after that date, pursuant to § 190.51(a)(2)(xvi): “The undersigned acknowledges the current statutory requirements under 19 U.S.C. 1313 and the regulatory requirements in 19 CFR part 190, and hereby certifies continuing eligibility for the waiver of prior notice (granted prior to February 24, 2019) in compliance therewith.” This certification may only be made for waiver of prior notice for the specific type of drawback claim for which the application was previously approved under 19 CFR 191, except that applications approved under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(1) will also be applicable to claims for the same type of merchandise if made under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(2).


(3) *Limited successorship for waiver of prior notice.* When a claimant (predecessor) is approved for waiver of prior notice under this section and all of the rights, privileges, immunities, powers, duties and liabilities of the claimant are transferred by written agreement, merger, or corporate resolution to a successor, such approval of waiver of prior notice will remain in effect for a period of 1 year after such transfer. The approval of waiver of prior notice will terminate at the end of such 1-year period unless the successor applies for waiver of prior notice under this section. If such successor applies for waiver of prior notice under this section within such 1-year period, the successor may continue to operate under the predecessor's waiver of prior notice until CBP approves or denies the successor's application for waiver of prior notice under this section, subject to the provisions in this section (*see,* in particular, paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section).


(b) *Application*—(1) *Who may apply.* A claimant for unused merchandise drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j) or rejected merchandise drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(c) may apply for a waiver of prior notice of intent to export or destroy merchandise under this section.

Based on the information submitted on and with the application and any information so requested, and based on the applicant's record of transactions with CBP, the drawback office will approve or deny the application.

(2) *Approval.* The approval of an application for waiver of prior notice of intent to export or destroy, under this section, will operate prospectively, applying only to those export shipments or destructions occurring after the date of the waiver. It will be subject to a stay, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.


(3) *Denial.* If an application for waiver of prior notice of intent to export or destroy, under this section, is denied, the applicant will be given written notice, specifying the grounds therefor, together with what corrective action may be taken, and informing the applicant that the denial may be appealed in the manner prescribed in paragraph (g) of this section. The applicant may not reapply for a waiver until the reason for the denial is resolved.


(d) *Stay.* An approval of waiver of prior notice may be stayed, for a specified reasonable period, should CBP desire for any reason to examine the merchandise being exported or destroyed with drawback prior to its exportation or destruction for purposes of verification. CBP will provide written notice, by registered or certified mail, of such a stay to the person for whom waiver of prior notice was approved. CBP will specify the reason(s) for the stay in such written notice. The stay will take effect 2 working days after the date the person signs the return post office receipt for the registered or certified mail. The stay will remain in effect for the period specified in the written notice, or until such earlier date as CBP notifies the person for whom waiver of prior notice was approved in writing that the reason for the stay has been satisfied. After the stay is lifted, operation under the waiver of prior notice procedure may resume for exports on or after the date the stay is lifted.


(e) *Proposed revocation.* CBP may propose to revoke the approval of an application for waiver of prior notice of intent to export or destroy, under this section, for good cause (such as, noncompliance with the drawback law and/or regulations). CBP will give written notice of the proposed revocation of a waiver of prior notice of intent to export or destroy. The notice will specify the reasons for CBP's proposed action and provide information regarding the procedures for challenging CBP's proposed revocation action as prescribed in paragraph (g) of this section. The written notice of proposed revocation may be included with a notice of stay of approval of waiver of prior notice as provided under paragraph (d) of this section. The revocation of the approval of waiver of prior notice will take effect 30 days after the date of the proposed revocation if not timely challenged under paragraph (g) of this section.

(f) *Action by drawback office controlling.* Action by the drawback office to approve, deny, stay, or revoke waiver of prior notice of intent to export or destroy, unless reversed by CBP Headquarters, will govern the applicant's eligibility for this procedure in all CBP drawback offices. If the application for waiver of prior notice of intent to export or destroy is approved, the claimant must refer to such approval in the first drawback claim filed after such approval in the drawback office approving waiver of prior notice and must submit a copy of the approval letter with the first drawback claim filed in any drawback office other than the approving office, when the export or destruction upon which the claim is based was without prior notice, under this section.


(g) *Appeal of denial or challenge to proposed revocation.* An appeal of a denial of an application under this section, or challenge to the proposed revocation of an approved application under this section, may be made by letter to the drawback office issuing the denial or proposed revocation and must be filed within 30 days of the date of denial or proposed revocation. A denial of an appeal or challenge made to the drawback office may itself be appealed to CBP Headquarters, Office of Trade, Trade Policy and Programs, and must be filed within 30 days of the denial date of the initial appeal or challenge. The 30-day period for appeal or challenge to the drawback office or to CBP Headquarters may be extended for good cause, upon written request by the applicant or holder for such extension filed with the appropriate office within the 30-day period.
