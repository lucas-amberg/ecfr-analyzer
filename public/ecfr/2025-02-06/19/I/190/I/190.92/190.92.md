# § 190.92   Accelerated payment.

(a) *General*—(1) *Scope.* Accelerated payment of drawback is available under this section on drawback claims under this part, unless specifically excepted from such accelerated payment. Accelerated payment of drawback consists of the payment of estimated drawback before liquidation of the drawback entry. Accelerated payment of drawback is only available when CBP's review of the request for accelerated payment of drawback does not find omissions from, or inconsistencies with the requirements of the drawback law and part 190 (*see,* especially, subpart E of this part). Accelerated payment of a drawback claim does not constitute liquidation of the drawback entry.


(2) *Effective date for claimants with existing approval.* For claimants approved for accelerated payment of drawback before February 24, 2019, and under 19 CFR part 191, such approval of accelerated payment will remain in effect, but only if the claimant provides the following certification as part of each complete claim filed after that date, pursuant to § 190.51(a)(2)(xvi): “The undersigned acknowledges the current statutory requirements under 19 U.S.C. 1313 and the regulatory requirements in 19 CFR part 190, and hereby certifies continuing eligibility for accelerated payment (granted prior to February 24, 2019) in compliance therewith.” This certification may only be made for accelerated payment for the specific type of drawback claim for which the application was previously approved under 19 CFR 191, except that applications approved under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(1) will also be applicable to claims for the same type of merchandise if made under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(2).


(3) *Limited successorship for approval of accelerated payment.* When a claimant (predecessor) is approved for accelerated payment of drawback under this section and all of the rights, privileges, immunities, powers, duties and liabilities of the claimant are transferred by written agreement, merger, or corporate resolution to a successor, such approval of accelerated payment will remain in effect for a period of 1 year after such transfer. The approval of accelerated payment of drawback will terminate at the end of such 1-year period unless the successor applies for accelerated payment of drawback under this section. If such successor applies for accelerated payment of drawback under this section within such 1-year period, the successor may continue to operate under the predecessor's approval of accelerated payment until CBP approves or denies the successor's application for accelerated payment under this section, subject to the provisions in this section (*see,* in particular, paragraph (f) of this section).


(b) *Application for approval; contents.* A person who wishes to apply for accelerated payment of drawback must file a written application (which may be physically delivered or delivered via email) with the drawback office where claims will be filed.


(1) *Required information.* The application must contain:

(4) *Description of claimant's drawback program.* With the application, the applicant must submit a description (with sample documents) of how the applicant will ensure compliance with its certification that the statutory and regulatory drawback requirements will be met. This description may be in the form of a booklet. The detail contained in this description should vary depending on the size and complexity of the applicant's accelerated drawback program (for example, if the dollar amount is great and there are several kinds of drawback involved, with differing inventory, manufacturing, and shipping methods, greater detail in the description will be required). The description must include at least:


(i) The name of the official in the claimant's organization who is responsible for oversight of the claimant's drawback program;


(ii) The procedures and controls demonstrating compliance with the statutory and regulatory drawback requirements;


(iii) The parameters of claimant's drawback recordkeeping program, including the retention period and method (for example, paper, electronic, etc.);

(c) *Sample application.* The drawback office, upon request, will provide applicants for accelerated payment with a sample letter format to assist them in preparing their submissions.


(d) *Bond required.* If approved for accelerated payment, the claimant must furnish a properly executed bond in an amount sufficient to cover the estimated amount of drawback to be claimed during the term of the bond. If outstanding accelerated drawback claims exceed the amount of the bond, the drawback office will require additional bond coverage as necessary before additional accelerated payments are made.


(e) *Action on application*—(1) *CBP review.* The drawback office will review and verify the information submitted in and with the application. In order for CBP to evaluate the application, CBP may request additional information (including additional sample documents) and/or explanations of any of the information provided for in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Based on the information submitted on and with the application and any information so requested, and based on the applicant's record of transactions with CBP, the drawback office will approve or deny the application. The criteria to be considered in reviewing the applicant's record with CBP include, but are not limited to (as applicable):


(i) The presence or absence of unresolved CBP charges (duties, taxes, fees, or other debts owed CBP);


(ii) The accuracy of the claimant's past drawback claims; and


(iii) Whether accelerated payment of drawback or waiver of prior notice of intent to export was previously revoked or suspended.


(2) *Notification to applicant.* CBP will notify the applicant in writing within 90 days of receipt of the application of its decision to approve or deny the application, or of CBP's inability to approve, deny, or act on the application and the reason therefor.


(3) *Approval.* The approval of an application for accelerated payment, under this section, will be effective as of the date of CBP's written notification of approval under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Accelerated payment of drawback will be available under this section to unliquidated drawback claims filed before and after such date. For claims filed before such date, accelerated payment of drawback will be paid only if the claimant furnishes a properly executed bond covering the claim, in an amount sufficient to cover the amount of accelerated drawback to be paid on the claim.


(4) *Denial.* If an application for accelerated payment of drawback under this section is denied, the applicant will be given written notice, specifying the grounds therefor, together with what corrective action may be taken, and informing the applicant that the denial may be appealed in the manner prescribed in paragraph (i) of this section. The applicant may not reapply for accelerated payment of drawback until the reason for the denial is resolved.


(f) *Revocation.* CBP may propose to revoke the approval of an application for accelerated payment of drawback under this section, for good cause (such as, noncompliance with the drawback law and/or regulations). In case of such proposed revocation, CBP will give written notice, by registered or certified mail, of the proposed revocation of the approval of accelerated payment. The notice will specify the reasons for CBP's proposed action and the procedures for challenging CBP's proposed revocation action as prescribed in paragraph (h) of this section. The revocation will take effect 30 days after the date of the proposed revocation if not timely challenged under paragraph (h) of this section. If timely challenged, the revocation will take effect after completion of the challenge procedures in paragraph (h) of this section unless the challenge is successful.


(g) *Action by drawback office controlling.* Action by the drawback office to approve, deny, or revoke accelerated payment of drawback will govern the applicant's eligibility for this procedure in all CBP drawback offices. If the application for accelerated payment of drawback is approved, the claimant must refer to such approval in the first drawback claim filed after such approval in the drawback office approving accelerated payment of drawback and must submit a copy of the approval letter with the first drawback claim filed in a drawback office other than the approving office.


(h) *Appeal of denial or challenge to proposed revocation.* An appeal of a denial of an application under this section, or challenge to the proposed revocation of an approved application under this section, may be made in writing to the drawback office issuing the denial or proposed revocation and must be filed within 30 days of the date of denial or proposed revocation. A denial of an appeal or challenge made to the drawback office may itself be appealed to CBP Headquarters, Office of Trade, Trade Policy and Programs, and must be filed within 30 days. The 30-day period for appeal or challenge to the drawback office or to CBP Headquarters may be extended for good cause, upon written request by the applicant or holder for such extension filed with the appropriate office within the 30-day period.


(i) *Payment.* The drawback office approving a drawback claim in which accelerated payment of drawback was requested will certify the drawback claim for payment. After liquidation, the drawback office will certify the claim for payment of any amount due or demand a refund of any excess amount paid. Any excess amount of duty the subject of accelerated payment that is not repaid to CBP within 30 days after the date of liquidation of the related drawback entry will be considered delinquent (*see* §§ 24.3a and 113.65(b) of this chapter).
