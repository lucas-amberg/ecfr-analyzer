The imported merchandise which the manufacturer or producer will designate on its claims will be so similar in quality to the merchandise used in producing the exported articles on which drawback is claimed that the merchandise used would, if imported, be subject to the same rate of duty as the imported designated merchandise.


See the General Instructions, I.A.7., for this general drawback ruling. Each article to be exported must be named. When the identity of the product is not clearly evident by its name, there must be a statement as to what the product is, e.g., a herbicide.


The manufacturer or producer manufactures or produces for its own account. The manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce articles for the account of another or another manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce for the account of the manufacturer or producer under contract within the principal and agency relationship outlined in T.D.s 55027(2) and 55207(1) (see § 191.9 of this part).


Heated crude oil is charged to an atmospheric distillation tower where it is subjected to fractionation. The charge to the distillation tower consists of a single crude oil, or of commingled crudes which are fed to the tower simultaneously or after blending in a tank. During fractionation, components of different boiling ranges are separated.


Fractionation results in 17 products. In order to insure proper distribution of drawback to each of these products, the manufacturer or producer agrees to record the relative values as the time of separation. The entire period covered by an abstract is to be treated at the time of separation. The value per unit of each product shall be the average market value for the abstract period.


The manufacturer or producer can vary the proportionate quantity of each product. The manufacturer or producer understands that drawback is payable on exported products only to the extent that these products could have been produced from the designated merchandise. The records of the manufacturer or producer will show that all of the products exported for which drawback will be claimed under this general manufacturing drawback ruling could have been produced concurrently on a practical operating basis from the designated merchandise.


The manufacturer or producer agrees to establish the amount to be designated by reference to the Industry Standards of Potential Production published in T.D. 66-16. 
2

There are no valuable wastes as a result of the processing.


Because the manufacturer or producer keeps records on a volume basis rather than a weight basis, it is anticipated that the material balance will show a volume gain. For the same reason, it is possible that occasionally the material balance will show a volume loss. Fluctuations in type of crude used, together with the type of finished product desired make an estimate of an average volume gain meaningless. However, records will be kept to show the amount of loss or gain with respect to the production of export products.


The use of any domestic merchandise acquired in exchange for imported merchandise that meets the same kind and quality specifications contained in the parallel columns of this general ruling shall be treated as use of the imported merchandise if no certificate of delivery is issued covering the imported merchandise (19 U.S.C. 1313(k)) upon compliance with the applicable regulations and rulings.


Records will be maintained to establish:


1. The identity and specifications of the merchandise designated;


2. The quantity of merchandise of the same kind and quality as the designated merchandise used to produce the exported articles.


3. That, within 3 years after receiving it at its refinery, the manufacturer or producer used the designated merchandise to produce articles. During the same 3-year period, the manufacturer or producer produced the exported articles.


4(a). The manufacturer or producer agrees to use a 28-31 day period (monthly) abstract period for each refinery covered by this general manufacturing drawback ruling, or


(b). The manufacturer or producer agrees to use an abstract period (not to exceed 1 year) for each refinery covered by this general manufacturing drawback ruling. The manufacturer or producer certifies that if it were to file abstracts covering each manufacturing period of not less than 28 days and not more than 31 days (monthly) within the longer period, in no such monthly abstract would the quantity of designated merchandise exceed, for the same class of designated merchandise, the material introduced into the manufacturing process during that monthly period. (Select (a) or (b), and state which is selected in the application, and, if (b) is selected, specify the length of the particular abstract period chosen (not to exceed 1 year (see General Instruction I.A.7.)).)


5. On each abstract of production the manufacturer or producer agrees to show the value per barrel to five decimal places.


6. The manufacturer or producer agrees to file claims in the format set forth in exhibits A through F which are attached to this general manufacturing drawback ruling. The manufacturer or producer realizes that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after importation of the imported merchandise. Records establishing compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by Customs during business hours. It is understood that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance. Records will be kept in accordance with T.D. 84-49, as amended by T.D. 95-61.


It is understood that the refiner can reserve as the basis for future payment the right to drawback only on the number of barrels of raw material computed by subtracting from Line E the larger of Lines A or B, of a given Exhibit E. It is further understood that this right to future payment can be claimed only against products concurrently producible with the products listed in Column 21, in the quantities shown in Column 22 of such Exhibit E. Such residual right can be transferred to another refinery of the same refiner only when Line B of Exhibit E is larger than Line A. Unless the number of residual barrels is specifically computed and rights thereto are expressly reserved on Exhibit E, such residual rights shall be deemed waived. The procedure the manufacturer or producer shall follow in preparing drawback entries claiming this residual right is illustrated in the attached sample Exhibit E-1. It is understood that claims involving residual rights shall be filed only at the port where the Exhibit E reserving such right was filed.


The manufacturer or producer realizes that inventory control is of major importance. In accordance with the normal accounting procedures of the manufacturer or producer, each refinery prepares a monthly stock and yield report, which accounts for inventories, production and disposals from time of receipt to time of disposition. This provides an audit trail of all products.


The above-noted records will provide the required audit trail from the initial source documents to the drawback claims of the manufacturer or producer and will support adherence with the requirements discussed under the heading PROCEDURES AND RECORDS MAINTAINED.


The amount of raw material on which drawback may be based shall be computed by multiplying the quantity of each product exported by the drawback factor for that product. The amount of any one type and class of raw material which may be designated as the basis for drawback on the exported products produced at a given refinery and covered by a drawback entry shall not exceed the quantity of such raw material used at the refinery during the abstract period or periods from which the exported products were produced. The quantity of raw material to be designated as the basis for drawback on exported products must be at least as great as the quantity of raw material of the same type and class which would be required to produce the exported products in the quantities exported.


The manufacturer or producer specifically agrees that it will:


1. Comply fully with the terms of this general ruling when claiming drawback;


2. Open its refinery and records for examination at all reasonable hours by authorized Government officers;


3. Keep its drawback related records and supporting data for at least 3 years from the date of payment of any drawback claim predicated in whole or in part upon this application;


4. Keep this application current by reporting promptly to the drawback office which liquidates its claims any changes in the information required by the General Instructions of this Appendix to be included therein (I. General Instructions, 1 through 9) or the corporate name or corporate organization by succession or reincorporation;


5. Keep a copy of this general ruling on file for ready reference by employees and require all officials and employees concerned to familiarize themselves with the provisions of this general ruling; and


6. Issue instructions to insure proper compliance with title 19, United States Code, section 1313, part 191 of the CBP Regulations and this general ruling.


The piece goods used in manufacture will be the same kind and quality as the piece goods designated as the basis of claim for drawback, and are used interchangeably without change in manufacturing processes or resultant products (including, if applicable, multiple products), or wastes. Some tolerances between imported-designated piece goods and the used-exported piece goods will be permitted to accommodate variations which are normally found in piece goods. These tolerances are no greater than the tolerances generally allowed in the industry for piece goods of the same kind and quality as follows:


1. A 4% weight tolerance so that the piece goods used in manufacture will be not more than 4% lighter or heavier than the imported piece goods which will be designated;


2. A tolerance of 4% in the aggregate thread count per square inch so that the piece goods used in manufacture will have an aggregate thread count within 4%, more or less of the aggregate thread count of the imported piece goods which will be designated. In each case, the average yarn number of the domestic piece goods will be the same or greater than the average yarn number of the imported piece goods designated, and in each case, the substitution and tolerance will be employed only within the same family of fabrics, *i.e.,* print cloth for print cloth, gingham for gingham, greige for greige, dyed for dyed, bleached for bleached, etc. The piece goods used in manufacture of the exported articles will be designated as containing the identical percentage of identical fibers as the piece goods designated as the basis for allowance of drawback; for example, piece goods containing 65% cotton and 35% dacron will be designated against the use of piece goods shown to contain 65% cotton and 35% dacron. The actual fiber composition may vary slightly from that described on the invoice or other acceptance of the fabric as having the composition described on documents in accordance with trade practices. The substituted piece goods used in the manufacture of articles for exportation with drawback will be so similar in quality to the imported piece goods designated for the basis of allowance of drawback, that the piece goods used, if imported, would have been subject to the same or greater amount of duty as was paid on the imported designated piece goods. Differences in value resulting from factors other than quality, as for example, price fluctuations, will not preclude an allowance of drawback.


Finished piece goods.


The manufacturer or producer manufactures or produces for its own account. The manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce articles for the account of another or another manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce for the account of the manufacturer or producer under contract within the principal and agency relationship outlined in T.D.'s. 55027(2) and 55207(1) (see § 191.9 of this part).


Piece goods are subject to any one of the following finishing productions:


1. Bleaching,


2. Mercerizing,


3. Dyeing,


4. Printing,


5. A combination of the above, or


6. Any additional finishing processes.


Not applicable.


Rag waste may be incurred. No drawback is payable on any waste which results from the manufacturing operation. Unless the claim for drawback is based on the quantity of merchandise appearing in the exported articles, the records of the manufacturer or producer will show the quantity of rag waste, if any, and its value. If necessary to establish the quantity of merchandise (eligible piece goods) appearing in the exported articles, such waste records will also be kept. In instances where rag waste occurs and it is impractical to account for the actual quantity of rag waste incurred, it may be assumed that such rag waste constituted 2% of the piece goods put into the finishing processes.


Unless the claim for drawback is based on the quantity of merchandise appearing in the exported articles, the records of the manufacturer or producer will show the yardage lost by shrinkage or gained by stretching during manufacture or production, and the quantity of remnants resulting and of spoilage incurred, if any. If necessary to establish the quantity of merchandise (eligible piece goods) appearing in the exported articles, such records for shrinkage, gain and spoilage will also be kept. 


The use of any domestic merchandise acquired in exchange for imported merchandise that meets the same kind and quality specifications contained in the parallel columns of this general ruling shall be treated as use of the imported merchandise if no certificate of delivery is issued covering the imported merchandise (19 U.S.C. 1313(k)) upon compliance with the applicable regulations and rulings.


Records will be maintained to establish:


1. The identity and specifications of the designated merchandise;


2. The quantity of merchandise of the same kind and quality as the designated merchandise 
2 used to produce the exported articles;


3. That, within 3 years after receiving the designated merchandise at its factory, the manufacturer or producer used the merchandise to produce articles. During the same 3-year period, the manufacturer or producer produced 
3 the exported articles.


To obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the importation of the imported merchandise. Records establishing compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by Customs during business hours. Drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.


The inventory records of the manufacturer or producer will show how the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) and part 191 of the CBP Regulations will be met, as discussed under the heading “Procedures And Records Maintained”. If those records do not establish satisfaction of those legal requirements, drawback cannot be paid.


Drawback will be claimed on the quantity of eligible piece goods used in producing the exported articles only if there is no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the manufacturing operation. Drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible piece goods that appears in the exported articles, regardless of whether there is waste, and no records of waste need be maintained. If there is valuable waste recovered from the manufacturing operation and records are kept which show the quantity and value of the waste from each lot of piece goods, drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible piece goods used to produce the exported articles less the amount of piece goods which the value of the waste would replace.


The manufacturer or producer will:


1. Comply fully with the terms of this general ruling when claiming drawback;


2. Open its factory and records for examination at all reasonable hours by authorized Government officers;


3. Keep its drawback related records and supporting data for at least 3 years from the date of payment of any drawback claim predicated in whole or in part upon this general ruling;


4. Keep its letter of notification of intent to operate under this general ruling current by reporting promptly to the drawback office which liquidates its claims any changes in the information required by the General Instructions of this Appendix to be included therein (I. General Instructions, 1 through 9) or the corporate name or corporate organization by succession or reincorporation;


5. Keep a copy of this general ruling on file for ready reference by employees and require all officials and employees concerned to familiarize themselves with the provisions of this general ruling; and


6. Issue instructions to insure proper compliance with title 19, United States Code, section 1313, part 191 of the CBP Regulations and this general ruling.


Drawback may be allowed under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) upon the exportation of hard or soft refined sugars and sirups manufactured from raw sugar, subject to the following special requirements:


A. The drawback allowance shall not exceed 99 percent of the duty paid on a quantity of raw sugar designated by the refiner which contains a quantity of sucrose not in excess of the quantity required to manufacture the exported sugar or sirup, ascertained as provided in this general rule.


B. The refined sugars and sirups shall have been manufactured with the use of duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic sugar, or combinations thereof, within 3 years after the date on which designated sugar was received by the refiner, and shall have been exported within 5 years from the date of importation of the designated sugar.


C. All granulated sugar testing by the polariscope 99.5° and over shall be deemed hard refined sugar. All refined sugar testing by the polariscope less than 99.5° shall be deemed soft refined sugar. All “blackstrap,” “unfiltered sirup,” and “final molasses” shall be deemed sirup.


D. The imported duty-paid sugar selected by the refiner as the basis for the drawback claim (designated sugar) shall be of the same kind and quality as that used in the manufacture of the exported refined sugar or sirup and shall have been used within 3 years after the date on which it was received by the refiner. Duty-paid sugar which has been used at a plant of a refiner within 3 years after the date on which it was received by such refiner may be designated as the basis for the allowance of drawback on refined sugars or sirups manufactured at another plant of the same refiner.


E. For the purpose of distributing the drawback, relative values shall be established between hard refined (granulated) sugar, soft refined (various grades) sugar, and sirups at the time of separation. The entire period covered by an abstract shall be deemed the time of separation of the sugars and sirups covered by such abstract.


F. The sucrose allowance per pound on hard refined (granulated) sugar established by an abstract, as provided for in this general ruling, shall be applied to hard refined sugar commercially known as loaf, cut loaf, cube, pressed, crushed, or powdered sugar manufactured from the granulated sugar covered by the abstract.


G. The sucrose allowance per gallon on sirup established by an abstract, as provided for in this general ruling, shall be applied to sirup further advanced in value by filtration or otherwise, unless such sirup is the subject of a special manufacturing drawback ruling.


H. As to each lot of imported or domestic sugar used in the manufacture of refined sugar or sirup on which drawback is to be claimed, the raw stock records shall show the refiner's raw lot number, the number and character of the packages, the settlement weight in pounds, and the settlement polarization. Such records covering imported sugar shall show, in addition to the foregoing, the import entry number, date of importation, name of importing carrier, country of origin, the Government weight, and the Government polarization.


I. The melt records shall show the date of melting, the number of pounds of each lot of raw sugar melted, and the full analysis at melting.


J. There shall be kept a daily record of final products boiled showing the date of the melt, the date of boiling, the magma filling serial number, the number of the vacuum pan or crystallizer filling, the date worked off, and the sirup filling serial number.


K. The sirup manufacture records shall show the date of boiling, the period of the melt, the sirup filling serial number, the number of barrels in the filling, the magma filling serial number, the quantity of sirup, its disposition in tanks or barrels and the refinery serial manufacture number.


L. The refined sugar stock records shall show the refinery serial manufacture number, the period of the melt, the date of manufacture, the grade of sugar produced, its polarization, the number and kind of packages, and the net weight. When soft sugars are manufactured, the commercial grade number and quantity of each shall be shown.


M. Each lot of hard or soft refined sugar and each lot of sirup manufactured, regardless of the character of the containers or vessels in which it is packed or stored, shall be marked immediately with the date of manufacture and the refinery manufacture number applied to it in the refinery records provided for and shown in the abstract, as provided for in this general ruling, from such records. If all the sugar or sirup contained in any lot manufactured is not intended for exportation, only such of the packages as are intended for exportation need be marked as prescribed above, provided there is filed with the drawback office immediately after such marking a statement showing the date of manufacture, the refinery manufacture number, the number of packages marked, and the quantity of sugar or sirup contained therein. No drawback shall be allowed in such case on any sugar or sirup in excess of the quantity shown on the statement as having been marked. If any packages of sugar or sirup so marked are repacked into other containers, the new containers shall be marked with the marks which appeared on the original containers and a revised statement covering such repacking and remarking shall be filed with the drawback office. If sirups from more than one lot are stored in the same tank, the refinery records shall show the refinery manufacture number and the quantity of sirup from each lot contained in such tank.


N. An abstract from the foregoing records covering manufacturing periods of not less than 1 month nor more than 3 months, unless a different period shall have been authorized, shall be filed when drawback is to be claimed on any part of the refined sugar or sirup manufactured during such period. Such abstract shall be filed by each refiner with the drawback office where drawback claims are filed on the basis of this general ruling. Such abstract shall consist of: (1) A raw stock record (accounting for Refiner's raw lot No., Import entry No., Packages No. and kind, Pounds, Polarization, By whom imported or withdrawn, Date of importation, Date of receipt by refiner, Date of melt, Importing carrier, Country of origin); (2) A melt record [number of pounds in each lot melted] (accounting for Lot No. Pounds, and Polarization degrees and pounds sucrose); (3) Sirup stock records (accounting for Date of boiling, Refinery serial manufacture No., Quantity of sirup in gallons, and Pounds sucrose contained therein); (4) Refined sugar stock record (accounting for Refinery serial production No., Date of manufacture, Hard or soft refined, Polarization and No., Net weight in pounds); (5) Recapitulation (consisting of (in pounds): (a) sucrose in process at beginning of period, (b) sucrose melted during period, (c) sucrose in process at end of period, (d) sucrose used in manufacture, and (e) sucrose contained in manufacture, in which item (a) plus item (b), minus item (c), should equal item (d)); and (6) A statement as follows:

I further declare that the sugar or sirup specified therein was exported as stated in the entry.


T. General Statement. The refiner manufactures or produces for its own account. The refiner may manufacture or produce articles for the account of another or another manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce for the refiner's account under contract within the principal and agency relationship outlined in T.D.'s 55027(2) and 55207(1) (see § 191.9 of this part).


U. Waste. No drawback is payable on any waste which results from the manufacturing operation. Unless drawback claims are based on the “appearing in” method, records will be maintained to establish the value (or the lack of value), the quantity, and the disposition of any waste that results from manufacturing the exported articles. If no waste results, records to establish that fact will be maintained.


V. Loss or Gain. The refiner will maintain records showing the extent of any loss or gain in net weight or measurement of the sugar caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors.


W. Tradeoff. The use of any domestic merchandise acquired in exchange for imported merchandise that meets the same kind and quality requirements provided for in this general ruling shall be treated as use of the imported merchandise if no certificate of delivery is issued covering the imported merchandise (19 U.S.C. 1313(k)) upon compliance with the applicable regulations and rulings.


X. Procedures And Records Maintained. Records will be maintained to establish:


1. The identity and specifications of the designated merchandise;


2. The quantity of merchandise of the same kind and quality as the designated merchandise 
1 used to produce the exported articles; and 


3. That, within 3 years after receiving the designated merchandise at its factory, the refiner used the designated merchandise to produce articles. During the same 3-year period, the refiner produced 
2 the exported articles.


To obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the importation of the imported merchandise. Records establishing compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by Customs during business hours. Drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.


Y. General requirements. The refiner will:


1. Comply fully with the terms of this general ruling when claiming drawback;


2. Open its factory and records for examination at all reasonable hours by authorized Government officers;


3. Keep its drawback related records and supporting data for at least 3 years from the date of payment of any drawback claim predicated in whole or in part upon this general ruling;


4. Keep its letter of notification of intent to operate under this general ruling current by reporting promptly to the drawback office which liquidates its claims any changes in the information required by the General Instructions of this Appendix to be included therein (I. General Instructions, 1 through 9) or the corporate name or corporate organization by succession or reincorporation;


5. Keep a copy of this general ruling on file for ready reference by employees and require all officials and employees concerned to familiarize themselves with the provisions of this general ruling; and


6. Issue instructions to insure proper compliance with title 19, United States Code, section 1313, part 191 of the CBP Regulations and this general ruling.



1. The duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic steel used instead of the imported, duty-paid steel (or drawback products) will be interchangeable for manufacturing purposes with the duty-paid steel. To be interchangeable a steel must be able to be used in place of the substituted steel without any additional processing step in the manufacture of the article on which drawback is to be claimed.


2. Because the duty-paid steel (or drawback products) that is to be designated as the basis for drawback is dutiable according to its value, the amount of duty can vary with its size (gauge, width, or length) or composition (e.g., chrome content). If such variances occur, designation will be by “price extra”, and in no case will drawback be claimed in a greater amount than that which would have accrued to that steel used in manufacture of or appearing in the exported articles. Price extra is not available for coated or plated steel, covered in paragraph 5, *infra,* insofar as the coating or plating is concerned.


3. The duty-paid steel (or drawback products) will be so similar in quality to the steel used to manufacture the articles on which drawback will be claimed that the steel so used, if imported, would be classifiable in the same tariff subheading number and at the same rate of duty as the duty-paid imported steel.


4. Any fluctuation in market value caused by a factor other than quality does not affect drawback.


5. If the steel is coated or plated with a base metal, in addition to meeting the requirements for uncoated or unplated steel set forth in the parallel columns, the base-metal coating or plating on the duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic steel used in place of the duty-paid steel (or drawback products) will have the same composition and thickness as the coating or plating on the duty-paid steel. If the coated or plated duty-paid steel is within a SAE, AISI, ASTM specification, any duty-paid, duty-free, or domestic coated or plated steel covered by the same specification and grade (if two or more grades are in the specification) is considered to meet this criterion for “same kind and quality.”


The exported articles will have been manufactured in the United States using steels described in the parallel columns above.


The manufacturer or producer manufactures or produces for its own account. The manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce articles for the account of another or another manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce for the account of the manufacturer or producer under contract within the principal and agency relationship outlined in T.D.'s 55027(2) and 55207(1) (see § 191.9 of this part).


The steel described in the parallel columns will be used to manufacture or produce articles in accordance with § 191.2(q) of this part.


Not applicable.


No drawback is payable on any waste which results from the manufacturing operation. Unless the claim for drawback is based on the quantity of steel appearing in the exported articles, records will be maintained to establish the value (or the lack of value), the quantity, and the disposition of any waste that results from manufacturing the exported articles. If no waste results, records to establish that fact will be maintained.


The manufacturer or producer will maintain records showing the extent of any loss or gain in net weight or measurement of the steel caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors.


The use of any domestic merchandise acquired in exchange for imported merchandise that meets the same kind and quality specifications contained in the parallel columns of this general ruling shall be treated as use of the imported merchandise if no certificate of delivery is issued covering the imported merchandise (19 U.S.C. 1313(k)) upon compliance with the applicable regulations and rulings.


Records will be maintained to establish:


1. The identity and specifications of the designated merchandise;


2. The quantity of merchandise of the same kind and quality as the designated merchandise 
3 used to produce the exported articles;


3. That, within 3 years after receiving the designated merchandise at its factory, the manufacturer or producer used the merchandise to produce articles. During the same 3-year period, the manufacturer or producer produced 
4 the exported articles.


To obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the importation of the imported merchandise. Records establishing compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by Customs during business hours. Drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.


The inventory records of the manufacturer or producer will show how the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) and part 191 of the CBP Regulations will be met, as discussed under the heading “Procedures And Records Maintained”. If those records do not establish satisfaction of those legal requirements, drawback cannot be paid.


Drawback will be claimed on the quantity of steel used in producing the exported articles only if there is no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the manufacturing operation. Drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible steel that appears in the exported articles, regardless of whether there is waste, and no records of waste need be maintained. If there is valuable waste recovered from the manufacturing operation and records are kept which show the quantity and value of the waste from each lot of steel, drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible steel used to produce the exported articles less the amount of that steel which the value of the waste would replace.


The manufacturer or producer will:


1. Comply fully with the terms of this general ruling when claiming drawback;


2. Open its factory and records for examination at all reasonable hours by authorized Government officers;


3. Keep its drawback related records and supporting data for at least 3 years from the date of payment of any drawback claim predicated in whole or in part upon this general ruling;


4. Keep its letter of notification to operate under this general ruling current by reporting promptly to the drawback office which liquidates its claims any changes in the information required by the General Instructions of this Appendix to be included therein (I. General Instructions, 1 through 9) or the corporate name or corporate organization by succession or reincorporation;


5. Keep a copy of this general ruling on file for ready reference by employees and require all officials and employees concerned to familiarize themselves with the provisions of this general ruling; and


6. Issue instructions to insure proper compliance with title 19, United States Code, section 1313, part 191 of the CBP Regulations and this general ruling.


The sugars listed above test within three-tenths of a degree on the polariscope. Sugars in each column are completely interchangeable with the sugars directly opposite and designation will be made on this basis only. The designated sugar on which claims for drawback will be based will be so similar in quality to the sugar used in manufacture of the products exported with drawback that the sugar used in manufacture would, if imported, be subject to the same amount of duty paid on a like quantity of designated sugar. Differences in value resulting from factors other than quality, such as market fluctuation, will not affect the allowance of drawback.


Edible substances (including confectionery) and/or beverages and/or ingredients therefor.


The manufacturer or producer manufactures or produces for its own account. The manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce articles for the account of another or another manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce for the account of the manufacturer or producer under contract within the principal and agency relationship outlined in T.D.'s 55027(2) and 55207(1) (see § 191.9 of this part).


The sugars are subjected to one or more of the following operations to form the desired product(s):


1. Mixing with other substances,


2. Cooking with other substances


3. Boiling with other substances,


4. Baking with other substances,


5. Additional similar processes


Not applicable.


No drawback is payable on any waste which results from the manufacturing operation. Unless the claim for drawback is based on the quantity of sugar appearing in the exported articles, records will be maintained to establish the value (or the lack of value), the quantity, and the disposition of any waste that results from manufacturing the exported articles. If no waste results, records to establish that fact will be maintained.


The manufacturer or producer will maintain records showing the extent of any loss or gain in net weight or measurement of the sugar caused by atmospheric conditions, chemical reactions, or other factors.


The use of any domestic merchandise acquired in exchange for imported merchandise that meets the same kind and quality specifications contained in the parallel columns of this general ruling shall be treated as use of the imported merchandise if no certificate of delivery is issued covering the imported merchandise (19 U.S.C. 1313(k)) upon compliance with the applicable regulations and rulings.


Records will be maintained to establish:


1. The identity and specifications of the designated merchandise;


2. The quantity of merchandise of the same kind and quality as the designated merchandise 
2 used to produce the exported articles;


3. That, within 3 years after receiving the designated merchandise at its factory, the manufacturer or producer used the merchandise to produce articles. During the same 3-year period, the manufacturer or producer produced 
3 the exported articles. 


The inventory records of the manufacturer or producer will show how the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) and part 191 of the CBP Regulations will be met, as discussed under the heading “Procedures And Records Maintained”. If those records do not establish satisfaction of those legal requirements, drawback cannot be paid.


Drawback will be claimed on the quantity of sugar used in producing the exported articles only if there is no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the manufacturing operation. Drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible sugar that appears in the exported articles regardless of whether there is waste, and no records of waste need be maintained. If there is valuable waste recovered from the manufacturing operation and records are kept which show the quantity and value of the waste, drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible material used to produce the exported articles less the amount of that sugar which the value of the waste would replace.


The manufacturer or producer will:


1. Comply fully with the terms of this general ruling when claiming drawback;


2. Open its factory and records for examination at all reasonable hours by authorized Government officers;


3. Keep its drawback related records and supporting data for at least 3 years from the date of payment of any drawback claim predicated in whole or in part upon this general ruling;


4. Keep its letter of notification of intent to operate under this general ruling current by reporting promptly to the drawback office which liquidates its claims any changes in the information required by the General Instructions of this Appendix to be included therein (I. General Instructions, 1 through 9) or the corporate name or corporate organization by succession or reincorporation;


5. Keep a copy of this general ruling on file for ready reference by employees and require all officials and employees concerned to familiarize themselves with the provisions of this general ruling; and


6. Issue instructions to insure proper compliance with title 19, United States Code, section 1313, part 191 of the CBP Regulations and this general ruling.


Drawback may be allowed under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) upon the exportation of bleached, mercerized, printed, dyed, or redyed piece goods manufactured or produced by any one or a combination of the foregoing processes with the use of imported woven piece goods, subject to the following special requirements:


Imported
 merchandise or drawback products (woven piece goods) are used in the manufacture of the exported articles upon which drawback claims will be based.


Exported articles on which drawback will be claimed will be manufactured in the United States using imported merchandise or drawback products.


The manufacturer or producer manufactures or produces for its own account. The manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce articles for the account of another or another manufacturer or producer may manufacture or produce for the account of the manufacturer or producer under contract within the principal and agency relationship outlined in T.D.s 55027(2) and 55207(1) (see § 191.9 of this part).


The imported merchandise or drawback products will be used to manufacture or produce articles in accordance with § 191.2(q) of this part.


The piece goods used in manufacture or production under this general manufacturing drawback ruling may also be subjected to one or more finishing processes. Drawback shall not be allowed under this general manufacturing drawback ruling when the process performed results only in the restoration of the merchandise to its condition at the time of importation.


Not applicable.


Rag waste may be incurred. No drawback is payable on any waste which results from the manufacturing operation. Unless the claim for drawback is based on the quantity of merchandise appearing in the exported articles, the records of the manufacturer or producer will show the quantity of rag waste, if any, its value, and its disposition. If necessary to establish the quantity of merchandise (eligible piece goods) appearing in the exported articles, such waste records will also be kept. If no waste results, records will be maintained to establish that fact. In instances where rag waste occurs and it is impractical to account for the actual quantity of rag waste incurred, it may be assumed that such rag waste constituted 2% of the woven piece goods put into process.


Unless the claim for drawback is based on the quantity of merchandise appearing in the exported articles, the records of the manufacturer or producer will show the yardage lost by shrinkage or gained by stretching during manufacture, and the quantity of remnants resulting and of spoilage incurred, if any. If necessary to establish the quantity of merchandise (eligible piece goods) appearing in the exported articles, such records for shrinkage, gain, and spoilage will also be kept.


Records will be maintained to establish:


1. That the exported articles on which drawback is claimed were produced with the use of the imported merchandise; and


2. The quantity of imported merchandise 
2 used in producing the exported articles.


To obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after importation of the imported merchandise. Records establishing compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by Customs during business hours. Drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.


The inventory records of the manufacturer or producer will show how the drawback recordkeeping requirements set forth in 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) and part 191 of the CBP Regulations will be met, as discussed under the heading “Procedures and Records Maintained”. If those records do not establish satisfaction of those legal requirements, drawback cannot be paid.


The records of the manufacturer or producer shall show, as to each lot of piece goods manufactured or produced for exportation with benefit of drawback, the lot number and the date or inclusive dates of manufacture or production, the quantity, identity, and value of the imported (or drawback product) piece goods used, the condition in which imported or received (whether in the gray, bleached, dyed, or mercerized), the working allowance specified in the contract under which they are received, the process or processes applied thereto, and the quantity and description of the piece goods obtained. The records shall also show the yardage lost by shrinkage or gained by stretching during manufacture or production, and the quantity of remnants resulting and of spoilage incurred.


Drawback will be claimed on the quantity of merchandise used in producing the exported articles only if there is no waste or valueless or unrecovered waste in the manufacturing operation. Drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible merchandise that appears in the exported articles, regardless of whether there is waste, and no records of waste need be maintained. If there is valuable waste recovered from the manufacturing operation and records are kept which show the quantity and value of the waste, drawback may be claimed on the quantity of eligible material used to produce the exported articles, less the amount of that merchandise which the value of the waste would replace. (If remnants and/or spoilage occur during manufacture or production, the quantity of imported merchandise used shall be determined by deducting from the quantity of piece goods received and put into manufacture or production the quantity of such remnants and/or spoilage. The remaining quantity shall be reduced by the quantity thereof which the value of the rag waste, if any, would replace.)


The manufacturer or producer will:


1. Comply fully with the terms of this general ruling when claiming drawback;


2. Open its factory and records for examination at all reasonable hours by authorized Government officers;


3. Keep its drawback related records and supporting data for at least 3 years from the date of payment of any drawback claim predicated in whole or in part upon this general ruling;
