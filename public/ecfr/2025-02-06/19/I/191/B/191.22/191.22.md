# § 191.22   Substitution drawback.

(a) *General.* If imported, duty-paid, merchandise and any other merchandise (whether imported or domestic) of the same kind and quality are used in the manufacture or production of articles within a period not to exceed 3 years from the receipt of the imported merchandise by the manufacturer or producer of the articles, then upon the exportation, or destruction under Customs supervision, of any such articles, without their having been used in the United States prior to such exportation or destruction, drawback is provided for in § 313(b) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(b)), even though none of the imported, duty-paid merchandise may have been used in the manufacture or production of the exported or destroyed articles. The amount of drawback allowable cannot exceed that which would have been allowable had the merchandise used therein been the imported, duty-paid merchandise. For purposes of drawback of internal revenue tax imposed under Chapters 32, 38, 51, and 52 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (IRC), drawback granted on the export or destruction of substituted merchandise will be limited to the amount of taxes paid (and not returned by refund, credit, or drawback) on the substituted merchandise.


(b) *Use by same manufacturer or producer at different factory.* Duty-paid merchandise or drawback products used at one factory of a manufacturer or producer within 3 years after the date on which the material was received by the manufacturer or producer may be designated as the basis for drawback on articles manufactured or produced in accordance with these regulations at other factories of the same manufacturer or producer.


(c) *Designation.* A manufacturer or producer may designate any eligible imported merchandise or drawback product which it has used in manufacture or production.


(d) *Designation by successor; 19 U.S.C. 1313(s)*—(1) *General rule.* Upon compliance with the requirements in this section and under 19 U.S.C. 1313(s), a drawback successor as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section may designate merchandise or drawback product used by a predecessor before the date of succession as the basis for drawback on articles manufactured or produced by the successor after the date of succession.


(2) *Drawback successor.* A “drawback successor” is a manufacturer or producer to whom another entity (predecessor) has transferred, by written agreement, merger, or corporate resolution:


(i) All or substantially all of the rights, privileges, immunities, powers, duties, and liabilities of the predecessor; or


(ii) The assets and other business interests of a division, plant, or other business unit of such predecessor, provided that the value of the transferred assets and interests (realty, personalty, and intangibles, exclusive of the drawback rights) exceeds the value of such drawback rights, whether vested or contingent.


(3) *Certifications and required evidence*—(i) *Records of predecessor.* The predecessor or successor must certify that the successor is in possession of the predecessor's records which are necessary to establish the right to drawback under the law and regulations with respect to the merchandise or drawback product.


(ii) *Merchandise not otherwise designated.* The predecessor or successor must certify in an attachment to the claim, that the predecessor has not designated and will not designate, nor enable any other person to designate, such merchandise or product as the basis for drawback.


(iii) *Value of transferred property.* In instances in which assets and other business interests of a division, plant, or other business unit of a predecessor are transferred, the predecessor or successor must specify, and maintain supporting records to establish, the value of the drawback rights and the value of all other transferred property.


(iv) *Review by Customs.* The written agreement, merger, or corporate resolution, provided for in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and the records and evidence provided for in paragraph (d)(3) (i) through (iii) of this section, must be retained by the appropriate party(s) for 3 years from the date of payment of the related claim and are subject to review by Customs upon request.


(e) *Multiple products*—(1) *General.* Where two or more products are produced concurrently in a substitution manufacturing operation, drawback shall be distributed to each product in accordance with its relative value (see § 191.2(u)) at the time of separation.


(2) *Claims covering a manufacturing period.* Where the claim covers a manufacturing period rather than a manufacturing lot, the entire period covered by the claim is the time of separation of the products and the value per unit of product is the market value for the period (see § 191.2(u) of this part). Manufacturing periods in excess of one month may not be used without specific approval of Customs.


(3) *Recordkeeping.* Records shall be maintained showing the relative value of each product at the time of separation.
