# § 191.53   Restructuring of claims.

(a) *General.* Customs may require claimants to restructure their drawback claims in such a manner as to foster Customs administrative efficiency. In making this determination, Customs will consider the following factors:


(1) The number of transactions of the claimant (imports and exports);


(2) The value of the claims;


(3) The frequency of claims;


(4) The product or products being claimed; and


(5) For 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) and 1313(b) claims, the provisions, as applicable, of the general manufacturing drawback ruling or the specific manufacturing drawback ruling.


(b) *Exemption from restructuring; criteria.* In order to be exempt from a restructuring, a claimant must demonstrate an inability or impracticability in restructuring its claims as required by Customs and must provide a mutually acceptable alternative. Criteria used in such determination will include a demonstration by the claimant of one or more of the following:


(1) Complexities caused by multiple commodities or the applicable general manufacturing drawback ruling or the specific manufacturing drawback ruling;


(2) Variable and conflicting manufacturing and inventory periods (for example, financial, accounting and manufacturing records maintained are significantly different);


(3) Complexities caused by multiple manufacturing locations;


(4) Complexities caused by difficulty in adjusting accounting and inventory records (for example, records maintained—financial or accounting—are significantly different); and/or


(5) Complexities caused by significantly different methods of operation.
