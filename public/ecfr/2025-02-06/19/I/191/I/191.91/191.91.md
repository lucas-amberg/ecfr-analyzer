# § 191.91   Waiver of prior notice of intent to export.

(a) *General*—(1) *Scope.* The requirement in § 191.35 of this part for prior notice of intent to export merchandise which may be the subject of an unused merchandise drawback claim under § 313(j) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(j)), may be waived under the provisions of this section.


(2) *Effective date for claimants with existing approval.* For claimants approved for waiver of prior notice as of April 6, 1998, such approval of waiver of prior notice shall remain in effect, under the Customs Regulations in effect as of the time of the approval of waiver of prior notice, for a period of 1 year after April 6, 1998. The previously approved waiver of prior notice shall terminate at the end of such 1-year period unless the claimant applies for waiver of prior notice under this section. If a claimant approved for waiver of prior notice as of April 6, 1998 applies for waiver of prior notice under this section within such 1-year period, the claimant may continue to operate under its existing waiver of prior notice until Customs approves or denies the application for waiver of prior notice under this section, subject to the provisions in this section (see, in particular, paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section).


(3) *Limited successorship for waiver of prior notice.* When a claimant (predecessor) is approved for waiver of prior notice under this section and all of the rights, privileges, immunities, powers, duties and liabilities of the claimant are transferred by written agreement, merger, or corporate resolution to a successor, such approval of waiver of prior notice shall remain in effect for a period of 1 year after such transfer. The approval of waiver of prior notice shall terminate at the end of such 1-year period unless the successor applies for waiver of prior notice under this section. If such successor applies for waiver of prior notice under this section within such 1-year period, the successor may continue to operate under the predecessor's waiver of prior notice until Customs approves or denies the successor's application for waiver of prior notice under this section, subject to the provisions in this section (see, in particular, paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section).

Customs shall provide written notice, by registered or certified mail, of such a stay to the person for whom waiver of prior notice was approved. Customs shall specify the reason(s) for the stay in such written notice. The stay shall take effect 2 working days after the date the person signs the return post office receipt for the registered or certified mail. The stay shall remain in effect for the period specified in the written notice, or until such earlier date as Customs notifies the person for whom waiver of prior notice was approved in writing that the reason for the stay has been satisfied.

(g) *Appeal of denial or challenge to proposed revocation.* An appeal of a denial of an application under this section, or challenge to the proposed revocation of an approved application under this section, may be made by letter to the drawback office issuing the denial or proposed revocation and must be filed within 30 days of the date of denial or proposed revocation.
