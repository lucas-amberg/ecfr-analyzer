# § 192.12   Criteria for denial of applications requesting AES post-departure (Option 4) filing status; appeal procedures.

(a) *Approval process.* Applications for the option of filing export commodity information electronically through AES after the vessel has departed (Option 4 filing status) must be unanimously approved by Customs, Census and other participating government agencies. Disapproval by one of the participating agencies will cause rejection of the application.


(b) *Grounds for denial.* Customs may deny a participant's application for any of the following reasons:


(1) The applicant is not an exporter, as defined in the Census Regulations (15 CFR 30.7(d));


(2) The applicant has a history of non-compliance with export regulations (e.g., exporter has a history of late electronic submission of commodity records or a record of non-submission of required export documentation);


(3) The applicant has been indicted, convicted, or is currently under an investigation, wherein Customs has developed probable cause, for a felony involving any Customs law or any export law administered by another government agency; or


(4) The applicant has made or caused to be made in the “Letter of Intent”, a false or misleading statement or omission with respect to any material fact.


(c) *Notice of denial; appeal procedures.* Applicants will be notified of approval or denial in writing by Census. (Applicants whose applications are denied by other agencies must contact those agencies for their specific appeal procedures.) Applicants whose applications are denied by Customs will be provided with the specific reason(s) for non-selection. Applicants may challenge Customs decision by following the appeal procedure provided at § 192.13(b).
