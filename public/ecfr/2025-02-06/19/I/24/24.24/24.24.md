(6) Cargo entering the U.S. in bond for transportation and direct exportation to a foreign country, unless, with respect to cargo exported to Canada or Mexico;


(i) The Secretary of the Treasury determines that Canada or Mexico has imposed a substantially equivalent port use fee on commercial vessels or commercial cargo using ports of their countries; or


(ii) A study made pursuant to the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-662) finds that the fee is not likely to cause significant economic loss to a U.S. port or diversion of a significant amount of cargo to a port in a contiguous country.


(7) Cargo or vessels of the U.S. or any agency or instrumentality of the U.S.


(8) Cargo owned or financed by nonprofit organizations or cooperatives which is certified by the CBP as intended for use in humanitarian or development assistance overseas, including contiguous countries.


(i) The donated cargo is required to be certified as intended for use in humanitarian or development assistance overseas by CBP. Subsequent to payment of the fee, a refund request may be made by electronically submitting to CBP the Harbor Maintenance Fee Amended Quarterly Summary Report (CBP Form 350), as well as the Harbor Maintenance Fee Quarterly Summary Report (CBP Form 349) for the quarter covering the payment to which the refund request relates, using the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) via an Internet account established by the payer and located at *http://www.pay.gov.* In the alternative, the requisite forms may be mailed to the Office of Administration, Revenue Division, Customs and Border Protection, using the current address posted at Forms.CBP.gov. Upon request by CBP, the party requesting the refund must also submit to CBP, via mail, any supporting documentation deemed necessary by CBP to certify that the entity donating the cargo is a nonprofit organization or cooperative and that the cargo was intended for humanitarian or development assistance overseas (including contiguous countries). A description of the cargo listed in the shipping documents and a brief summary of the intended use of the goods, if such use in not reflected in the documents, are acceptable evidence for certification purposes. Approved HMF refund payments will be made via ACH to those payers who are enrolled in the ACH refund program; all others will receive HMF refund payments via mail.


(ii) Each nonprofit organization or cooperative claiming the exemption under this subpart must maintain documentation pertaining to the exemption for a period of 5 years. The documentation must be made available for inspection by CBP in accordance with the provisions of §§ 162.1a through 162.1i of this chapter.


(d) *Special rules*—(1) *Intraport.* The fee is not to be assessed on the mere movement of commercial cargo within a port.


(2) *Same vessel, same cargo.* If a fee is assessed when cargo is loaded on a vessel, the unloading of the same cargo from that vessel is not subject to the fee. If a fee is assessed when cargo is unloaded from a vessel, the reloading of the same cargo on that vessel is not subject to the fee.


(3) *De minimis for individual shipments.* The fee will not be assessed on loadings or unloadings of cargo in which:


(i) *For imported cargo:* The shipment would be entitled to be entered under informal entry procedures as provided for in § 143.21 of this chapter.


(ii) *For domestic cargo:* The value of the shipment does not exceed $1,000.


(4) *De minimis for quarterly payments.* Quarterly payment is not required if the total value of all shipments for which a fee was assessed for the quarter does not exceed $10,000.


(e) *Collections, supplemental payments, and refunds*—(1) *Domestic vessel movements*—(i) *Time and place of liability.* Subject to the exemptions and special rules of this section, when cargo is loaded on a commercial vessel at a port within the definition of this section to be transported between ports in the U.S. or is unloaded from a commercial vessel at a port within the definition of this section after having been transported between ports in the U.S., the shipper (the person or corporation who pays the freight) of that cargo is liable for the payment of the port use fee at the time of unloading. The fee will be imposed only once on a movement pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The fee is to be based upon the value of the cargo as determined by standard commercial documentation where such documentation is available. Otherwise, the value is to be determined under 19 U.S.C. 1401a as if it were imported merchandise. The Vessel Operation Report (Army Corps of Engineers Form 3925) is to be completed and submitted to the Army Corps of Engineers in accordance with the procedures set forth in 33 CFR Ch. II, part 207. The shipper's name, either the internal revenue service or social security number of the shipper and the tax exemption code (as it appears in the Vessel Operation Report instructions) claimed for the shipment are to be included on the Vessel Operation Report.


(ii) *Fee payment.* The shipper whose name appears on the Vessel Operation Report must pay all accumulated fees for which he is liable on a quarterly basis in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section by submitting to CBP a Harbor Maintenance Fee Quarterly Summary Report, CBP Form 349. The CBP Form 349 must either be submitted electronically to CBP using the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) via an Internet account established by the payer and located at *http://www.pay.gov* or, alternatively, mailed with a single check or money order payable to U.S. Customs and Border Protection to the Office of Administration, Revenue Division, Customs and Border Protection, using the current address posted at Forms.CBP.gov.


(2) *Import vessel movements*—(i) *Time and place of liability.* Subject to the exemptions and special rules of this section, when imported cargo is unloaded from a commercial vessel at a port within the definition of this section, and destined for either consumption, warehousing, or foreign trade zone admission, the importer of that cargo, or in the case of foreign trade zones, the person or corporation responsible for bringing merchandise into the zone, is liable for the payment of the port use fee at the time of unloading. The fee is based on the CBP appraised value of the shipment pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1401a, the same basis as that used for duty payment. The fee will be collected on all formal entries, including warehouse entries and temporary importation under bond entries, and admissions into foreign trade zones.


(ii) *Fee payment.* The port use fee on unloading of imported cargo must be paid in accordance with the normal CBP collection procedures set forth in §§ 24.1 and 141.1 of this chapter, except as provided for merchandise admitted into foreign trade zones in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section. The CBP Entry Summary Form (CBP Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent), is to be completed with the amount of the fee shown and identified on the form. The fee must be paid by the importer by adding it to any normal duty, tax or fee payable at the time of formal entry processing.


(iii) *Foreign Trade Zones.* In cases where imported cargo is unloaded from a commercial vessel at a port within the definition of this section and admitted into a foreign trade zone, the applicant for admission (the person or corporation responsible for bringing merchandise into the zone) who becomes liable for the fee at the time of unloading pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, must pay all fees for which he is liable on a quarterly basis in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section by submitting to CBP a Harbor Maintenance Fee Quarterly Summary Report, CBP Form 349. The CBP Form 349 must either be submitted electronically to CBP using the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) via an Internet account established by the payer and located at *http://www.pay.gov* or, alternatively, mailed with a single check or money order payable to U.S. Customs and Border Protection to the Office of Administration, Revenue Division, Customs and Border Protection, using the current address posted at Forms.CBP.gov. Fees must be paid for all shipments unloaded and admitted to the zone, or in the case of direct deliveries under §§ 146.39 and 146.40 of this chapter, unloaded and received in the zone under the bond of the foreign trade zone operator.


(3) *Passengers*—(i) *Time and place of liability.* Subject to the exemptions and special rules of this section, when a passenger boards or disembarks a commercial vessel at a port within the definition of this section, the operator of that vessel is liable for the payment of the port use fee. The fee is to be based upon the value of the actual charge for transportation paid by the passenger or on the prevailing charge for comparable service if no actual charge is paid. The vessel operator on each cruise is liable only once for the port use fee for each passenger.


(ii) *Fee payment.* The operator of the passenger-carrying vessel must pay the accumulated fees for which he is liable on a quarterly basis in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section by submitting to CBP a Harbor Maintenance Fee Quarterly Summary Report, CBP Form 349. The CBP Form 349 must either be submitted electronically to CBP using the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) via an Internet account established by the payer and located at *http://www.pay.gov* or, alternatively, mailed with a single check or money order payable to U.S. Customs and Border Protection to the Office of Administration, Revenue Division, Customs and Border Protection, using the current address posted at Forms.CBP.gov.


(4) *Refunds and supplemental payments*—(i) *General.* To make supplemental payments or seek refunds of harbor maintenance fees paid relative to the unloading of imported cargo, the procedures applicable to supplemental payments or refunds of ordinary duties must be followed. To seek refunds of quarterly-paid harbor maintenance fees pertaining to export movements, the procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section must be followed. To make supplemental payments on any quarterly-paid harbor maintenance fee or seek refunds of quarterly-paid harbor maintenance fees pertaining to other than export movements, the procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(4)(iii) must be followed. 


(ii) *Time limit for refund requests.* A refund request must be received by CBP within one year of the date the fee for which the refund is sought was paid to CBP or, in the case of fees paid relative to imported merchandise admitted into a foreign trade zone and subsequently withdrawn from the zone under 19 U.S.C. 1309, within one year of the date of withdrawal from the zone. 


(iii) *For fees paid on other than export movements.* If a supplemental payment is made for any quarterly-paid harbor maintenance fee or a refund is requested relative to quarterly fee payments previously made regarding the loading or unloading of domestic cargo, the unloading of cargo destined for admission into a foreign trade zone, or the boarding or disembarking of passengers, the refund request or supplemental payment must be accompanied by a Harbor Maintenance Fee Amended Quarterly Summary Report, CBP Form 350, along with a copy of the Harbor Maintenance Fee Quarterly Summary Report, CBP Form 349, for the quarter(s) covering the payment to which the refund request or supplemental payment relates. A request for a refund must specify the grounds for the refund. Supplemental payments and HMF refund requests, accompanied by the requisite CBP Forms 350 and 349 and, if applicable, supporting documentation, must be submitted electronically to CBP using the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) via an Internet account established by the payer and located at *http://www.pay.gov* or, alternatively, mailed to the Office of Administration, Revenue Division, Customs and Border Protection, using the current address posted at Forms.CBP.gov. If a supplemental payment is mailed, a single check or money order payable to U.S. Customs and Border Protection must be attached to each CBP Form 350. Approved HMF refund payments will be made via ACH to those payers who are enrolled in the ACH refund program; all others will receive HMF refund payments via mail.


(iv) *For fees paid on export movements.* CBP will process refund requests relative to fee payments previously made regarding the loading of cargo for export as follows: 


(A) *Refund request.* For export fee payments made prior to July 1, 1990, the exporter (the name that appears on the SED or equivalent documentation authorized under 15 CFR 30.39(b)) or its agent must submit a letter of request for a refund specifying the grounds for the refund and identifying the specific payments made. The letter must be accompanied by the proof of payment set forth in paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(C) of this section. For export fee payments made on or after July 1, 1990, supporting documentation is not required with the refund request. For these payments, the request must specify the grounds for the refund, identify the quarters for which a refund is sought, and contain the following additional information: the exporter's name, address, and employer identification number (EIN); the name and EIN of any freight forwarder or other agent that made export fee payments on the exporter's behalf; and a name, telephone number, and facsimile number of a contact person. Refund requests must either be submitted electronically to CBP using the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) via an Internet account established by the payer and located at *http://www.pay.gov* or, alternatively, mailed to the Office of Administration, Revenue Division, Customs and Border Protection, using the current address posted at Forms.CBP.gov. Approved HMF refund payments will be made using the ACH to those payers who are enrolled in the ACH refund program; all others will receive HMF refund payments via mail.


(B) *Refund procedure*—(*1*) *Processing order; power of attorney.* Generally, a properly filed refund request will be processed in the chronological order of its receipt. A refund request filed on behalf of an exporter by an agent other than a freight forwarder must be supported by a power of attorney or letter signed by the exporter authorizing the representation. A refund request filed by an agent other than a freight forwarder that lacks a power of attorney or authorization letter will not be processed unless one or the other is submitted. A refund request filed by a freight forwarder does not require a power of attorney or authorization letter to be processed; however, if CBP has not received a power of attorney or authorization letter for an exporter covered in a freight forwarder's refund request and that exporter has filed a separate refund request on its own behalf, that freight forwarder's entire refund request will be removed from the chronological processing order and processed after the processing of all exporter refund requests is completed. 


(*2*) *HMT Payment Report and Report/Certification.* In processing a request for a refund, CBP will conduct a search of its records (CBP electronic database and paper document sources) and produce for issuance to the exporter (or its agent, as appropriate) a “Harbor Mantenance Tax Payment Report” (HMT Payment Report) that lists all payments reflected in those records for the entire period the fee was in effect. CBP will also produce for issuance to the exporter a “Harbor Maintenance Tax Refund Report and Certification” (Report/Certification) that lists all payments supported by paper documentation, either retained by CBP (relative to payments made on and after July 1, 1990) or submitted by the exporter with its refund request (relative to payments made at any time the fee was in effect). Where a refund request was filed on the exporter's behalf by an agent other than a freight forwarder, a power of attorney or authorization letter must be filed with CBP before CBP will issue these reports. The Report/Certification sets forth the total amount of the refund that CBP believes it owes the exporter for the payments listed in that report (minus any previous refunds). Pre-July 1, 1990, payments listed in the HMT Payment Report for which paper documentation has not been provided by the exporter will not be listed in the Report/Certification. The exporter has 120 days from the date the HMT Payment Report and the Report/Certification are issued (the 120-day period) to sign and return to CBP the Report/Certification in order to receive the refund set forth in that report and/or to submit to CBP a request for a Revised Report/Certification. Where the exporter chooses to receive the refund set forth in the Report/Certification, the exporter must sign and return the report to CBP. CBP will issue the refund upon receipt of the signed report. 


(*3*) *Revised Report/Certification.* A request for a Revised Report/Certification must be accompanied by documentation to support any payments not listed in the Report/Certification or corrections to listed payments. See paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(C) of this section regarding acceptable documentation. If an exporter (or its agent, as appropriate) both signs and returns to CBP a Report/Certification and requests a Revised Report/Certification, CBP will not, when reviewing the request for a Revised Report/Certification, approve for refund any corrections to the payments that were listed in the signed Report/Certification; CBP will, however, in that circumstance, consider approving any additional payments that were not listed in the signed Report/Certification. If an exporter does not sign and return to CBP a Report/Certification, but requests a Revised Report/Certification, CBP will consider approving for refund corrections to the payments listed in the Report/Certification and additional payments. Where the exporter requests a Revised Report/Certification, CBP will review the documentation submitted with the request, make a determination, and, within 60 days of the request's receipt, issue a Revised Report/Certification that lists all payments approved for refund and the total amount of the refund owed. In order to receive the refund set forth in a Revised Report/Certification, the exporter must sign and return it to CBP. CBP will issue the refund upon its receipt of the signed report. An exporter, within the 120-day period, may submit additional requests for a Revised Report/Certification, with appropriate documentation, to cover any payments not approved for refund in a Revised Report/Certification previously issued by CBP. 


(*4*) *Protest.* For purposes of filing a protest under 19 U.S.C. 1514 (and 19 CFR part 174), unless issuance of a Revised Report/Certification is pending, any payments not approved for refund in a Report/Certification or a Revised Report/Certification issued by CBP within the 120-day period will be considered denied as of the date the period expires; a protest covering such payments must be filed within 180 days of that date. For any payments not approved for refund in a Revised Report/Certification issued after expiration of the 120-day period, a protest may be filed within 180 days of that report's issuance. 


(*5*) *Significance of signed Report/Certification and Revised Report/Certification.* A Report/Certification or Revised Report/Certification must be signed by an officer of the company duly authorized to bind the company or by an agent (such as a broker or freight forwarder) representing the exporter in seeking a refund under this section. A Report/Certification or Revised Report/Certification signed by the exporter or its agent and received by CBP constitutes the exporter's agreement that the amount of the refund set forth in the report is accurate and CBP's payment of that refund amount is in full accord and satisfaction of all payments approved for refund in the report. The signed Report/Certification or Revised Report/Certification also represents the exporter's release, waiver, and abandonment of all claims, excluding claims for interest, against the Government, its officers, agents, and assigns for costs, attorney fees, expenses, compensatory damages, and exemplary damages arising out of the payments approved for refund in the report. When an agent, including a freight forwarder, signs a Report/Certification or Revised Report/ Certification on behalf of an exporter(s), the agent certifies that it is acting on the exporter's behalf and will use due diligence to forward the refund to the exporter, and, in the event the agent does not forward the refund to the exporter, will notify CBP and return the refund to CBP within one year of its receipt of the refund. Upon receipt of the signed Report/Certification or Revised Report/Certification, CBP releases, waives, and abandons all claims other than fraud against the exporter, its officers, agents, or employees arising out of all payments approved for refund in the report. 


(C) *Documentation.* For payments made prior to July 1, 1990, supporting documentation is required to obtain a refund and must be submitted in accordance with paragraphs (e)(4)(iv)(A) and/or (B)(*3*) of this section. For payments made on and after July 1, 1990, supporting documentation is not required to obtain a refund, unless the exporter seeks to prove corrections of payments listed in the Report/Certification (if the exporter did not sign and return it to CBP) and/or additional payments not listed in a Report/Certification, in accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(B)(*3*) of this section. The supporting documentation that CBP will accept as establishing entitlement to a refund, whether submitted with a refund request or a request for a Revised Report/Certification, is whichever of the following documents CBP accepted with the payment at the time it was made: a copy of the Export Vessel Movement Summary Sheet; where an Automated Summary Monthly Shipper's Export Declaration was filed, a copy of a letter containing the exporter's identification, its employer identification number (EIN), the Census Bureau reporting symbol, and, the quarter for which the payment was made; or a copy of a Harbor Maintenance Fee Quarterly Summary Report, CBP Form 349, for the quarter covering the refund requested. CBP also will consider other documentation offered as proof of payment of the fee, such as cancelled checks and/or affidavits from exporters attesting to the fact that all quarterly harbor maintenance tax payments made by the exporter were made exclusively for exports, and will accept that other documentation as establishing entitlement for a refund only if it clearly proves the payments were made for export harbor maintenance fees in the amounts sought to be refunded and were made by the party requesting the refund or the party on whose behalf the refund was requested. 


(f) *Quarterly payments.* All quarterly payments required by this section must be received no later than 31 days after the close of the quarter being paid. Quarterly periods end on the last day of March, June, September, and December.


(g) *Maintenance of records.* Each importer, applicant for admission of cargo into a foreign trade zone, shipper and cruise vessel operator affected by this section must maintain all such documentation necessary for CBP to verify the accuracy of fee computations and to otherwise determine compliance under the law. Such documentation must be maintained for a period of 5 years from the date of fee calculation. The affected parties must advise the Director, Revenue Division, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, at the current address posted at Forms.CBP.gov, of the name, address, email and telephone number of a responsible officer who is able to verify any records required to be maintained under this paragraph. The Director, Revenue Division, must be promptly notified of any changes in the identifying information submitted. The records must be maintained and made available for inspection, copying, reproduction or other official use by CBP in accordance with the provisions of part 163 of this chapter.


(h) *Penalties/liquidated damages for failure to pay harbor maintenance fee and file summary sheet*—(1) *Amount of penalty or damages.* Any party (including the importer, or shipper) who fails to pay the harbor maintenance fee and file the summary sheet at the time specified by regulation will incur a penalty equal to the amount of liquidated damages assessable for late filing of an entry summary pursuant to the provisions of § 142.15 of this chapter. An importer will be liable for payment of liquidated damages under the basic importation and entry bond, for failure to pay the harbor maintenance fee, as provided in such bond.


(2) *Application for relief.* The party must follow the procedures set forth in part 171 of this chapter in filing an application for relief. Any application to cancel liquidated damages incurred must be made in accordance with part 172 of this chapter.


(3) *Mitigation.* Any penalty assessed under this provision will be mitigated in a manner consistent with guidelines relating to cancellation of claims for liquidated damages for late filing of entry summaries. Any liquidated damages assessed under this provision will be mitigated in a manner consistent with guidelines published by the authority of the Commissioner of CBP for cancellation of claims for untimely payment of estimated duties, taxes and charges.


(i) *Privacy Act notice.* Whenever an identification number is requested on the summary sheets provided for in paragraph (e) of this section, the disclosure of the social security number is mandatory when an internal revenue service number is not disclosed. Identification numbers are solicited under the authority of Executive Order 9397 and Pub. L. 99-662. The identification number provides unique identification of the party liable for the payment of the harbor maintenance fee. The number will be used to compare the information on the summary sheets with information submitted to the government on other forms required in the course of shipping or importing merchandise, which contain the identification number, *e.g.,* Vessel Operation Report, to verify that the information submitted is accurate and current. Failure to disclose an identification number may cause a penalty pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section. The above information is set forth pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-579).
