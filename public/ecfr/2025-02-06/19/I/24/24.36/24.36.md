# ยง 24.36   Refunds of excessive duties, taxes, etc.

(a) When it is found upon, or prior to, liquidation or reliquidation of an entry or reconciliation that a refund of excessive duties, taxes, fees or interest (at the rate determined in accordance with ยง 24.3a(c)(1)) is due, a refund shall be prepared in the name of the person to whom the refund is due, as determined under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. If an authority to mail checks to someone other than the payee, Customs Form 4811, is on file, the address of the payee shall be shown as in care of the address of the authorized persons. If a power of attorney is on file, the address of the payee may be shown as in care of the address of such attorney, if requested. A Form 4811 received by Customs will not be effective if a Customs transaction requiring the use of the owner's importer number has not been made within 3 years from the date the Form 4811 was filed or if there is no unliquidated entry on file to which such number is to be associated. For purposes of this section:


(1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iii) of this section, the refund shall include interest on the excess moneys deposited with Customs, and such interest shall accrue from the date the duties, taxes, fees or interest were deposited or, in a case in which a proper claim is filed under 19 U.S.C. 1520(d) and subpart D of Part 181 of this chapter, from the date such claim is filed, to the date of liquidation or reliquidation of the applicable entry or reconciliation. An example follows:


(i) If an additional deposit of duties, taxes, fees or interest was made prior to liquidation or reliquidation and if any portion of that additional deposit was in excess of the amount required to be deposited, in addition to any other interest accrued under this paragraph (a)(1), the refund also shall include interest accrued on the excess additional deposit from the date of the additional deposit to the date of liquidation or reliquidation of the applicable entry or reconciliation. An example follows:


(ii) In the case of a refund of duties, taxes, fees or interest made prior to liquidation, such a refund will include only principal amounts and not any interest thereon. Interest on such principal amounts will be computed at the time of liquidation or reliquidation and shall accrue as follows:


(A) Interest shall only accrue on the amount refunded from the date the duties, taxes, fees or interest were deposited to the date of the refund if the amount refunded is determined upon liquidation or reliquidation of the applicable entry or reconciliation to constitute the true excess amount deposited with Customs. An example follows:


(B) If the amount refunded is determined upon liquidation or reliquidation of the applicable entry or reconciliation to constitute less than the true excess amount deposited with Customs, in addition to any other interest accrued under this paragraph (a)(1), interest also shall accrue on the remaining excess deposit from the date the duties, taxes, fees or interest were deposited to the date of liquidation or reliquidation. An example follows:


(C) If an entry or reconciliation is determined upon liquidation or reliquidation to involve both an initial underpayment and an additional excess deposit, interest in each case shall be computed separately and the resulting amounts shall be netted for purposes of determining the final amount of interest to be reflected in the refund. An example follows:


(D) If the amount refunded or any portion thereof exceeds the amount properly refundable as determined upon liquidation or reliquidation of the applicable entry or reliquidation, the excess amount refunded shall be treated as an underpayment of duties, taxes, fees or interest on which interest shall accrue as provided in ยง 24.3a.


(2) A refund determined to be due upon liquidation or reliquidation, including a refund consisting only of interest that has accrued in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, shall be paid within 30 days of the date of liquidation or reliquidation of the applicable entry or reconciliation.


(3) If a refund, including any interest thereon, is not paid in full within the applicable 30-day period specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the refund shall be considered delinquent thereafter and interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance by 30-day periods until the full balance is paid. However, no interest will accrue during the 30-day period in which the refund is paid.


(b) Refunds of excessive duties, taxes, fees or interest shall be certified for payment to the importer of record unless a transferee of the right to withdraw merchandise from bonded warehouse is entitled to receive the refund under section 557(b), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, or an owner's declaration has been filed in accordance with section 485(d), Tariff Act of 1930, or a surety submits evidence of payment to Customs, upon default of the principal, of amounts previously determined to be due on the same entry or transaction. The certification of a refund for payment to a nominal consignee may be made prior to the expiration of the 90-day period within which an owner's declaration may be filed as prescribed in section 485(d) of the Tariff Act, provided the nominal consignee waives in writing his right to file such declaration. If an owner's declaration has been duly filed, the refund shall be certified for payment to the actual owner who executed the declaration, except that, irrespective of whether an owner's declaration has been filed, refunds shall be certified for payment to a transferee provided for in section 557(b), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, if the moneys with respect to which the refund was allowed were paid by such transferee. If a surety submits evidence of payment to Customs, upon default of the principal, for an amount previously determined to be due on an entry or transaction the refund shall be certified to that surety up to the amount paid by it or shall be applied to other obligations of the surety.


(c) If the nominal consignee has become bankrupt, refunds of duties, taxes, fees or interest on merchandise entered in the name of such nominal consignee for the account of the actual owner shall be withheld from payment pending the receipt of a claim therefor and the establishment of rights thereto, unless the declaration of the actual owner has been filed with the port director under section 485(d), Tariff Act of 1930.

(9) The tax was paid or collected on a greater quantity of imported articles than that actually imported and the fact of the deficiency is established to the port directors' satisfaction before liquidation of the entry becomes final; or




(10) For alcohol excise taxes imposed under the Internal Revenue Code for goods entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or before December 31, 2022, the refund of tax is claimed pursuant to the assignment of a reduced tax rate or tax credit to an importer by a foreign producer in accordance with CBP implementation of sections 13801-13808 of Public Law 115-97 (December 22, 2017), as amended.
