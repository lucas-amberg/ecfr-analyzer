# § 24.4   Optional method for payment of estimated import taxes on alcoholic beverages upon entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption.

(a) *Application to defer.* An importer, including a transferee of alcoholic beverages in a Customs bonded warehouse who wishes to pay on a semi-monthly basis the estimated import taxes on alcoholic beverages entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption by him during such a period may apply by letter to the Center director, either at a port of entry or electronically. If the importer desires the additional privilege of depositing estimated tax payments on an extended deferred basis, it must be specifically requested. An importer who receives approval from the Center director to defer such payments may, however, continue to pay the estimated import taxes due at the time of entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption.


(b) *Deferred payment periods.* A period shall commence on October 24 and run through October 31, 1965; thereafter the periods shall run from the 1st day of each month through the 15th day of that month, and from the 16th day of each month through the last day of that month. An importer may begin the deferral of payments of estimated tax to a Customs port in the first deferral period beginning after the date of the written approval by the Center director. An importer may use the deferred payment system until the Center director advises such importer that he is no longer eligible to defer the payment of such taxes.


(c) *Content of application and supporting documents.* (1) An importer must state his estimate of the largest amount of taxes to be deferred in any semimonthly period based on the largest amount of import taxes on alcoholic beverages deposited with CBP in such a period during the year preceding his application. He must also identify any existing bond or bonds that he has on file with CBP and shall submit in support of his application the approval of the surety on his bond or bonds to the use of the procedure and to the increase of such bond or bonds to such larger amount or amounts as may be found necessary by the Center director.


(2) Each application must include a declaration in substantially the following language:


(d) *Use of deferred payment method.* (1) The Center director will notify the importer, or his authorized agent if requested, of approval.


(2) An importer who has received approval to make deferred payments retains the option of deferring or depositing the estimated tax on imported alcoholic beverages until the entry or withdrawal is presented to the cashier for payment of estimated duties. At the time the importer presents his entry or withdrawal for consumption to the cashier together with the estimated duty, he must either pay the estimated tax or indicate on the entry or withdrawal that he elects to defer the tax payment.


(e) *Tax deferment procedure.* If the importer elects to defer the tax payments, he shall enter on each copy of the entry or withdrawal the words “Tax Payment Deferred,” adjacent to the amount shown on the documents as estimated taxes, before presentation to the cashier.


(f) *Payment procedure*—(1) *Billing.* Each importer who has deferred tax payments on imported alcoholic beverages will be billed on Customs Form 6084, United States Customs Service Bill, at the end of each tax deferred period for all taxes deferred during the period. Each bill will identify each tax amount deferred and the related entry numbers. These bills must be paid in fully by the last day of the next succeeding deferral period.


(2) *Interest on overdue accounts.* When any bill for deferred taxes is not paid within the period specified in subparagraph (f)(1) of this section, interest thereon from the date following the end of the specified period to the date of payment of the bill shall be assessed, collected, and paid in the same manner as the basic tax. The rate of interest to be assessed shall be 7 percent per annum or such other rate as is established by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 6621(b).


(g) *Restrictions on deferring tax deposits.* An importer may not on one entry, or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption, deposit part of the estimated tax and defer the balance of the tax. The estimated tax on each entry or withdrawal must be either fully paid or deferred.


(h) *Termination of deferred payment privilege.* (1) When any bill on Customs Form 6084 for deferred taxes is not paid within the period specified in paragraph (f) of this section, a demand for payment shall be made to the surety on the importer's bond. If in the opinion of the customs officer concerned such failure to make timely payment of estimated deferred taxes warrants the withdrawal of the tax deferral privilege, he will advise the importer of the withdrawal of such privilege. In all instances of failure to pay timely the deferred taxes on alcoholic beverages withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, further withdrawals from the warehouse entry on which the tax is delinquent will be refused until payment is made of the amount delinquent.


(2) The termination at any port of the tax deferral privilege for failure to pay timely any deferred estimated tax shall be at the discretion of the Customs officer concerned. Termination of the privilege for any other reason shall be subject to the approval of the Commissioner of Customs. Notice of termination of the tax deferral privilege at any port will be disseminated to all other Customs ports.


(3) Renewal of the tax deferral privilege after it has been withdrawn at any port may be made only upon approval of the Commissioner of Customs.


(i) *Duration of deferred payment privilege.* The deferred payment privilege once approved by the port director or Center director before January 19, 2017, or the Center director on or after January 19, 2017, will remain in effect until terminated under the provisions of paragraph (h) or the importer or surety requests termination.


(j) *Entries for consumption or warehouse after an importer is delinquent.* An importer who is delinquent in paying deferred taxes may make entries for consumption or for warehousing, or withdrawals for consumption from warehouse entries on which no delinquency exists, upon deposit of all estimated duties or taxes.


(k) *Rate of tax.* The estimated taxes must be paid on the basis of the rates in effect upon entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption, unless in accordance with section 315 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, another date is applicable and not on the basis of the rates of tax in effect on the date deferred payment is made.
