# § 4.63   Outward cargo declaration; Electronic Export Information (EEI).

(a) No vessel will be cleared directly for a foreign port, or for a foreign port by way of another domestic port or other domestic ports (see § 4.87(b)), unless there has been filed with the appropriate CBP officer at the port from which clearance is being sought:


(1) A Cargo Declaration Outward With Commercial Forms, CBP Form 1302A. Copies of bills of lading or equivalent commercial documents relating to all cargo encompassed by the manifest must be attached in such manner as to constitute one document, together with a Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement, CBP Form 1300, and EEI as are required by pertinent regulations of the Bureau of the Census, Department of Commerce; or


(2) An incomplete Cargo Declaration as provided for in § 4.75.


(b) Except as hereafter stated, the Internal Transaction Number (ITN) of the Electronic Export Information (EEI) covering each shipment for which EEI is required must be shown on the Cargo Declaration Outward With Commercial Forms, CBP Form 1302A, in the marginal column headed “B/L No.” If EEI is not required for a shipment, a notation must be made on the Cargo Declaration Outward With Commercial Forms (CBP Form 1302A) describing the basis for the exemption or exclusion using the reference number found in the Census Bureau's Foreign Trade Regulations (see 15 CFR part 30, appendix B) where the particular exemption or exclusion is provided.


(c) The following minimal information must be included on the Cargo Declaration Outward With Commercial Forms, CBP Form 1302A (other information required to be on a CBP Form 1302A as shown on the form itself must also be included thereon) or on attached copies of bills of lading or equivalent commercial documents:


(1) Name and address of shipper;


(2) Description of the cargo (see paragraph (d) of this section);


(3) Number of packages and gross weight (see paragraph (d) of this section);


(4) Name of vessel or carrier;


(5) Port of exit (this shall be the port where the merchandise is loaded on the vessel); and


(6) Port of destination (this shall be the foreign port of discharge of the merchandise).


(d) If the bills of lading or equivalent commercial documents attached to the CBP Form 1302A show on their face the cargo information required by columns 6, 7, and either column 8 or 9, of the CBP Form 1302A, that information need not be shown again on the CBP Form 1302A. However, in that case, the cargo information must be incorporated by a suitable reference on the face of the CBP Form 1302A such as “Cargo as per attached commercial documents.”


(e) For each shipment to be exported under an entry or withdrawal for exportation or for transportation and exportation, the Cargo Declaration Outward With Commercial Forms, CBP Form 1302A, or commercial document attached to the Cargo Declaration and made a part thereof in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, must clearly show for such shipment the number, date, and class of such customs entry or withdrawal (i.e., T. & E., Wd. T. & E., I. E., Wd. Ex., or Wd. T., as applicable) and the name of the port where the merchandise is laden for exportation.


(f) CBP officers will accept a Cargo Declaration Outward With Commercial Forms, CBP Form 1302A, covering containerized or palletized cargo which indicates by the use of appropriate words of qualification (see § 4.7a(c)(3)) that the declaration has been prepared on the basis of information furnished by the shipper.
