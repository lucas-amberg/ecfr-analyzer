(2) The following nations have been found to extend similar reciprocal privileges in respect to the other articles mentioned in paragraph (a) of this section:


(c) Any Cargo Declaration, Customs Form 1302, required to be filed under this part by any foreign vessel shall describe any article mentioned in paragraph (a) of this section laden aboard and transported from one United States port to another, giving its identifying number or symbol, if any, or such other identifying data as may be appropriate, the names of the shipper and consignee, and the destination. The Cargo Declaration shall also include a statement (1) that the articles specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are owned or leased by the owner or operator of the transporting vessel and are transported for his use in handing his cargo in foreign trade; or (2) that the stevedoring equipment and material specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is owned or leased by the owner or operator of the transporting vessel, or is owned or leased by the stevedoring company contracting for the lading or unlading of that vessel, and is transported without charge for his use in handling his cargo in foreign trade. If the director of the port of lading is satisfied that there will be sufficient control over the coastwise transportation of the article without identifying it by number or symbol or such other identifying data on the Cargo Declaration, he may permit the use of a Cargo Declaration that does not include such information provided the Cargo Declaration includes a statement, that the director of the port of unlading will be presented with a statement at the time of entry of the vessel that will list the identifying number or symbol or other appropriate identifying data for the article to be unladen at that port. Applicable penalties under section 584, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1584), shall be assessed for violation of this paragraph.
