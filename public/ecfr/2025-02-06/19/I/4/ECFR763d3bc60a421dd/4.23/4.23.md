# ยง 4.23   Certificate of payment and cash receipt.

Upon each payment of tonnage tax or light money, the master of the vessel shall be given a certificate on Customs Form 1002 on which the control number of the cash receipt (Customs Form 368 or 368A) upon which payment was recorded shall be written. This certificate shall constitute the official evidence of such payment and shall be presented upon each entry during the tonnage year to establish the date of commencement of the tonnage year and to insure against overpayment. In the absence of the certificate, evidence of payment of tonnage tax shall be obtained from the port director to whom the payment was made.
