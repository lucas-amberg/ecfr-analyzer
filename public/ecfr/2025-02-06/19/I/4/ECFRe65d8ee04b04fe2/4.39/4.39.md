# ยง 4.39   Stores and equipment of vessels and crews' effects; unlading or lading and retention on board.

(a) The provisions of ยง 4.30 relating to unlading under a permit on Customs Form 3171 are applicable to the unlading of articles, other than cargo or baggage, which have been laden on a vessel outside the Customs territory of the United States, regardless of the trade in which the vessel may be engaged at the time of unlading, except that such provisions do not apply to such articles which have already been entered.


(b) Any articles other than cargo or baggage landed for delivery for consumption in the United States shall be treated in the same manner as other imported articles. A notation as to the landing of such articles, together with the number of the entry made therefor, shall be made on the vessel's store list, but such notation shall not subject the articles to the requirement of being included in a post entry to the manifest.


(c) Bags or dunnage constituting equipment of a vessel may be landed temporarily and reladen on such vessel under Customs supervision without entry.


(d) Articles claimed to be sea or ships' stores which are in excess of the reasonable requirements of the vessel on which they are found shall be treated as cargo of such vessel.


(e) Under section 446, Tariff Act of 1930, port directors may permit narcotic drugs, except smoking opium, in reasonable quantities and properly listed as medical stores to remain on board vessels if satisfied that such drugs are adequately safeguarded and used only as medical supplies.


(f) Application for permission to transfer bunkers, stores or equipment as provided for in the proviso to section 446, Tariff Act of 1930, shall be made and the permit therefor granted on Customs Form 3171.


(g) Equipment of a vessel arriving either directly or indirectly from a foreign port or place, if in need of repairs in the United States, may be unladen from and reladen upon the same vessel under the procedures set forth in ยง 4.30 relating to the granting of permits and special licenses on Customs Form 3171 (CF 3171). Adequate protection of the revenue is insured under the appropriate International Carrier Bond during the period that equipment is temporarily landed for repairs (see ยง 113.64(b) of this chapter), and so resort to the procedures established for the temporary importation of merchandise under bond is unnecessary. Once equipment which has been unladen under the terms of a CF 3171 has been reladen on the same vessel, potential liability for that transaction existing under the bond will be extinguished.
