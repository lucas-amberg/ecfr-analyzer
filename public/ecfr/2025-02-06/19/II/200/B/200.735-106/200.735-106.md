# ยง 200.735-106   Outside employment and other activities.

(a) An employee may engage in outside employment or other outside activity not incompatible with the full and proper discharge of the duties and responsibilities of his Government employment: *Provided,* That no Commissioner shall actively engage in any other business, vocation, or employment than that of serving as a Commissioner (19 U.S.C. 1330(c)). Incompatible activities include but are not limited to: 


(1) Acceptance of a fee, compensation, gift, payment of expense, or any other thing of monetary value in circumstances in which acceptance may result in, or create the appearance of, conflicts of interest; or 


(2) Outside employment tending to impair the employee's capacity to perform his Government duties and responsibilities in an acceptable manner. 


(b) An employee (except a special Government employee) shall not receive any salary or anything of monetary value from a private source as compensation for his services to the Government (18 U.S.C. 209). 


(c) Employees are encouraged to engage in teaching, lecturing, and writing that is not prohibited by law, the Executive order, or this part. However, an employee shall not, either for or without compensation, engage in teaching, lecturing, or writing, including teaching, lecturing, or writing for the purpose of the special preparation of a person or class of persons for an examination of the Civil Service Commission or Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service, that is dependent on information obtained as a result of his Government employment, except when that information has been made available to the general public or will be made available on request, or when the Commission gives authorization for the use of nonpublic information (other than information received in confidence) on the basis that the use is in the public interest and would not be in violation of law. In addition, Commissioners shall not receive compensation or anything of monetary value for any consultation, lecture, discussion, writing, or appearance the subject matter of which is devoted substantially to the responsibilities, programs, or operations of the Commission, or which draws substantially on official data or ideas which have not become part of the body of public information. 


(d) This section does not preclude an employee from: 


(1) Participation in the activities of national or State political parties not proscribed by law. 


(2) Participation in the affairs of, or acceptance of, an award for a meritorious public contribution or achievement given by a charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, nonprofit educational and recreational, public service, or civic organization.
