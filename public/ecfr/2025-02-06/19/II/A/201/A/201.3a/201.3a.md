# ยง 201.3a   Missing children information.

(a) Pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 3220, penalty mail sent by the Commission may be used to assist in the location and recovery of missing children. This section establishes procedures for such use and is applicable on a Commission-wide basis. The Commission's Office of Facilities Management, telephone 202-205-2741, shall be the point of contact for matters related to the implementation of this section.


(b) Missing children information shall be inserted in or affixed to such mailings of Commission monthly calendars, notices, press releases, and other documents as the Commission may direct. Such missing children information shall be obtained exclusively from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.




(c) The procedure established in paragraph (b) of this section will result in missing children information being inserted in an estimated 25 percent of the Commission's penalty mail and will cost an estimated $1,500 for the first year of implementation. The Chief Administrative Officer shall make such changes in the procedure as the Officer deems appropriate to maximize the use of missing children information in the Commission's mail.
