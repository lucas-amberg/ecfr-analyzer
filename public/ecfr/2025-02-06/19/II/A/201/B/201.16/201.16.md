# § 201.16   Service of process and other documents.

(a) *By the Commission.* Except when service by another method shall be specifically ordered by the Commission, the service of a process or other document of the Commission shall be served by anyone duly authorized by the Commission and be effected—


(1) By mailing, delivering, or serving by electronic means a copy of the document to the person to be served, to a member of the partnership to be served, to the president, secretary, other executive officer, or member of the board of directors of the corporation, association, or other organization to be served, or, if an attorney represents any of the above before the Commission, by mailing, delivering, or serving by electronic means a copy to such attorney; or


(2) By leaving a copy thereof at the principal office of such person, partnership, corporation, association, or other organization, or, if an attorney represents any of the above before the Commission, by leaving a copy at the office of such attorney. 


(3) By using an express delivery service to send a copy of the document to the principal office of such person, partnership, corporation, association, or other organization, or, if an attorney represents any of the above before the Commission, by serving the attorney by express delivery.


(4) When service is by mail, it is complete upon mailing of the document. When service is by an express service, service is complete upon submitting the document to the express delivery service or depositing it in the appropriate container for pick-up by the express delivery service. When service is by electronic means, service is complete upon transmission of a notification that the document has been placed in an appropriate repository for retrieval by the person, organization, representative, or attorney being served, unless the Commission is notified that the notification was not received by the party served.


(b) *By a party other than the Commission.* Except when service by another method shall be specifically ordered by the Commission, the service of a document of a party shall be effected:


(1) By mailing or delivering a copy of a nonconfidential version of the document to each party, or, if the party is represented by an attorney before the Commission, by mailing or delivering a nonconfidential version thereof to such attorney; or


(2) By leaving a copy thereof at the principal office of each other party, or, if a party is represented by an attorney before the Commission, by leaving a copy at the office of such attorney.


(3) When service is by mail, it is complete upon mailing of the document.


(4) When service is by mail, it shall be by first class mail, postage prepaid. In the event the addressee is outside the United States, service shall be by first class airmail, postage prepaid.


(c) *Proof of service; certificate.* (1) Each document filed with the Secretary to the Commission by a party in the course of an investigation (as provided in § 201.8 of this part) shall be served on each other party to the investigation (as provided in § 210.4(i) of this chapter for investigations under 19 U.S.C. 1337).


(2) Each document served by a party shall include a certificate of service, setting forth the manner and date of such service. The certificate of service shall be deemed proof of service of the document. In the event a document is not accompanied by a certificate of service, the Secretary shall not accept such document for filing and shall promptly notify the submitter.




(d) *Additional time after service by mail.* Whenever a party or Federal agency or department has the right or is required to perform some act or take some action within a prescribed period after the service of a document upon it and the document is served upon it by mail, three (3) calendar days shall be added to the prescribed period, except that when mailing is to a person located in a foreign country, ten (10) calendar days shall be added to the prescribed period. Computation of additional time for Commission proceedings conducted under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337) is set out in § 210.6 of this chapter.


(e) *Additional time after service by express delivery.* Whenever a party or Federal agency or department has the right or is required to perform some act or take some action within a prescribed period after the service of a document upon it and the document is served by express delivery, one (1) calendar day shall be added to the prescribed period if the service is to a destination in the United States, and five (5) calendar days shall be added to the prescribed period if the service is to a destination outside the United States. “Service by express delivery” refers to a method that would provide delivery by the next business day within the United States and refers to the equivalent express delivery service when the delivery is to a foreign location. Computation of additional time for Commission proceedings conducted under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337) is set out in § 210.6 of this chapter.


(f) *Electronic service by parties.* Parties may serve documents by electronic means in all matters before the Commission. Parties may effect such service on any party, unless that party has, upon notice to the Secretary and to all parties, stated that it does not consent to electronic service. If electronic service is used, no additional time is added to the prescribed period. However, any dispute that arises among parties regarding electronic service must be resolved by the parties themselves, without the Commission's involvement. When a document served by electronic means contains confidential business information or business proprietary information subject to an administrative protective order, the document must be securely stored and transmitted by the serving party in a manner, including by means ordered by the presiding administrative law judge, that prevents unauthorized access and/or receipt by individuals or organizations not authorized to view the specified confidential business information.
