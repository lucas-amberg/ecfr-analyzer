# § 201.8   Filing of documents.

(a) *Applicability; where to file; date of filing.* This section applies to all Commission proceedings except, notwithstanding any other section of this chapter, those conducted under 19 U.S.C. 1337, which are covered by requirements set out in part 210 of this chapter. Documents shall be filed with the office of the Secretary through the Commission's Electronic Document Information System (EDIS) website at *https://edis.usitc.gov.* If a paper filing is required or authorized under paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, documents shall be filed at the office of the Secretary in Washington, DC. Such documents, if properly filed within the hours of operation specified in § 201.3(c), will be deemed to be filed on the date on which they are actually received by the Commission.






(b) *Conformity with rules.* Each document filed with the Commission for the purpose of initiating any investigation shall be considered properly filed if it conforms with the pertinent rules prescribed in this chapter. Substantial compliance with the pertinent rules may be accepted by the Commission provided good and sufficient reason is stated in the document for inability to comply fully with the pertinent rules. 




(c) *Specifications for documents.* Each document filed under this chapter shall be signed, double-spaced, clear and legible, except that a document of two pages or less in length need not be double-spaced. All submissions shall be in letter-sized format (8.5 x 11 inches), except copies of documents prepared for another agency or a court (*e.g.,* pleadings papers). The name of the person signing the original shall be typewritten or otherwise reproduced on each copy.


(d) *Filing.* (1) All documents filed with the Commission shall be filed electronically. All filings shall comply with the procedures set forth in the Commission's Electronic Document Information System website at *https://edis.usitc.gov.* See also *https://www.usitc.gov/press_room/edissupport.htm.* Failure to comply with the requirements of this chapter and the Handbook on Filing Procedures that apply to the filing of a document may result in the rejection of the document as improperly filed.


(2) Supplementary material and witness testimony provided for under § 201.13 or § 207.15 or § 207.24 of this chapter shall also be filed in accordance with the provisions of the applicable section.


(3) The Secretary may provide for exceptions and modifications to the filing requirements set out in this chapter. A person seeking an exception should consult the Handbook on Filing Procedures.


(4) During any period in which the Commission is closed, deadlines for filing documents electronically and by other means are extended so that documents are due on the first business day after the end of the closure.


(e) *Identification of party filing document.* Each document filed with the Commission for the purpose of initiating any investigation shall show on the first page thereof the name, address, and telephone number of the party or parties by whom or on whose behalf the document is filed and shall be signed by the party filing the document or by a duly authorized officer, attorney, or corporate representative of such party. Also, any attorney or corporate representative filing the document shall give a current address, electronic mail address, and telephone number. The signature of the person signing such a document constitutes a certification that the person has read the document, that to the best of that person's knowledge and belief the statements contained therein are true, and that the person signing the document was duly authorized to sign it.


(f) *Nonconfidential copies.* In the event that confidential treatment of a document is requested under § 201.6(b), a nonconfidential version of the document shall be filed, in which the confidential business information shall have been deleted and which shall have been conspicuously marked “nonconfidential” or “public inspection.” The nonconfidential version shall be filed electronically. In the event that confidential treatment is not requested for a document under § 201.6(b), the document shall be conspicuously marked “No confidential version filed,” and the document shall be filed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. The name of the person signing the original shall be typewritten or otherwise reproduced on each copy.


(g) *Cover sheet.* For documents that are filed electronically, parties must complete the cover sheet form for such filing online at *https://edis.usitc.gov* at the time of the electronic filing. When making a paper filing, parties must complete the cover sheet form on-line at *https://edis.usitc.gov* and print out the cover sheet for submission to the Office of the Secretary with the paper filing. The party submitting the cover sheet is responsible for the accuracy of all information contained in the cover sheet, including, but not limited to, the security status and the investigation number, and must comply with applicable limitations on disclosure of business proprietary information or confidential information under § 201.6 and §§ 206.8, 206.17, 207.3, and 207.7 of this chapter.
