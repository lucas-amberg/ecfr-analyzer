# ยง 201.27   Special procedures: Medical records.

(a) While an individual has an unqualified right of access to the records in systems of records maintained by the Commission which pertain to him or her, medical and psychological records merit special treatment because of the possibility that disclosure will have an adverse physical or psychological effect upon the requesting individual. Accordingly, in those instances where an individual is requesting the medical and/or psychological records which pertain to him or her, he or she shall, in his or her Privacy Act request to the Privacy Act Officer as called for in ยง 201.24(a) of this part, specify a physician to whom the medical and/or psychological records may be released.


(b) It shall be the responsibility of the individual requesting medical or psychological records to specify a physician to whom the requested records may be released. If an individual refuses to name a physician and insists on inspecting his or her medical or psychological records in the absence of a doctor's discussion and advice, the individual shall so state in his or her Privacy Act request to the Privacy Act Officer as called for in ยง 201.24(a) of this part and the Privacy Act Officer shall provide access to or transmit such records directly to the individual.
