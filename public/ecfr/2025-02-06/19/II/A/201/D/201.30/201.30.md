(c) After the individual's request has been reviewed by the Commission, if the Commission agrees with the Privacy Act Officer's or the Inspector General's refusal to grant access to a record, to amend a record, or to provide an accounting of a record disclosure, in accordance with the individual's request, the Commission shall:


(1) Notify the individual in writing of the Commission's decision;


(2) For requests to amend or correct records, advise the individual that he or she has the right to file a concise statement of disagreement with the Commission which sets forth his or her reasons for disagreement with the refusal of the Commission to grant the individual's request; and


(3) Notify the individual of his or her legal right, if any, to judicial review of the Commission's final determination.
