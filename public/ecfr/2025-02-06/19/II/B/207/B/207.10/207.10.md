(3) Service of the petition shall be attested by filing a certificate of service with the Commission. 


(c) *Amendments and withdrawals; critical circumstances.* (1) Any amendment or withdrawal of a petition shall be filed on the same day with both the Secretary and the administering authority, without regard to whether the requester seeks action only by one agency.

Critical circumstances allegations, whether made in the petition or in an amendment thereto, shall contain information reasonably available to petitioner concerning the factors enumerated in sections 705(b)(4)(A) and 735(b)(4)(A) of the Act.
