# ยง 210.30   Requests for production of documents and things and entry upon land.

(a) *Scope.* Any party may serve on any other party a request:




(1) To produce and permit the party making the request, or someone acting on that party's behalf, to inspect and copy any designated documents (including writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, and other data compilations from which information can be obtained), or to inspect and copy, test, or sample any tangible things that are in the possession, custody, or control of the party upon whom the request is served; or


(2) To permit entry upon designated land or other property in the possession or control of the party upon whom the request is served for the purpose of inspecting and measuring, surveying, photographing, testing, or sampling the property or any designated object or operation thereon, within the scope of ยง 210.27(b). 


(b) *Procedure.* (1) The request may be served upon any party after the date of publication in the _Federal Register_ of the notice of investigation. The request shall set forth the items to be inspected, either by individual item or by category, and describe each item and category with reasonable particularity. The request shall specify a reasonable time, place, and manner of making the inspection and performing the related acts.




(2) The party upon whom the request is served shall serve a written response within ten (10) days or the time specified by the administrative law judge. The response shall state, with respect to each item or category, that inspection and related activities will be permitted as requested, unless the request is objected to, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated. An objection must state whether any responsive materials are being withheld on the basis of that objection. An objection to part of a request must specify the part and permit inspection of the rest. The party submitting the request may move for an order under ยง 210.33(a) with respect to any objection to or other failure to respond to the request or any part thereof, or any failure to permit inspection as requested. A party who produces documents for inspection shall produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business or shall organize and label them to correspond to the categories in the request.


(c) *Persons not parties.* This section does not preclude issuance of an order against a person not a party to permit entry upon land.
