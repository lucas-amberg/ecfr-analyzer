# § 210.32   Subpoenas.

(a) *Application for issuance of a subpoena*—(1) *Subpoena ad testificandum.* An application for issuance of a subpoena requiring a person to appear and depose or testify at the taking of a deposition or at a hearing shall be made to the administrative law judge. 


(2) *Subpoena duces tecum.* An application for issuance of a subpoena requiring a person to appear and depose or testify and to produce specified documents, papers, books, or other physical exhibits at the taking of a deposition, at a prehearing conference, at a hearing, or under any other circumstances, shall be made in writing to the administrative law judge and shall specify the material to be produced as precisely as possible, showing the general relevancy of the material and the reasonableness of the scope of the subpoena. 




(3) The administrative law judge shall rule on all applications filed under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section and may issue subpoenas when warranted. The administrative law judge shall also rule on any motion seeking foreign judicial assistance to obtain testimony or documents outside the United States.


(b) *Use of subpoena for discovery.* Subpoenas may be used by any party for purposes of discovery or for obtaining documents, papers, books or other physical exhibits for use in evidence, or for both purposes. When used for discovery purposes, a subpoena may require a person to produce and permit the inspection and copying of nonprivileged documents, papers, books, or other physical exhibits that constitute or contain evidence relevant to the subject matter involved and that are in the possession, custody, or control of such person. 




(c) *Application for subpoenas for nonparty Commission records or personnel or for records and personnel of other Government agencies*—(1) *Procedure.* An application for issuance of a subpoena requiring the production of nonparty documents, papers, books, physical exhibits, or other material in the records of the Commission, or requiring the production of records or personnel of other Government agencies shall specify as precisely as possible the material to be produced, the nature of the information to be disclosed, or the expected testimony of the official or employee, and shall contain a statement showing the general relevancy of the material, information, or testimony and the reasonableness of the scope of the application, together with a showing that such material, information, or testimony or their substantial equivalent could not be obtained without undue hardship or by alternative means. 




(2) *Ruling.* Such applications shall be ruled upon by the administrative law judge, who may issue such subpoenas when warranted. To the extent that the motion is granted, the administrative law judge shall provide such terms and conditions for the production of the material, the disclosure of the information, or the appearance of the official or employee as may appear necessary and appropriate for the protection of the public interest.


(3) *Application for subpoena grounded upon the Freedom of Information Act.* No application for a subpoena for production of documents grounded upon the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. § 552) shall be entertained by the administrative law judge. 


(d) *Objections and motions to quash.* (1) Any objection to a subpoena shall be served in writing on the party or attorney designated in the subpoena within the later of 10 days after receipt of the subpoena or within such time as the administrative law judge may allow. If an objection is made, the party that requested the subpoena may move for a request for judicial enforcement upon reasonable notice to other parties or as otherwise provided by the administrative law judge who issued the subpoena.


(2) Any motion to quash a subpoena shall be filed within the later of 10 days after receipt of the subpoena or within such time as the administrative law judge may allow.


(e) *Ex parte rulings on applications for subpoenas.* Applications for the issuance of the subpoenas pursuant to the provisions of this section may be made ex parte, and, if so made, such applications and rulings thereon shall remain ex parte unless otherwise ordered by the administrative law judge. 


(f) *Witness fees*—(1) *Deponents and witnesses.* Any person compelled to appear in person to depose or testify in response to a subpoena shall be paid the same fees and mileage as are paid to witnesses with respect to proceedings in the courts of the United States; provided, that salaried employees of the United States summoned to depose or testify as to matters related to their public employment, irrespective of the party at whose instance they are summoned, shall be paid in accordance with the applicable Federal regulations.


(2) *Responsibility.* The fees and mileage referred to in paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall be paid by the party at whose instance deponents or witnesses appear. Fees due under this paragraph shall be tendered no later than the date for compliance with the subpoena issued under this section. Failure to timely tender fees under this paragraph shall not invalidate any subpoena issued under this section.


(g) *Obtaining judicial enforcement.* In order to obtain judicial enforcement of a subpoena issued under paragraphs (a)(3) or (c)(2) of this section, the administrative law judge shall certify to the Commission, on motion or sua sponte, a request for such enforcement. The request shall be accompanied by copies of relevant papers and a written report from the administrative law judge concerning the purpose, relevance, and reasonableness of the subpoena. If the request, relevant papers, or written report contain confidential business information, the administrative law judge shall certify nonconfidential copies along with the confidential versions. The Commission will subsequently issue a notice stating whether it has granted the request and authorized its Office of the General Counsel to seek such enforcement.
