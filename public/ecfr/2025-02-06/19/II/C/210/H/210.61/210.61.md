# ยง 210.61   Discovery and compulsory process.

The presiding administrative law judge shall set all discovery deadlines. The administrative law judge's authority to compel discovery includes discovery relating to the following issues: 


(a) Any matter relevant to the motion for temporary relief and the responses thereto, including the issues of bonding by the complainant; and 


(b) The issues the Commission considers pursuant to sections 337 (e)(1), (f)(1), and (j)(3) of the Tariff Act of 1930, viz., 


(1) The appropriate form of relief (notwithstanding the form requested in the motion for temporary relief), 


(2) Whether the public interest precludes that form of relief, and 


(3) The amount of the bond to be posted by the respondents to secure importations or sales of the subject imported merchandise while the temporary relief order is in effect. The administrative law judge may, but is not required to, make findings on the issues specified in sections 337 (e)(1), (f)(1), or (j)(3) of the Tariff Act of 1930. Evidence and information obtained through discovery on those issues will be used by the parties and considered by the Commission in the context of the parties' written submissions on remedy, the public interest, and bonding by respondents, which are filed with the Commission pursuant to ยง 210.67(b).
