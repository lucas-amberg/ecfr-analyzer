# § 210.69   Approval of complainant's temporary relief bond.

(a) In accordance with 31 U.S.C. § 9304(b), all bonds posted by complainants must be approved by the Commission before the temporary relief sought by the complainant will be issued. See also 31 U.S.C. § 9303(a) and 31 CFR 225.1 and 225.20. The Commission's bond approval officer for purposes of those provisions shall be the Secretary. 


(b) The bond approval process may entail investigation by the Secretary or the Commission's Office of Investigations to determine the veracity of all factual information set forth in the bond and the accompanying documentation (e.g., powers of attorney), as well as any additional verification required by 31 CFR parts 223, 224, or 225. The Secretary may reject a bond on one or more of the following grounds: 


(1) Failure to comply with the instructions in the Commission determination, order, or notice directing the complainant to post a bond; 


(2) Failure of the surety or the bond to provide information or supporting documentation required by the Commission, the Secretary, § 210.68 of this part, 31 CFR parts 223 or 224, or other governing statutes, regulations, or Treasury circulars, or because of a limitation prescribed in a governing statute, regulation, or circular; 


(3) Failure of an individual surety to execute and file with the bond, an affidavit of the type shown in appendix A to § 210.68, which sets forth information about the surety's assets, liabilities, net worth, real estate and other property of which the initial surety is the sole owner, other bonds on which the individual surety is a surety (and which must be updated at 4-month intervals while the bond is in effect, measured from the date on which the bond is approved by the Secretary on behalf of the Commission or by the Commission); 


(4) Any question about the solvency or financial responsibility of the surety, or any question of fraud, misrepresentation, or perjury which comes to light as a result of the verification inquiry during the bond approval process; and 


(5) Any other reason deemed appropriate by the Secretary. 


(c) If the complainant believes that the Secretary's rejection of the bond was erroneous as a matter of law, the complainant may appeal the Secretary's rejection of the bond by filing a petition with the Commission in the form of a letter to the Chairman, within 10 days after service of the rejection letter. 


(d) After the bond is approved and temporary relief is issued, if any question concerning the continued solvency of the individual or the legality or enforceability of the bond or undertaking develops, the Commission may take the following action(s), sua sponte or on motion; 


(1) Revoke the Commission approval of the bond and require complainant to post a new bond; or 


(2) Revoke or vacate the temporary remedial order for public interest reasons or changed conditions of law or fact (criteria that are the basis for modification or rescission of final Commission action pursuant to § 210.76(a)(1) and (b)); or 


(3) Notify the Treasury Department if the problem involves a corporate surety licensed to do business with the United States under 31 U.S.C. §§ 9303-9306 and 31 CFR parts 223 and 224; or 


(4) Refer the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice if there is a suggestion of fraud, perjury, or related conduct.
