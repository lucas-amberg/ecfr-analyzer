# § 351.107   Cash deposit rates; producer/exporter combination rates.

(a) *Introduction.* Sections 703(d)(1)(B), 705(d), 733(d)(1)(B), and 735(c) of the Act direct the Secretary to order the posting of cash deposits, as determined in preliminary and final determinations of antidumping and countervailing duty investigations, and additional provisions of the Act, including section 751, direct the Secretary to establish a cash deposit rate in accordance with various reviews. This section covers the establishment of cash deposit rates and the instructions which the Secretary issues to U.S. Customs and Border Protection to collect those cash deposits.


(b) *In general.* The Secretary will instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to suspend liquidation of merchandise subject to an antidumping duty or countervailing duty proceeding and apply cash deposit rates determined in that proceeding to all imported merchandise for which a cash deposit rate was determined by the Secretary in proportion to the estimated value of the merchandise as reported to U.S. Customs and Border Protection on an *ad valorem* basis.


(c) *Exceptions*—(1) *Application of cash deposit rates on a per-unit basis.* If the Secretary determines that the information normally used to calculate an *ad valorem* cash deposit rate is not available or the use of an *ad valorem* cash deposit rate is otherwise not appropriate, the Secretary may instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to apply the cash deposit rate on a per-unit basis.


(2) *Application of cash deposit rates to producer/exporter combinations.* The Secretary may instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to apply a determined cash deposit rate only to imported merchandise both produced by an identified producer and exported by an identified exporter if the Secretary determines that such an application is appropriate. Such an application is called a producer/exporter combination.


(i) *Example.* Exporter A exports to the United States subject merchandise produced by Producers W, X, and Y. In such a situation, the Secretary may establish a cash deposit rate applied to Exporter A that is limited to merchandise produced by Producers W, X, and Y. If Exporter A begins to export subject merchandise produced by Producer Z, that cash deposit rate would not apply to subject merchandise produced by Producer Z.


(ii) *In general.* The Secretary will instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to apply a cash deposit rate to a producer/exporter combination or combinations when the cash deposit rate is determined as follows:


(A) Pursuant to a new shipper review, in accordance with section 751(a)(2)(B) of the Act and § 351.214;


(B) Pursuant to an antidumping investigation of merchandise from a nonmarket economy country, in accordance with sections 733 and 735 of the Act and §§ 351.205 and 210, for merchandise exported by an examined exporter;


(C) Pursuant to scope, circumvention, and covered merchandise segments of the proceeding, in accordance with §§ 351.225(m), 351.226(m) and 351.227(m), when the Secretary makes a segment-specific determination on the basis of a producer/exporter combination; and


(D) Pursuant to additional segments of a proceeding in which the Secretary determines that the application of a cash deposit rate to a producer/exporter combination is warranted based on facts on the record.


(3) *Exclusion from an antidumping or countervailing duty order*—(i) *Preliminary determinations.* In general, in accordance with sections 703(b) and 733(b) of the Act, if the Secretary makes an affirmative preliminary antidumping or countervailing duty determination and the Secretary preliminarily determines an individual weighted-average dumping margin or individual net countervailable subsidy rate of zero or *de minimis* for an investigated exporter or producer, the exporter or producer will not be excluded from the preliminary determination or the investigation. However, the Secretary will not instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to suspend liquidation of entries or collect cash deposits on the merchandise produced and exported from the producer/exporter combinations examined in the investigation and identified in the _Federal Register_*,* as the investigated combinations will not be subject to provisional measures under sections 703(d) or 733(d) of the Act.


(ii) *Final determinations.* In general, in accordance with sections 705(a), 735(a), 706(a), and 736(a) of the Act, if the Secretary makes an affirmative final determination, issues an antidumping or countervailing duty order and determines an individual weighted-average dumping margin or individual net countervailable subsidy rate of zero or *de minimis* for an investigated producer or exporter, the Secretary will exclude from the antidumping or countervailing duty order only merchandise produced and exported in the producer/exporter combinations examined in the investigation and identified in the _Federal Register._ An exclusion applicable to a producer/exporter combination shall not apply to resellers. Excluded producer/exporter combinations may include transactions in which the exporter is both the producer and exporter, transactions in which the producer's merchandise has been exported to the United States through multiple exporters individually examined in the investigation, and transactions in which the exporter has sourced from multiple producers identified in the investigation.


(iii) *Example.* If during the period of investigation, Exporter A exports to the United States subject merchandise produced by Producer X, based on an examination of Exporter A the Secretary may determine that the dumping margins with respect to the examined merchandise are *de minimis.* In that case, the Secretary would normally exclude only subject merchandise produced by Producer X and exported by Exporter A. If Exporter A began to export subject merchandise produced by Producer Y, that merchandise would be subject to the antidumping duty order.


(4) *Certification requirements.* If the Secretary determines that parties must maintain or provide a certification in accordance with § 351.228, the Secretary may instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to apply a cash deposit requirement that is based on the facts of the case and effectuates the administration and purpose of the certification.


(d) *The antidumping duty order cash deposit hierarchies*—(1) *In general.* If the Secretary has not previously established a combination cash deposit rate under paragraph (c)(2) of this section for the producer and exporter in question, the following will apply:


(i) *A market economy country proceeding.* In a proceeding covering merchandise produced in a market economy country:


(A) If the Secretary has established a current cash deposit rate for the exporter of the subject merchandise, the Secretary will instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to apply the cash deposit rate established for the exporter to entries of the subject merchandise;


(B) If the Secretary has not established a current cash deposit rate for the exporter, but the Secretary has established a current cash deposit rate for the producer of the subject merchandise, the Secretary will instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to apply the cash deposit rate established for the producer of the subject merchandise to entries of the subject merchandise; and


(C) If the Secretary has not established a current cash deposit rate for either the producer or the exporter of the subject merchandise, the Secretary will instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to apply the all-others rate determined in the investigation to entries of the subject merchandise, pursuant to section 735(c) of the Act and § 351.109(f).


(ii) *A nonmarket economy country proceeding.* In a proceeding covering merchandise originating from a nonmarket economy country:


(A) If the Secretary has established a current separate cash deposit rate for the exporter of the subject merchandise, the Secretary will instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to apply the cash deposit rate for the exporter to entries of the subject merchandise;


(B) If the Secretary has not established a current separate cash deposit rate for an exporter of the subject merchandise, the Secretary will instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to apply the cash deposit rate determined by the Secretary for the nonmarket economy entity to entries of the subject merchandise, pursuant to § 351.108(b); and


(C) If the entries of subject merchandise were resold to the United States through a third-country reseller, the Secretary will normally instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to apply the current separate cash deposit rate applicable to the nonmarket economy country exporter (or the applicable producer/exporter combination, if warranted) that supplied the subject merchandise to the reseller to those entries of the subject merchandise.


(2) *Exception.* If the Secretary determines that an application of cash deposit rates other than that described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to particular producers or exporters is warranted, the Secretary may instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to use an alternative methodology in applying those cash deposit rates to entries of subject merchandise.


(e) *The countervailing duty order cash deposit hierarchy*—(1) *In general.* If the Secretary has not previously established a combination cash deposit rate under paragraph (c)(2) of this section for the producer and exporter in question and the exporter and producer have differing cash deposit rates, the following will apply:


(i) If the Secretary has established current cash deposit rates for both the producer and the exporter of the subject merchandise, the Secretary will instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to apply the higher of the two rates to the entries of subject merchandise;


(ii) If the Secretary has established a current cash deposit rate for the producer but not the exporter of the subject merchandise, the Secretary will instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to apply the producer's cash deposit rate to entries of subject merchandise;


(iii) If the Secretary has established a current cash deposit rate for the exporter but not the producer of the subject merchandise, the Secretary will instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to apply the exporter's cash deposit rate to entries of subject merchandise; and


(iv) If the Secretary has not established current cash deposit rates for either the producer or the exporter of the subject merchandise, the Secretary will instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to apply the all-others rate determined in the investigation pursuant to section 705(c)(5) of the Act and § 351.109(f) to the entries of subject merchandise.


(2) *Exception.* If the Secretary determines that an application of cash deposit rates other than that described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section to particular producers or exporters is warranted, the Secretary may instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to use an alternative methodology in applying those cash deposit rates to the entries of subject merchandise.


(f) *Effective dates for amended preliminary and final determinations and results of review upon correction of a ministerial error.* If the Secretary amends an agency determination in accordance with sections 703, 705(e), 733 and 735(e) of the Act and § 351.224 (e) through (g):


(1) If the Secretary amends a preliminary or final determination in an investigation for a ministerial error and the amendment increases the dumping margin or countervailing duty rate, the new cash deposit rate will be effective to entries made on or after the date of publication of the amended determination;


(2) If the Secretary amends a preliminary or final determination in an investigation for a ministerial error and the amendment decreases the dumping margin or countervailing duty rate, the new cash deposit rate will be retroactive to the date of publication of the original preliminary or final determination, as applicable;


(3) If the Secretary amends the final results of an administrative review pursuant to a ministerial error, the effective date of the amended cash deposit rate will be retroactive to entries following the date of publication of the original final results of administrative review regardless of whether the antidumping duty margin or countervailing duty rate increases or decreases; and


(4) If the Secretary amends the final results of an investigation or administrative review pursuant to litigation involving alleged or disputed ministerial errors, the effective date of the amended cash deposit rate may differ from the effective dates resulting from the application of paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section and normally will be identified in a _Federal Register_ notice.
