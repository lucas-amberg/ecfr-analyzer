# ยง 351.215   Expedited antidumping review and security in lieu of estimated duty under section 736(c) of the Act.

(a) *Introduction.* Exporters and producers individually examined in an investigation normally cannot obtain a review of entries until an administrative review is requested. In addition, when an antidumping order is published, importers normally must begin to make a cash deposit of estimated antidumping duties upon the entry of subject merchandise. Section 736(c), however, establishes a special procedure under which exporters or producers may request an expedited review, and bonds, rather than cash deposits, may continue to be posted for a limited period of time if several criteria are satisfied. This section contains rules regarding requests for expedited antidumping reviews and the procedures applicable to such reviews.


(b) *In general.* If the Secretary determines that the criteria of section 736(c)(1) of the Act are satisfied, the Secretary:


(1) May permit, for not more than 90 days after the date of publication of an antidumping order, the posting of a bond or other security instead of the deposit of estimated antidumping duties required under section 736(a)(3) of the Act; and


(2) Will initiate an expedited antidumping review. Before making such a determination, the Secretary will make business proprietary information available, and will provide interested parties with an opportunity to file written comments, in accordance with section 736(c)(4) of the Act.


(c) *Procedures.* The Secretary will conduct an expedited antidumping review under this section in accordance with ยง 351.221.
