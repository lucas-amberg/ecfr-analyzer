(2) The case brief must present all arguments that continue in the submitter's view to be relevant to the Secretary's final determination or final results, including any arguments presented before the date of publication of the preliminary determination or preliminary results. As part of the case brief, parties are requested to provide the following:

These comments may not include any new factual information or evidence (such as supplementation of a substantive response to the notice of initiation) and are limited to five pages.


(ii) *Time limit for filing comments.* Comments on adequacy of response and appropriateness of expedited sunset review must be filed not later than 70 days after the date publication in the _Federal Register_ of the notice of initiation.
