# § 351.516   Price preferences for inputs used in the production of goods for export.

(a) *Benefit*—(1) *In general.* In the case of a program involving the provision by governments or their agencies, either directly or indirectly through government-mandated schemes, of imported or domestic products or services for use in the production of exported goods, a benefit exists to the extent that the Secretary determines that the terms or conditions on which the products or services are provided are more favorable than the terms or conditions applicable to the provision of like or directly competitive products or services for use in the production of goods for domestic consumption unless, in the case of products, such terms or conditions are not more favorable than those commercially available on world markets to exporters.


(2) *Amount of benefit.* In the case of products provided under such schemes, the Secretary will determine the amount of the benefit by comparing the price of products used in the production of exported goods to the commercially available world market price of such products, inclusive of delivery charges.


(3) *Commercially available.* For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, *commercially available* means that the choice between domestic and imported products is unrestricted and depends only on commercial considerations.


(b) *Time of receipt of benefit.* In the case of a benefit described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary normally will consider the benefit to have been received as of the date on which the firm paid, or in the absence of payment was due to pay, for the product.


(c) *Allocation of benefit to a particular time period.* Normally, the Secretary will allocate (expense) benefits described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to the year in which the benefit is considered to have been received under paragraph (b) of this section.
