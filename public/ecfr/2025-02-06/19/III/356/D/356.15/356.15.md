# § 356.15   Initiation of proceedings.

(a) If the Deputy Under Secretary concludes, after an investigation and report by the Director under § 356.14(c) and consultation with the Chief Counsel, that there is reasonable cause to believe that a person has violated a protective order or a disclosure undertaking and that sanctions are appropriate for the violation, the Deputy Under Secretary will, at the Deputy Under Secretary's discretion, either initiate a proceeding under this subpart by issuing a charging letter as set forth in § 356.16 or request that the authorized agency of the involved FTA country initiate a proceeding by issuing a request to charge as set forth in § 356.17. In determining whether sanctions are appropriate and, if so, what sanctions to impose, the Deputy Under Secretary will consider the nature of the violation, the resulting harm, and other relevant circumstances of the case. The Deputy Under Secretary will decide whether to initiate a proceeding no later than 60 days after receiving a report of the investigation. 


(b) If the Department receives a request to charge from an authorized agency of a FTA country, the Deputy Under Secretary will promptly initiate proceedings under this part by issuing a charging letter as set forth in § 356.16.
