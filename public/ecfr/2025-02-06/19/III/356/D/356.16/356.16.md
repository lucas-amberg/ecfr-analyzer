# ยง 356.16   Charging letter.

(a) *Contents of letter.* The Deputy Under Secretary will initiate proceedings by issuing a charging letter to each charged party and affected party which includes: 


(1) A statement of the allegation that a protective order or a disclosure undertaking has been violated and the basis thereof; 


(2) A statement of the proposed sanctions; 


(3) A statement that the charged or affected party is entitled to review the documents or other physical evidence upon which the charge is based and the method for requesting access to, or copies of, such documents; 


(4) A statement that the charged or affected party is entitled to a hearing before an administrative law judge if requested within 30 days of the date of service of the charging letter and the procedure for requesting a hearing, including the name, address, and telephone number of the person to contact if there are further questions; 


(5) A statement that the charged or affected party has a right, if a hearing is not requested, to submit documentary evidence to the Deputy Under Secretary and an explanation of the method for submitting evidence and the date by which it must be received; and 


(6) A statement that the charged or affected party has a right to retain counsel at the party's own expense for purposes of representation. 


(b) *Settlement and amendment of the charging letter.* The Deputy Under Secretary may amend, supplement, or withdraw the charging letter at any time with the approval of an administrative law judge if the interests of justice would thereby be served. If a hearing has not been requested, the Deputy Under Secretary will ask the Under Secretary to appoint an administrative law judge to make this determination. If a charging letter is withdrawn after a request for a hearing, the administrative law judge will determine whether the withdrawal will bar the Deputy Under Secretary from seeking sanctions at a later date for the same alleged violation. If there has been no request for a hearing, or if supporting information has not been submitted under ยง 356.28, the withdrawal will not bar future actions on the same alleged violation. The Deputy Under Secretary and a charged or affected party may settle a charge brought under this subpart by mutual agreement at any time after service of the charging letter; approval of the administrative law judge or the APO Sanctions Board is not necessary. 


(c) *Service of charging letter on a resident of the United States.* (1) Service of a charging letter on a United States resident will be made by: 


(i) Mailing a copy by registered or certified mail addressed to the charged or affected party at the party's last known address; 


(ii) Leaving a copy with the charged or affected party or with an officer, a managing or general agent, or any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service for the party; or 


(iii) Leaving a copy with a person of suitable age and discretion who resides at the party's last known dwelling. 


(2) Service made in the manner described in paragraph (c)(1) (ii) or (iii) of this section shall be evidenced by a certificate of service signed by the person making such service, stating the method of service and the identity of the person with whom the charging letter was left. 


(d) *Service of charging letter on a non-resident.* If applicable laws or intergovernmental agreements or understandings make the methods of service set forth in paragraph (c) of this section inappropriate or ineffective, service of the charging letter on a person who is not a resident of the United States may be made by any method that is permitted by the country in which the person resides and that, in the opinion of the Deputy Under Secretary, satisfies due process requirements under United States law with respect to notice in administrative proceedings.
