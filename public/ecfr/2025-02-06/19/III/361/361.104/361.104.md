# ยง  361.104   Aluminum import monitoring.

(a) Commerce will maintain an import monitoring system on the public AIM system website that will report certain aggregate information on imports of aluminum products obtained from the aluminum licenses and, where available, from publicly available U.S. import statistics. Aggregate data will be reported, as appropriate, on a monthly basis by country of origin, country of smelt, country of last cast, relevant aluminum product grouping, etc., and will include import quantity (metric tons), import Customs value (U.S. $), and average unit value ($/metric ton). The website will also contain certain aggregate data at the 6-digit Harmonized Tariff Schedule level and will also present a range of historical data for comparison purposes. Provision of aggregate data on the website may be revisited should concerns arise over the possible release of proprietary data.


(b) Reported monthly import data will be refreshed each week, as appropriate, with new data on licenses issued during the previous week. This data will also be adjusted periodically for cancelled or unused aluminum import licenses, as appropriate. Additionally, outdated license data will be replaced, where available, with publicly available U.S. import statistics.
