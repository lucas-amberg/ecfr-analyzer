# ยง 180.215   Which nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions?

The following types of nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions:


(a) A direct award to:


(1) A foreign government or foreign governmental entity;


(2) A public international organization;


(3) An entity owned (in whole or in part) or controlled by a foreign government; or


(4) Any other entity consisting wholly or partially of one or more foreign governments or foreign governmental entities.


(b) A benefit to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted). For example, when a person receives social security benefits under the Supplemental Security Income provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1301 *et seq.,* those benefits are not covered transactions and, therefore, are not affected if the person is excluded.


(c) Federal employment.


(d) A transaction that a Federal agency needs to respond to a national or agency recognized emergency or disaster.


(e) A permit, license, certificate, or similar instrument issued as a means to regulate public health, safety, or the environment, unless a Federal agency specifically designates it to be a covered transaction.


(f) An incidental benefit that results from ordinary governmental operations.


(g) Any other transaction if:


(1) The application of an exclusion to the transaction is prohibited by law; or


(2) A Federal agency's regulation exempts it from coverage under this part.


(h) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, covered transactions must include non-procurement and procurement transactions involving entities engaged in activity that contributed to or is a significant factor in a country's non-compliance with its obligations under arms control, nonproliferation or disarmament agreements, or commitments with the United States. Federal agencies and primary tier non-procurement recipients must not award, renew, or extend a non-procurement transaction or procurement transaction, regardless of amount or tier, with any entity listed in SAM.gov Exclusions on the basis of involvement in activities that violate arms control, nonproliferation or disarmament agreements, or commitments with the United States (see section 1290 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017). The head of a Federal agency may grant an exception to this requirement under 2 CFR 180.135 and with the concurrence of the OMB Director.
