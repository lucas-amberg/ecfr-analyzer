# ยง 180.220   Are any procurement contracts included as covered transactions?

(a) Covered transactions under this part:


(1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a Federal agency; but


(2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded under nonprocurement covered transactions.


(b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered transaction if any of the following applies:


(1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement transaction covered under ยง 180.210, and the contract amount is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.


(2) The contract requires the consent of an official of a Federal agency. In that case, the contract is always a covered transaction regardless of the amount or who awarded it. For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the Appendix to this part.


(3) The contract is for Federally required audit services.


(c) A subcontract also is a covered transaction if:


(1) It is awarded by a participant in a procurement transaction under a nonprocurement transaction of a Federal agency that extends the coverage of paragraph (b)(1) of this section to additional tiers of contracts (see the diagram in the Appendix to this part showing that optional lower tier coverage); and


(2) The value of the subcontract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.
