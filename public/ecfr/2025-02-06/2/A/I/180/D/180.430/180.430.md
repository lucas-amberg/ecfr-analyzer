# ยง 180.430   How do I check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified?

You check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified in two ways:


(a) As a Federal agency official, you must check *SAM.gov* Exclusions when you take any action listed in ยง 180.425.


(b) You must review the information that a participant gives you, as required by ยง 180.335, about its status or the status of the principals of a transaction.
