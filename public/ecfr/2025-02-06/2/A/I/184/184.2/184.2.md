# ยง 184.2   Applicability, effective date, and severability.

(a) *Non-applicability of this part to existing Buy America Preferences.* This part does not apply to a Buy America Preference meeting or exceeding the requirements of section 70914 of the Build America, Buy America Act applied by a Federal agency to Federal awards for infrastructure projects before November 15, 2021.


(b) *Effective date of this part.* The effective date of this part is October 23, 2023. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, this part applies to Federal awards obligated on or after its effective date. Awards obligated on or after May 14, 2022, the effective date of the Build America, Buy America Act, and before the effective date of this part, are instead subject to OMB Memorandum M-22-11.


(c) *Modified effective date of this part for certain infrastructure projects.* If an infrastructure project that has previously received a Federal award obligated on or after May 14, 2022, but before the effective date of this part receives an additional Federal award obligated within one year of the effective date of this part, the additional Federal award is subject to OMB Memorandum M-22-11. However, if significant design or planning changes are made to the infrastructure project, the Federal agency may apply this part to the additional Federal award. Federal awards for an infrastructure project obligated after one year from the effective date of this part are subject to this part, regardless of whether this part applied to previous awards for the project.


(d) *Severability.* The provisions of this part are separate and severable from one another. OMB intends that if a provision of this part is held to be invalid or unenforceable as applied to a particular person or circumstance, the provision should be construed so as to continue to give the maximum effect permitted by law as applied to other persons not similarly situated or to dissimilar circumstances. If any provision is determined to be wholly invalid and unenforceable, it should be severed from the remaining provisions of this part, which should remain in effect.
