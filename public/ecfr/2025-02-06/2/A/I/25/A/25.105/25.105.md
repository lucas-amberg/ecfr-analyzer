(b) Subrecipients are required to obtain a UEI in accordance with subpart C. This part does not apply to subrecipients of subrecipients (second-tier subrecipients) or contractors under Federal awards.


(c) This part does not apply to an individual who applies for or receives Federal financial assistance as a natural person (unrelated to any business or nonprofit organization an individual owns or operates).
