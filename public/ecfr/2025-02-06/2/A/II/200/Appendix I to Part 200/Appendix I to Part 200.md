# Appendix I to Part 200—Full Text of Notice of Funding Opportunity












(a) *General Requirements.*

(1) *Requirements for developing NOFOs.* In developing a notice of funding opportunity (NOFO), Federal agencies must:


(i) Be concise and use plain language per the guidance at *PlainLanguage.gov* wherever possible.


(ii) For electronic NOFOs and other information about them, comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d).


(2) *Considerations for developing NOFOs.* Federal agencies may:


(i) Link to standard content to include required information rather than including the full language in the NOFO. The NOFO should make clear if linked information is critical—for example, standard terms and conditions, administrative and national policy requirements, and standard templates.


(ii) Include links to relevant regulations and other sources.


(iii) Use cross-references between the sections, including hyperlinks in electronic versions.


(3) *Required Consistency.* Potential applicants must be able to find similar information across all Federal NOFOs. To that end, Federal agencies must include the same or similar section headings and a table of contents with at least these sections:


(i) Basic Information


(ii) Eligibility


(iii) Program Description


(iv) Application Contents and Format


(v) Submission Requirements and Deadlines


(vi) Application Review Information


(vii) Award Notices


(viii) Post-Award Requirements and Administration


(b) *Required Sections and Information.*

As required below, the Federal agency must include the following sections and information in the text of a NOFO and a table of contents.


(1) *Basic Information.*

This section provides sufficient information to help an applicant make an informed decision about whether to submit a proposal.


(i) This section must include the following:


(A) Federal Agency Name.


(B) Funding Opportunity Title.

(E) Assistance Listing Number(s).


(F) Funding Details. The total amount of funding that the Federal agency expects to award, the anticipated number of awards, and the expected dollar values of individual awards, which may be a range.


(G) Key Dates. Key dates include due dates for submitting applications or Executive Order 12372 submissions, as well as for any letters of intent or preapplications. For any announcement issued before a program's application materials are available, key dates also include the date on which those materials will be released; and any other additional information, as deemed applicable by the Federal agency. If possible, the Federal agency should provide an anticipated award date. If the NOFO is evaluated on a “rolling” basis, the Federal agency should provide an estimate of the time needed to process an application and notify the applicant of the Federal agency's decision.


(H) Executive Summary. A brief description that is written in plain language and summarizes the goals and objectives of the program, the target audience, and eligible recipients. The text of the executive summary should not exceed 500 words


(I) Agency contact information.

(6) *Application Review Information.*

(i) *Responsiveness Review.* This section includes information on the criteria that make an application or project ineligible.

This information includes the merit and other review criteria evaluators will use to judge applications, including any statutory, regulatory, or other preferences that will be applied in the review process. These criteria are distinct from eligibility criteria that are addressed before an application is accepted for review and any program policy or other factors that are applied during the selection process, after the review process is completed.

*(4)* How an applicant's proposed cost sharing will be considered in the review process if it is not an eligibility criterion in Section 2b. For example, to assign a certain number of additional points to applicants who offer cost sharing or to break ties among applications with equivalent scores after evaluation against all other factors. If cost sharing will not be considered in the evaluation, the announcement should say so. Do not include statements that cost sharing is encouraged without providing clarity about what that means.


*(5)* The relevant information if the Federal agency permits applicants to nominate reviewers of their applications or suggest those they feel may be inappropriate due to a conflict of interest.


(B) This section could include the following:

(B) It could also include the following:


*(1)* Who makes the final selections for awards.


*(2)* Any multi-phase review methods. For example, an external panel that advises on, makes, or approves final recommendations to the deciding official.


(iv) *Risk Review.*

(A) This section must include the following:


*(1)* A brief description of the factors used for the Federal agency's risk review as required by § 200.206.


*(2)* If the Federal agency expects that any award under the NOFO will be more than the simplified acquisition threshold during its period of performance, include the following information:


*(i)* That before making a Federal award with a total amount of Federal share greater than the simplified acquisition threshold, the Federal agency must review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the responsibility/qualification records available in *SAM.gov* (see 41 U.S.C. 2313).


*(ii)* That an applicant can review and comment on any information in the responsibility/qualification records available in *SAM.gov*.


*(iii)* That before making decisions in the risk review required by § 200.206 the Federal agency will consider any comments by the applicant, along with information available in the responsibility/qualification records in *SAM.gov*.


(7) *Award Notices.* This section must address what a successful applicant can expect to receive following selection.


(i) It must include the following:


(A) If the Federal agency's practice is to provide a separate notice stating that an application has been selected before it makes the Federal award, indicate that the letter is not an authorization to begin performance and that the Federal award is the authorizing document.


(B) If pre-award costs are allowed, beginning performance is at the applicant's own risk.


(C) This section should indicate that the notice of Federal award signed by the grants officer, or equivalent, is the official document that obligates funds, and whether it is provided through postal mail or by electronic means and to whom.


(D) The timing, form, and content of notifications to unsuccessful applicants. See also § 200.211.


(8) *Post-Award Requirements and Administration.*

(A) A statement related to the “general” terms and conditions of the award, including requirements that the Federal agency normally includes.


(B) Any relevant specific terms and conditions.


(C) Any special requirements that could apply to specific awards after the review of applications and other information based on the particular circumstances of the effort to be supported. For example, if human subjects were to be involved or if some situations may justify specific terms on intellectual property, data sharing, or security requirements.


(D) As in other sections, the announcement need not include all terms and conditions of the award but may refer to documents with details on terms and conditions.


(ii) *Reporting.* This section includes information needed to understand the post-award reporting requirements. Highlight any special reporting requirements for Federal awards under this funding opportunity that differ from what the Federal agency's Federal awards usually require. For example, differences in report type, frequency, form, format, or circumstances for use. This section must include the following:


(A) The type of reporting required, such as financial or performance.


(B) The reporting frequency.


(C) The means of submission, such as paper or electronic.

(E) If the Federal share of any Federal award may include more than $500,000 over the period of performance, this section must inform potential applicants about the post-award reporting requirements reflected in appendix XII to this part.


(9) *Other Information—Optional.* This section may include any additional information to help potential applicants. For example, the section could include the following:


(i) Related programs or other upcoming or ongoing Federal agency funding opportunities for similar activities.


(ii) Current internet addresses for Federal agency websites that may be useful to an applicant in understanding the program.


(iii) Routine notices to applicants. For example, the Federal Government is not obligated to make any Federal award as a result of the announcement, or only grants officers can bind the Federal Government to the expenditure of funds.
