# Appendix XII to Part 200—Award Term and Condition for Recipient Integrity and Performance Matters


(1) If the total value of your active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal agencies exceeds $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of this Federal award, then you as the recipient must ensure the information available in the responsibility/qualification records through the System for Award Management (*SAM.gov*), about civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings described in paragraph (b) of this award term is current and complete. This is a statutory requirement under section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313). As required by section 3010 of Public Law 111-212, all information posted in responsibility/qualification records in *SAM.gov* on or after April 15, 2011 (except past performance reviews required for Federal procurement contracts) will be publicly available.


(b) *Proceedings About Which You Must Report.*

(1) You must submit the required information about each proceeding that—


(i) Is in connection with the award or performance of a grant, cooperative agreement, or procurement contract from the Federal Government;


(ii) Reached its final disposition during the most recent five-year period; and


(iii) Is one of the following—


(A) A criminal proceeding that resulted in a conviction;


(B) A civil proceeding that resulted in a finding of fault and liability and payment of a monetary fine, penalty, reimbursement, restitution, or damages of $5,000 or more;


(C) An administrative proceeding that resulted in a finding of fault and liability and your payment of either a monetary fine or penalty of $5,000 or more or reimbursement, restitution, or damages in excess of $100,000; or


(D) Any other criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding if—


(*1*) It could have led to an outcome described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) through (C);


(*2*) It had a different disposition arrived at by consent or compromise with an acknowledgment of fault on your part; and


(*3*) The requirement in this award term to disclose information about the proceeding does not conflict with applicable laws and regulations.


(c) *Reporting Procedures.* Enter the required information in *SAM.gov* for each proceeding described in paragraph (b) of this award term. You do not need to submit the information a second time under grants and cooperative agreements that you received if you already provided the information in *SAM.gov* because you were required to do so under Federal procurement contracts that you were awarded.


(d) *Reporting Frequency.* During any period of time when you are subject to the requirement in paragraph (a) of this award term, you must report proceedings information in *SAM.gov* for the most recent five-year period, either to report new information about a proceeding that you have not reported previously or affirm that there is no new information to report. If you have Federal contract, grant, and cooperative agreement awards with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000, you must disclose semiannually any information about the criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings.


(e) *Definitions.* For purposes of this award term—


*Administrative proceeding* means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature to make a determination of fault or liability (for example, Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals proceedings). This includes proceedings at the Federal and State level but only in connection with the performance of a Federal contract or grant. It does not include audits, site visits, corrective plans, or inspection of deliverables.


*Conviction* means a judgment or conviction of a criminal offense by any court of competent jurisdiction, whether entered upon a verdict or a plea, and includes a conviction entered upon a plea of nolo contendere.


Total value of currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts includes the value of the Federal share already received plus any anticipated Federal share under those awards (such as continuation funding).
