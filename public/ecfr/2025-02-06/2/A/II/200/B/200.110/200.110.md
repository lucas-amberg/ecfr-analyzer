# ยง 200.110   Effective date.

(a) The standards set forth in this part affecting the administration of Federal awards by Federal agencies become effective once implemented by Federal agencies or when any future amendment to this part becomes final.


(b) Existing negotiated indirect cost rates will remain in place until they expire. The effective date of changes to indirect cost rates must be based upon the date a newly re-negotiated rate goes into effect for the recipient's or subrecipient's fiscal year. Therefore, for indirect cost rates and cost allocation plans, the revisions to this part (as of the publication date for revisions to this guidance) become effective in generating proposals and negotiating a new rate (when the rate is re-negotiated).
