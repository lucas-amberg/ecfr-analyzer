(a) All Federal financial assistance announcements, applications, and Federal award information should be in the English language and must be in terms of U.S. dollars. However, Federal agencies, recipients, and subrecipients may issue or translate a Federal award or other documents into another language. A Federal agency may translate formal or informal announcements of the availability of Federal funding through a financial assistance program, such as a notice of funding opportunity, when translations may serve to increase the pool of applicants or the participation of a specific community (for example, programs administered in foreign countries where the primary language is not English). Federal agencies must maintain an official controlling English version of the Federal financial assistance announcement and the Federal award, including the terms and conditions.(b) Applications, reports, and official correspondence may be submitted in languages other than English if specified in the notice of funding opportunity or the terms and conditions of the Federal award.


(c) In the event of inconsistency between English and another language, the English language meaning will control. When a significant portion of the recipient's or subrecipient's employees administering a Federal award are not fluent in English, the Federal award should be provided in English and the language(s) with which employees are more familiar.
