# ยง 200.213   Reporting a determination that an applicant is not qualified for a Federal award.

(a) The Federal agency must report in *SAM.gov* if it does not make a Federal award to an applicant because it determines that the applicant does not meet the minimum qualification standards as described in ยง 200.206(a)(2). The Federal agency must report that determination only if all of the following apply:


(1) The only basis for the determination is the applicant's prior record of performance on administering Federal awards or its record of integrity and business ethics, as described in ยง 200.206(a)(2) (meaning, the applicant was determined to be qualified based on all factors other than those two standards); and


(2) The total Federal share of the Federal award was expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold over the period of performance.


(b) The Federal agency is not required to report a determination that an applicant is not qualified for a Federal award if they issue the Federal award in accordance with the requirements of ยง 200.208.


(c) If the Federal agency reports a determination that an applicant is not qualified for a Federal award, the Federal agency also must notify the applicant that:


(1) The determination was made and reported in *SAM.gov*. The notification from the Federal agency to the applicant should also provide a brief explanation for the determination;


(2) The information will be kept in the system for a period of five years from the date of the determination and then archived (See section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended, codified at 41 U.S.C. 2313);


(3) Each Federal agency that considers making a Federal award to the applicant during that five-year period will consider that information in determining the applicant's qualification to receive a Federal award when the total Federal share of a Federal award is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold over the period of performance;


(4) The applicant may review the responsibility and qualification records accessible in *SAM.gov* and comment on any information the system contains about the applicant; and


(5) Federal agencies must consider the applicant's comments in determining whether the applicant is qualified for a future Federal award.


(d) If the Federal agency enters information into *SAM.gov* about a determination that an applicant is not qualified for a Federal award and subsequently:


(1) Learns that any of that information is erroneous, the Federal agency must correct the information in the system within three business days; and


(2) Obtains an update to that information that could be helpful to other Federal agencies, the Federal agency should amend the information in the system within 30 days.


(e) Federal agencies must not post any information that will be made publicly available in the non-public segment of the responsibility and qualification records that is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act. If a recipient asserts within seven calendar days to a Federal agency that some or all of the publicly available information is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act, the Federal agency that posted the information must remove the posting within seven calendar days of receiving the assertion. Prior to reposting the releasable information, the Federal agency must resolve the issue in accordance with the agency's Freedom of Information Act procedures.
