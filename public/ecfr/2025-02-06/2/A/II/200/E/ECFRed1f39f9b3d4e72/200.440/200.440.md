(a) Cost increases for fluctuations in exchange rates are allowable costs subject to the availability of funding. Prior approval of exchange rate fluctuations is required only when the change results in the need for additional Federal funding, or the increased costs result in the need to significantly reduce the scope of the project. Before providing approval, the Federal agency must ensure that adequate funds are available to cover currency fluctuations in order to avoid a violation of the Antideficiency Act.
