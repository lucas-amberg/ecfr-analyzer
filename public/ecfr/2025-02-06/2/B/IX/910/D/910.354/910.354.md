(a) For-Profit Recipients are an exception to 2 CFR 200.305(b)(1) which requires that non-Federal entities be paid in advance as long as certain conditions are met.


(b) For For-Profit Recipients who are paid directly by DOE, reimbursement is the preferred method of payment. Under the reimbursement method of payment, the Federal awarding agency must reimburse the non-Federal entity for its actual cash disbursements. When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal awarding agency must make payment within 30 calendar days after receipt of the billing, unless the Federal awarding agency reasonably believes the request to be improper.
