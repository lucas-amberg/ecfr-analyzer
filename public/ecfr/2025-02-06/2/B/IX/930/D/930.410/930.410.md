# ยง 930.410   Purchase of real property and equipment by for-profit firms.

Federal funds provided under another transaction (OT) agreement to for-profit entities must not be used to purchase real property or equipment. If the OT agreement requires the purchase of real property or equipment, the for-profit entity must use its own funds that are separate from the research, development, and demonstration project. The Agreements Officer, meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer OT agreements, should allow the for-profit participant to charge to an expenditure-based award or include in the cost estimate for fixed-support award, only depreciation or use charges for the real property or equipment. Note that the for-profit must charge depreciation consistently with its usual accounting practices and policies. Many for-profits treat depreciation as an indirect cost. Any for-profit that usually charges depreciation indirectly for a particular type of property must not charge depreciation for that property as a direct cost to the OT agreement.
