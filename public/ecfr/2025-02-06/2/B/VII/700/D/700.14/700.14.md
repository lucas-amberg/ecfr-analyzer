# ยง 700.14   Award Suspension and Termination.

If at any time USAID determines that continuation of all or part of the funding for a program should be suspended or terminated because such assistance would not be in the national interest of the United States or would be in violation of an applicable law, then USAID may, following notice to the recipient, suspend or terminate the award in whole or in part and prohibit the recipient from incurring additional obligations chargeable to the award other than those costs specified in the notice of suspension. If a suspension is put into effect and the situation causing the suspension continues for 60 calendar days or more, then USAID may terminate the award in whole or in part on written notice to the recipient and cancel any portion of the award which has not been disbursed or irrevocably committed to third parties.
