# ยง 1108.3   Definitions of terms used in the Governmentwide cost principles or single audit requirements.

(a) Some DoDGARs provisions state that DoD Components or recipients must comply with single audit or cost principles requirements in a Governmentwide issuance that contains defined terms and include the requirements by reference to the issuance without restating them.


(b) For any term in one of those issuances, this part includes the definition of the term only if the DoDGARs also use that term directly.


(c) If the DoDGARs only use the term indirectly, *i.e.,* through the DoDGARs' reference to the issuance, then this part will not include a definition and a user of the DoDGARs should consult definitions in the pertinent Governmentwide source, as follows:


(1) The Single Audit Act requirements for audits of recipients and subrecipients that are in subpart F of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200;


(2) The Governmentwide cost principles for institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes that are contained in subpart E of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200; and


(3) The cost principles for for-profit entities at Subpart 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31, as supplemented by provisions of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement at subpart 231.2 of 48 CFR part 231.
