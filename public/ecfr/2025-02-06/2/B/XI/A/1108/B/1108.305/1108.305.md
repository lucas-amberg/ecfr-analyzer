# § 1108.305   Procurement transaction.

*Procurement transaction* means a legal instrument by which a recipient or subrecipient purchases property or services it needs to carry out the project or program under its award or subaward, respectively. A procurement transaction is distinct both from “subaward” and “procurement contract,” as those terms are defined in this subpart.
