# ยง 1108.70   Basic research.

*Basic research* means efforts directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in science and engineering, rather than the practical application of that knowledge and understanding. It typically is funded within Basic Research (Budget Activity 1) programs within DoD's Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriations. For the purposes of the DoDGARs, basic research includes:


(a) Research-related, science and engineering education and training, including graduate fellowships and research traineeships; and


(b) Research instrumentation and other activities designed to enhance the infrastructure for science and engineering research.
