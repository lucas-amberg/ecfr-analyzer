# § 1108.90   Contract.

*Contract* means a procurement transaction, as that term is defined in this subpart. A contract is a transaction into which a recipient or subrecipient enters. It is therefore distinct from the term “procurement contract,” which is a transaction that a DoD Component awards at the prime tier.
