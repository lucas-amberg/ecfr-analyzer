# ยง 1120.405   Content of the preamble.

The preamble for each set of general terms and conditions must include at least the following information elements, organized in the order shown:


(a) *Table of contents.* This should show the articles within each other subdivision of the general terms and conditions (Subdivisions B and C for administrative and national policy requirements and, if needed, Subdivision D for programmatic requirements).


(b) *Scope.* This element identifies the programs, types of awards, and types of recipient entities that are subject to the set of general terms and conditions.


(c) *Effective date.* This is the date on which the particular version of the set of general terms and conditions became effective, which enables a recipient to easily distinguish it from any earlier or subsequent versions. The version date of each article within the general terms and conditions must be indicated in parentheses following the title of the article, to help a recipient identify the articles that changed from previous versions of the general terms and conditions.


(d) *English language.* The purpose of this element of the preamble is to implement OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.111(b) by informing each recipient that:


(1) It must translate any of the award content (including attachments to it and any material incorporated into the award by reference) into another language to the extent that the recipient's compliance with the award's terms and conditions depends upon a significant number of its employees who are not fluent in English being able to read and comprehend that content.


(2) If it does translate any award content into another language, either as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section or at its own initiative, the original award content in the English language will take precedence in the event of an inconsistency between the award requirements in the English and translated versions.


(e) *Plain language.* This section of the preamble is required when the general terms and conditions use personal pronouns, in accordance with ยง 1120.310. Its purpose is to inform recipients about the meanings of those personal pronouns.


(f) *Definitions.* Providing the definitions of words and phrases that are used in the general terms and conditions and defined in the DoDGARs is more helpful to recipients than referring them to the DoDGARs to find the definitions.
