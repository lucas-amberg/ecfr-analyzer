# ยง 1120.700   Scope of programmatic requirements.

A requirement is most appropriately included in the programmatic requirements portion of the general terms and conditions if it:


(a) Is not in one of the subject matter areas covered by the administrative requirements in Subdivision B of the general terms and conditions, as described in ยง 1120.500.


(b) Does not meet the criteria in ยง 1120.600 for a national policy requirement.


(c) Broadly applies to awards using the general terms and conditions. Requirements that apply to relatively few of those awards are more appropriately included in the award-specific terms and conditions of the individual awards to which they apply.


(d) Is expected to be in effect for the foreseeable future, rather than for a limited period of time. For example, a requirement in an annual appropriations act that applies specifically to funding made available by that act is better addressed through the award-specific terms and conditions of awards or modifications to which it applies.
