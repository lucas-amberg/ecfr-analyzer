Flood-prone areas and provide any help we may need to comply with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. 4001 *et seq.*), which require flood insurance, when available, for federally assisted construction or acquisition in flood-prone areas.
