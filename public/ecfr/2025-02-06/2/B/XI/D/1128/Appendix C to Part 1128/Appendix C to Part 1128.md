# Appendix C to Part 1128—Terms and Conditions for FMS Article III, “Allowable Costs, Period of Availability of Funds, and Fee or Profit”


Unless a DoD Component reserves sections or paragraphs of this article, as permitted by §§ 1128.310 through 1128.325, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the following wording for FMS Article III.


*Section A. Allowable costs.* This section, with the clarification provided in Section B, specifies which Federal cost principles must be used in determining the allowability of costs charged to this award, a subrecipient's costs charged to any cost-type subaward that you make under this award, and a contractor's costs charged to any cost-type procurement transaction into which you enter under this award. These cost principles also govern the allowable costs that you or a subrecipient of a subaward at any tier below this award may consider when establishing the amount of any fixed-amount subaward or fixed-price procurement transaction at the next lower tier. The set of cost principles to be used in each case depends on the type of entity incurring the cost under the award, subaward, or contract.


1. *General case.* If you, your subrecipient, or your contractor is:


a. *An institution of higher education*, the allowability of costs must be determined in accordance with provisions of Subpart E of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 other than 2 CFR 200.400(g), supplemented by appendix III to that part.


b. *A hospital*, the allowability of costs must be determined in accordance with provisions of appendix IX to 2 CFR part 200, which currently specifies the cost principles in appendix IX to 45 CFR part 75 as the applicable cost principles.


c. *A nonprofit organization other than a hospital or institution of higher education*, the allowability of costs must be determined in accordance with provisions of Subpart E of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 other than 2 CFR 200.400(g), supplemented by appendices IV and VIII to that part. In accordance with guidance in 2 CFR 200.401(c), a nonprofit organization listed in appendix VIII to 2 CFR part 200 is subject to the cost principles for for-profit entities specified in paragraph 1.e of this section.


d. *A State, local government, or Indian tribe*, the allowability of costs must be determined in accordance with applicable provisions of Subpart E of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 other than 2 CFR 200.400(g), supplemented by appendices V through VII to that part.


e. *A for-profit entity (other than a hospital) or a nonprofit organization listed in appendix VIII to 2 CFR part 200:*

i. The allowability of costs must be determined in accordance with:


(A) The cost principles for commercial organizations in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at Subpart 31.2 of 48 CFR part 31, as supplemented by provisions of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) at Subpart 231.2 of 48 CFR part 231; and


(B) For a for-profit entity, the additional provisions on allowability of audit costs, in 32 CFR 34.16(f).


ii. The indirect cost rate to use in that determination is:


(A) The for-profit entity's federally negotiated indirect cost rate if it has one.


(B) Subject to negotiation between you and the for-profit entity if it does not have a federally negotiated indirect cost rate. The rate that you negotiate may provide for reimbursement only of costs that are allowable in accordance with the cost principles specified in paragraph A.1.e.i of this article.


2. *Exception.* You may use your own cost principles in determining the allowability of a contractor's costs charged to a cost-type procurement transaction under this award—or in pricing for a fixed-price contract based on estimated costs—as long as your cost principles comply with the Federal cost principles that paragraph A.1 of this section identifies as applicable to the contractor.


*Section B. Clarifications concerning charges for professional journal publications.* For an entity that Section A of this article makes subject to the cost principles in Subpart E of 2 CFR part 200:


1. Costs of publishing in professional journals are allowable under 2 CFR 200.461(b) only if they are consistently applied across the organization. An organization may not charge costs of journal publications as direct costs to this award if it charges any of the same type of costs for other journal publications as indirect costs.


2. “Costs of publication or sharing of research results” in 2 CFR 200.461(b)(3) are the “charges for professional journal publications” described in 2 CFR 200.461(b) and subject to the conditions of 2 CFR 200.461(b)(1) and (2).


*Section C. Period of availability of funds.* You may charge to this award only:


1. Allowable costs incurred during the period of performance specified in this award, including any subsequent amendments to it;


2. Any pre-award costs that you are authorized (by either the terms and conditions of FMS Article IV or the DoD awarding official) to incur prior to the start of the period of performance, at your own risk, for purposes of the project or program under this award; and


3. Costs of publishing in professional journals incurred after the period of performance, as permitted under 2 CFR 200.461(b)(3), if:


a. We receive the request for payment for such costs no later than the date on which REP Article II requires you to submit the final financial report to us (or, if we grant your request for an extension of the due date, that later date on which the report is due); and


b. Your reported expenditures on the final financial report include the amount you disbursed for those costs.


*Section D. Fee or profit.*

1. You may not receive any fee or profit under this award.


2. You may not use funds available to you under this award to pay fee or profit to an entity of any type to which you make a subaward.


3. You may pay fee or profit to an entity with which you enter into a procurement transaction to purchase goods or general support services for your use in carrying out the project or program under the award.
