# § 1128.215   Payment requirements for institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, local governments, and Indian tribes.

(a) *Policy.* OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.305 addresses the use of three payment methods for grants and cooperative agreements—advance payments, reimbursement, and working capital advances. Two of the methods pertain to a DoD Component's general terms and conditions, as described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.


(1) *Advance payments.* With the possible exception of construction awards, as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must authorize each recipient to request payments in advance as long as the recipient maintains, or demonstrates the willingness to maintain, both:


(i) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between its receipt of funds from the Federal Government and its disbursement of the funds for project or program purposes; and


(ii) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability specified in the wording of FMS Article I (see Subpart A and appendix A to this part).


(2) *Reimbursement.* A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may specify the reimbursement method if the awards using those terms and conditions will support construction projects financed in whole or in part by the Federal Government.


(b) *Award terms and conditions*—(1) *General.* Appendix B provides wording for Section B of FMS Article II that a DoD Component:


(i) Must use in general terms and conditions for non-construction awards to authorize recipients to request advance payments; and


(ii) May use in general terms and conditions for construction awards if it elects to authorize recipients of those awards to request advance payments.


(2) *Alternative award terms and conditions.* A DoD Component may develop an alternative to appendix B's wording for Section B of FMS Article II to use in general terms and conditions for construction awards, if it elects to specify reimbursement as the payment method for those awards. The alternative:


(i) Would replace appendix B's wording for paragraph B.1 with wording to specify the reimbursement method of payment;


(ii) Must include appendix B's wording for paragraphs B.2.b and c, B.4, and B.5, which may be renumbered as appropriate, because those paragraphs apply to reimbursements as well as advance payments;


(iii) Should omit appendix B's wording for paragraphs B.2.a, B.3, and B.6 because those paragraphs apply specifically to advance payments; and


(iv) Must inform recipients that the DoD payment office generally makes payment within 30 calendar days after receipt of the request for reimbursement by the award administration office, unless the request is reasonably believed to be improper.
