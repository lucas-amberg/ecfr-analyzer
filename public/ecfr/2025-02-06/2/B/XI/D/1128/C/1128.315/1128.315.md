# § 1128.315   Clarification concerning allowability of publication costs.

(a) *Requirement.* A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must clarify that a recipient must charge publication costs consistently as either direct or indirect costs in order for those costs to be allowable charges to DoD grants and cooperative agreements.


(b) *Award terms and conditions*—(1) *General.* To clarify the allowability of publication costs, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section B of FMS Article III.


(2) *Exception.* A DoD Component may instead reserve Section B of FMS Article III in its general terms and conditions if the DoD Component determines that there will be no publication costs under any of the awards using those general terms and conditions.
