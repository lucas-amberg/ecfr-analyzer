(a) *OMB guidance.* OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(1) through (4) addresses prior approval requirements for revisions of a recipient's budget and program plans under a construction grant or cooperative agreement or construction activities under an award that supports both construction and non-construction activities.


(b) *DoD implementation of the guidance.* DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(1) through (4) through terms and conditions of awards for construction. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for construction awards may require additional prior approvals for budget and program revisions (*i.e.,* prior approvals other than those authorized by this subpart) only in accordance with the exceptions provisions of 2 CFR 1126.3.


(c) *Award terms and conditions.* In a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for construction awards or awards supporting construction activities, the DoD Component:


(1) Must include the wording that appendix D to this part provides for paragraph B.2 of FMS Article IV.


(2) May reserve or remove the wording appendix D to this part provides for paragraph B.1 and Section C of FMS Article IV unless some awards using the general terms and conditions will also support non-construction activities (if the DoD Component elects to remove Section C, it should redesignate Section D in the article as Section C).
