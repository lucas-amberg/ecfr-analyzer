# ยง 1128.610   General requirement for cost sharing or matching.

(a) *Requirement.* (1) FMS Article VI of the general terms and conditions must tell a recipient that:


(i) It may find the amount or percentage of cost sharing or matching required under its award in the award cover pages.


(ii) The cost sharing or matching amount or percentage identified in the award includes all required (but not voluntary uncommitted) contributions to the project or program by the recipient and its subrecipients, including any that involve third-party contributions or donations to the recipient and subrecipients.


(iii) It must obtain the DoD Component's prior approval for any change in the required amount or percentage of cost share or match.


(2) At a DoD Component's option, FMS Article VI also may require a recipient to obtain the DoD Component's prior approval if it wishes to substitute alternative cost sharing or matching contributions in lieu of specific contributions included in the approved budget (*e.g.,* to use a third-party in-kind contribution not included in the approved budget).


(b) *Award terms and conditions.* To implement paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section A of FMS Article VI. A DoD Component may insert wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.2.b if it elects to require recipients to obtain prior approval before substituting alternative cost sharing or matching contributions, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
