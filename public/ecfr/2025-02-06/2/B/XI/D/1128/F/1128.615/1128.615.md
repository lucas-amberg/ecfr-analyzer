# § 1128.615   General criteria for determining allowability as cost sharing or matching.

(a) *OMB guidance.* The OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(b) lists the basic criteria for the allowability of cost sharing or matching under grants and cooperative agreements.


(b) *Award terms and conditions*—(1) *General.* A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section B of FMS Article VI to specify the allowability of cash or third-party in-kind contributions as cost sharing or matching.


(2) *Exception.* A DoD Component may reserve paragraph B.4 of Section B of FMS Article VI in its general terms and conditions, or replace it with appropriate alternative wording, if the DoD Component has statutory authority to accept costs reimbursed by other Federal awards as cost sharing or matching under the awards using its general terms and conditions.
