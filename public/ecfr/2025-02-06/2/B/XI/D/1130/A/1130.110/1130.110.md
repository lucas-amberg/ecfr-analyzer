(a) *OMB guidance.* OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.316 describes the property trust relationship. It states that:


(1) Recipients must hold real property, equipment, and intangible property acquired or improved under grants or cooperative agreements in trust for the beneficiaries of the projects or programs under which the property was acquired or improved; and


(2) A Federal agency may require a recipient to record liens or other appropriate notices of record to indicate that personal or real property was acquired or improved under a grant or cooperative agreement, making the property's use and disposition subject to the award terms and conditions.


(b) *DoD implementation.* A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that recipients hold title to real property, equipment, and intangible property acquired or improved under DoD grants and cooperative agreements in trust for the beneficiaries of the projects or programs carried out under those awards.


(c) *Award terms and conditions.* A DoD Component's general terms and conditions:


(1) Must include the wording appendix A to this part provides for paragraph B.1 of PROP Article I, except that a DoD Component may instead reserve Section B if there will be no acquisition or improvement of real property, equipment, or intangible property under awards using those general terms and conditions or subawards under those awards.


(2) May add wording to the reserved paragraph B.2 of the wording of Section B of PROP Article I to require recipients to record liens or other notices of record, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.
