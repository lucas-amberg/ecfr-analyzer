# ยง 1130.120   Federal interest in donated property.

(a) *Requirement.* A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must inform recipients that the Federal Government acquires an interest in any real property or equipment for which the value of the remaining life of the property in the recipient's accounting records or the fair market value of the property is counted toward required cost sharing or matching, rather than charging depreciation.


(b) *Award terms and conditions.* A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must either:


(1) Include the wording appendix A to this part provides for Section D of PROP Article I to specify the Federal interest in donated real property or equipment; or


(2) Reserve Section D of PROP Article I if the DoD Component does not permit recipients to count the fair market value of real property or equipment toward cost sharing or matching.
