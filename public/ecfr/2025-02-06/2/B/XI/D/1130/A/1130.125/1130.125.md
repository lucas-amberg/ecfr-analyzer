(1) Include the wording appendix A to this part provides for Section E of PROP Article I to specify the Federal interest in improved real property or equipment; or


(2) Reserve Section E of PROP Article I if there will be no improvements to real property or equipment under awards using those general terms and conditions or subawards under those awards.
