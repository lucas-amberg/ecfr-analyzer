# Appendix F to Part 1130—Terms and Conditions for PROP Article VI, “Intangible Property”


Except for Section B, whose language must be tailored or reserved based on the type of award as specified in § 1130.610, and Section D if reserved as provided in § 1130.615, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for PROP Article VI.


*Section A. Assertion of copyright.*

1. You may assert copyright in any work that is eligible for copyright protection if you acquire ownership of it under this award, either by developing it or otherwise.


2. With respect to any work, you developed or otherwise acquired under this award, DoD reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable license to:


a. Reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work for Federal Government purposes; and


b. Authorize others to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work for Federal Government purposes.


*Section B. Inventions developed under the award.*

1. *Applicability of Governmentwide clause for research awards.* You must comply with the Governmentwide patent rights award clause published at 37 CFR 401.14, with the modifications described in paragraph B.2 of this section. DoD adopts that Governmentwide clause for the following entities, thereby broadening the applicability beyond types of entities included in the definition of “contractor” in 37 CFR part 401:


a. Any governmental or nonprofit entity (the types of entities subject to these general terms and conditions) receiving a DoD award for the performance of experimental, research, or developmental work;


b. Any governmental, nonprofit, or for-profit entity receiving a subaward to perform experimental, research, or developmental work under an award described in paragraph B.1.a of this section.


2. *Modifications to the wording of the Governmentwide clause.* DoD adopts the Governmentwide clause at 37 CFR 401.14, as described in paragraph B.1 of this section, with the following modifications:


a. *Terminology.* Throughout the Governmentwide clause:


i. Insert the terms “recipient” and “subrecipient (or contractor to the recipient or to a subrecipient)” to replace the terms “contractor” and “subcontractor,” respectively.


ii. Insert the terms “award” and “subaward (or contract under either the award or a subaward)” to replace the terms “contract” and “subcontract,” respectively.


b. *Final report.* Add a new subparagraph (f)(5) to read, “The recipient must submit a final report listing all subject inventions made under the award or stating that there were none. The final report is due 90 calendar days after the end date of the period of performance unless you request, and we grant, an extension of the due date.”


c. *Broadening applicability to all entities.* Delete paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of the Governmentwide clause, redesignate paragraph (g)(1) as paragraph (g) and delete the phrase “to be performed by a small business firm or domestic nonprofit organization” from paragraph (g) as redesignated.


*Section C. Data produced under the award.*

1. *Data in general.* The Federal Government has the right to:


a. Obtain, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the data produced under this award; and


b. Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the data produced under this award for Federal Government purposes.


2. *Research data requested under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).*

a. If we receive a request under the FOIA for “research data” that are related to “published research findings” produced under this award and that were “used by the Federal Government in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law,” you must provide the data to us within a reasonable time after we request it from you, so that the data can be made available to the public through procedures established under the FOIA.


b. For purposes of the requirement in paragraph C.2.a of this section, 2 CFR 200.315(e) provides definitions of the phrases “published research findings,” “used by the Federal Government in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law,” and “research data.”


*Section D. Use and disposition of intangible property acquired, but not developed or produced, under the award.*

1. *Applicability.* This section applies to a patent, patent application, copyright, or other intangible property acquired, but not developed or produced, under this award.


2. *Use.* You:


a. Must use the intangible property for the authorized purpose under this award until the intangible property is no longer needed for that purpose, whether or not that purpose is still being supported by this award.


b. May not encumber the intangible property without the prior written approval of the award administration office.


3. *Disposition.* When the intangible property is no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, you must contact the award administration office to arrange for disposition in accordance with the procedures specified for disposition of equipment in either section B or D of PROP Article IV, as applicable.
