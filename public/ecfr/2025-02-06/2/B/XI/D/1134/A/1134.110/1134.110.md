# § 1134.110   Performance reporting for non-construction awards.

(a) *OMB guidance.* OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(f) states that an agency may waive any performance report that it does not need.


(b) *DoD implementation*—(1) *Interim reports.* DoD Components should waive requirements for interim performance reports under non-construction awards, including research awards, only when program managers have an alternative source for the information that the reports provide in support of the need for technical program oversight during the period of performance.


(2) *Final reports*—(i) *Research.* DoD Components may not waive requirements for final performance reports under research awards, even when program managers have other sources of the information they contain. A primary purpose of a final report under a research award is to document the overall project or program well enough to serve as a long-term reference from which others may understand the purpose, scope, approach, results or outcomes, and conclusions or recommendations of the research.


(ii) *Non-construction awards other than research.* DoD Components should consider the long-term value of final performance reports for documenting program outcomes, as well as any near-term value, before waiving requirements for final reports under other non-construction awards.


(c) *Award terms and conditions.* Appendix A to this part provides a template for REP Article I of the general terms and conditions of research awards or other non-construction awards under which performance reports are required. A DoD Component must either use the wording that appendix A provides or insert wording into the template, in accordance with §§ 1134.115 through 1134.145, to:


(1) Specify the content and form, format, or data elements recipients must use for interim and final performance reporting (see § 1134.115);


(2) Specify the reporting frequency, reporting periods, and due dates for interim performance reports (see § 1134.120);


(3) Specify the due dates and reporting periods for final performance reports (see § 1134.125);


(4) Specify that recipients may request extensions of due dates for performance reports (see § 1134.130);


(5) Require recipients to report significant developments (see § 1134.135);


(6) Specify reporting procedures (see § 1134.140); and


(7) Reserve the DoD Component's right to make site visits (see § 1134.145).
