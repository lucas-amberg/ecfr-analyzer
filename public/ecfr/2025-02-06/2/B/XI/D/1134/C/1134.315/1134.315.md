# § 1134.315   Federally owned property: inventory, notifications, and requests.

(a) *Requirement.* REP Article III of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the reporting requirement described in § 1134.300(a)(2) and provide the references described in § 1134.300(b)(4) to requirements in other articles for notifications and requests related to federally owned property.


(b) *Policy.* (1) Except as provided by statute or in regulations adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment, a DoD Component may not specify:


(i) Due dates for the annual inventories of federally owned property; or


(ii) Forms, formats, or specific data elements for the inventories, notifications, or requests for disposition instructions. Any form, format, or data elements that a DoD Component specifies must be cleared by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, as implemented by OMB at 5 CFR part 1320.


(2) Not specifying due dates, forms, formats, or data elements provides flexibility for recipients and DoD post-award administrators to handle these requirements in ways that reduce burdens and costs. For example, a recipient may arrange with a post-award administration office to submit one consolidated inventory annually for federally owned property under all of the awards it receives that are administered by that office, using a format its property management system already generates.


(c) *Award terms and conditions*—(1) *General.* To implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section C of REP Article III. The DoD Component may add wording on due dates or on forms, formats, or data elements only as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.


(2) *Exception.* A DoD Component may reserve Section C of REP Article III if it determines that no recipients of awards using its general terms and conditions, or subrecipients of subawards under those awards, will be accountable for federally owned property under those awards or subawards.
