# Appendix D to Part 1136—Terms and Conditions for OAR Article IV, “Claims, Disputes, and Appeals”


As specified in § 1136.405, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for OAR Article IV, with the required insertion in paragraph A.2 of the article, along with any additional wording permitted by that section.


*Section A. Definitions.*

1. *Claim.* The definition of the term “claim,” as it is used in this article, is in the definitions section of the preamble to these general terms and conditions.


2. *Grant Appeal Authority.* [Reserved]


*Section B. Submission of claims.*

1. *Your claims.* To submit a claim arising out of this award, you must submit it in writing to the grants officer for decision, specify the nature and basis for the relief you are requesting, and include all data that supports your claim.


2. *Federal Government claims.* You will receive a written grants officer's decision if a DoD claim arises out of this award.


*Section C. Alternative dispute resolution.*

1. We encourage resolution of all issues related to this award by mutual agreement between you and the grants officer.


2. If you and the grants officer are unable to resolve an issue through unassisted negotiations, we encourage use of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) procedures to try to do so. ADR procedures are any voluntary means, such as mini-trials or mediation, used to resolve issues in controversy. ADR procedures may be used prior to submission of a claim or at any other time prior to the Grant Appeal Authority's decision on any appeal you submit.


*Section D. Grants officer decisions for claims you submit.*

1. Within 60 calendar days of receiving your claim, the grants officer will either:


a. Transmit a written decision that:


i. Identifies data on which the decision is based; and


ii. Identifies and provides the mailing address for the Grant Appeal Authority to whom you would submit an appeal of the decision if you elect to do so; or


b. If more time is required to render a written decision, notify you of a specific date when he or she will render the decision and inform you of the reason for delaying it.


2. The grants officer's decision will be final unless you decide to appeal, in which case we encourage use of ADR procedures as noted in Section C of this article.


*Section E. Formal administrative appeals.*

1. *Right to appeal.* You have the right to appeal a grants officer's decision to the Grant Appeal Authority identified in Section A of this article.


2. *Notice of appeal.* You may appeal a grants officer's decision within 90 calendar days of receiving the decision by submitting a written notice of appeal to the Grant Appeal Authority and grants officer. If you elect to use ADR procedures, you are allowed an additional 60 calendar days to submit the written notice of appeal.


3. *Appeal file.* Within 30 calendar days of the grants officer's receipt of your notice of appeal, you should receive the appeal file with copies of all documents relevant to the appeal. You may supplement the file with other documents you deem relevant and with a memorandum in support of your position for the Grant Appeal Authority's consideration. The Grant Appeal Authority may request additional information from you.


4. *Decision.* Unless the Grant Appeal Authority decides to conduct fact-finding procedures or an oral hearing on the appeal, the appeal will be decided solely on the basis of the written record. Any fact-finding or hearing will be conducted using procedures that the Grant Appeal Authority deems appropriate.


*Section F. Representation.* You may be represented by counsel or any other designated representative in any claim, appeal, or ADR proceeding, as long as the representative is not otherwise prohibited by law or regulation from appearing before the DoD Component concerned.


*Section G. Effect of Grant Appeal Authority's decision.* The Grant Appeal Authority's decision is the final administrative decision of DoD and cannot be further appealed within DoD.


*Section H. Non-exclusivity of remedies.* Nothing in this article is intended to limit your right to any remedy under the law.
