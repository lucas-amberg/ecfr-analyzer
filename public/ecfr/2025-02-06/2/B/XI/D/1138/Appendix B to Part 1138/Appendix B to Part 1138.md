# Appendix B to Part 1138—Terms and Conditions for SUB Article II, “Pre-Award and Time of Award Responsibilities”


Unless modified as provided in § 1138.5, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for SUB Article II.


*Section A. Requirements for unique entity identifiers.*

1. *Definition of “entity.”* For purposes of the unique entity identifier requirements in paragraphs A.2 and 3 of this section, “entity” has the meaning given in paragraph C.3 of appendix A to OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 25.


2. *Pre-notification of potential subrecipients.* You must notify potential subrecipients that no entity may receive a subaward from you under this award unless it has provided its unique entity identifier to you.


3. *Restriction on making subawards.*

a. *General.* You may not make a subaward to an entity unless the entity has provided its unique entity identifier to you.


b. *Exception.* You may make a subaward to an entity that has not provided its unique entity identifier to you in rare cases in which you requested, and we approved, an exemption from the requirement for the entity to provide a unique entity identifier, based on the criteria in OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 25.110(d).


*Section B. Pre-award risk assessment.*

1. Before making a subaward to an entity, you must perform a risk assessment of the prospective subrecipient, as described in 2 CFR 200.331(b). OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.205(c) provides examples of factors you may consider in evaluating risk.


2. As part of the risk assessment under paragraph B.1 of this article, you must:


a. Verify that neither the prospective subrecipient nor its principals under the subaward are excluded or disqualified from participating in the transaction, in accordance with requirements in Subpart C of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 180, as implemented by DoD at 2 CFR part 1125; and


b. If warranted by risks you identify, determine whether to impose award-specific terms and conditions in the subaward to mitigate the risks.


i. These award-specific terms and conditions may be in addition to, or differ from, the terms and conditions that SUB Articles IV through IX of this award require you to include in subawards.


ii. They may include items such as those listed in OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.207(b)(1) through (6).


iii. Your procedures for imposing and removing the additional or different requirements must comply with the procedural guidance in 2 CFR 200.207(c) and (d).


*Section C. Subaward content.*

1. *Cost-type subawards.*

a. SUB Article III of this award specifies informational content that you must include in each cost-type subaward.


b. SUB Articles IV through VIII specify administrative requirements that you must include:


i. As applicable, in each cost-type subaward to:


(A) A domestic U.S. entity (*i.e.,* an entity other than a foreign public entity or a foreign organization); or


(B) An organizational unit of a foreign organization if that unit has a place of business in the United States; and


ii. To the maximum extent practicable in each cost-type subaward to either a foreign public entity or an organizational unit of a foreign organization that does not have a place of business in the United States (regardless of whether another organizational unit of that foreign organization has one). However, absent our prior approval, you may not allow that foreign entity or organization to acquire real property or equipment under a subaward.


c. SUB Article IX of this award specifies national policy requirements that you must include, as applicable, in each cost-type subaward.


2. *Fixed-amount type subawards.*

a. Sections A through F of SUB Article III of this award specify informational content that you must include in each fixed-amount subaward.


b. SUB Article IX of this award specifies national policy requirements that you must include, as applicable, in each fixed-amount subaward.

i. A domestic U.S. entity (*i.e.,* an entity other than a foreign public entity or a foreign organization); or


ii. An organizational unit of a foreign organization if that unit has a place of business in the United States; and


iii. To the maximum extent practicable to either a foreign public entity or an organizational unit of a foreign organization that does not have a place of business in the United States (regardless of whether another organizational unit of that foreign organization has one). However, absent our prior approval, you may not allow that foreign entity or organization to acquire real property or equipment under a subaward.


3. *Additional subaward terms and conditions.* You may include other requirements in your subawards that you need in order to meet your responsibilities under this award for performance of the project or program (including portions performed by subrecipients) and compliance with applicable administrative and national policy requirements.


*Section D. Subaward and executive compensation reporting.* You must report subaward obligating actions and information on subrecipients' executive compensation as required by REP Article IV of this award.
