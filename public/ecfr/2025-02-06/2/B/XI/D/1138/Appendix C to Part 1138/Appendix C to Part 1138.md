# Appendix C to Part 1138—Terms and Conditions for SUB Article III, “Informational Content of Subawards”


Unless modified as provided in § 1138.5, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for SUB Article III.


*Section A. Informational content in general.* You must include in each subaward (and each subsequent amendment to a subaward that alters the amount of the subaward) the information specified in OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1), “Federal Award Identification,” with the clarifications provided in Sections B through G of this article.


*Section B. Federal award identification number and award date.* The “Federal Award Identification Number” and “Federal Award Date” described in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1)(iii) and (iv), respectively, are the award number and award date for this award to you. You must provide the information in a way that makes it clear that the subaward is under this DoD award.


*Section C. Amount of Federal funds obligated.*

1. The “Amount of Federal Funds Obligated by this action by the pass-through entity to the subrecipient” that is described in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1)(vi) is either:


a. The amount of your obligation to the subrecipient, if the terms and conditions of this award do not require you to provide any cost sharing or matching for the project or program the award supports; or


b. The amount of the Federal share of your subaward obligation if this award does require cost sharing or matching, which in that case is the product of:


i. The Federal share of total project costs under this DoD award to you, as a percentage of those total project costs; and


ii. The total amount of project costs obligated for the subaward action.


2. Note that the total project costs of the award and subaward, as used in paragraphs C.1.b.i and ii of this section, include any cost sharing or matching that you or the subrecipient provides if you are counting it toward the cost sharing or matching required under this award.


*Section D. Total amount obligated to the subrecipient.* The “Total Amount of Federal Funds Obligated to the Subrecipient by the pass-through entity including the current obligation,” as described in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1)(vii), is the cumulative amount to date of the amounts described in Section C of this article.


*Section E. Total Amount of the Federal Award.* The “Total Amount of the Federal Award committed to the subrecipient by the pass-through entity,” as described in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1)(viii), is the total amount through the end of the subaward that you and the subrecipient mutually agreed upon, to include: Funding obligated to date, any future anticipated funding increments, and any options you may exercise in the future.


*Section F. Federal awarding agency, pass-through entity, and awarding official.* The “Name of Federal awarding agency” and “pass-through entity,” as those terms are used in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1)(x) are the DoD and the business name associated with your registration in SAM. In that same paragraph of 2 CFR part 200, the “awarding official” is the individual in your organization who made the subaward.


*Section G. Indirect cost rate.* With respect to the requirement in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1)(xiii) for the subaward to include the “Indirect cost rate for the Federal award:”


1. This requirement applies to cost-type subawards only.


2. The rate the subaward must include is the subrecipient's rate, whether it is a rate set by negotiation with a Federal agency or you or is the de minimis rate described in 2 CFR 200.414(f).


3. You are required to include the indirect cost rate only if the subrecipient is willing to share that information with you and assents that information about its rate is not proprietary. If a subrecipient is not willing to share information about its indirect cost rate with you, consult the grants officer for this award to explore alternative ways to assess the reasonableness of costs of the subaward.
