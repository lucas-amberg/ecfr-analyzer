# Appendix D to Part 1138—Terms and Conditions for SUB Article IV, “Financial and Program Management Requirements for Subawards”


Unless modified as provided in § 1138.5, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for SUB Article IV.


*Section A. Purposes of this article in relation to other articles.*

1. This article specifies administrative requirements concerning financial and program management that you must include in the terms and conditions of each cost-type subaward that you make under this award to a domestic entity.


2. It thereby addresses the flow down to subrecipients of requirements with which you must comply under FMS Articles I through VII of this award.


3. SUB Article XII of this award addresses which of these administrative requirements you must include in any fixed-amount subaward that you make, if you are authorized to make fixed-amount subawards under this award.


*Section B. Financial management system standards.* You must include in any subaward you make under this award the requirements of:


1. Sections A through C of FMS Article I of this award if the subrecipient is a State;


2. Sections B and C of FMS Article I if the subrecipient is an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, local government, or Indian tribe; or


3. 32 CFR 34.11 if the subrecipient is a for-profit entity.


*Section C. Payments.*

1. *Subawards to States.* You must include the provisions of Section A of FMS Article II of this award in each subaward you make to a State;


2. *Subawards to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, local governments, and Indian tribes.* The following paragraphs specify requirements you must include in subawards to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, local governments, and Indian tribes.


a. *Payment method.*

i. If you are authorized to request advance payments under this award, you must authorize a subrecipient to request advance payments unless:


(A) The subrecipient does not maintain, or demonstrate the willingness to maintain, written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between its receipt of each payment and its disbursement of the funds for project or program purposes;


(B) You impose a requirement for the subrecipient to be paid by reimbursement as a result of your risk evaluation of the subrecipient under SUB Article II of this award.


(C) The subaward is for construction.


ii. If you do not authorize advance payments for one of the reasons given in paragraph C.2.a.i of this article, you must specify either reimbursement or working capital advances as the payment method in accordance with OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.305(b)(3) and (4).


b. *Payment timing and amount.*

i. *Advances.* You must limit advance payments to the minimum amounts needed and time the payments to be in accordance with the subrecipient's actual, immediate cash requirements in carrying out the project or program under the subaward. The timing and amount of your advance payments to the subrecipient must be as close as is administratively feasible to the subrecipient's actual disbursements for direct project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs. Your subawards also must include the requirements of paragraphs B.2.b and c of FMS Article II to specify costs subrecipients must exclude from amounts of their advance payment requests.


ii. *Reimbursements or working capital advances.* You must follow OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.305(b)(3) and (4) concerning timing and amount of reimbursements or working capital advances.


c. *Frequency of requests.* You must allow the subrecipient to request advance payments or reimbursements, including those associated with the working capital advance payment method, as often as it wishes if you pay using electronic funds transfers and at least monthly otherwise.


d. *Other requirements.*

i. In any subaward that was subject to our consent, you must include the requirements of paragraph B.5 of FMS Article II of this award concerning withholding of payments.


ii. You must include the provisions of paragraph B.6 of FMS Article II concerning depositories in each subaward that authorizes the subrecipient to request advance payments.


3. *Subawards to for-profit entities.* The provision concerning payments in each subaward you make to a for-profit entity must conform to the requirements in 32 CFR 34.12.


*Section D. Allowable costs, period of availability of funds, and fee and profit.*

1. You must include in each cost-type subaward a requirement that the allowability of costs under the subaward (and any lower-tier subawards or procurement transactions into which the subrecipient enters) must be determined in accordance with the applicable cost principles identified in Section A of FMS Article III of this award, as well as the clarification in Section B of that article if it applies to those cost principles.


2. You must specify in each subaward the period of availability of funds for any project or program purpose so that the period neither begins before nor ends after the period during which you may use funds available to you under this award for that same project or program purpose.


3. You must include in each subaward the provisions concerning fee or profit that are in Section D of FMS Article III of this award.


*Section E. Revision of budget and program plans.* You must include in each subaward provisions requiring the subrecipient to request your approval for any change in the subaward budget or program that would cause a budget or program change under this award for which Section B of FMS Article IV requires you to first obtain our prior approval. You may not approve any budget or program revision that is inconsistent with the purpose or terms and conditions of this award.


*Section F. Non-Federal audits.* You must include a provision in each subaward that you make under this award to require the subrecipient entity to comply with the audit requirements applicable to that entity, as specified in either Section A or Section B of FMS Article V.


*Section G. Cost sharing or matching requirements.* If you make a subaward under which the subrecipient may provide contributions or donations of cash or third-party in-kind contributions to be counted toward any cost sharing or matching that is required under this award, you must include provisions in that subaward to specify:


1. The criteria governing the allowability as cost sharing or matching of the types of cash or third-party in-kind contributions that the subrecipient may contribute or donate. Those criteria are specified in:


a. Sections B through D of FMS Article VI of this award if the subaward is to a State, institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, local government, or Indian tribe.


b. The provisions of 32 CFR 34.13(a) if the subaward is to a for-profit entity.


2. The methods for determining and documenting the values of those contributions or donations to be counted as cost sharing or matching. Those methods are specified in:


a. Sections E and F of FMS Article VI of this award if the subaward is to a State, institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, local government, or Indian tribe.


b. The provisions of 32 CFR 34.13(b) if the subaward is to a for-profit entity.


*Section H. Program income.* You must include requirements concerning program income in subawards, as follows:


1. In each subaward to a State, institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, local government, or Indian tribe:


a. You must require the subrecipient to account to you when it earns any program income under the subaward or uses it, so that you can prepare reports you are required to submit to us. If the award-specific terms and conditions of this award require you to account for program income earned after the period of performance, you must include a corresponding requirement in your subawards.


b. You must include the provisions of Sections A through D of FMS Article VII of this award.


c. You may specify the deduction, addition, or cost-sharing or matching alternative—described in 2 CFR 1128.720(b)—or a combination of those alternatives, for the subrecipient's use of any program income it earns. However, you still must comply with the alternative specified in Section E of FMS Article VII and any applicable award-specific terms and conditions for the total amount of program income earned, which includes amounts earned by you and your subrecipients. For example, if we require you to use the deduction alternative, you may authorize a subrecipient to use the addition alternative if you reduce the funding allocated for portions of the project or program that you or other subrecipients perform to make the required reduction in the total award amount.


2. In each subaward to a for-profit entity, you must include the provisions of 32 CFR 34.14, with the appropriate method specified for disposition of program income.
