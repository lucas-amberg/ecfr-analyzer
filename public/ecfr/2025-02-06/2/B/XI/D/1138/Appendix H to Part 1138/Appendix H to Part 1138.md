# Appendix H to Part 1138—Terms and Conditions for SUB Article VIII, “Other Administrative Requirements for Subawards”


Unless modified as provided in § 1138.5, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for SUB Article VIII, as specified in § 1138.805, but may add a section(s), as appropriate.


*Section A. Purposes of this article in relation to other articles.*

1. This article specifies other administrative requirements that you either must or should include in the terms and conditions of each cost-type subaward that you make under this award.


2. It thereby addresses the flow down to subrecipients of requirements with which you must comply under OAR Articles I through VII of this award.


3. SUB Article XII of this award addresses which of these administrative requirements you must include in any fixed-amount subaward that you make, if you are authorized to make fixed-amount subawards under this award.


*Section B. Submission and maintenance of subrecipient information.* You must include the substance of the provision in Section C of OAR Article I in any subaward you make under this award. The provision must require the subrecipient's disclosure of any evidence directly to the Inspector General, DoD.


*Section C. Records retention and access.* In each subaward you make under this award:


1. If the subaward is to an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, State, local government, or Indian tribe:


a. You must include the requirements of Section A of OAR Article II with the additional condition that, for any subrecipient under this award that does not have a federally approved rate for indirect or facilities and administrative costs and that does not use the de minimis rate described in 2 CFR 200.414(f), you must:


i. Require the subrecipient to keep records that support its indirect or facilities and administrative costs charged to the subaward for 3 years from the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) to which the costs apply; and


ii. Keep any plan or computation the subrecipient submits to you to serve as a basis for your determining the reasonableness and allowability of indirect or facilities and administrative costs of the subaward, for 3 years from the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) to which the proposal, plan, or computation applies.


b. You must include the requirements of Sections B, C, and F of OAR Article II.


c. You must include provisions that enable you to comply with the requirements of Section D of OAR Article II concerning records for joint or long-term use.


d. You must include provisions that establish the same rights and responsibilities for the subrecipient under the subaward that Section E of OAR Article II establishes for you under this award.


e. You may not impose any other record retention or access requirements on the subrecipient.


2. If the subaward is to a for-profit entity, you must include the records retention and access provisions of 32 CFR 34.42.


*Section D. Remedies and termination.* The terms and conditions of each subaward you make under this award should specify your rights and responsibilities and those of the subrecipient if you take a remedial action to address a subrecipient's noncompliance with an applicable Federal statute or regulation or the terms and conditions of your subaward. Each subaward's terms and conditions should:


1. Identify remedial actions you may take to address the subrecipient's noncompliance. Available remedies are described in:


a. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.338 for a subaward to an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, State, local government, or Indian tribe; and


b. 32 CFR 34.52 for a subaward to a for-profit entity.


2. With respect to termination specifically:


a. Identify conditions under which you, the subrecipient, or both (by mutual agreement) may terminate the subaward, in whole or in part, as described in:


i. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.339(a) for a subaward to an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, State, local government, or Indian tribe; and


ii. 32 CFR 34.51 for a subaward to a for-profit entity.


b. Inform the subrecipient that you will provide it with a notice of termination if you unilaterally terminate the award.


c. Specify that you and the subrecipient remain responsible for applicable requirements addressed in Sections G and H of this article concerning closeout, post-closeout adjustments, and continuing responsibilities.


3. With respect to either suspension or termination of the subaward, inform the subrecipient about the criteria that you will use to either allow or disallow subaward costs, which are in:


a. Section D of OAR Article III for a subaward to an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, State, local government, or Indian tribe; and


b. 32 CFR 34.52(c) for a subaward to a for-profit entity.


*Section E. Disputes, hearings, and appeals.* Each subaward's terms and conditions should specify any rights the subrecipient has to a hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding if it disputes a decision you render in administering its subaward. You must comply with any statute or regulation that affords the subrecipient an opportunity for a hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding and is applicable to the dispute.


*Section F. Collection of amounts due.* Although your subaward terms and conditions do not need to include any of the requirements of OAR Article V because those requirements do not flow down to subrecipients, you should consider including provisions to specify what you would need from the subrecipient if you owed a debt to the Federal Government under this award that is related to its subaward.


*Section G. Closeout.*

1. In each subaward that you make to an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, State, local government, or Indian tribe, you must include provisions to require the subrecipient to:


a. Liquidate all obligations that it incurred under the subaward not later than 90 calendar days after the end date of the period of performance of either the subaward or this award, whichever is earlier, unless you grant an extension.


b. Promptly refund to you any balances of unobligated cash that you advanced or paid to the subrecipient, unless you received authorization from the DoD award administration office for the subrecipient's use of those funds on other projects or programs.


c. Submit to you:


i. Any information you need from the subrecipient to meet your responsibilities to us for an accounting of property, under Section D of OAR Article VI; and


ii. Not later than 90 calendar days after the end date of the period of performance of this award, unless you grant the subrecipient an extension, any information you need to meet your responsibilities to us for final reports, under Section C of OAR Article VI.


2. In each subaward that you make to a for-profit entity, you must include the terms and conditions that you deem necessary for you to be able to comply with the requirements in OAR Article VI.


*Section H. Post-closeout adjustments and continuing responsibilities.*

You must include provisions in each subaward to require the subrecipient to provide what you need in order to comply with the requirements of OAR Article VII.
