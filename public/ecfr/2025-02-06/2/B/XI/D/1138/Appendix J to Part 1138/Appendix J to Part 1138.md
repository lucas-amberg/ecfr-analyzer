# Appendix J to Part 1138—Terms and Conditions for SUB Article X, “Subrecipient Monitoring and Other Post-Award Administration”


Unless modified as provided in § 1138.5, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for SUB Article X.


*Section A. General requirement for subrecipient monitoring.* You must do the post-award monitoring of the subrecipient's activities under each subaward that is needed in order for you to ensure that:


1. The subrecipient carries out the portion of the substantive project or program under this award.


2. The subrecipient is using funds under the subaward (including any cost sharing or matching the subrecipient provides that is counted as project costs in the approved budget of this award) for authorized purposes.


3. The subrecipient's performance under the subaward is in compliance with applicable Federal statutes and regulations, and the terms and conditions of your subaward.


*Section B. Subrecipient monitoring actions.*

1. *Required monitoring actions under cost-type subawards.* You must, as part of your post-award monitoring of each subrecipient:


a. Review the financial and programmatic information that your subaward terms and conditions require the subrecipient to provide, in accordance with Sections B and C of SUB Article VII of this award.


b. Follow up and ensure that the subrecipient takes timely and appropriate action to remedy deficiencies detected through any means, including audits and on-site reviews.


c. With respect to audits of subrecipients that are required under FMS Article V of this award:


i. Verify that the subrecipient is audited in accordance with those requirements, as applicable (note that Section F of SUB Article IV requires you to include those audit requirements for the subrecipient in the subaward's terms and conditions).


ii. Resolve and issue a management decision for audit findings that pertain to your subaward. Doing so is a requirement under either Section A or B of FMS Article V of this award (Section B requires that explicitly and Section A does so by implementing OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.521, as well as other portions of Subpart F of that part).


iii. Consider whether you need to adjust your own records related to this award based on results of audits, on-site reviews or other monitoring of the subrecipient and, as applicable, notify the award administration office.


2. *Other monitoring actions.* OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.331(e)(1) through (3) describes other actions that may be useful as part of your subrecipient monitoring program, depending on the outcomes of the pre-award risk assessment you conducted in accordance with Section B of SUB Article II.


*Section C. Remedies and subaward suspension or termination.* With respect to any subaward under this award, you must:


1. Consider whether you need to take any remedial action if you determine that the subrecipient is noncompliant with an applicable Federal statute or regulation or the terms and conditions of your subaward, as described in Section D of SUB Article VIII.


2. Provide a notice of termination to the subrecipient if you terminate its subaward unilaterally for any reason prior to the end of the period of performance.


3. In the case of suspension or termination of a subaward prior to the end of the period of performance, allow or disallow subaward costs in accordance with Section D of OAR Article III.


*Section D. Subaward closeout.*

1. You will close out each subaward when you either:


a. Determine that the subrecipient has completed its programmatic performance under the subaward and all applicable administrative actions; or


b. Terminate the subaward, if you do so prior to the end of the subaward's period of performance.


2. With respect to the closeout of each subaward:


a. You must pay the subrecipient promptly for allowable and reimbursable costs.


b. Consistent with the terms and conditions of the subaward, you must make a settlement for any upward or downward adjustments to the Federal share of costs after you receive the information you need from the subrecipient to close out the subaward.


c. You should complete the closeout of the subaward no later than one year after you receive and accept the final reports and other information from the subrecipient that you need to close out the subaward.
