(a) *Purposes.* SUB Article V specifies requirements concerning equipment, supplies, and real, intangible, and federally owned property that recipients must include in subawards they make under DoD grants and cooperative agreements. It thereby:


(1) Specifies which of the requirements in PROP Articles I through VI of the award flow down to subawards; and


(2) Implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.310 through 200.316, as those sections apply to subawards.


(b) *Award terms and conditions.* A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix E to this part provides as Section A of SUB Article V to inform recipients about the relationship between requirements for the recipient in PROP Articles I through VI and requirements for subawards in SUB Article V.
