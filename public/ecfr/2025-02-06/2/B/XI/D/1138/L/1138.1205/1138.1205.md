# § 1138.1205   Content of SUB Article XII.

(a) *Requirement.* A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address how a recipient may use a fixed-amount type of subaward, when it requires the Component's prior approval to do so, and what requirements the recipient must include in those subawards.


(b) *Award terms and conditions* — (1) *General.* A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix L to this part provides for SUB Article XII.


(2) *Exceptions.*

(i) In addition to the authorities provided in § 1138.5 to omit or reserve all or portions of the wording appendix L to this part provides for SUB Article XII, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions may add wording to Section B of the article to authorize recipients to use fixed-amount subawards without obtaining the Component's prior approval in other situations for which it would be appropriate to do so, given the nature of the program or programs that use its general terms and conditions.


(ii) However, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions should never authorize recipients' use of fixed-amount subawards for basic or applied research, for the reason given in paragraph B.2.a.ii of the wording appendix L provides for SUB Article XII. It is unrealistic to have a subrecipient commit in advance to accomplishing specific, well-defined, and observable research outcomes. Doing so subjects the subrecipient to undue risk of not being reimbursed for research costs it incurred if it fails to fully accomplish the outcomes.
