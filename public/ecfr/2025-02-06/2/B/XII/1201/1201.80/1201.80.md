# ยง 1201.80   Program income.

Notwithstanding 2 CFR 200.1, *program income* means gross income earned by the non-Federal entity that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award during the period of performance. (See 2 CFR 200.1 *Definitions*.) Program income includes but is not limited to income from fees for services performed, the use or rental or real or personal property acquired under Federal awards, the sale of commodities or items fabricated under a Federal award, license fees and royalties on patents and copyrights, and principal and interest on loans made with Federal award funds. Interest earned on advances of Federal funds is not program income. Except as otherwise provided in Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award, program income does not include rebates, credits, discounts, taxes, special assessments, levies, and fines raised by a grantee and subgrantee, and interest earned on any of them.
