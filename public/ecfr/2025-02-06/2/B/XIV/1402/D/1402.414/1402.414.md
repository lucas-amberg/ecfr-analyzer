# ยง 1402.414   What are the negotiated indirect cost rate deviation policies?

(a) This section establishes DOI policies, procedures, and decision making criteria for using an indirect cost rate that differs from the non-Federal entity's negotiated rate or approved rate for DOI awards. These are established in accordance with 2 CFR 200.414(c)(3) or (f).


(b) DOI accepts indirect cost rates that have been reduced or removed voluntarily by the proposed recipient of the award, on an award-specific basis.


(c) For all deviations to the Federal negotiated indirect cost rate, including statutory, regulatory, programmatic, and voluntary, the basis of direct costs against which the indirect cost rate is applied must be:


(1) The same base identified in the recipient's negotiated indirect cost rate agreement, if the recipient has a federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement; or


(2) The Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC) base, in cases where the recipient does not have a federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement or, with prior approval of the awarding bureau or office, when the recipient's federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement base is only a subset of the MTDC (such as salaries and wages) and the use of the MTDC still results in an overall reduction in the total indirect cost recovered. MTDC is the base defined by 2 CFR 200.68, Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC).


(d) In cases where the recipient does not have a federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement, DOI will not use a modified rate based upon total direct cost or other base not identified in the federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement or defined within 2 CFR 200.68.


(1) *Indirect cost rate deviation required by statute or regulation.* In accordance with 2 CFR 200.414(c)(1), a Federal agency must use a rate other than the Federal negotiated rate where required by Federal statute or regulation. For such instances within DOI, the official award file must document the specific statute or regulation that required the deviation.


(2) *Indirect cost rate reductions used as cost-share.* Instances where the recipient elects to use a rate lower than the federally negotiated indirect cost rate, and uses the balance of the unrecovered indirect costs to meet a cost-share or matching requirement required by the program and/or statute, are not considered a deviation from 2 CFR 200.414(c), as the federally negotiated indirect cost rate is being applied under the agreement in order to meet the terms and conditions of the award.


(3) *Programmatic indirect cost rate deviation approval process.* Bureaus and offices with DOI approved deviations in place prior to October 29, 2019 are not required to resubmit those for reconsideration following the procedures in this paragraph (d)(3). The following requirements apply for review, approval, and posting of programmatic indirect cost rate waivers:


(i) *Program qualifications.* Programs that have instituted a program-wide requirement and governance process for deviations from federally negotiated indirect cost rates may qualify for a programmatic deviation approval.


(ii) *Deviation requests.* Deviation requests must be submitted by the responsible senior program manager to the DOI Office of Grants Management. The request for deviation approval must include a description of the program, and the governance process for negotiating and/or communicating to recipients the indirect cost rate requirements under the program. The program must make its governance documentation, rate deviations, and other program information publicly available.


(iii) *Approvals.* Programmatic deviations must be approved, in writing, by the Director, Office of Grants Management. Approved deviations will be made publicly available.


(4) *Voluntary indirect cost rate reduction.* On any single award, an applicant and/or proposed recipient may elect to reduce or eliminate the indirect cost rate applied to costs under that award. The election must be voluntary and cannot be required by the awarding official, NOFO, program, or other non-statutory or non-regulatory requirements. For these award-specific and voluntary reductions, DOI can accept the lower rate provided the notice of award clearly documents the recipient's voluntary election. Once DOI has accepted the lower rate, that rate will apply for the duration of the award.


(5) *Unrecovered indirect costs.* In accordance with 2 CFR 200.405, indirect costs not recovered due to deviations to the federally negotiated rate are not allowable for recovery via any other means.
