# ยง 1532.765   How may I appeal my EPA suspension?

(a) If the EPA suspending official issues a decision under 2 CFR 180.755 to continue your suspension after you present information in opposition to that suspension under 2 CFR 180.720, you can ask for review of the suspending official's decision in two ways:


(1) You may ask the suspending official to reconsider the decision for material errors of fact or law that you believe will change the outcome of the matter; and/or


(2) You may request the Director, Office of Grants and Debarment (OGD Director), to review the suspending official's decision to continue your suspension within 30 days of your receipt of the suspending official's decision under 2 CFR 180.755 or paragraph (a)(1) of this section. However, the OGD Director can reverse the suspending official's decision only where the OGD Director finds that the decision is based on a clear error of material fact or law, or where the OGD Director finds that the suspending official's decision was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.


(b) A request for review under this section must be in writing; state the specific findings you believe to be in error; and include the reasons or legal bases for your position.


(c) A review under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is solely within the discretion of the OGD Director who may also stay the suspension pending review of the suspending official's decision.


(d) The EPA suspending official and the OGD Director must notify you of their decisions under this section, in writing, using the notice procedures at 2 CFR 180.615 and 180.975.
