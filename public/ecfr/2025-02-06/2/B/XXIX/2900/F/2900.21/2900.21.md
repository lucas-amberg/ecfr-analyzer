# ยง 2900.21   Management decision.

In the DOL, ordinarily, a management decision is issued within six months of receipt of an audit from the audit liaison of the Office of the Inspector General and is extended an additional six months when the audit contains a finding involving a subrecipient of the pass-through entity being audited. The pass-through entity responsible for issuing a management decision must do so within twelve months of acceptance of the audit report by the FAC. The auditee must initiate and proceed with corrective action as rapidly as possible and should begin corrective action no later than upon receipt of the audit report. (See 2 CFR 200.521(d)).
