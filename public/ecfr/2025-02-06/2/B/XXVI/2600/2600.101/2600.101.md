# ยง 2600.101   Indirect costs exception to 2 CFR 200.414.

As approved by the Archivist of the United States, the National Archives does not permit grant recipients to use allocated funds from NARA or NHPRC for indirect costs. Grant recipients may use cost sharing to cover indirect costs instead. NARA's policies on indirect costs are located at *http://www.archives.gov/nhprc*, and are included in grant opportunity announcements.
