(c) Except where otherwise provided for by law, no non-Federal entity may seek or accept an equity stake in any firm it assists under the auspices of an SBA award. Additionally, no principal, officer, employee, or contractor of such an entity (nor any of their Close or Secondary Relatives as those terms are defined by 13 CFR 108.50) may seek or accept an equity stake or paid position in any firm the entity assists under an SBA award.
