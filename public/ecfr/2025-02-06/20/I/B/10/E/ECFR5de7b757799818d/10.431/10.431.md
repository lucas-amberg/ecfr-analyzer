# ยง 10.431   What does OWCP do when an overpayment is identified?

Before seeking to recover an overpayment or adjust benefits, OWCP will advise the beneficiary in writing that:


(a) The overpayment exists, and the amount of overpayment;


(b) A preliminary finding shows either that the individual was or was not at fault in the creation of the overpayment;


(c) He or she has the right to inspect and copy Government records relating to the overpayment; and


(d) He or she has the right to present evidence which challenges the fact or amount of the overpayment, and/or challenges the preliminary finding that he or she was at fault in the creation of the overpayment. He or she may also request that recovery of the overpayment be waived.
