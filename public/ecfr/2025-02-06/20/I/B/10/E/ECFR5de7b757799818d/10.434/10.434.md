# ยง 10.434   If OWCP finds that the recipient of an overpayment was not at fault, what criteria are used to decide whether to waive recovery of it?

If OWCP finds that the recipient of an overpayment was not at fault, repayment will still be required unless:


(a) Adjustment or recovery of the overpayment would defeat the purpose of the FECA (see ยง 10.436), or


(b) Adjustment or recovery of the overpayment would be against equity and good conscience (see ยง 10.437).
