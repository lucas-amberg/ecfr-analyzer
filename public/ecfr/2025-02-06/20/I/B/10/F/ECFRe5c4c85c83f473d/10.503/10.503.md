# ยง 10.503   Under what circumstances may OWCP reduce or terminate compensation benefits?

Once OWCP has advised the employee that it has accepted a claim and has either approved continuation of pay or paid medical benefits or compensation, benefits will not be terminated or reduced unless the weight of the evidence establishes that:


(a) The disability for which compensation was paid has ceased;


(b) The disabling condition is no longer causally related to the employment;


(c) The employee is only partially disabled;


(d) The employee has returned to work;


(e) The beneficiary was convicted of fraud in connection with a claim under the FECA, or the beneficiary was incarcerated based on any felony conviction; or


(f) OWCP's initial decision was in error.
