# ยง 10.706   How will a beneficiary know if OWCP or SOL has determined that action against a third party is required?

When OWCP determines that an employee or other FECA beneficiary must take action against a third party, it will notify the employee or beneficiary in writing. If the case is transferred to SOL, a second notification may be issued.
