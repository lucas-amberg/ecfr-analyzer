# ยง 30.106   Can OWCP request employment verification from other sources?

(a) For most claims filed under EEOICPA, DOE has access to sufficient factual information to enable it to fulfill its obligations described in ยง 30.105(a). However, in instances where it lacks such information, DOE may arrange for other entities to provide OWCP with the information necessary to verify an employment history submitted as part of a claim. These other entities may consist of either current or former DOE contractors and subcontractors, atomic weapons employers, beryllium vendors, or other entities with access to relevant employment information.


(b) On its own initiative, OWCP may also arrange for entities other than DOE to perform the employment verification duties described in ยง 30.105(a).
