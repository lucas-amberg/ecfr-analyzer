# ยง 30.214   How does a claimant establish that the employee is a member of the Special Exposure Cohort?

(a) For purposes of establishing eligibility as a member of the Special Exposure Cohort (SEC) under ยง 30.210(a)(1), the employee must have been a DOE employee, a DOE contractor employee, or an atomic weapons employee who meets any of the following requirements:


(1) The employee was so employed for a number of workdays aggregating at least 250 workdays before February 1, 1992, at a gaseous diffusion plant located in Paducah, Kentucky; Portsmouth, Ohio; or Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and during such employment:


(i) Was monitored through the use of dosimetry badges for exposure at the plant of the external parts of the employee's body to radiation; or


(ii) Worked in a job that had exposures comparable to a job that is or was monitored through the use of dosimetry badges.


(2) The employee was so employed before January 1, 1974, by DOE or a DOE contractor or subcontractor on Amchitka Island, Alaska, and was exposed to ionizing radiation in the performance of duty related to the Long Shot, Milrow, or Cannikin underground nuclear tests.


(3) The employee is a member of a group or class of employees subsequently designated as additional members of the SEC by HHS.


(b) For purposes of satisfying the 250 workday requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the claimant may aggregate the days of service at more than one gaseous diffusion plant.


(c) Proof of employment by the DOE or a DOE contractor, or an atomic weapons employer, for the requisite time periods set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, may be made by the submission of any trustworthy records that, on their face or in conjunction with other such records, establish that the employee was so employed and the time period(s) of such employment. If the evidence shows that exposure occurred while the employee was employed by an employer that would have to be designated by DOE as an atomic weapons employer under section 7384l(4) of the Act to be a covered employer, and that the employer has not been so designated, OWCP will deny the claim on the ground that the employer is not a covered atomic weapons employer.


(d) Records from the following sources may be considered as evidence for purposes of establishing employment or presence at a covered facility:


(1) Records or documents created by any federal government agency (including verified information submitted for security clearance), any tribal government, or any state, county, city or local government office, agency, department, board or other entity, or other public agency or office.


(2) Records or documents created as a byproduct of any regularly conducted business activity or by an entity that acted as a contractor or subcontractor to the DOE.
