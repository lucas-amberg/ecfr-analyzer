# ยง 30.207   How does a claimant prove a diagnosis of a beryllium disease covered under Part B?

(a) Written medical documentation is required in all cases to prove that the employee developed a covered beryllium illness. Proof that the employee developed a covered beryllium illness must be made by using the procedures outlined in paragraph (b), (c), (d) or (e) of this section.


(b) Beryllium sensitivity or sensitization is established with either:


(1) An abnormal beryllium LPT performed on either blood or lung lavage cells; or


(2) Three borderline beryllium LPTs performed on blood cells over a period of 3 years.




(c) Chronic beryllium disease is established in the following manner:


(1) For diagnoses on or after January 1, 1993, beryllium sensitivity (as established in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section), together with lung pathology consistent with chronic beryllium disease, including the following:


(i) A lung biopsy showing granulomas or a lymphocytic process consistent with chronic beryllium disease;


(ii) A computerized axial tomography scan showing changes consistent with chronic beryllium disease; or


(iii) Pulmonary function or exercise testing showing pulmonary deficits consistent with chronic beryllium disease.


(2) For diagnoses before January 1, 1993, the presence of the following:


(i) Occupational or environmental history, or epidemiologic evidence of beryllium exposure; and


(ii) Any three of the following criteria:


(A) Characteristic chest radiographic (or computed tomography (CT)) abnormalities.


(B) Restrictive or obstructive lung physiology testing or diffusing lung capacity defect.


(C) Lung pathology consistent with chronic beryllium disease.


(D) Clinical course consistent with a chronic respiratory disorder.


(E) Immunologic tests showing beryllium sensitivity (skin patch test or beryllium blood test preferred).


(d) OWCP will use the criteria in either paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section to establish that the employee developed chronic beryllium disease as follows:


(1) If the earliest dated medical evidence shows that the employee was either treated for, tested positive for, or diagnosed with a chronic respiratory disorder before January 1, 1993, the criteria set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be used;


(2) If the earliest dated medical evidence shows that the employee was either treated for, tested positive for, or diagnosed with a chronic respiratory disorder on or after January 1, 1993, the criteria set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section must be used; and


(3) If the employee was treated for a chronic respiratory disorder before January 1, 1993 and medical evidence verifies that such treatment was performed before January 1, 1993, but the medical evidence is dated on or after January 1, 1993, the criteria set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be used.


(e) An injury, illness, impairment or disability sustained as a consequence of beryllium sensitivity or established chronic beryllium disease must be established with a fully rationalized medical report by a physician that shows the relationship between the injury, illness, impairment or disability and the beryllium sensitivity or established chronic beryllium disease. Neither the fact that the injury, illness, impairment or disability manifests itself after a diagnosis of beryllium sensitivity or established chronic beryllium disease, nor the belief of the claimant that the injury, illness, impairment or disability was caused by the beryllium sensitivity or established chronic beryllium disease, is sufficient in itself to prove a causal relationship.
