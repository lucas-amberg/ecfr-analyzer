# § 30.501   What order of precedence will OWCP use to determine which survivors are entitled to receive compensation under EEOICPA?

(a) Under Part B of the Act, if OWCP determines that a survivor or survivors are entitled to receive compensation under EEOICPA because a covered Part B employee who would otherwise have been entitled to benefits is deceased, that compensation will be disbursed as follows, subject to the qualifications set forth in § 30.5(hh)(3):


(1) If there is a surviving spouse, the compensation shall be paid to that individual.


(2) If there is no surviving spouse, the compensation shall be paid in equal shares to all children of the deceased covered Part B employee.


(3) If there is no surviving spouse and no children, the compensation shall be paid in equal shares to the parents of the deceased covered Part B employee.


(4) If there is no surviving spouse, no children and no parents, the compensation shall be paid in equal shares to all grandchildren of the deceased covered Part B employee.


(5) If there is no surviving spouse, no children, no parents and no grandchildren, the compensation shall be paid in equal shares to the grandparents of the deceased covered Part B employee.


(6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section, if there is a surviving spouse and at least one child of the deceased covered Part B employee who is a minor at the time of payment and who is not a recognized natural child or adopted child of such surviving spouse, half of the compensation shall be paid to the surviving spouse, and the other half of the compensation shall be paid in equal shares to each child of the deceased covered Part B employee who is a minor at the time of payment.


(b) Under Part E of the Act, if OWCP determines that a survivor or survivors are entitled to receive compensation under EEOICPA because a covered Part E employee who would otherwise have been entitled to benefits is deceased, that compensation will be disbursed as follows, subject to the qualifications set forth in § 30.5(hh)(3):


(1) If there is a surviving spouse, the compensation shall be paid to that individual.


(2) If there is no surviving spouse, the compensation shall be paid in equal shares to all “covered” children of the deceased covered Part E employee.


(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, if there is a surviving spouse and at least one “covered” child of the deceased covered Part E employee who is living at the time of payment and who is not a recognized natural child or adopted child of such surviving spouse, then half of such payment shall be made to such surviving spouse, and the other half of such payment shall be made in equal shares to each “covered” child of the employee who is living at the time of payment.
