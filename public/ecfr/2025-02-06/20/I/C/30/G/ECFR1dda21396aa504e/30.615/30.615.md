# § 30.615   What type of tort suits filed against beryllium vendors or atomic weapons employers may disqualify certain claimants from receiving benefits under Part B of EEOICPA?

(a) A tort suit (other than an administrative or judicial proceeding for workers' compensation) that includes a claim arising out of a covered Part B employee's employment-related exposure to beryllium or radiation, filed against a beryllium vendor or an atomic weapons employer, by a covered Part B employee or an eligible surviving beneficiary or beneficiaries of a deceased covered Part B employee, will disqualify that otherwise eligible individual or individuals from receiving benefits under Part B of EEOICPA unless such claim is terminated in accordance with the requirements of §§ 30.616 through 30.619 of these regulations.


(b) The term “claim arising out of a covered Part B employee's employment-related exposure to beryllium or radiation” used in paragraph (a) of this section includes a claim that is derivative of a covered Part B employee's employment-related exposure to beryllium or radiation, such as a claim for loss of consortium raised by a covered Part B employee's spouse.


(c) If all claims arising out of a covered Part B employee's employment-related exposure to beryllium or radiation are terminated in accordance with the requirements of §§ 30.616 through 30.619 of these regulations, proceeding with the remaining portion of the tort suit filed against a beryllium vendor or an atomic weapons employer will not disqualify an otherwise eligible individual or individuals from receiving benefits under Part B of EEOICPA.
