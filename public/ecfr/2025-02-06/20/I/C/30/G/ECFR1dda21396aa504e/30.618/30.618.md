# § 30.618   What happens if this type of tort suit was filed after December 28, 2001?

(a) If a tort suit described in § 30.615 was filed after December 28, 2001, the claimant or claimants will be disqualified from receiving any benefits under Part B of EEOICPA if a judgment is entered against them.


(b) If a tort suit described in § 30.615 was filed after December 28, 2001 and a judgment has not yet been entered against the claimant or claimants, they will also be disqualified from receiving any benefits under Part B of EEOICPA unless, prior to entry of any judgment, they dismiss all claims arising out of a covered Part B employee's employment-related exposure to beryllium or radiation that are included in the tort suit on or before the last permissible date described in paragraph (c) of this section.


(c) The last permissible date is the later of:


(1) April 30, 2003; or


(2) The date that is 30 months after the date the claimant or claimants first became aware that an illness of the covered Part B employee may be connected to his or her exposure to beryllium or radiation covered by EEOICPA. For purposes of determining when this 30-month period begins, “the date the claimant or claimants first became aware” will be deemed to be the date they received either a reconstructed dose from NIOSH, or a diagnosis of a covered beryllium illness, as applicable.
