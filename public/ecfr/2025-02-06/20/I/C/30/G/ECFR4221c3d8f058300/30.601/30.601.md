# ยง 30.601   Who may serve as a representative?

A claimant may authorize any individual to represent him or her in regard to a claim under EEOICPA, unless that individual's service as a representative would violate any applicable provision of law (such as 18 U.S.C. 205 and 208) or the standards regarding conflicts of interest adopted by OWCP. Under those standards, authorized representatives are prohibited from having private, non-representational financial interests with respect to their client's EEOICPA claims. This does not include their fee for serving as a representative. A Federal employee may act as a representative only:


(a) On behalf of immediate family members, defined as a spouse, children, parents, and siblings of the representative, provided no fee or gratuity is charged; or


(b) While acting as a union representative, defined as any officially sanctioned union official, and no fee or gratuity is charged.
