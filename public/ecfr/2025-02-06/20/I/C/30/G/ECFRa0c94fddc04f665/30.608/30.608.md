# ยง 30.608   How does the United States calculate the amount to which it is subrogated?

The subrogated amount of a specific claim consists of the total money paid by OWCP from the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Fund with respect to that claim to or on behalf of a covered Part B employee, a covered Part E employee or an eligible surviving beneficiary, less charges for any medical file review (*i.e.*, the physician did not examine the employee) done at the request of OWCP. Charges for medical examinations also may be subtracted if the covered Part B employee, covered Part E employee or an eligible surviving beneficiary establishes that the examinations were required to be made available to the covered Part B employee or covered Part E employee under a statute other than EEOICPA.
