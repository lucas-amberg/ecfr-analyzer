# ยง 30.609   Is a settlement or judgment received as a result of allegations of medical malpractice in treating an illness covered by EEOICPA a recovery that must be reported to OWCP?

Since an injury caused by medical malpractice in treating an occupational illness or covered illness compensable under EEOICPA is also covered under EEOICPA, any recovery in a suit alleging such an injury is treated as a recovery that must be reported to OWCP.
