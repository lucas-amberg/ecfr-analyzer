# ยง 30.611   If a settlement or judgment is received for more than one medical condition, can the amount paid on a single EEOICPA claim be attributed to different conditions for purposes of calculating the amount to which the United States is subrogated?

(a) All medical conditions accepted by OWCP in connection with a single claim are treated as the same illness for the purpose of computing the amount which the United States is entitled to offset in connection with the receipt of a recovery from a third party, except that an injury caused by medical malpractice in treating an illness covered under EEOICPA will be treated as a separate injury.


(b) If an illness covered under EEOICPA is caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in more than one person, other than the United States, a DOE contractor or subcontractor, a beryllium vendor or an atomic weapons employer, to pay damages, OWCP will determine whether recoveries received from one or more third parties should be attributed to separate conditions for which compensation is payable in connection with a single EEOICPA claim. If such an attribution is both practicable and equitable, as determined by OWCP, in its discretion, the conditions will be treated as separate injuries for purposes of calculating the amount to which the United States is subrogated.
