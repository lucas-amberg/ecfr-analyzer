# § 30.811   How will OWCP calculate the duration and extent of a covered Part E employee's initial period of compensable wage-loss?

(a) To determine the initial calendar years of wage-loss, OWCP will use the evidence it receives under §§ 30.805 through 30.807 to compare the calendar-year wages for the covered Part E employee, as adjusted, with the average annual wage determined under § 30.810 for each calendar year beginning with the calendar year that includes the trigger month, and concluding with the last calendar year of wage-loss prior to the submission of the claim or the calendar year in which the employee reached normal retirement age (as defined in § 30.801(b)), whichever occurred first.


(b) OWCP will then aggregate separately the number of calendar years of wage-loss in which the employee's wages, as adjusted, did not exceed 50 percent of the average annual wage determined under § 30.810, and the number of calendar years of wage-loss in which the employee's wages, as adjusted, exceeded 50 percent of such average annual wage, but did not exceed 75 percent of such average annual wage.


(c) For each calendar year of wage-loss determined under paragraph (c) of this section during which the employee's wages did not exceed 50 percent of his or her average annual wage, OWCP will pay the employee $15,000 as compensation for wage-loss. For each calendar year of wage-loss determined under paragraph (c) of this section during which the employee's calendar-year wages exceeded 50 percent of his or her average annual wage but did not exceed 75 percent of such average annual wage, OWCP will pay the employee $10,000 as compensation for wage-loss.
