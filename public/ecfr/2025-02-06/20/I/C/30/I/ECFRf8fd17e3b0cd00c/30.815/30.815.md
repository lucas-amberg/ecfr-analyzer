# § 30.815   Are there special rules that OWCP will use to determine the extent of a deceased covered Part E employee's compensable wage-loss?

(a) For purposes of adjudicating a claim of a survivor of a deceased covered Part E employee only, OWCP will presume that such employee experienced wage-loss for each calendar year subsequent to the calendar year of his or her death through and including the calendar year in which the employee would have reached normal retirement age under the Social Security Act. During these particular calendar years, OWCP will also presume that the deceased covered Part E employee's subsequent calendar-year wages did not exceed 50 percent of his or her average annual wage as determined under § 30.810.


(b) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, OWCP will calculate the wage-loss of a deceased covered Part E employee in conformance with the provisions of §§ 30.800 through 30.811.


(c) If OWCP determines that a deceased covered Part E employee had an aggregate of not less than ten calendar years of adjusted earnings that did not exceed 50 percent of his or her average annual earnings, it will pay the eligible surviving beneficiary(s) additional compensation (the basic survivor award payable under section 7385s-3(a)(1) is $125,000) in the amount of $25,000 pursuant to section 7385s-3(a)(2) of the Act. In the alternative, if OWCP determines that the aggregate number of such years is not less than 20 years, it will pay the eligible surviving beneficiary(s) additional compensation in the amount of $50,000 pursuant to section 7385s-3(a)(3).
