# ยง 30.908   How will the FAB evaluate new medical evidence submitted to challenge the impairment determination in the recommended decision?

(a) If an employee submits an additional impairment evaluation that differs from the impairment evaluation relied upon by the district office, the FAB will not consider the additional impairment evaluation if it does not meet the criteria listed in ยง 30.905(b)(1), (2) and (3).


(b) The employee shall bear the burden of proving that the additional impairment evaluation submitted is more probative than the evaluation relied upon by the district office to determine the employee's recommended impairment rating.


(c) If an employee submits an additional impairment evaluation that differs from the impairment evaluation relied upon by the district office, the FAB will review all relevant evidence of impairment in the record, and will base its determinations regarding impairment upon the evidence it considers to be most probative. The FAB will determine the impairment rating after it has evaluated all relevant evidence and argument in the record.
