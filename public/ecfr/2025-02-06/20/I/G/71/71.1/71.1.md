# § 71.1   General administrative provisions.

(a) Section 5(f) of the War Claims Act of 1948 (act of July 3, 1948; Pub. L. 896, 80th Cong., 62 Stat. 1240) makes provision for the payment of benefits with respect to the injury, disability or death resulting from injury of any civilian American citizen occurring while he was held by or in hiding from the Imperial Japanese Government to the same extent as if such civilian American citizen were an employee within the purview of the act of December 2, 1942 (Pub. L. 784, 77th Cong., 56 Stat. 1028, 42 U.S.C. 1701, *et seq.*). Under section 5(f) of the said War Claims Act of 1948, the rights of individuals to benefits payable under this subchapter shall accrue from and after December 7, 1941, subject, however, to all of the provisions of said act and the regulations in this subchapter.


(b) The regulations in part 61 of subchapter F of this chapter governing the administration of the benefits provided under titles I and II of the said act of December 2, 1942, as amended, shall, insofar as they are applicable and are not inconsistent with any of the provisions of this subchapter, govern the administration of the benefits payable under this subchapter. Provisions of such regulations relating to benefits for detention by the enemy, reimbursement to an employer or insurance carrier, and limitations on benefits in cases where workmen's compensation is payable are not applicable to the benefits provided in this subchapter nor are they within the purview of this subchapter. The provisions of sections 101(b), 104 and 105 of such act of December 2, 1942, and the various provisions of part 61 of this chapter relating to such provisions, accordingly, are not applicable to the payment of benefits under this subchapter.
