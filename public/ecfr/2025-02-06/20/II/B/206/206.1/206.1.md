Except as otherwise expressly noted, as used in this part— 


*Account benefits ratio* means the amount determined by the Railroad Retirement Board by dividing the fair market value of the assets in the Railroad Retirement Account and the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (and for years prior to 2002, the Social Security Equivalent Benefit Account) as of the close of each fiscal year by the total benefits and administrative expenses paid from those accounts during the fiscal year. 


*Administrative expenses paid* means the amount of the cash transfers from the Railroad Retirement Account to the agency's single administrative fund. Also included in this term is the amount of the cash transfers from the Railroad Retirement Account to the Limitation on the Office of Inspector General and the administrative expenses paid by the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust. 


*Assets* means the market value of cash and investments in the Railroad Retirement Account and the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (and for years before 2002, the Social Security Equivalent Benefit Account). 


*Average account benefits ratio* means for any calendar year, the average of the account benefits ratio for the 10 most recent fiscal years ending before such calendar year. If the amount computed is not a multiple of 0.1, such amount shall be increased to the next highest 0.1. 


*Total benefits paid* means the total amount of benefits paid from the Railroad Retirement Account and the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust in a fiscal year minus any benefit overpayments actually recovered during that fiscal year.
