(a) If the compensation claimed is in excess of the maximum creditable amounts defined in ยง 211.13 of this part, the Director of the Bureau of Research and Employment Accounts shall inform the employee that the compensation claimed is not creditable.


(b) If the compensation is claimed within four years from the date the compensation was required to be reported to the Board as prescribed in ยง 209.6 of this chapter, the Director of Research and Employment Accounts shall contact the employer requesting a review of their records, and if the employee's claim is correct, the employer will submit an adjustment crediting the employee with the compensation claimed.

Upon receipt of the check stubs, the proof will be sent to the employer along with a request for the employer to submit an adjustment crediting the employee with the compensation claimed.
