# ยง 211.3   Compensation paid for time lost.

(a) A payment made to an employee for a period during which the employee was absent from the active service of the employer is considered to be pay for time lost and is, therefore, creditable compensation. Pay for time lost as an employee includes:


(1) Pay received for a certain period of time due to personal injury, or


(2) Pay received for loss of earnings for a certain period of time, resulting from the employee being placed in a position or occupation paying less money. In reporting compensation which represents pay for time lost, employers shall allocate the amount paid to the employee to the month(s) in which the time was actually lost. The entire amount of any payment made to an employee for personal injury is considered pay for time lost unless, at the time of payment, the employer states that a particular amount of the payment was for reasons other than pay for time lost.


(b) Where pay for time lost is allocated to the month(s) in which the time was actually lost, the Board will accept the allocation made by the parties involved if it relates to the employee's normal monthly pay. A reasonable relationship to an employee's normal monthly pay is ordinarily no less than ten times the employee's daily pay rate.
