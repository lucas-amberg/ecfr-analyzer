# ยง 216.17   What amount of regular non-railroad employment will break a current connection.

The amount of regular non-railroad employment needed to break a current connection depends on when the applicable 30-month period ends (see ยง 216.13 of this part), as follows:


(a) If the 30-month period ends in the calendar year before or in the same calendar year as the annuity begins or the month the employee dies, the current connection is broken if the employee:


(1) Works in each month in the interval after the end of the 30-month period and before the earlier of the month the annuity begins or the employee dies; or


(2) Works and earns at least $200 in wages in any 3 months within the interval described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.


(b) If the 30-month period ends more than a year before the calendar year in which the annuity begins or the employee dies, the current connection is broken if the employee:


(1) Works in any 2 consecutive years wholly or partially within the interval after the end of the 30-month period and before the month the annuity begins or the employee dies, whichever is earlier; and


(2) Earns at least $1,000 in wages in any year wholly or partially within the interval described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section (but not counting earnings during the 30-month period and after the annuity beginning date), even if that year is not one of the 2 consecutive years described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
