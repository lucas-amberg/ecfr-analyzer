The Railroad Retirement Act provides annuities based on the employee's age for employees who have been credited with at least 10 years of railroad service.


(a) *Annuities based on 10 years of service.* An employee with 10 years of railroad service but less than 30 years of service is eligible for an annuity if he or she:


(1) Has attained retirement age; or


(2) Has attained age 62 (the annuity cannot begin prior to the first full month during which the employee is age 62) but is less than retirement age. All components of the annuity are reduced for each month the employee is under retirement age when the annuity begins.


(b) *Annuities based on 30 years of service.* An employee who has been credited with 30 years of railroad service is eligible for an annuity at age 60 (the annuity cannot begin prior to the first full month the employee is age 60). The Tier I component of the annuity is reduced if the employee meets the following conditions:


(1) The employee annuity begins before the month in which the employee is age 62; and either


(2) He or she had not attained age 60, prior to July 1, 1984; or


(3) He or she had not completed 30 years of railroad service prior to July 1, 1984.


(c) *Change from employee disability to age annuity.* A disability annuity paid to an employee through the end of the month before the month in which the employee attains retirement age is converted to an age annuity beginning with the month in which he or she attains retirement age.
