(b) The first month the individual is disabled, if the disability began before he or she attained age 22 and continues through the time of application for benefits; or


(c) The first month in which the individual is under a disability that began before the last day of a 7-year period (84 consecutive months) following the month in which the previous child's annuity ended, or the individual was no longer included as a disabled child in a railroad retirement annuity paid under the Social Security Overall Minimum Annuity (see part 229).
