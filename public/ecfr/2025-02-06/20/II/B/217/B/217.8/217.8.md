(2) The employee is entitled to a disability annuity in the month before the month he or she is 65 years old.


(b) An employee disability annuity if an application for an age annuity is denied and the employee is eligible for the disability annuity on the date the application is filed.


(c) An accrued employee or supplemental annuity, or a residual lump sum, if a claimant is eligible for one of these payments when he or she files an application for a survivor annuity or lump-sum payment under this chapter.


(d) A widow(er)'s annuity if the widow(er) was entitled to a spouse annuity in the month before the month the employee died.

(f) A child's annuity if the spouse of the employee had the child “in care” and was entitled to a spouse annuity in the month before the month the employee died.


(g) A child's annuity or child's full-time student annuity if the child of the employee was included in the computation of the employee's annuity under the social security overall minimum provision of the Railroad Retirement Act in the month before the month the employee died.

(i) A widow(er)'s annuity based on age or disability if a widow(er), who was receiving an annuity because he or she had the employee's child “in care”, is eligible for an age or disability annuity when he or she no longer has an eligible child “in care”.
