# ยง 217.19   Representative of the claimant selected after application is filed.

(a) *Before benefits awarded.* If the Board selects a representative for an incompetent claimant (see part 266 of this chapter) after an application is filed but before the benefit is awarded, a new benefit application must be filed by the representative. However, benefits will be paid using the filing date of the original benefit application.


(b) *After benefits awarded.* If the Board selects a representative after a monthly annuity was awarded to another person, the representative must apply as a substitute payee on a form specifically designed for that purpose. A new annuity application is not required.
