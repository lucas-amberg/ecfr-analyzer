# § 219.64   When evidence may be required for other reasons.

(a) The Board will require evidence of the appointment of a legal representative when—


(1) The employee's estate is entitled to a lump-sum death payment, annuity unpaid at death, or residual lump sum, and an executor or administrator has been appointed for the estate; or


(2) A minor child or incompetent is entitled to an annuity or lump-sum payment and a guardian, trustee, committee, or conservator has been appointed to act in his or her behalf.


(b) The Board will require evidence of an annuitant's earnings when the information that he or she furnished the Board does not agree with the earnings data furnished by the Social Security Administration or secured from other sources, and the annuitant maintains that the earnings data from the Social Security Administration or from other sources is not correct.


(c) The Board will require evidence to establish the amounts paid as a public service pension, public disability benefit, or worker's compensation to an employee, spouse, widow, or widower when the pension, public disability benefit, or worker's compensation affects the amount of his or her annuity.


(d) The Board will require evidence to reconcile discrepancies between the information furnished by the claimant and information already in the records of the Board, the Social Security Administration, or other public agencies. Such discrepancies may be differences in name, date or place of birth, periods of employment, or other identifying data.
