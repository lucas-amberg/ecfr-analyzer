# ยง 220.14   Weighing of evidence.

(a) *Factors which support greater weight.* Evidence will generally be given more weight if it meets one or more of the following criteria:


(1) The residual functional capacity evaluation is based upon functional objective tests with high validity and reliability;


(2) The medical evidence shows multiple impairments which have a cumulative effect on the employee's residual functional capacity;


(3) Symptoms associated with limitations are consistent with objective findings;


(4) There exists an adequate trial of therapies with good compliance, but poor outcome;


(5) There exists consistent history of conditions between treating physicians and other health care providers.


(b) *Factors which support lesser weight.* Evidence will generally be given lesser weight if it meets one or more of the following criteria:


(1) There is an inconsistency between the diagnoses of the treating physicians;


(2) There is inconsistency between reports of pain and functional impact;


(3) There is inconsistency between subjective symptoms and physical examination findings;


(4) There is evidence of poor compliance with treatment regimen, keeping appointments, or cooperating with treatment;


(5) There is evidence of exam findings which is indicative of exaggerated or potential malingering response;


(6) The evidence consists of objective findings of exams that have poor reliability or validity;


(7) The evidence consists of imaging findings which are nonspecific and largely present in the general population;


(8) The evidence consists of a residual functional capacity evaluation which is supported by limited objective data without consideration for functional capacity testing.
