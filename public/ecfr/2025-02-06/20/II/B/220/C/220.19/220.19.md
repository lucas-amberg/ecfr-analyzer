# § 220.19   Payment of the disability annuity during the trial work period and the reentitlement period.

(a) The employee who is entitled to an occupational disability annuity will not be paid an annuity for each month in the trial work period or reentitlement period in which he or she—


(1) Works for an employer covered by the Railroad Retirement Act (see § 220.160); or


(2) Earns more than $400 (after deduction of impairment-related work expenses) in employment or self-employment (see §§ 220.161 and 220.164). See § 220.145 for the definition of impairment-related work expenses.
