# ยง 220.27   What is needed to show an impairment.

A physical or mental impairment must result from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which can be shown by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques. A physical or mental impairment must be established by medical evidence consisting of signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings, not only by the claimant's statement of symptoms. (See ยง 220.113 for further information about what is meant by symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings.) (See also ยง 220.112 for the effect of a medical opinion about whether or not a claimant is disabled.)
