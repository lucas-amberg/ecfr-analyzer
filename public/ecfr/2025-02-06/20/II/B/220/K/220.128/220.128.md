# § 220.128   Age as a vocational factor.

(a) *General.* (1) *Age* refers to how old the claimaint is (chronological age) and the extent to which his or her age affects his or her ability to—


(i) Adapt to a new work situation; and


(ii) Do work in competition with others.


(2) In determining disability, the Board does not consider age alone. The Board must also consider the claimant's residual functional capacity, education, and work experience. If the claimant is unemployed because of his or her age and can still do a significant number of jobs which exist in the national economy, the Board will find that he or she is not disabled. Appendix 2 of this part explains in detail how the Board considers age as a vocational factor. However, the Board does not apply these age categories mechanically in a borderline situation.


(b) *Younger person.* If the claimant is under age 50, the Board generally does not consider that his or her age will seriously affect the ability to adapt to a new work situation. In some circumstances, the Board considers age 45 a handicap in adapting to a new work setting (see Rule 201.17 in appendix 2 of this part).


(c) *Person approaching advanced age.* If the claimant is closely approaching advanced age (50-54), the Board considers that the claimant's age, along with a severe impairment and limited work experience, may seriously affect the claimant's ability to adjust to a significant number of jobs in the national economy.


(d) *Person of advanced age.* The Board considers that advanced age (55 or over) is the point at which age significantly affects the claimant's ability to do substantial gainful activity.


(1) If the claimant is severly impaired and of advanced age, and he or she cannot do medium work (see § 220.132), the claimant may not be able to work unless he or she has skills that can be used in less demanding jobs which exist in significant numbers in the national economy.


(2) If the claimant is close to retirement age (60-64) and has a severe impairment, the Board will not consider him or her able to adjust to sedentary or light work unless the claimant has skills which are highly marketable.
