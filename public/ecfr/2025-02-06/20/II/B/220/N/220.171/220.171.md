# § 220.171   The reentitlement period.

(a) *General.* (1) The reentitlement period is an additional period after the 9 months of trial work during which the annuitant may continue to test his or her ability to work if he or she has a disabling impairment(s).


(2) The disability annuity of an employee, child, or widow(er) who is disabled for any regular employment will not be paid for—


(i) Any month, after the 3rd month, in this period in which the annuitant does substantial gainful activity; or


(ii) Any month in this period in which the annuitant works for an employer covered by the Railroad Retirement Act (see § 220.160).


(3) The disability annuity of an employee who is disabled for any regular employment will not be paid for any month in this period in which the employee annuitant earns more than $400 in employment or self-employment (see §§ 220.161 and 220.164).


(4) If the disability annuity of an employee, child or widow(er) who is disabled for any regular employment is stopped because of work during the trial work period or reentitlement period, and the disability annuitant discontinues that work before the end of either period, the disability annuity may be started again without a new application or a new determination of disability.


(b) *When the reentitlement period begins and ends.* The reentitlement period begins with the first month following completion of nine months of trial work but cannot begin earlier than December 1, 1980. It ends with whichever is earlier—


(1) The month before the first month in which the annuitant's impairment(s) no longer exists or is not medically disabling; or


(2) The last day of the 36th month following the end of the annuitant's trial work period.


(c) *When the annuitant is not entitled to a reentitlement period.* The annuitant is not entitled to a reentitlement period if—


(1) He or she is not entitled to a trial work period; or


(2) His or her disability ended before the annuitant completed nine months of trial work in that period in which he or she was disabled.
