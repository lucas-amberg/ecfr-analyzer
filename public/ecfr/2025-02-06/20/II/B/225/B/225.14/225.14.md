# § 225.14   Railroad Earnings Dual Benefit PIA.

(a) *General.* The Railroad Earnings Dual Benefit PIA is used in computing the employee vested dual benefit when the employee meets certain eligibility requirements as described in part 216 of this chapter. The Railroad Earnings Dual Benefit PIA is also used in computing the employee's tier II annuity component when the employee becomes entitled to a vested dual benefit. This PIA is determined under section 215 of the Social Security Act as in effect on December 31, 1974. Railroad earnings after 1950 (or after 1936, if applicable) and through December 31, 1974, or the last year of railroad service before 1974 are included in the calculation of this PIA.


(b) *Employee insured on own wage record on December 31, 1974.* Railroad earnings after 1950 (or after 1936, if a higher PIA would result) and through 1974 are used in computing the Railroad Earnings Dual Benefit PIA if the employee—


(1) Had at least 25 years of railroad service before January 1, 1975; or


(2) Had at least 10 years of railroad service as of December 31, 1974, and worked in the railroad industry anytime during calendar year 1974; or


(3) Had at least 10 years of railroad service as of December 31, 1974, and had a current connection with the railroad industry (as described in part 216 of this chapter) on December 31, 1974, or when the employee annuity began.


(c) *Employee insured on own wage record in last year of railroad service.* Railroad earnings after 1950 (or after 1936, if a higher PIA would result) and through December 31 of the year before 1974 in which the employee last worked in railroad service are used in computing the Railroad Earnings Dual Benefit PIA if the employee—


(1) Had at least 10 but less than 25 years of railroad service through December 31, 1974; and


(2) Did not work in the railroad industry during 1974; and


(3) Did not have a current connection with the railroad industry (as described in part 216 of this chapter) on December 31, 1974, or when the employee annuity began.
