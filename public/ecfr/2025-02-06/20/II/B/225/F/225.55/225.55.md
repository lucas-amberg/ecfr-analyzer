# § 225.55   Recomputation to use a new or different PIA formula.

(a) *Description*—(1) *New computation formula.* If a new formula for computing or recomputing PIA's is enacted into law and the annuitant is eligible for the recomputation, the Board will recompute the PIA under the new formula.


(2) *Recomputation under different formula.* In some cases, a PIA may be recomputed under a computation formula different from the formula used in the computation (or earlier recomputation) of the PIA. The annuitant must be eligible for a computation or recomputation under the different formula.


(b) *Effective date of recomputation*—(1) *New computation formula.* A PIA recomputed under a newly enacted formula is effective with the month as directed in the legislation that establishes the new formula. The new PIA formula applies when it produces a PIA that is higher than the amount on which the existing annuity is based.


(2) *Different computation formula.* A PIA recomputed under a different formula is effective with the first month that the different formula produces a PIA that is higher than the PIA on which the existing annuity is based.
