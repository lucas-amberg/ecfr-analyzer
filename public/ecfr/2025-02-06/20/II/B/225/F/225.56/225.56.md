# ยง 225.56   Automatic recomputation.

Periodically, the Board reviews the earnings record of every retired, disabled and recently deceased employee to see if a recomputation of the PIA is necessary. When a recomputation is called for due to a change in the reported railroad or social security earnings, the Board processes it automatically. Increased benefits resulting from a recomputation are paid from the earliest month that the recomputation is effective. The annuitant does not have to request a recomputation to consider additional earnings, although the annuitant may request a recomputation before the automatic recomputation is processed. However, the effective date of the recomputation is the same, whether the recomputation is done automatically or at the request of the annuitant.
