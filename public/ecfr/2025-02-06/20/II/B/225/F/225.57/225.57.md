# ยง 225.57   Requesting a recomputation.

An annuitant who meets the conditions for a recomputation may request that his or her PIA be recomputed sooner than it would be recomputed automatically. Providing inclusion of the additional earnings increases the PIA, the Board will recompute the PIA from the earliest permissible date as described in this part.
