# § 226.51   Maximum monthly amount.

The railroad retirement family maximum is equal to an employee's “final average monthly compensation” (FAMC) up to 
1/2 of 
1/12 of the annual maximum tier I earnings as shown in part 224 of this chapter in the year the annuity begins plus 80 percent of so much of his or her FAMC as exceeds 
1/2 of 
1/12 of the tier I maximum in the year the annuity begins. For this purpose, the FAMC is determined by dividing the individual's total earnings up to the tier II earnings limit as shown in part 211 of this chapter for the two highest-earnings years out of the last 10 calendar years, including the year of retirement, by 24. The railroad retirement maximum cannot be more than the FAMC and cannot be less than $1,200.
