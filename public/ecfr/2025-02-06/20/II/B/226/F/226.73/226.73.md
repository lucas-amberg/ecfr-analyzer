# ยง 226.73   Changes in reduction amount.

The reduction amount is not changed when a tier I benefit increases because of a recomputation or a general adjustment in annuity rates, such as a cost-of-living increase. However, the reduction amount may change for the following reasons:


(a) *A spouse or divorced spouse becomes entitled to a tier I benefit after the effective date of the reduction.* The reduction amount is recomputed as if the spouse or divorced spouse were entitled to a tier I benefit on the date the reduction first applied. The new reduction amount applies beginning with the date the spouse or divorced spouse tier I benefit begins.


(b) *The tier I benefit of a spouse or divorced spouse annuity ends after the effective date of the reduction.* The new reduction amount is computed using the tier I rate to which the employee was entitled when the reduction first applied. The new reduction amount applies beginning with the month after the month in which the spouse or divorced spouse tier I benefit ends.


(c) The average current earnings are redetermined, as shown in ยง 226.74.


(d) *The amount of the other disability benefit changes.* The reduction amount is recomputed to use the new benefit rate beginning with the date on which the new rate is payable. Any increases in the tier I amounts which were effective after the reduction first applied are not included in computing the new reduction amount.
