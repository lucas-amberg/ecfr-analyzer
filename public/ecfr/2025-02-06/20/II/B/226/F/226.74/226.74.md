# § 226.74   Redetermination of reduction.

(a) *General.* The average current earnings are redetermined in the second year after the year the reduction for other disability benefits was first applied and every third year after that. The redetermined amount is used only if it results in a lower reduction amount. The new reduction amount is effective with January of the year after the redetermination is made.


(b) *Redetermined average current earnings.* The average current earnings are redetermined by multiplying the initial average current earnings amount by—


(1) The average of the total wages (including wages that exceed the maximum used in computing social security benefits) of all persons for whom wages were reported to the Secretary of the Treasury for the year before the year of redetermination, divided by the average of the total wages reported to the Secretary of the Treasury for 1977 or, if later, the year before the year for which the reduction was first computed. If the result is not a multiple of $1, it is rounded to the next lower multiple of $1; or


(2) If the reduction was first computed before 1978, the average of all taxable wages reported to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for the first quarter of 1977, divided by the average of all taxable wages reported to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for the first quarter of the year before the year for which the reduction was first computed. If the result is not a multiple of $1, it is rounded to the next lower multiple of $1.
