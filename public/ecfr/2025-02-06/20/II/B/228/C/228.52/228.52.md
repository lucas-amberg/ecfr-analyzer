(b) *Amount.* The amount of the tier II restored amount for a widow(er) is the difference between the amount payable as a widow(er) under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 as increased by all annual social security cost-of-living percentage increases from January 1, 1975, until the later of the annuity beginning date of either the employee's annuity or the widow(er)'s annuity and the amount payable to the widow(er) under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 under the rules set forth in this part.


(c) *Widower.* In order to qualify for an annuity under the 1937 Act and thus for a restored amount, a widower must have been dependent on his spouse for at least 50 percent of his support in the year prior to her death or at the time the spouse's annuity began.
