# § 233.4   Reconsideration of the reduction computation.

The Board shall periodically, but at least quarterly, examine the determinations and calculations made under §§ 233.1 and 233.2, in view of changes which may occur in the estimates used. If, as a result of this examination, the Board determines that the balance in the Dual Benefits Payments Account will be insufficient to pay benefits from that Account for the balance of the fiscal year at the established rate, the Board shall establish a new rate of reduction to be applied to benefits to be paid for the remaining months so that the balance in the Dual Benefits Payments Account will be sufficient to pay benefits for the remainder of the fiscal year. If, as a result of this examination, the Board finds that the balance in the Account is greater than would be required to pay benefits at the then applicable reduction percentage for the remainder of the fiscal year, the Board may, at its discretion, decrease the reduction percentage with respect to benefits to be paid for the remaining months.
