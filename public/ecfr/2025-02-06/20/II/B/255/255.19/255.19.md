# ยง 255.19   Suspension or termination of the collection of overpayments.

This section sets forth the principal standards which the Board applies in approving the suspension or termination of the collection of an overpayment. In addition the Board may suspend or terminate collection under the Federal Claims Collection Standards set forth in 4 CFR part 104.


(a) Collection action on a Board claim may be suspended temporarily when the debtor cannot be located and there is reason to believe future collection action may be productive or collection may be effected by offset in the near future.


(b) Collection action may be terminated when:


(1) The debtor is unable to make any substantial payment;


(2) The debtor cannot be located and offset is too remote to justify retention of the claim;


(3) The cost of collection action will exceed the amount recoverable; or


(4) The claim is legally without merit or cannot be substantiated by the evidence.
