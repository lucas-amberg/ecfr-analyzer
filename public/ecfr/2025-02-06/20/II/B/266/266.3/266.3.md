# ยง 266.3   Information considered in determining whether to make representative payments.

In determining whether to make representative payment, the Board may consider the following information:


(a) *Evidence of legal guardianship.* Evidence of the appointment of a legal guardian or other person legally vested with the care of the person or estate of an incompetent or a minor shall be a certified copy of the court's determination.


(b) *Medical evidence.* The Board may use medical evidence, when such is available, to help determine whether an annuitant is capable of managing or directing the management of benefit payments. For example, a statement by a physician or other medical professional based upon his or her recent examination of the annuitant and his or her knowledge of the annuitant's present condition will be used in the Board's determination, if it includes information concerning the nature of the annuitant's illness, the annuitant's chances for recovery and the opinion of the physician or other medical professional as to whether the annuitant is able to manage or direct the management of benefit payments.


(c) *Other evidence.* The Board may also consider statements of relatives, friends, and other people in a position to know and observe the annuitant, which contain information helpful to the Board in deciding whether the annuitant is able to manage or direct the management of benefit payments.
