# § 322.2   General definition of remuneration.

(a) *Remuneration.* (1) Remuneration includes pay for services for hire, pay for time lost as defined in § 322.6, and other earned income payable or accruing with respect to any day. Income is “earned” if it is payable or accrues in consideration of services and if such services were in turn rendered in consideration of the income payable or accruing. 


(2) Remuneration includes income in the form of a commodity, service, or privilege if, before the performance of the service for which it is payment, the parties have agreed upon the value of such commodity, service, or privilege, and that such part of the amount agreed upon to be paid may be paid in the form of such commodity, service, or privilege. 


(3) Remuneration for a working day that includes a part of two consecutive calendar days is deemed to have been earned on the first of such two days. 


(b) *Subsidiary remuneration.* For the purpose of this part, remuneration does not include subsidiary remuneration, as defined in § 322.9. Subsidiary remuneration for any day does not prevent such day from being a day of unemployment or a day of sickness, except as explained in § 322.9. 


(c) *Supplemental unemployment or sickness benefits.* The term remuneration does not include money payments received by an employee pursuant to any nongovernmental plan for unemployment or sickness insurance, as defined in part 323 of this chapter. Employer payments of sick pay to an employee are remuneration, except when payment is made pursuant to a nongovernmental plan for sickness insurance.
