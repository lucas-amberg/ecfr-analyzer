# ยง 325.2   Procedure for registering for unemployment benefits.

(a) *Registering as unemployed.* To claim unemployment benefits for any day, an employee must register as unemployed by doing the following:


(1) Apply for unemployment benefits and employment service in accordance with ยง 325.3;


(2) File a claim in accordance with ยง 325.4; and


(3) Provide any other information that the Board needs to properly adjudicate his or her right to unemployment benefits.


(b) *No benefits payable without registration.* No unemployment benefits shall be paid to any otherwise qualified employee with respect to any day claimed as a day of unemployment, and no waiting period credit shall be allowed, until such time as the employee has complied with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.


(c) *When a registration period may begin.* When registering for unemployment benefits, an employee may claim benefits for any calendar day on which he or she is unemployed and believes himself or herself to be eligible for benefits. A registration period may begin as early as the first calendar day on which an employee is unemployed following his or her last day of work even though such first calendar day would have been a rest day if the employee had not become unemployed. However, a registration period may not begin with any calendar day with respect to which an employee has received or will receive remuneration.
