# § 345.301   Introduction.

(a) *General.* Effective January 1, 1993, each employer that is subject to this part will have an experience-rated rate of contribution computed as set forth in § 345.303 of this part. A transitional rate of contribution applies to each such employer for 1991 and 1992, in accordance with section 8(a)(1)(B) of the RUIA. An employer that first becomes subject to section 8 of the RUIA after December 31, 1989 will have a “new-employer” contribution rate as computed in § 345.304 of this part. An employer's experience-rated contribution rate will be not less than 0.65 percent nor more than 12.5 percent. Not later than October 15 of each year, the Board will notify each employer of its experience-rated contribution rate for the following calendar year.


(b) *Components of an experience-rated contribution rate.* An employer's experience-rated contribution rate for each calendar year beginning with 1993 will be based upon the following charges:


(1) An allocated charge based upon the amount of benefits paid to employees of such employer; this charge is explained in subpart E of this part;


(2) An unallocated charge based upon a proportionate share of the system unallocated charge balance, the computation of which is explained in § 345.302(p) of this part;


(3) A pooled charge, also referred to as risk-sharing, to cover the cost of benefit payments that are chargeable to a base year employer but are not captured by the contribution rate assigned to such employer because it is paying contributions at the maximum rate of contribution; the formula for computing the pooled charge is set forth in § 345.302(j) of this part;


(4) A surcharge of 1.5, 2.5, or 3.5 percent, or a pooled credit, depending on the balance to the credit of the Account as of June 30 of a given year; and


(5) An addition of 0.65 percent to the rate of contribution to cover the expenses incurred by the Board in administering the RUIA.


(c) *Maximum rate of contribution.* Notwithstanding any provision of this part, an employer's contribution rate for any calendar year shall be limited to 12 percent, except when a surcharge of 3.5 percent is in effect with respect to that calendar year. If a 3.5 percent surcharge is in effect, the maximum contribution limit with respect to that calendar year is 12.5 percent. The surcharge rate for a calendar year will be 3.5 percent when the balance to the credit of the Account is less than zero. The Board will compute the surcharge rate in accordance with § 345.302(n) of this part.
