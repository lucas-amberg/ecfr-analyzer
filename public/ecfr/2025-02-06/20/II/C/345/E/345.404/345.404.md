# § 345.404   Adjustments.

(a) *Recovery of benefits charged to base year employer.* Where the Board recovers a benefit payment that it had previously charged, in whole or in part, to one or more base year employers, the Board will subtract the amount of the recovery from the cumulative benefit balances of the employers of the employee to whom such amount was paid as a benefit in proportion to the amount by which each such employer's cumulative benefit balance was increased as a result of the payment of the benefit.


(b) *Recovery of other benefit payments.* Where the Board recovers a benefit payment that was not charged, in whole or in part, to any base year employer, or was made before January 1, 1990, the Board will treat the amount of the recovery as a subtraction from the system unallocated charge balance.


(c) *Payment of interest or other debt collection-related charges.* The Board will not adjust a base year employer's cumulative benefit balance to reflect payment by a debtor of interest or other charges assessed by the Board under § 200.7 of this chapter with respect to the collection of a debt arising from a benefit payment charged to such employer and later found to be recoverable by the Board.


(d) *Limitations.* The Board will adjust a base year employer's cumulative benefit balance only when the Board actually recovers, by cash payment or setoff, a debt that represents a benefit payment that was charged, in whole or in part, to such employer. No adjustment shall be made—


(1) If the Board waives recovery of a debt in accordance with part 340 of this chapter, or


(2) If the Board finds that a debt is uncollectible, or


(3) To the extent of the amount not recovered by the Board by reason of a compromise settlement of a debt.
