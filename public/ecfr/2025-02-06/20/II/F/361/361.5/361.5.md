# § 361.5   Notice requirements before offset.

The Board shall provide an employee written Notice of Intent to Offset Salary (Notice of Intent). The employee will be provided the notice at least thirty calendar days before the intended deduction is to begin. In addition, the notice must provide the following:


(a) That the Board has reviewed the records relating to the claim and has determined that a debt is owed, and the origin, nature, and amount of that debt;


(b) The Board's intention to collect the debt by means of deduction from the employee's current disposable pay account;


(c) The amount, frequency, approximate beginning date, and duration of the intended deductions;


(d) An explanation of the Board's requirements concerning interest, penalties, and administrative costs, and notification that such assessment must be made unless such payments are excused in accordance with the FCCS;


(e) Advice as to the employee's or his or her representative's right to inspect and copy or to be provided copies of government records relating to the debt;


(f) If not previously provided, notification of the opportunity (under terms agreeable to the Board) to establish a schedule for the voluntary repayment of the debt or to enter into a written agreement to establish a schedule for repayment of the debt in lieu of offset. The agreement must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the Board, and documented in the Board's files (4 CFR 102.2(e));


(g) Advice that the Board will accept a repayment agreement which is reasonable in view of the financial condition of the employee at that time;


(h) If there is a statutory provision for waiver, cancellation, remission or forgiveness of the debt to be collected, advice that waiver may be requested within the period and by the procedure specified and explaining the conditions under which waiver, cancellation, remission or forgiveness is granted;


(i) Advice as to the employee's right to a hearing conducted by an official arranged by the Board (an administrative law judge, or alternatively, a hearing official not under the control of the head of the agency) on the Board's determination of the debt, the amount of the debt, and the percentage of disposable pay to be deducted each pay period if a petition is filed as prescribed by the Board;


(j) Advice that the timely filing of a petition for hearing or a request for waiver (if the waiver statute or regulations are not “permissive” in nature) will stay the commencement of collection proceedings;


(k) Advice that a final decision on the hearing (if one is requested) will be issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than sixty days after the filing of the petition requesting the hearing unless the employee requests and the hearing official grants a delay in the proceedings;


(l) Advice as to the method and time period for requesting a hearing as provided for in § 361.5 and for requesting waiver, if it is available;


(m) Advice that any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations, or evidence may subject the employee to:


(1) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code, part 752 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, or any other applicable statutes or regulations;


(2) Penalties under the False Claims Act, sections 3729-3731 of title 31, United States Code, or any other applicable statutory authority; or


(3) Criminal penalties under sections 286, 287, 1001, and 1002 of title 18, United States Code, or any other applicable statutory authority;


(n) Advice as to other rights and remedies available to the employee under statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection is being made; and


(o) Advice that unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions to the contrary, amounts paid on or deducted for the debt which are later waived or found not owed to the United States will be promptly refunded to the employee. Such refunds will not bear interest unless required or permitted by law.
