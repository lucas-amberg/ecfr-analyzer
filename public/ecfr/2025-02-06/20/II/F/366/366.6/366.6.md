# ยง 366.6   Change in notification to Internal Revenue Service.

If, after submitting to the Internal Revenue Service notification of liability for a debt, the Board:


(a) Determines that an error has been made with respect to the information contained in the notification,


(b) Receives a payment or credits a payment to the account of the debtor named in the notification that reduces the amount of the debt referred to the Internal Revenue Service for offset, or


(c) Receives notification that the debtor has filed for bankruptcy under title 11 of the United States Code or has been adjudicated bankrupt and the debt has been discharged, the Board will promptly notify the Internal Revenue Service. However, the Board will make no notification to the Internal Revenue Service to increase the amount of a debt owed by a debtor named in the Board's original notification to the Internal Revenue Service. If the amount of a debt is reduced after referral by the Board and offset by the Internal Revenue Service, the Board will refund to the debtor any excess amount and will promptly notify the Internal Revenue Service of any refund made by the Board.
