# § 402.130   The FOIA Exemption 4: Trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information.

Submitters may designate information as trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information at the time of submission or within a reasonable time thereafter. Submitters must use good faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under the FOIA exemptions. These designations expire ten years after the due date of the submission unless the submitter requests a longer designation period.


(a) *Steps of submitters notice*—(1) *The submitter's notice.* When trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information is requested under the FOIA, SSA will provide written submitter's notice if we have a reason to believe that information in the records could reasonably be disclosed under the FOIA. The submitter's notice will describe and include a copy of the trade secret or commercial or financial information requested or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving many submitters, SSA may post or publish a submitter's notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to inform the submitters of the proposed disclosure instead of sending individual notifications. The submitter's notice requirements of this section do not apply if:


(i) SSA determines the information is fully exempt under the FOIA, and therefore will not be disclosed;


(ii) The information has been previously published or made generally available; or


(iii) Disclosure of the information is required by statute other than the FOIA.


(2) *Submitter's opportunity to object to disclosure.* (i) Unless SSA grants an extension, the submitter must respond to the notice within five working days of SSA issuing the submitter's notice or the information may be released in accordance with these regulations and the FOIA. A submitter who fails to respond within five working days will be considered to have no objection to the disclosure of the information. SSA is not required to consider any information received after the date of any disclosure decision. Any information provided by a submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.


(ii) If a submitter objects to disclosure, the submitter should provide SSA with a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as basis for non-disclosure, the submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is confidential.


(iii) SSA will consider a submitter's timely made objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.


(3) *Notice of intent to disclose.* Whenever SSA decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, SSA provides the following to the submitter:


(i) A Release Over Objection letter explaining the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections did not meet the requirements for withholding under the FOIA.


(ii) A copy of the information as SSA intends to release it.


(iii) A statement of our intent to disclose the information five working days from the date on the Release Over Objection letter unless the submitter files an action in a U.S. District Court to prevent the release.


(b) *Notice of FOIA lawsuit.* When a submitter's notice is issued for a request that is the subject of a lawsuit, SSA notifies the submitter of the lawsuit within the notice.


(c) *Requester notification.* To the extent SSA expects substantial delays in the processing of FOIA requests due to the agency's communications with the submitter, we will notify the requester in writing via email, or when the requester's email is not provided, via U.S. postal mail.
