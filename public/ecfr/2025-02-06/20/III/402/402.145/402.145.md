# § 402.145   The FOIA Exemption 7: Law enforcement.

Exemption 7 authorizes our agency to withhold certain records that the government has compiled for law enforcement purposes. The records may apply to actual or potential violations of either criminal or civil laws or regulations. We can withhold these records only to the extent that releasing them would cause harm in at least one of the following situations:


(a) *Enforcement proceedings.* Pursuant to the FOIA Exemption 7(A) (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(a)), we may withhold information whose release could reasonably be expected to interfere with prospective or ongoing law enforcement proceedings. Investigations of fraud and mismanagement, employee misconduct, and civil rights violations may fall into this category. In certain cases—such as when a fraud investigation is likely—we may refuse to confirm or deny the existence of records that relate to the violations in order not to disclose that an investigation is in progress, or may be conducted.


(b) *Fair trial or impartial adjudication.* Under the FOIA Exemption 7(B) (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(b)), we may withhold records whose release would deprive a person of a fair trial or an impartial adjudication because of prejudicial publicity.


(c) *Personal privacy.* Under the FOIA Exemption 7(C) (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(c)), we may withhold the personally identifiable information of individuals when the disclosure could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. When a name surfaces in an investigation, that person is likely to be vulnerable to innuendo, rumor, harassment, and retaliation.


(d) *Confidential sources and information.* Pursuant to the FOIA Exemption 7(D) (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(d)), we may withhold the identity of confidential sources, as well as the records obtained from the confidential sources in criminal investigations or by an agency conducting a lawful national security investigation. A confidential source may be an individual; a State, local, or foreign government agency; or any private organization. The exemption applies whether the source provides information under an express promise of confidentiality or under circumstances from which such an assurance could be reasonably inferred; however, inferred confidentiality is determined in a case-by-case analysis. Also protected from mandatory disclosure is any information which, if disclosed, could reasonably be expected to jeopardize the system of confidentiality that assures a flow of information from sources to investigatory agencies.


(e) *Techniques and procedures.* Under the FOIA Exemption 7(E) (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(e)), we may withhold records that would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law. In some cases, it is not possible to describe even in general terms those techniques without disclosing the very material to be withheld.


(f) *Life and physical safety.* Under the FOIA Exemption 7(F) (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(f)), we may withhold records whose disclosure could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual. This protection extends to threats and harassment, as well as to physical violence.
