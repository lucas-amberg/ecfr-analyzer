# § 402.95   Release of records.

(a) *Records previously released.* If we have released a record, or a part of a record, to others in the past, we will ordinarily release it to the requester, as well. However, we will not release it to a requester if a statute forbids this disclosure; an exemption applies that was not previously applicable; or if the previous release was unauthorized.


(b) *Withholding records.* Section 552(b) of the FOIA explains the nine exemptions under which we may withhold records requested under the FOIA. Within §§ 402.115 through 402.150, we describe the FOIA exemptions and explain how we apply them to disclosure determinations. In some cases, more than one exemption may apply to the same document. Section 552(b) of the FOIA, while providing nine exemptions from mandatory disclosure, does not itself provide any assurance of confidentiality by the agency.


(c) *FOIA library.* If the record(s) requested are already publicly available, either in our electronic FOIA library or elsewhere online, such as at *www.ssa.gov,* we will direct the requester to the publicly available record(s).


(d) *Poor copy.* If we cannot make a legible copy of a record to be released, we do not attempt to reconstruct it. Instead, we furnish the best copy possible and note its poor quality in our reply.
