# § 404.115   Table for determining the quarters of coverage you need to be fully insured.

(a) *General.* You may use the following table to determine the number of quarters of coverage (QCs) you need to be fully insured under § 404.110. Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section tell you how to use this table.


(b) *Number of QCs you need.* The QCs you need for fully insured status are in column II opposite your date of birth in column I. If a worker dies before reaching retirement age as described in § 404.110(b)(2), the QCs needed for fully insured status are shown in column IV opposite—


(1) The year of death in column III, if the worker was born before January 2, 1930; or


(2) The age in the year of death in column V, if the worker was born after January 1, 1930.


(c) *How a period of disability affects the number of QCs you need.* If you had a period of disability established for you, it affects the number of QCs you need to be fully insured (see § 404.110(c)). For each year which is wholly or partly in a period of disability, subtract one QC from the number of QCs shown in the appropriate line and column of the table as explained in paragraph (b) of this section.
