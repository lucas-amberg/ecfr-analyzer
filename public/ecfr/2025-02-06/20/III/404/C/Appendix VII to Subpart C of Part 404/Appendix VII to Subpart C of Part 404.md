# Appendix VII to Subpart C of Part 404—“Old-Law” Contribution and Benefit Base


*Explanation:* We use these figures to determine the earnings needed for a year of coverage for years after 1978 (see § 404.261 and appendix IV). This is the contribution and benefit base that would have been effective under the Social Security Act without the enactment of the 1977 amendments.
