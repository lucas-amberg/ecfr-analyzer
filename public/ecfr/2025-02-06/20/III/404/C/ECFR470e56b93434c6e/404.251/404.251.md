# ยง 404.251   Subsequent entitlement to benefits less than 12 months after entitlement to disability benefits ended.

(a) *Disability before 1979; second entitlement after 1978.* In this situation, we compute your second-entitlement primary insurance amount by selecting the highest of the following:


(1) The primary insurance amount to which you were entitled when you last received a benefit, increased by any automatic cost-of-living or *ad hoc* increases in primary insurance amounts that took effect since then;


(2) The primary insurance amount resulting from a recomputation of your primary insurance amount, if one is possible; or


(3) The primary insurance amount computed for you as of the time of your second entitlement under any method for which you are qualified at that time, including the average-indexed-monthly-earnings method if the previous period of disability is disregarded.


(b) *Disability and second entitlement after 1978.* In this situation, we compute your second-entitlement primary insurance amount by selecting the highest of the following:


(1) The primary insurance amount to which you were entitled when you last received a benefit, increased by any automatic cost-of-living or *ad hoc* increases in primary insurance amount that took effect since then;


(2) The primary insurance amount resulting from a recomputation of your primary insurance amount, if one is possible (this recomputation may be under the average-indexed-monthly-earnings method only); or


(3) The primary insurance amount computed for you as of the time of your second entitlement under any method (including an old-start method) for which you are qualified at that time.


(c) *Disability before 1986; second entitlement after 1985.* When applying the rule in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, we must consider your receipt of a monthly pension based on noncovered employment. (See ยง 404.213). However, we will disregard your monthly pension if you were previously entitled to disability benefits before 1986 and in any of the 12 months before your second entitlement.
