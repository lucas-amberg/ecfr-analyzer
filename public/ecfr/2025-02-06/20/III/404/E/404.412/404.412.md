# ยง 404.412   After my benefits are reduced for age when and how will adjustments to that reduction be made?

(a) *When may adjustment be necessary?* The following months are not counted for purposes of reducing benefits in accordance with ยง 404.410; 


(1) Months subject to deduction under ยง 404.415 or ยง 404.417;


(2) In the case of a wife's or husband's benefit, any month in which she or he had a child of the insured individual in her or his care and for which the child was entitled to child's benefits; 


(3) In the case of a wife's or husband's benefit, any month for which entitlement to such benefits is precluded because the insured person's disability ceased (and, as a result, the insured individual's entitlement to disability benefits ended); 


(4) In the case of a widow's or widower's benefit, any month in which she or he had in her or his care a child of the deceased insured individual and for which the child was entitled to child's benefits; 


(5) In the case of a widow's or widower's benefit, any month before attainment of full retirement age for which she or he was not entitled to such benefits; 


(6) In the case of an old-age benefit, any month for which the individual was entitled to disability benefits. 


(b) *When is the adjustment made?* We make automatic adjustments in benefits to exclude the months of entitlement described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section from consideration when determining the amount by which such benefits are reduced. Each year we examine beneficiary records to identify when an individual has attained full retirement age and one or more months described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section occurred prior to such age during the period of entitlement to benefits reduced for age. Increases in benefit amounts based upon this adjustment are effective with the month of attainment of full retirement age. In the case of widow's or widower's benefits, this adjustment is made in the month of attainment of age 62 as well as the month of attainment of full retirement age.
