(i) Deported under the provisions of section 241(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) that were in effect before April 1, 1997, unless your deportation was under:


(A) Paragraph (1)(C) of that section; or


(B) Paragraph (1)(E) of that section and we received notice of your deportation under this paragraph before March 3, 2004;


(ii) Removed as deportable under the provisions of section 237(a) of the INA as in effect beginning April 1, 1997, unless your removal was under:


(A) Paragraph (1)(C) of that section; or


(B) Paragraph (1)(E) of that section and we received notice of your removal under this paragraph before March 3, 2004; or


(iii) Removed as inadmissible under the provisions of section 212(a)(6)(A) of the INA as in effect beginning April 1, 1997.


(2) Benefits that cannot be paid to you because of your deportation or removal under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may again be payable for any month subsequent to your deportation or removal that you are lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence. You are considered lawfully admitted for permanent residence as of the month you enter the United States with permission to reside here permanently.

(1) You are a U.S citizen; or


(2) You were present in the United States for the entire month. (This means you were not absent from the United States for any period during the month, no matter how short.)


(c) *Lump sum death payment.* A lump sum death payment cannot be paid on the record of a person who died:


(1) In or after the month we receive from the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General of the United States notice of his or her deportation or removal under the provisions of the INA specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section (excluding the exceptions under paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) and (B) and (ii)(A) and (B) of this section); and


(2) Before the month in which the deceased person was thereafter lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence.
