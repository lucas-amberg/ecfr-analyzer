# § 404.471   Nonpayment of disability benefits for trial work period service months upon a conviction of fraudulently concealing work activity.

(a) *Nonpayment of benefits during the trial work period.* Beginning with work activity performed in March 2004 and thereafter, if you are convicted by a Federal court of fraudulently concealing your work activity and the concealment of the work activity occurred while you were in a trial work period, monthly disability benefits under title II of the Social Security Act are not payable for months in which you performed services during that trial work period prior to the conviction (see § 404.1592 for a definition of a trial work period and services). Benefits already received for months of work activity in the trial work period prior to the conviction and in the same period of disability during which the fraudulently concealed work activity occurred, will be considered an overpayment on the record.


(b) *Concealment of work activity.* You can be found to be fraudulently concealing work activity if—


(1) You provide false information to us concerning the amount of earnings you received or are receiving for a particular period;


(2) You received or are receiving disability benefits while engaging in work activity under another identity (this would include working under another social security number or a forged social security number); or


(3) You take other actions to conceal work activity with the intent of fraudulently obtaining benefits in excess of amounts that are due.
