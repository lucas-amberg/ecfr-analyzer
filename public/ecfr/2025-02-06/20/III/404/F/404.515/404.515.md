# § 404.515   Collection and compromise of claims for overpayment.

(a) *General effect of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996.* Claims by the Administration against an individual for recovery of overpayments under title II or title XVIII (not including title XVIII overpayments for which refund is requested from providers, physicians, or other suppliers of services) of the Act, not exceeding the sum of $100,000 or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney General, exclusive of interest, may be compromised, or collection suspended or terminated where such individual or his estate does not have the present or prospective ability to pay the full amount of the claim within a reasonable time (see paragraph (c) of this section) or the cost of collection is likely to exceed the amount of recovery (see paragraph (d) of this section) except as provided under paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) *When there will be no compromise, suspension or termination of collection of a claim for overpayment*—(1) *Overpaid individual alive.* In any case where the overpaid individual is alive, a claim for overpayment will not be compromised, nor will there be suspension or termination of collection of the claim by the Administration if there is an indication of fraud, the filing of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of such individual or on the part of any other party having an interest in the claim.


(2) *Overpaid individual deceased.* In any case where the overpaid individual is deceased (i) a claim for overpayment in excess of $5,000 will not be compromised, nor will there be suspension or termination of collection of the claim by the Administration if there is an indication of fraud; the filing of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of such deceased individual, and (ii) a claim for overpayment regardless of the amount will not be compromised, nor will there be suspension or termination of collection of the claim by the Administration if there is an indication that any person other than the deceased overpaid individual had a part in the fraudulent action which resulted in the overpayment.


(c) *Inability to pay claim for recovery of overpayment.* In determining whether the overpaid individual is unable to pay a claim for recovery of an overpayment under title II or title XVIII of the Act, the Administration will consider such individual's age, health, present and potential income (including inheritance prospects), assets (e.g., real property, savings account), possible concealment or improper transfer of assets, and assets or income of such individual which may be available in enforced collection proceedings. The Administration will also consider exemptions available to such individual under the pertinent State or Federal law in such proceedings. In the event the overpaid individual is deceased, the Administration will consider the available assets of the estate, taking into account any liens or superior claims against the estate.


(d) *Cost of collection or litigative probabilities.* Where the probable costs of recovering an overpayment under title II or title XVIII of the Act would not justify enforced collection proceedings for the full amount of the claim or there is doubt concerning the Administration's ability to establish its claim as well as the time which it will take to effect such collection, a compromise or settlement for less than the full amount will be considered.


(e) *Amount of compromise.* The amount to be accepted in compromise of a claim for overpayment under title II or title XVIII of the Act shall bear a reasonable relationship to the amount which can be recovered by enforced collection proceedings giving due consideration to the exemptions available to the overpaid individual under State or Federal law and the time which such collection will take.


(f) *Payment.* Payment of the amount which the Administration has agreed to accept as a compromise in full settlement of a claim for recovery of an overpayment under title II or title XVIII of the Act must be made within the time and in the manner set by the Administration. A claim for such recovery of the overpayment shall not be considered compromised or settled until the full payment of the compromised amount has been made within the time and manner set by the Administration. Failure of the overpaid individual or his estate to make such payment as provided shall result in reinstatement of the full amount of the overpayment less any amounts paid prior to such default.
