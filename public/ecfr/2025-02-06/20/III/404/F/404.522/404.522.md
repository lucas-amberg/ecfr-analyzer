# § 404.522   Review within SSA that an overpayment is past due and legally enforceable.

(a) *Notification by overpaid individual.* An overpaid individual who receives a notice as described in § 404.521 has the right to present evidence that all or part of the overpayment is not past due or not legally enforceable. To exercise this right, the individual must notify us and present evidence regarding the overpayment within 60 calendar days from the date of our notice.


(b) *Submission of evidence.* The overpaid individual may submit evidence showing that all or part of the debt is not past due or not legally enforceable as provided in paragraph (a) of this section. Failure to submit the notification and evidence within 60 calendar days will result in referral of the overpayment to the Department of the Treasury, unless the overpaid individual, within this 60-day time period, has asked us to waive collection of the overpayment under section 204(b) of the Act and we have not yet determined whether we can grant the waiver request. If the overpaid individual asks us to waive collection of the overpayment, we may ask that evidence to support the request be submitted to us.


(c) *Review of the evidence.* After a timely submission of evidence by the overpaid individual, we will consider all available evidence related to the overpayment. If the overpaid individual has not requested a waiver we will make findings based on a review of the written record, unless we determine that the question of indebtedness cannot be resolved by a review of the documentary evidence. If the overpaid individual has asked us to make a waiver determination and our records do not show that after an oral hearing we had previously determined that he was at “fault” in accepting the overpayment, we will not deny the waiver request without first scheduling an oral hearing.
