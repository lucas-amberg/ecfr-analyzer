# ยง 404.703   When evidence is needed.

When you apply for benefits, we will ask for evidence that you are eligible for them. After you become entitled to benefits, we may ask for evidence showing whether you continue to be entitled to benefits; or evidence showing whether your benefit payments should be reduced or stopped. See ยง 404.401 for a list showing when benefit payments must be reduced or stopped.
