# § 404.780   Evidence of “good cause” for exceeding time limits on accepting proof of support or application for a lump-sum death payment.

(a) *When evidence of good cause* is needed. We may ask for evidence that you had *good cause* (as defined in § 404.370(f)) for not giving us sooner proof of the support you received from the insured as his or her parent. We may also ask for evidence that you had *good cause* (as defined in § 404.621(b)) for not applying sooner for the lump-sum death payment. You may be asked for evidence of *good cause* for these delays if—


(1) You are the insured person's parent giving us proof of support more than 2 years after he or she died, or became disabled; or


(2) You are applying for the lump-sum death payment more than 2 years after the insured died.


(b) *What evidence of good cause* is needed. We will ask for the following evidence of good cause:


(1) Your signed statement explaining why you did not give us the proof of support or the application for lump-sum death payment within the specified 2 year period.


(2) If the statement in paragraph (b)(1) of the section or other evidence raises a reasonable doubt whether there was good cause, other convincing evidence of this.
