# § 404.925   How to request expedited appeals process.

(a) *Time of filing request.* You may request the expedited appeals process—


(1) Within 60 days after the date you receive notice of the reconsidered determination (or within the extended time period if we extend the time as provided in paragraph (c) of this section);


(2) At any time after you have filed a timely request for a hearing but before you receive notice of the administrative law judge's decision;


(3) Within 60 days after the date you receive a notice of the administrative law judge's decision or dismissal (or within the extended time period if we extend the time as provided in paragraph (c) of this section); or


(4) At any time after you have filed a timely request for Appeals Council review, but before you receive notice of the Appeals Council's action.


(b) *Place of filing request.* You may file a written request for the expedited appeals process at one of our offices, the Veterans Administration Regional Office in the Philippines, or an office of the Railroad Retirement Board if you have 10 or more years of service in the railroad industry.


(c) *Extension of time to request expedited appeals process.* If you want to use the expedited appeals process but do not request it within the stated time period, you may ask for more time to submit your request. Your request for an extension of time must be in writing and must give the reasons why the request for the expedited appeals process was not filed within the stated time period. If you show that you had good cause for missing the deadline, the time period will be extended. To determine whether good cause exists, we use the standards explained in § 404.911.
