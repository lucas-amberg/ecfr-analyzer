# § 404.952   Consolidated hearing before an administrative law judge.

(a) *General.* (1) A consolidated hearing may be held if—


(i) You have requested a hearing to decide your benefit rights under title II of the Act and you have also requested a hearing to decide your rights under another law we administer; and


(ii) One or more of the issues to be considered at the hearing you requested are the same issues that are involved in another claim you have pending before us.


(2) If the administrative law judge decides to hold the hearing on both claims, he or she decides both claims, even if we have not yet made an initial or reconsidered determination on the other claim.


(b) *Record, evidence, and decision.* There will be a single record at a consolidated hearing. This means that the evidence introduced in one case becomes evidence in the other(s). The administrative law judge may make either a separate or consolidated decision.
