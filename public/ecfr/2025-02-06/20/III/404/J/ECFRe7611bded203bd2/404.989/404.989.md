# § 404.989   Good cause for reopening.

(a) We will find that there is good cause to reopen a determination or decision if—


(1) New and material evidence is furnished;


(2) A clerical error in the computation or recomputation of benefits was made; or


(3) The evidence that was considered in making the determination or decision clearly shows on its face that an error was made.


(b) We will not find good cause to reopen your case if the only reason for reopening is a change of legal interpretation or administrative ruling upon which the determination or decision was made.
