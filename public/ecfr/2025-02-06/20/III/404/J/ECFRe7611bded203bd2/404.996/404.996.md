# ยง 404.996   Increase in future benefits where time period for reopening expires.

If, after the time period for reopening under ยง 404.988(b) has ended, new evidence is furnished showing a different date of birth or additional earnings for you (or for the person on whose earnings record your claim was based) which would otherwise increase the amount of your benefits, we will make the increase (subject to the limitations provided in section 205(c) (4) and (5) of the Act) but only for benefits payable after the time we received the new evidence. (If the new evidence we receive would lead to a decrease in your benefits, we will take no action if we cannot reopen under ยง 404.988.)
