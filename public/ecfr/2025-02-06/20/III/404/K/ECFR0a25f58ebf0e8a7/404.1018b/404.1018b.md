# § 404.1018b   Medicare qualified government employment.

(a) *General.* The work of a Federal, State, or local government employee not otherwise subject to Social Security coverage may constitute Medicare qualified government employment. Medicare qualified government employment means any service which in all ways meets the definition of “employment” for title II purposes of the Social Security Act, except for the fact that the service was performed by a Federal, State or local government employee. This employment is used solely in determining eligibility for protection under part A of title XVIII of the Social Security Act (Hospital Insurance) and for coverage under the Medicare program for end-stage renal disease.


(b) *Federal employment.* If, beginning with remuneration paid after 1982, your service as a Federal employee is not otherwise covered employment under the Social Security Act, it is Medicare qualified government employment unless excluded under § 404.1018(c).


(c) *State and local government employment.* If, beginning with service performed after March 31, 1986, your service as an employee of a State or political subdivision (as defined in § 404.1202(b)), Guam, American Samoa, the District of Columbia, or the Northern Mariana Islands is excluded from covered employment solely because of section 210(a)(7) of the Social Security Act which pertains to employees of State and local governments (note §§ 404.1020 through 404.1022), it is Medicare qualified government employment except as provided in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section.


(1) An individual's service shall not be treated as employment if performed—


(i) By an individual employed by a State or political subdivision for the purpose of relieving that individual from unemployment;


(ii) In a hospital, home, or other institution by a patient or inmate thereof as an employee of a State, political subdivision, or of the District of Columbia;


(iii) By an individual, as an employee of a State, political subdivision or the District of Columbia serving on a temporary basis in case of fire, storm, snow, earthquake, flood, or other similar emergency;


(iv) By an individual as an employee included under 5 U.S.C. 5351(2) (relating to certain interns, student nurses, and other student employees of hospitals of the District of Columbia government), other than as a medical or dental intern or a medical or dental resident in training; or


(v) By an election official or election worker paid less than $100 in a calendar year for such service prior to 1995, or less than $1,000 for service performed in any calendar year after 1994 and before 2000, or, for service performed in any calendar year after 1999, less than the $1,000 base amount, as adjusted pursuant to section 218(c)(8)(B) of the Social Security Act to reflect changes in wages in the economy. We will publish this adjustment of the $1,000 base amount in the _Federal Register_ on or before November 1 preceding the year for which the adjustment is made.


(2) An individual's service performed for an employer shall not be treated as employment if—


(i) The service would be excluded from coverage under section 210(a)(7) of the Social Security Act which pertains to employees of State and local governments;


(ii) The service is performed by an individual who—


(A) Was performing substantial and regular service for remuneration for that employer before April 1, 1986;


(B) Was a bona fide employee of that employer on March 31, 1986; and


(C) Did not enter into the employment relationship with that employer for purposes of meeting the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section; and


(iii) After March 31, 1986, but prior to the service being performed, the employment relationship with that employer had not been terminated.
