(a) *Time for filing.* The State must file the civil action for a redetermination of the correctness of the assessment, allowance or disallowance within 2 years from the date the Commissioner mails to the State the notice of the decision under § 404.1296. Where the 2-year period ends on a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday or Federal nonwork day, an action filed on the next Federal workday is considered timely filed.


(b) *Extension of time for filing.* The Commissioner, for good cause shown, may upon written application by a State filed prior to the end of the two-year period, extend the time for filing the civil action.
