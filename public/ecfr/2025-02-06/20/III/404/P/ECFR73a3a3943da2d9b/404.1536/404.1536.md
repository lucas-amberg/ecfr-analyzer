# § 404.1536   Treatment required for individuals whose drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability.

(a) If we determine that you are disabled and drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability (as described in § 404.1535), you must avail yourself of appropriate treatment for your drug addiction or alcoholism at an institution or facility approved by us when this treatment is available and make progress in your treatment. Generally, you are not expected to pay for this treatment. You will not be paid benefits for any month after the month we have notified you in writing that—


(1) You did not comply with the terms, conditions and requirements of the treatment which has been made available to you; or


(2) You did not avail yourself of the treatment after you had been notified that it is available to you.


(b) If your benefits are suspended for failure to comply with treatment requirements, your benefits can be reinstated in accordance with the rules in § 404.470.
