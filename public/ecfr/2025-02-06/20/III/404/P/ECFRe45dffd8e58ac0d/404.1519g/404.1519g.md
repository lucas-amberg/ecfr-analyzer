# § 404.1519g   Who we will select to perform a consultative examination.

The medical source must also have the equipment required to provide an adequate assessment and record of the existence and level of severity of your alleged impairments.


(c) The medical source we choose may use support staff to help perform the consultative examination. Any such support staff (e.g., X-ray technician, nurse) must meet appropriate licensing or certification requirements of the State. See § 404.1503a.
