# § 404.1661   When we will provide performance support.

(a) *Optional support.* We may offer, or a State may request, performance support at any time that the regular monitoring and review process reveals that support could enhance performance. The State does not have to be below the initial performance accuracy rate of 90.6 percent to receive performance support. Support will be offered, or granted upon request, based on available resources.


(b) *Mandatory support.* (1) We will provide a State agency with mandatory performance support if regular monitoring and review reveal that two of three threshold levels (one of which must be performance accuracy) are not met for two consecutive calendar quarters.


(2) We may also decide to provide a State agency with mandatory performance support if regular monitoring and review reveal that any one of the three threshold levels is not met for two consecutive calendar quarters. Support will be provided based on available resources.


(3) The threshold levels are:


(i) Combined title II and title XVI initial performance accuracy rate—90.6 percent,


(ii) Title II initial processing time—49.5 days, and


(iii) Title XVI initial processing time—57.9 days.
