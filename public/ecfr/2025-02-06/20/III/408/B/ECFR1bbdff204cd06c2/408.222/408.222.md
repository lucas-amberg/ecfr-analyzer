# ยง 408.222   How does your other benefit income affect your SVB?

(a) *Income began before you qualify for SVB.* If, at the time you file your application for SVB, your other benefit income is equal to, or more than, the maximum SVB payment possible (see ยง 408.505), we will deny your SVB claim. If it is less, we will reduce any monthly SVB payments you become entitled to by the amount of your other benefit income (see ยง 408.510 for a description of how we make the reduction). 


(b) *Income begins after you qualify for SVB.* If you have been determined to be qualified for SVB, we will reduce any monthly SVB payments you become entitled to by the amount of your other benefit income (see ยง 408.510 for a description of how we make the reduction).
