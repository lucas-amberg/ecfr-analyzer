# ยง 408.228   When do we consider you to be residing outside the United States?

(a) *Effect of residency on SVB eligibility.* You can be paid SVB only for those months in which you are residing outside the United States but you can not be paid for a month that is earlier than the month in which you filed your application for SVB. You are residing outside the United States in a month only if you reside outside the United States on the first day of that month. For SVB purposes, you can be a resident of only one country at a time. You cannot, for example, maintain a residence in the United States and a residence outside the United States at the same time. 


(b) *Definition of residing outside the United States.* We consider you to be residing outside the United States if you: 


(1) Have established an actual dwelling place outside the United States; and 


(2) Intend to continue to live outside the United States. 


(c) *When we will assume you intend to continue living outside the United States.* If you tell us, or the evidence shows, that you intend to reside outside the United States for at least 6 months, we will assume you meet the intent requirement in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Otherwise we will assume, absent convincing evidence to the contrary, that your stay is temporary and that you are not residing outside the United States.
