# ยง 408.402   When do you need to give us evidence?

When you apply for SVB, we will ask you for any evidence we need to make sure that you meet the SVB qualification and entitlement requirements. After you begin receiving SVB, we may ask you for evidence showing whether your SVB payments should be reduced or stopped. We will help you get any documents you need but do not have. If your evidence is a foreign-language record or document, we can have it translated for you. The evidence you give us will be kept confidential and not disclosed to anyone but you except under the rules set out in part 401 of this chapter. You should also be aware that section 811 of the Act provides criminal penalties for misrepresenting the facts or for making false statements to obtain SVB payments for yourself or someone else, or to continue entitlement to benefits.
