# ยง 408.406   How do we evaluate the evidence you give us?

When you give us evidence, we examine it to see if it is convincing evidence. This means that unless we have information in our records that raises a doubt about the evidence, other evidence of the same fact will not be needed. If the evidence you give us is not convincing by itself, we may ask you for additional evidence. In evaluating whether the evidence you give us is convincing, we consider such things as whether: 


(a) The information contained in the evidence was given by a person in a position to know the facts; 


(b) There was any reason to give false information when the evidence was created; 


(c) The information in the evidence was given under oath, or with witnesses present, or with the knowledge that there was a penalty for giving false information; 


(d) The evidence was created at the time the event took place or shortly thereafter; 


(e) The evidence has been altered or has any erasures on it; and 


(f) The information contained in the evidence agrees with other available evidence including our records.
