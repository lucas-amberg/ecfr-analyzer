# ยง 408.1020   How do we make our reconsidered determination?

After you request a reconsideration, we will review the evidence considered in making the initial determination and any other evidence we receive. We will make our determination based on the preponderance of the evidence in the record. The person who makes the reconsidered determination will have had no prior involvement with the initial determination.
