# § 408.1005   Will we mail you a notice of the initial determination?

(a) We will mail a written notice of the initial determination to you at your last known address. Generally, we will not send a notice if your benefits are stopped because of your death, or if the initial determination is a redetermination that your eligibility for benefits and the amount of your benefits have not changed.


(b) The notice that we send will tell you— 


(1) What our initial determination is; 


(2) The reasons for our determination; and 


(3) What rights you have to a reconsideration of the determination.


(c) If our initial determination is that we must suspend, reduce your SVB payments or terminate your SVB entitlement, the notice will also tell you that you have a right to a reconsideration before the determination takes effect (see § 408.820).
