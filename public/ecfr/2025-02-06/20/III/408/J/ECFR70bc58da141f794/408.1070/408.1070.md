# § 408.1070   When will we reopen a final determination?

(a) *General rules.* For purposes of this part, we use the same rules on reopening and revising determinations and decisions that we use in the title XVI program (see §§ 416.1487-416.1494 of this chapter), except as noted in paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) *Exceptions.* (1) In addition to the rule stated in § 416.1488, a determination, revised determination, or revised decision may be reopened at any time if it was fully or partially unfavorable to you, but only to correct— 


(i) A clerical error; or 


(ii) An error that appears on the face of the evidence that we considered when we made the determination or decision.


(2) In § 416.1492(b), the parenthetical clause is deemed to read “(see § 408.820),” and paragraph (d) does not apply to this part.


(3) In § 416.1494, the words “one of our offices” in the first sentence are deemed to read “any of the offices listed in § 408.1009(b).”
