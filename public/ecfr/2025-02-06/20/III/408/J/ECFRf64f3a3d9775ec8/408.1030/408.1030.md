# § 408.1030   When can you use the expedited appeals process?

(a) *General rules.* Under the expedited appeals process (EAP), you may go directly to a Federal District Court without first completing the administrative review process. For purposes of this part, we use the same EAP rules we use in the title XVI program (see §§ 416.1423-416.1428 of this chapter) except as noted in paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) *Exceptions.* In § 416.1425, the words “one of our offices” in paragraph (b) are deemed to read “any of the offices listed in § 408.1009(b)” and the reference in the last sentence of paragraph (c) to “§ 416.1411” is deemed to read “§ 408.1011.”
