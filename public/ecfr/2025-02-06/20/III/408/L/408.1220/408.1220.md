# ยง 408.1220   How do we pay Federally administered State recognition payments?

(a) *Payment procedures.* We make Federally administered State recognition payments on a monthly basis and we include them in the same check as your SVB payment. The State recognition payment is for the same month as your SVB payment.


(b) *Maximum amount.* Except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, there is no restriction on the amount of a State recognition payment that SSA will administer on behalf of a State.


(c) *Minimum amount.* SSA will not administer State recognition payments in amounts less than $1 per month. Hence, recognition payment amounts of less than $1 will be raised to a dollar.
