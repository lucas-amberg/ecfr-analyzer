Disputes arising under agreements between ENs and State VR agencies must be resolved using the following steps:


(a) When procedures for resolving disputes are spelled out in the agreement between the EN and the State VR agency, those procedures must be used.


(b) If procedures for resolving disputes are not included in the agreement between the EN and the State VR agency and procedures for resolving disputes under contracts and interagency agreements are provided for in State law or administrative procedures, the State procedures must be used to resolve disputes under agreements between ENs and State VR agencies.


(c) If procedures for resolving disputes are not spelled out in the agreement or in State law or administrative procedures, the EN or the State VR agency may request that the PM recommend a resolution to the dispute.


(1) The request must be in writing and include:


(i) a copy of the agreement;


(ii) information on the issue(s) in dispute; and


(iii) information on the position of both the EN and the State VR agency regarding the dispute.


(2) The PM has 20 calendar days after receiving a written request to recommend a resolution to the dispute. If either the EN or the State VR agency does not agree with the PM's recommended resolution to the dispute, the EN or the State VR agency has 30 calendar days after receiving the PM's recommendation to request a decision by us on the matter in dispute.
