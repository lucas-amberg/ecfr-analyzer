# ยง 411.565   What happens if two or more ENs qualify for payment on the same ticket but have elected different EN payment systems?

We will pay each EN (or State VR agency acting as an EN) according to its elected EN payment system in effect at the time the beneficiary assigned the ticket to the EN (or the State VR agency acting as an EN).
