# ยง 411.650   Is there a process for resolving disputes between ENs that are not State VR agencies and PMs, other than disputes on a payment request?

Yes. Under the agreement to assist us in administering the Ticket to Work program, a PM is required to have procedures to resolve disputes with ENs that do not involve an EN's payment request. (See ยง 411.590 for the process for resolving disputes on EN payment requests.) This process must ensure that:


(a) The EN can seek a solution through the PM's internal grievance procedures; and


(b) If the PM's internal grievance procedures do not result in a mutually agreeable solution, the PM shall refer the dispute to us for a decision.
