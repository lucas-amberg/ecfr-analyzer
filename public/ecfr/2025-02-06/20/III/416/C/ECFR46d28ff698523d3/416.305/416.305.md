# § 416.305   You must file an application to receive supplemental security income benefits.

(a) *General rule.* In addition to meeting other requirements, you must file an application to become eligible to receive benefits. If you believe you may be eligible, you should file an application as soon as possible. Filing an application will—


(1) Permit us to make a formal determination whether or not you are eligible to receive benefits;


(2) Assure that you receive benefits for any months you are eligible to receive payment; and


(3) Give you the right to appeal if you disagree with the determination.


(b) *Exceptions.* You need not file a new application if—


(1) You have been receiving benefits as an eligible spouse and are no longer living with your husband or wife;


(2) You have been receiving benefits as an eligible spouse of an eligible individual who has died;


(3) You have been receiving benefits because you are disabled or blind and you are 65 years old before the date we determine that you are no longer blind or disabled.


(4) A redetermination of your eligibility is being made and it is found that you were not eligible for benefits during any part of a period for which we are making a redetermination but you currently meet the requirements for eligibility;


(5) You are notified that your payments of SSI benefits will be stopped because you are no longer eligible and you again meet the requirements for eligibility before your appeal rights are exhausted.
