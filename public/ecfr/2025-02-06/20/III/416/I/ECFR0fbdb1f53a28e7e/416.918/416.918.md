# § 416.918   If you do not appear at a consultative examination.

(a) *General.* If you are applying for benefits and do not have a good reason for failing or refusing to take part in a consultative examination or test which we arrange for you to get information we need to determine your disability or blindness, we may find that you are not disabled or blind. If you are already receiving benefits and do not have a good reason for failing or refusing to take part in a consultative examination or test which we arranged for you, we may determine that your disability or blindness has stopped because of your failure or refusal. Therefore, if you have any reason why you cannot go for the scheduled appointment, you should tell us about this as soon as possible before the examination date. If you have a good reason, we will schedule another examination. We will consider your physical, mental, educational, and linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) when determining if you have a good reason for failing to attend a consultative examination.


(b) *Examples of good reasons for failure to appear.* Some examples of what we consider good reasons for not going to a scheduled examination include—


(1) Illness on the date of the scheduled examination or test;


(2) Not receiving timely notice of the scheduled examination or test, or receiving no notice at all;


(3) Being furnished incorrect or incomplete information, or being given incorrect information about the physician involved or the time or place of the examination or test, or;


(4) Having had death or serious illness occur in your immediate family.


(c) *Objections by your medical source(s).* If any of your medical sources tell you that you should not take the examination or test, you should tell us at once. In many cases, we may be able to get the information we need in another way. Your medical source(s) may agree to another type of examination for the same purpose.
