# § 416.941   Establishment and use of referral and monitoring agencies.

We will contract with one or more agencies in each of the States and the District of Columbia to provide services to individuals whose disabilities are based on a determination that drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability (as described in § 416.935) and to submit information to us which we will use to make decisions about these individuals' benefits. These agencies will be known as referral and monitoring agencies. Their duties and responsibilities include (but are not limited to)—


(a) Identifying appropriate treatment placements for individuals we refer to them;


(b) Referring these individuals for treatment;


(c) Monitoring the compliance and progress with the appropriate treatment of these individuals; and


(d) Promptly reporting to us any individual's failure to comply with treatment requirements as well as failure to achieve progress through the treatment.
