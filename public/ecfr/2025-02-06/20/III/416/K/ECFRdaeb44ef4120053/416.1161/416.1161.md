# § 416.1161   Income of an ineligible spouse, ineligible parent, and essential person for deeming purposes.

The first step in deeming is determining how much income your ineligible spouse, ineligible parent (if you are a child), your sponsor (if you are an alien), or your essential person, has. We do not always include all of their income when we determine how much income to deem. In this section we explain the rules for determining how much of their income is subject to deeming. As part of the process of deeming income from your ineligible spouse or parent, we must determine the amount of income of any ineligible children in the household.


(a) *For an ineligible spouse or parent.* We do not include any of the following types of income (see § 416.1102) of an ineligible spouse or parent:


(1) Income excluded by Federal laws other than the Social Security Act (See the appendix to this subpart.)


(2) Any public income-maintenance payments (§ 416.1142(a)) your ineligible spouse or parent receives, and any income which was counted or excluded in figuring the amount of that payment;


(3) Any of the income of your ineligible spouse or parent that is used by a public income-maintenance program (§ 416.1142(a)) to determine the amount of that program's benefit to someone else;


(4) Any portion of a grant, scholarship, fellowship, or gift used or set aside to pay tuition, fees or other necessary educational expenses; 


(5) Money received for providing foster care to an ineligible child;


(6) The value of food stamps and the value of Department of Agriculture donated foods;

(11) The value of in-kind support and maintenance;


(12) Alaska Longevity Bonus payments made to an individual who is a resident of Alaska and who, prior to October 1, 1985: met the 25-year residency requirement for receipt of such payments in effect prior to January 1, 1983; and was eligible for SSI;


(13) Disaster assistance as described in §§ 416.1150 and 416.1151;


(14) Income received infrequently or irregularly (see §§ 416.1112(c)(1) and 416.1124(c)(6));


(15) Work expenses if the ineligible spouse or parent is blind;

(21) Payments from a fund established by a State to aid victims of crime (see § 416.1124(c)(17));

(25) Interest earned on excluded burial funds and appreciation in the value of excluded burial arrangements which are left to accumulate and become part of separate burial funds, and interest accrued on and left to accumulate as part of the value of agreements representing the purchase of excluded burial spaces (see § 416.1124(c) (9) and (15));

In addition, if the ineligible child is a student (see § 416.1861), we exclude his/her earned income subject to the amounts set in § 416.1112(c)(3). 


(d) *For an eligible alien.* Although we do not deem any income to you from an eligible alien, if your ineligible spouse or ineligible parent is also a sponsor of an eligible alien, we reduce the alien's allocation if he or she has income (see § 416.1163(c)(2)). For this purpose exclude any of the alien's income listed in paragraph (a) of this section.
