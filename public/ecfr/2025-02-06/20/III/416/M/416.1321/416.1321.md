# § 416.1321   Suspension for not giving us permission to contact financial institutions.

(a) If you don't give us permission to contact any financial institution and request any financial records about you when we think it is necessary to determine your SSI eligibility or payment amount, or if you cancel the permission, you cannot be eligible for SSI payments (*see* § 416.207) and we will stop your payments. Also, if anyone whose income and resources we consider as being available to you (see §§ 416.1160, 416.1202, 416.1203 and 416.1204) doesn't give us permission to contact any financial institution and request any financial records about that person when we think it is necessary to determine your SSI eligibility or payment amount, or that person cancels the permission, you cannot be eligible for SSI payments and we will stop your payments. We will not find you ineligible and/or stop your payments if the person whose income and resources we consider as being available to you fails to give or continue permission and good cause, as discussed in § 416.207(h), exists. 


(b) We will suspend your payments starting with the month after the month in which we notify you in writing that: 


(1) You failed to give us permission to contact any financial institution and request any financial records about you, or 


(2) The person(s) whose income and resources we consider as being available to you failed to give us such permission. 


(c) If you are otherwise eligible, we will start your benefits in the month following the month in which: 


(1) You give us permission to contact any financial institution and request any financial records about you, or 


(2) The person(s) whose income and resources we consider as being available to you gives us such permission.
