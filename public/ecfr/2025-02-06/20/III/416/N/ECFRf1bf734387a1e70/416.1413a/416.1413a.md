The method of reconsideration we will use when you appeal an initial determination on your application for benefits depends on the issue involved in your case.


(a) *Nonmedical issues.* If you challenge our finding on a nonmedical issue, we shall offer you a case review or an informal conference, and will reach our reconsidered determination on the basis of the review you select.


(b) *Medical issues.* If you challenge our finding on a medical issue (even if you received payments because we presumed you were blind or disabled), we shall reach our reconsidered determination on the basis of a case review.
