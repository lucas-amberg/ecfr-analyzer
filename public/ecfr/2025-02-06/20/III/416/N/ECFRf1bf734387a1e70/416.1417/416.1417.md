# § 416.1417   Disability hearing—disability hearing officer's reconsidered determination.

(a) *General.* The disability hearing officer who conducts your disability hearing will prepare and will issue a written reconsidered determination, unless:


(1) The disability hearing officer sends the case back for additional development by the component that prepared the case for the hearing, and that component issues a favorable determination, as permitted by § 416.1416(c);


(2) It is determined that you are engaging in substantial gainful activity and that you are therefore not disabled; or


(3) The reconsidered determination prepared by the disability hearing officer is reviewed under § 416.1418.


(b) *Content.* The disability hearing officer's reconsidered determination will give the findings of fact and the reasons for the reconsidered determination.

(c) *Notice.* We will mail you and the other parties a notice of reconsidered determination in accordance with § 416.1422.


(d) *Effect.* The disability hearing officer's reconsidered determination, or, if it is changed under § 416.1418, the reconsidered determination that is issued by the Associate Commissioner for Disability Determinations or his or her delegate, is binding in accordance with § 416.1421, subject to the exceptions specified in that section.
