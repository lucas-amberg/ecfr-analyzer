# § 416.1530   Payment of fees.

(a) *Fees allowed by a Federal court.* We will pay an attorney representative out of your past-due benefits the amount of the fee allowed by a Federal court in a proceeding under title XVI of the Act. The payment we make to the attorney is subject to the limitations described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(b) *Fees we may pay*—(1) *Attorneys and eligible non-attorneys.* Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if we make a determination or decision in your favor and you were represented by an attorney or an eligible non-attorney (see § 416.1517), and as a result of the determination or decision you have past-due benefits;


(i) We will pay your representative out of the past-due benefits the smallest of the amounts in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) through (v) of this section, less the amount of the assessment described in paragraph (d) of this section, unless the representative files a waiver of the fee or direct payment of the fee; and


(ii) If there is a valid assignment (see paragraph (e) of this section), we will pay the representative's fee (see paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section) to an entity.


(iii) Twenty-five percent of the total of the past-due benefits, as determined before any payment to a State (or political subdivision) to reimburse the State (or political subdivision) for interim assistance furnished you, as described in § 416.525 of this part, and reduced by the amount of any reduction in benefits under this title or title II pursuant to section 1127 of the Act;


(iv) The amount of past-due benefits remaining after we pay to a State (or political subdivision) an amount sufficient to reimburse the State (or political subdivision) for interim assistance furnished you, as described in § 416.525 of this part, and after any applicable reductions under section 1127 of the Act; or


(v) The amount of the fee that we set.


(2) *Non-attorneys ineligible for direct payment.* If the representative is a non-attorney who is ineligible to receive direct payment of his or her fee, we assume no responsibility for the payment of any fee that we authorized. We will not deduct the fee from your past-due benefits.


(c) *Time limit for filing request for approval of fee to obtain direct payment.* (1) To receive direct fee payment from your past-due benefits, a representative who is an attorney or an eligible non-attorney should file a request for approval of a fee, or written notice of the intent to file a request, at one of our offices, or electronically at the times and in the manner that we prescribe if we give notice that such a method is available, within 60 days of the date we mail the notice of the favorable determination or decision.


(2)(i) If no request is filed within 60 days of the date the notice of the favorable determination is mailed, we will mail a written notice to you and your representative at your last known addresses. The notice will inform you and the representative that unless the representative files, within 20 days from the date of the notice, a written request for approval of a fee under § 416.1525, or a written request for an extension of time, we will pay all the past-due benefits to you.


(ii) The representative must send you a copy of any request made to us for an extension of time. If the request is not filed within 20 days of the date of the notice, or by the last day of any extension we approved, we will pay to you all past-due benefits remaining after we reimburse the State for any interim assistance you received. We must approve any fee the representative charges after that time, but the collection of any approved fee is a matter between you and the representative.


(d) *Assessment when we pay a fee directly to a representative.* (1) Whenever we pay a fee directly to a representative from past-due benefits, we impose an assessment on the representative.


(2) The amount of the assessment is equal to the lesser of:


(i) The product we obtain by multiplying the amount of the fee we are paying to the representative by the percentage rate the Commissioner of Social Security determines is necessary to achieve full recovery of the costs of determining and paying fees directly to representatives, but not in excess of 6.3 percent; and


(ii) The maximum assessment amount. The maximum assessment amount was initially set at $75, but by law is adjusted annually to reflect the increase in the cost of living. (See §§ 404.270 through 404.277 for an explanation of how the cost-of-living adjustment is computed.) If the adjusted amount is not a multiple of $1, we round down the amount to the next lower $1, but the amount will not be less than $75. We will announce any increase in the maximum assessment amount, and explain how that increase was determined in the _Federal Register._

(3) We collect the assessment by subtracting it from the amount of the fee to be paid to the representative. The representative who is subject to an assessment may not, directly or indirectly, request or otherwise obtain reimbursement of the assessment from you.


(e) *Assignment of direct payment of a fee to designated entity.* (1) A representative may assign direct payment of the fee we authorize to an eligible entity if the representative:


(i) Is eligible for direct payment;


(ii) Has not waived the fee or direct payment;


(iii) Assigns direct payment of the entire fee we authorize to one entity in the manner we prescribe;


(iv) Makes the assignment before the date on which we notify you of our first favorable determination or decision; and


(v) Affiliates with the entity through registration.


(2) A representative may rescind an assignment in the manner we prescribe before the date on which we notify you of our first favorable determination or decision.


(3) A representative may not assign direct payment of a fee to an entity that is ineligible to receive direct payment.


(4) A representative may not waive a fee or direct payment of a fee if the representative previously assigned direct payment of a fee in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section and did not timely rescind that assignment in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section.


(f) *Effective dates for extension of direct payment of fee to attorneys.* The provisions of this subpart authorizing the direct payment of fees to attorneys and the withholding of title XVI benefits for that purpose, apply in claims for benefits with respect to which the agreement for representation is entered into before March 1, 2010.
