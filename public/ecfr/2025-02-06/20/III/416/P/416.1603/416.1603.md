# § 416.1603   How to prove you are a resident of the United States.

(a) *What you should give us.* Your home address in the United States may be sufficient to establish that you are a resident. However, if we have any reason to question that you are a resident of the United States we will ask for evidence. You can prove you are a resident of the United States by giving us papers or documents showing that you live in the United States such as—


(1) Property, income, or other tax forms or receipts;


(2) Utility bills, leases or rent payment records;


(3) Documents that show you participate in a social services program in the United States; or


(4) Other records or documents that show you live in the United States.


(b) *What “resident of the United States” means.* We use the term *resident of the United States* to mean a person who has established an actual dwelling place within the geographical limits of the United States with the intent to continue to live in the United States.


(c) *What “United States” means.* We use the term *United States* in this section to mean the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Northern Mariana Islands.
