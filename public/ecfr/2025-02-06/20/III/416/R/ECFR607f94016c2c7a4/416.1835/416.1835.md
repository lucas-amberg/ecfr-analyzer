# § 416.1835   Information we need about separation or end of marriage after you become eligible for SSI.

(a) *If you and your spouse stop living together.* If you and your spouse stop living together, you must promptly report that fact to us, so that we can decide whether there has been a change that affects either person's benefits. You must also answer questions such as the following. If you cannot answer our questions you must tell us why not and give us whatever information you can.


(1) When did you stop living together?


(2) Do you expect to live together again?


(3) If so, when?


(4) Where is your husband or wife living?


(5) Is either of you living with someone else as husband and wife?


(b) *Evidence of end of marriage*—(1) *Death.* We will accept your statement that your husband or wife died unless we have information to the contrary. If we have contrary information, you must show us the death certificate if you can. If you cannot, you must tell us why not and give us whatever evidence you can.


(2) *Divorce or annulment.* If your marriage ends by divorce or annulment, you must show us the decree of divorce or annulment if you can. If you cannot, you must tell us why not and give us whatever evidence you can.


(3) *Other reason.* If your marriage ends for reasons other than death, divorce, or annulment, you must give us any information we ask you to give us about the end of the marriage. If you cannot, you must explain why you cannot. We will consider all of the relevant information to decide if and when your marriage ends.
