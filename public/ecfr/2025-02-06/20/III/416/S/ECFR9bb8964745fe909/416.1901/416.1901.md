# ยง 416.1901   Scope of subpart S.

(a) *General.* This subpart explains that we may withhold your SSI benefit and/or State supplementary payments and send them to the State (or a political subdivision of the State) as repayment for interim assistance it gave you while your application for SSI was pending, or while your SSI benefits were suspended or terminated if you are subsequently found to have been eligible for such benefits. Before we will do this, the State must have entered into an interim assistance agreement with us authorizing such reimbursement, and you must have given written authorization for us to repay the State (or a political subdivision of the State).
