# ยง 416.2020   Federally administered supplementary payments.

(a) *Payment procedures.* A federally administered State supplementary payment will be made on a monthly basis and will be included in the same check as a Federal benefit that is payable. A State supplementary payment shall be for the same month as the Federal benefit.


(b) *Maximum amount.* There is no restriction on the amount of a State supplementary payment that the Federal Government will administer on behalf of a State.


(c) *Minimum amount.* The Federal Government will not administer optional State supplementary payments in amounts less than $1 per month. Hence, optional supplementary payment amounts of less than $1 will be raised to a dollar.


(d) *Optional supplementation: nine categories possible.* A State may elect Federal administration of its supplementary payments for up to nine categories, depending on the assistance titles in effect in that State in January 1972 (*i.e.*, title I, X, XIV, or XVI). It can have no more than two categories (one for individuals and one for couples) for each title in effect for January 1972:


(1) Since a State with a title XVI program had just the one title in effect, it can supplement only to two categories, the individual (aged, blind, or disabled), the couple (both of whom are aged, blind, or disabled).


(2) Other States could supplement up to nine categories, depending on the plans they had in effect. Six of these categories would be for:


(i) Aged Individual,


(ii) Aged Couple,


(iii) Blind Individual,


(iv) Blind Couple,


(v) Disabled Individual,


(vi) Disabled Couple.


(3) In addition to those enumerated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, there are three additional couple categories for which a State may elect to provide a federally administered supplement. These categories are created when one individual in the couple is:


(i) Aged and the other blind, or


(ii) Aged and the other disabled, or


(iii) Blind and the other disabled.
