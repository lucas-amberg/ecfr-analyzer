(1) The Commissioner has determined that the specific State laws and their enforcement are consistent with the supplemental security income program purpose of providing unencumbered cash payments to recipients; and


(2) The Federal Government is not involved in the administration of such laws and will not vary the State supplementary payment amount it makes to comply with such laws; and
