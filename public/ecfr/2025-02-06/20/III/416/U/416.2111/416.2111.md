# § 416.2111   Conditions for our agreeing to make Medicaid eligibility determinations.

We will agree to make Medicaid eligibility determinations for a State only if the State's Medicaid eligibility requirements for recipients of SSI benefits and for recipients of State supplementary payments are the same as the requirements for receiving SSI benefits and the requirements for receiving State supplementary payments, respectively. Exceptions: We may agree to make Medicaid eligibility determinations—


(a) For one, two, or all of the three categories of people (*i.e.*, aged, blind, and disabled) who receive SSI benefits or State supplementary payments; or


(b) Even though the State's Medicaid eligibility requirements for recipients of SSI benefits or of State supplementary payments, or both, differ from the requirements for SSI or State supplementary payments, or both, in ways mandated by Federal law.
