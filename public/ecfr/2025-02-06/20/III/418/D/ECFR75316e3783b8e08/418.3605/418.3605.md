Initial determinations are the determinations we make that are subject to administrative and judicial review. The initial determination will state the relevant facts and will give the reasons for our conclusions. Examples of initial determinations that are subject to administrative and judicial review include but are not limited to:


(a) The initial calculation of your income and/or resources;


(b) The determination about whether or not you are eligible for a subsidy and if so, whether you receive a full or partial subsidy;


(c) The determination to reduce your subsidy; and


(d) The determination to terminate your subsidy.
