# ยง 418.3678   What is the process for correcting Agency clerical errors?

If we become aware within 60 days of the date of our initial determination or our decision following a case review or telephone hearing, that a clerical error was made in determining whether or not you are eligible for a subsidy (either in whole or in part), we may issue a revised initial determination which would be effective back to the date you originally filed your application or the effective date of a subsidy changing event, provided you meet the requirements in ยง 418.3101. We may revise an initial determination or decision regardless of whether such revised determination or decision is favorable or unfavorable to you. If the revised determination or decision (which is a new initial determination) is not favorable to you, you will not be responsible for paying back any subsidy received prior to the revised determination or decision. We will mail you a notice of the revised determination which will explain to you that we have made a revised determination and that this determination replaces an earlier determination, how this determination affects your subsidy eligibility, and your right to request a hearing.
