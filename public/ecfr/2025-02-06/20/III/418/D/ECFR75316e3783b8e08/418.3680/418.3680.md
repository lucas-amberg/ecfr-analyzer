# ยง 418.3680   What happens if your case is remanded by a Federal court?

When a Federal court remands a case to the Commissioner for further consideration, the decision-maker (as described in ยง 418.3625) acting on behalf of the Commissioner, may make a decision. That component will follow the procedures in ยง 418.3625, unless we decide that we can make a decision that is fully favorable to you without another hearing. Any issues relating to your subsidy may be considered by the decision-maker whether or not they were raised in the administrative proceedings leading to the final decision in your case.
