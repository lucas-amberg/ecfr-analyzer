# ยง 418.3350   What types of unearned income do we not count?

(a) For claims filed on or after January 1, 2010 and redeterminations that are effective on or after January 1, 2010, we do not count as income in-kind support and maintenance.


(b) While we must know the source and amount of all of your unearned income, we do not count all of it to determine your eligibility for the subsidy. We apply to your unearned income the exclusions in ยง 418.3350(c) in the order listed. However, we do not reduce your unearned income below zero, and we do not apply any unused unearned income exclusion to earned income except for the $20 per month exclusion described in ยง 416.1124(c)(12) of this chapter. For purposes of determining eligibility for a subsidy and whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy, we treat the $20 per month exclusion as a $240 per year exclusion.


(c) We do not count as income the unearned income described in ยง 416.1124(b) and (c) of this chapter, except for paragraph (c)(13).


(d) We do not count as income any dividends or interest earned on resources you or your spouse owns.
