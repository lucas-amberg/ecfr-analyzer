# § 422.821   Administrative offset.

(a) *Scope.* (1) Administrative Offset is the withholding of funds payable by the United States to, or held by the United States for, a person to satisfy a debt. We will use Administrative Offset to recover administrative debts.


(2) This section does not apply to:


(i) Debts arising under the Social Security Act;


(ii) Payments made under the Social Security Act, except as provided for in 31 U.S.C. 3716(c), and 31 CFR 285.4;


(iii) Debts arising under, or payments made under the Internal Revenue Code or the tariff laws of the United States;


(iv) Offsets against Federal salaries to the extent these standards are inconsistent with regulations published to implement such offsets under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 31 U.S.C. 3716 (see 5 CFR part 550, subpart K; 31 CFR 285.7; §§ 422.810 and 422.829 of this part);


(v) Offsets under 31 U.S.C. 3728 against a judgment obtained by a debtor against the United States;


(vi) Offsets or recoupments under common law, State law, or Federal statutes specifically prohibiting offsets or recoupments for particular types of debts; or


(vii) Offsets in the course of judicial proceedings, including bankruptcy.


(3) Unless otherwise provided for by contract or law, debts or payments that are not subject to Administrative Offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 may be collected by Administrative Offset under the common law or other applicable statutory authority.


(4) In bankruptcy cases, the agency may seek legal advice from the Office of the General Counsel concerning the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, particularly 11 U.S.C. 106, 362, and 553, on pending or contemplated collections by offset.
