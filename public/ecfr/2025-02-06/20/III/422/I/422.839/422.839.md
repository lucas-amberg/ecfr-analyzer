Upon providing the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) written certification that a debtor has been afforded the procedures provided in § 422.823 of this part, we may request OPM to offset a debtor's anticipated or future benefit payments under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (Fund) and the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) in accordance with regulations codified at 5 CFR 831.1801 through 831.1808, and 5 CFR part 845 Subpart D.
