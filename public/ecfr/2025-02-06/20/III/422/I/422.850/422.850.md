# ยง 422.850   Referrals to the Department of Justice.

(a) *Prompt referral.* (1)(i) We will promptly refer to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for litigation debts on which aggressive collection activity has been taken in accordance with ยง 422.803, and that cannot be compromised, or on which collection activity cannot be suspended or terminated, in accordance with ยง 422.848.


(ii) We may refer debts arising out of activities of, or referred or transferred for collection services to, the agency to DOJ for litigation.


(2)(i) Debts for which the principal amount is over $100,000 or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs will be referred to the Civil Division or other division responsible for litigating such debts at the DOJ.


(ii) Debts for which the principal amount is $1,000,000 or less, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs will be referred to the Nationwide Central Intake Facility at the DOJ as required by the Claims Collections Litigation Report (CCLR) instructions.


(3)(i) Consistent with aggressive agency collection activity and the standards contained in this part and 31 CFR parts 900 through 904, debts will be referred to the DOJ as early as possible and, in any event, well within the period for initiating timely lawsuits against the debtors.


(ii) We will make every effort to refer delinquent debts to the DOJ for litigation within one year of the date such debts last became delinquent. In the case of guaranteed or insured loans, we will make every effort to refer these delinquent debts to the DOJ for litigation within one year from the date the debt was known to the agency.


(4) The DOJ has exclusive jurisdiction over debts referred to it pursuant to this subpart. Upon referral of a debt to the DOJ, we will:


(i) Immediately terminate the use of any administrative collection activities to collect the debt;


(ii) Advise the DOJ of the collection tools utilized and the results of activities to date; and


(iii) Refrain from having any contact with the debtor and direct all debtor inquiries concerning the debt to the DOJ.


(5) After referral of a debt under this subpart, we will immediately notify the DOJ of any payments credited by the agency to the debtor's account. Pursuant to 31 CFR 904.1(b), after referral of the debt under this subpart, the DOJ will notify the agency of any payment received from the debtor.


(b) *Claims Collection Litigation Report.* (1)(i) Unless excepted by the DOJ, we will complete a CCLR and associated signed Certificate of Indebtedness to refer all administratively uncollectible claims to the DOJ for litigation.


(ii) We will complete all sections of the CCLR appropriate to each debt as required by the CCLR instructions and furnish such other information as may be required in specific cases.


(2) We will indicate clearly on the CCLR the actions that we wish the DOJ to take with respect to the referred debt. We may indicate specifically any of a number of litigation activities the DOJ may choose to pursue, including enforced collection, judgment lien only, renew judgment lien only, renew judgment lien and enforced collection, program enforcement, foreclosure only, and foreclosure and deficiency judgment.


(3) We will also use the CCLR to refer a debt to the DOJ for the purpose of obtaining any necessary approval of a proposal to compromise a debt or to suspend or terminate administrative collection activity on a debt.


(c) *Preservation of evidence.* We will maintain and preserve all files and records that may be needed by the DOJ to prove our claim in court. When referring debts to the DOJ for litigation, certified copies of the documents that form the basis for the claim should be provided along with the CCLR. Upon its request, the original documents will be provided to the DOJ.


(d) *Minimum amount of referrals.* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, we will not refer for litigation claims of less than $2,500 exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, or such other amount as the Attorney General may prescribe.


(2) We will not refer claims of less than the minimum amount unless:


(i) Litigation to collect such smaller amount is important to ensure compliance with the agency's policies and programs;


(ii) The agency is referring the claim solely for the purpose of securing a judgment against the debtor, which will be filed as a lien against the debtor's property pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 3201 and returned to the agency for enforcement; or


(iii) The debtor has the clear ability to pay the claim and the Government can enforce payment effectively, with due regard for the exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law and the judicial remedies available to the Government.


(3) We will consult with the Financial Litigation Staff of the Executive Office for United States Attorneys at DOJ prior to referring claims valued at less than the minimum amount.
