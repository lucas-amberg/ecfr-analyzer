(a) *Claims under $2,500.* If your claim is approved, you must complete a “Voucher for Payment under the Federal Tort Claims Act,” Standard Form 1145. If you are represented by an attorney, the voucher for payment (SF 1145) must designate both you and your attorney as “payees”; we will then mail the check to your attorney.
