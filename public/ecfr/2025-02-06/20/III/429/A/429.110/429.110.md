# ยง 429.110   Are there any limitations on SSA's authority under this subpart?

(a) An award, compromise or settlement of a claim under this subpart in excess of $25,000 needs the prior written approval of the Attorney General or his designee. For the purposes of this paragraph, we treat a principal claim and any derivative or subrogated claim as a single claim.


(b) An administrative claim may be adjusted, determined, compromised, or settled under this subpart only after consultation with the Department of Justice when, in the opinion of SSA:


(1) A new precedent or a new point of law is involved;


(2) A question of policy is or may be involved;


(3) The United States is or may be entitled to indemnity or contribution from a third party and SSA is unable to adjust the third-party claim; or


(4) The compromise of a particular claim, as a practical matter, will or may control the disposition of a related claim in which the amount to be paid may exceed $25,000.


(c) An administrative claim may be adjusted, determined, compromised or settled only after consultation with the Department of Justice when it is learned that the United States, or an employee, agent, or cost-plus contractor of the United States, is involved in litigation based on a claim arising out of the same incident or transaction.
