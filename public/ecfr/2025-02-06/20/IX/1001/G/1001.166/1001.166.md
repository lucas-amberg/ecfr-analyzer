# ยง 1001.166   How will the uniform national threshold EER be used to evaluate whether a State will be required to submit a Corrective Action Plan (CAP)?

(a) *Comparison.* Each State's program year EER will be compared to the uniform national threshold EER for that program year. State agencies that do not achieve a program year EER that equals or exceeds the uniform national threshold EER (90 percent of the national EER) for the year under review will be subject to a review by VETS, with input from the Employment and Training Administration (ETA), to determine whether the program year EER is deficient.


(b) *Review.* For each State whose program year EER is subject to review to determine deficiency, the review will consider the degree of difference between the State's program year EER and the uniform national threshold EER for that program year, as well as the annual unemployment data for the State as compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.


(1) The review also may consider other relevant measures of prevailing economic conditions and regional economic conditions, as well as other measures of the performance of workforce programs and/or any information the State may submit.


(2) The review will include consultation with VETS and ETA field staff about findings from their on-site reviews and desk audits of State agency implementation of policies and procedures for services to veterans and also may include consultation with staff affiliated with other agencies of the Department, as appropriate.


(c) *Requirement of a CAP.* After review, a State whose program year EER is determined not to be deficient will be notified that a CAP will not be required; a State whose program year EER is determined to be deficient will be required to submit a CAP to improve the State's performance in assisting veterans to meet their employment needs as a condition of receiving its next-due JVSG.


(1) Any State whose program year EER has been determined to be deficient will be notified by March 31 of the year following the calendar year in which the program year under review ended.


(2) For any State that is required to submit a CAP, VETS will provide technical assistance (TA), with input from ETA, on the development of the CAP. The CAP must be submitted to the Grant Officer's Technical Representative by June 30 of the year following the calendar year in which the program year under review ended.


(3) We will review the CAP submitted by the State and determine, with input from ETA, whether to approve it or to provide additional TA to the State.


(i) If we approve the CAP, the State must expeditiously implement it.


(ii) If we do not approve the CAP, we will take such steps as are necessary to implement corrective actions to improve the State's EER for veterans and eligible persons.


(4) If a State fails to take the actions we impose under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the Assistant Secretary for Veterans' Employment and Training may take any actions available to remedy non-compliance under 20 CFR 1001.130(a) (referring to the compliance measures discussed in 20 CFR part 658, subpart H).
