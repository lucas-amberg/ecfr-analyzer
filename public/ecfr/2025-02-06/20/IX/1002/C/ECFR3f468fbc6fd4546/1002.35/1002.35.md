# § 1002.35   Is a successor in interest an employer covered by USERRA?

USERRA's definition of “employer” includes a successor in interest. In general, an employer is a successor in interest where there is a substantial continuity in operations, facilities, and workforce from the former employer. The determination whether an employer is a successor in interest must be made on a case-by-case basis using a multi-factor test that considers the following:


(a) Whether there has been a substantial continuity of business operations from the former to the current employer;


(b) Whether the current employer uses the same or similar facilities, machinery, equipment, and methods of production;


(c) Whether there has been a substantial continuity of employees;


(d) Whether there is a similarity of jobs and working conditions;


(e) Whether there is a similarity of supervisors or managers; and,


(f) Whether there is a similarity of products or services.
