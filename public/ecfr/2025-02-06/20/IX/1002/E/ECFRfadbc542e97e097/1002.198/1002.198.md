# § 1002.198   What efforts must the employer make to help the employee become qualified for the reemployment position?

The employee must be qualified for the reemployment position. The employer must make reasonable efforts to help the employee become qualified to perform the duties of this position. The employer is not required to reemploy the employee on his or her return from service if he or she cannot, after reasonable efforts by the employer, qualify for the appropriate reemployment position.


(a)(1) “Qualified” means that the employee has the ability to perform the essential tasks of the position. The employee's inability to perform one or more non-essential tasks of a position does not make him or her unqualified.


(2) Whether a task is essential depends on several factors, and these factors include but are not limited to:


(i) The employer's judgment as to which functions are essential;


(ii) Written job descriptions developed before the hiring process begins;


(iii) The amount of time on the job spent performing the function;


(iv) The consequences of not requiring the individual to perform the function;


(v) The terms of a collective bargaining agreement;


(vi) The work experience of past incumbents in the job; and/or


(vii) The current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs.


(b) Only after the employer makes reasonable efforts, as defined in § 1002.5(i), may it determine that the employee is not qualified for the reemployment position. These reasonable efforts must be made at no cost to the employee.
