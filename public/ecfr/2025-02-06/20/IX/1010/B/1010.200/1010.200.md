# § 1010.200   What is priority of service?

(a) As defined in section 2(a) of the JVA (38 U.S.C. 4215(a)) “priority of service” means, with respect to any qualified job training program, that a covered person shall be given priority over a non-covered person for the receipt of employment, training, and placement services provided under that program, notwithstanding any other provision of the law.


(b) Priority in the context of providing priority of service to veterans and other covered persons in qualified job training programs covered by this regulation means the right to take precedence over non-covered persons in obtaining services. Depending on the type of service or resource being provided, taking precedence may mean:


(1) The covered person receives access to the service or resource earlier in time than the non-covered person; or


(2) If the service or resource is limited, the covered person receives access to the service or resource instead of or before the non-covered person.
