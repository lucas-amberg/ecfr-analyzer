# § 1010.330   What are the responsibilities of recipients to collect and maintain data on covered and non-covered persons?

(a) *General requirements.* Recipients must collect information in accordance with instructions issued by the Department.


(1) Recipients must collect two broad categories of information:


(i) For the qualified job training programs specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, information must be collected on covered persons from the point of entry, as defined in § 1010.300(a), and as provided in paragraph (b) of this section; and,


(ii) For all qualified job training programs, including the programs specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, information must be collected on covered and non-covered persons who receive services, as prescribed by the respective qualified job training programs, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.


(2) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, qualified job training programs that served, at the national level, 1,000 or more veterans per year for the three most recent years of program operations (currently the Wagner-Peyser, WIA Adult, WIA Dislocated Worker, WIA National Emergency Grant, and Senior Community Service Employment Programs) must collect information and report on covered entrants. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Program must collect information and report on covered entrants on the effective date of the next information collection requirement applicable to that program, whether that is for a renewal of an existing approved information collection or for approval of a new information collection.


(3) For purposes of this section, covered persons at the point of entry are referred to as “covered entrants.” This group includes two further subgroups: veterans and eligible spouses as defined in § 1010.110.


(b) *Collection and maintenance of data on covered entrants.* In accordance with instructions issued by the Department, recipients of assistance for the programs specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section must collect and report individual record data for all covered entrants from the point of entry.


(c) *Collection and maintenance of data on covered and non-covered persons who receive services.* In accordance with instructions issued for individual qualified job training programs, all recipients must collect and maintain data on covered and non-covered persons who receive services, including individual record data for those programs that require establishment and submission of individual records for persons receiving services.


(1) The information to be collected shall include, but is not limited to:


(i) The covered and non-covered person status of all persons receiving services;


(ii) The types of services provided to covered and non-covered persons;


(iii) The dates that services were received by covered and non-covered persons; and;


(iv) The employment outcomes experienced by covered and non-covered persons receiving services.


(2)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, for persons receiving services, recipients must apply the definitions set forth in § 1010.110 to distinguish covered from non-covered persons receiving services and, within covered persons, to distinguish veterans from eligible spouses.


(ii) Until qualified job training programs adopt the definitions for covered and non-covered persons set forth at § 1010.110 through the publication of requirements pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act, recipients must collect data on the services provided to and the outcomes experienced by veterans (however defined) and non-veterans receiving services in accord with regulations, policies and currently approved information collections.


(d) All information must be stored and managed in a manner that ensures confidentiality.
