# § 614.10   Restrictions on entitlement.

(a) *Disqualification.* If the week of unemployment for which an individual claims UCX is a week to which a disqualification for State unemployment compensation applies under the applicable State law, the individual shall not be entitled to a payment of UCX for that week. As provided in § 614.9(a), no disqualification shall apply in regard to separation from any Federal military agency. 


(b) *Effect of “days lost”.* The continuity of a period of an individual's Federal military service shall not be deemed to be interrupted by reason of any “days lost” in such period, but “days lost” shall not be counted for purposes of determining: 


(1) Whether an individual has performed Federal military service; 


(2) Whether an individual meets the wage and employment requirements of a State law; or 


(3) The amount of an individual's Federal military wages. 


(c) *Allocation of military accrued leave.* A State agency shall allocate the number of days of unused military leave specified in an ex-servicemember's military document, for which a lump-sum payment has been made, in the same manner as similar payments by private employers to their employees are allocated under the applicable State law, except that the applicable Schedule of Remuneration instead of the lump-sum payment shall be used to determine the amount of the claimant's Federal military wages. In a State in which a private employer has an option as to the period to which such payments shall be allocated, such payments shall be allocated to the date of the individual's latest discharge or release from Federal military service. An allocation under this paragraph shall be disregarded in determining whether an individual has had a period of active service constituting Federal military service. 


(d) *Education and training allowances.* An individual is not entitled to UCX under the Act or this part for a period with respect to which the individual receives: 


(1) A subsistence allowance for vocational rehabilitation training under chapter 31 of title 38 of the United States Code, 38 U.S.C. 1501 *et seq.,* or under part VIII of Veterans Regulation Numbered 1(a); or 


(2) An educational assistance allowance or special training allowance under chapter 35 of title 38 of the United States Code, 38 U.S.C. 1700 *et seq.*
