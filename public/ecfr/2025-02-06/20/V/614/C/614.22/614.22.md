# § 614.22   Correcting Federal findings.

(a) *Request for correction.* (1) If an individual believes that a finding specified in § 614.21 is incorrect or that information as to any finding has been omitted from a military document, the individual may request the issuing Federal military agency to correct the military document. A request for correction may be made through the State agency, which shall forward such request and any supporting information submitted by the individual to the Federal military agency.


(2) The Federal military agency shall promptly forward to the individual or State agency making the request the corrected military document. Information contained in a corrected military document issued pursuant to such a request shall constitute the findings of the Federal military agency under § 614.21.


(3) If a determination or redetermination based on a finding as to which correction is sought has been issued by a State agency before a request for correction under this paragraph is made, the individual who requested such correction shall file a request for redetermination or appeal from such determination or redetermination with the State agency, and shall inform the State agency of the request for correction.


(4) An individual who files a request for correction of findings under this paragraph shall promptly notify the State agency of the action of the Federal military agency on such request.


(b) *State agency procedure when request made.* (1) If a determination of entitlement has not been made when an individual notifies a State agency of a request for correction under paragraph (a) of this section, the State agency may postpone such determination until the individual has notified the State agency of the action of the Federal military agency on the request.


(2) If a determination of entitlement has been made when an individual notifies a State agency that a request for correction of Federal findings has been made, or if an individual notifies a State agency prior to a determination of entitlement that a request has been made but such determination is not postponed by the State agency, the individual may file a request for redetermination or appeal in accordance with the applicable State law.


(3) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no redetermination shall be made or hearing scheduled on an appeal until the individual has notified the State agency of the action of the Federal military agency on a request for correction under paragraph (a) of this section.


(c) *State agency procedure when request answered.* On receipt of notice of the action of a Federal military agency on a request for correction of its findings, a State agency shall:


(1) Make a timely determination or redetermination of the individual's entitlement, or


(2) Promptly schedule a hearing on the individual's appeal.


(d) *Findings corrected without request.* Information as to any finding specified in § 614.21 contained in a corrected military document issued by a Federal military agency on its own motion shall constitute the findings of such agency under § 614.21, if notice thereof is received by a State agency before the period for redetermination or appeal has expired under the State law. On timely receipt of such notice a State agency shall take appropriate action under the applicable State law to give effect to the corrected findings.
