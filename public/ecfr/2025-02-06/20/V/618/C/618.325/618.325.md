(a)(1) A State must co-enroll trade-affected workers who are eligible for WIOA's dislocated worker program. Workers may choose to decline co-enrollment in WIOA. A State cannot deny such a worker benefits or services under the TAA Program solely for declining co-enrollment in WIOA.


(2) A State must also make co-enrollment available to trade-affected workers who are eligible for other one-stop partner programs to ensure that all necessary and appropriate services, including supportive services, are available to the worker.


(b)(1) *Trade-affected worker dislocated worker eligibility.* Most trade-affected workers meet the eligibility criteria of a dislocated worker defined at WIOA section 3(15).


(2) *Partially separated worker and AAIW dislocated worker eligibility.* In certain circumstances, such as a general announcement of a closure, partially separated workers and AAIWs may meet the eligibility criteria as a dislocated worker under WIOA and must also be co-enrolled.


(3) *Trade-affected worker dislocated worker ineligibility.* Some trade-affected workers are ineligible for the WIOA dislocated worker program, including those that do not meet the Selective Service registration requirement, and will be exempt from the co-enrollment requirement in this section.
