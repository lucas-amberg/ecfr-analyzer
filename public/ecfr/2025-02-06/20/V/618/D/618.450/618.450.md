# § 618.450   Findings required for a relocation allowance.

(a) *Findings by liable State.* Before the liable State may approve final payment of a relocation allowance, the liable State must make the following findings:


(1) That the AAW meets the eligibility requirements for a relocation allowance specified in § 618.445(a)(1) through (7) and is not also simultaneously receiving a job search allowance as specified in § 618.445(b);


(2) That the worker submitted the application for a relocation allowance within the time limits specified in § 618.445(a)(1);


(3) That the worker began and completed the relocation within the time limitations specified in § 618.445(a)(6) and (7); and


(4) That the worker obtained suitable employment, or a bona fide offer of such suitable employment, in the area of intended relocation, in accordance with § 618.445(a)(5). The liable State must verify (directly or through the agent State) the suitable employment, or the bona fide offer, with the employer.


(b) *Assistance by agent State.* (1) When an AAW relocates to an agent State, the agent State is responsible for:


(i) Assisting the worker in relocating to the State, completing an application for a relocation allowance with the liable State, and paying the relocation allowance; and


(ii) Assisting the liable State by furnishing any information required for the liable State's determination on the claim.


(2) The agent State must cooperate with the liable State in carrying out its activities and functions with regard to relocation applications. When requested by the liable State, the agent State must verify with the employer and report to the liable State whether the worker has obtained suitable employment, or a bona fide offer of suitable employment.
