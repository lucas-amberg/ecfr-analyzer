# § 618.620   Selection of training program.

(a) *Standards and procedures for selection of training.* The State must document the standards and procedures used to select training providers and training(s) in which the training program under this subpart will be approved.


(1) In determining the types of training to be approved and provided under the standards, the State should consult with partner agencies, including State partner agencies (e.g., State apprenticeship agencies or Federal Offices of Apprenticeship located in the States), WIOA one-stop partners, local employers, appropriate labor organizations, local educational organizations, the LWDB, State and local apprenticeship programs, local advisory councils established under the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (Pub. L. 115-224 (2018), as codified at 20 U.S.C. 2301 *et seq.*), and postsecondary institutions.


(2)(i) States may choose an eligible training provider (ETP) established under WIOA section 122 without establishing additional standards or procedures under the TAA Program.


(ii) As provided in section 236 of the Act, States must not limit training approved under this section to only programs on the ETP list under title I of WIOA.


(b) *Training types.* Eligible trade-affected workers must be provided training using either one, or a combination of, the following methods:


(1) Work-based training, such as apprenticeships, OJT, or customized training, may be approved for AAWs. Customized training with the worker's current employer may only be approved for AAIWs if the training is for a position other than the AAIW's threatened position. See § 618.655(c)(2). AAIWs must not be approved for OJTs. See § 618.655(c)(1). The State must inform the worker of the potential negative effects of work-based training on TRA and the HCTC, if available; or


(2) Institutional training, including training at public area career and technical education schools, as well as community colleges, may be approved alone or in combination with work-based training. This also includes distance learning, including online training, where a worker may complete all or part of an educational or vocational program in a geographical location apart from the institution hosting the training program, and where the final certificate or degree conferred is equivalent in standard of achievement and content to the same program completed on campus or at another institutional training location.


(i) A provider of the distance learning must be based in the United States for training provided to be approved. In addition, the worker must be physically within the United States when participating in distance learning to remain eligible for benefits under the Act.


(ii) Distance learning is subject to all training approval criteria described in this subpart.


(iii) The State must establish and monitor the milestones of a distance-learning program based on the worker's IEP, as described in subpart C of this part, if available.


(iv) A worker who does not meet the requirements or milestones of a distance-learning program may be determined to have ceased participation in training, as described in § 618.780(b)(3)(ii).


(3) Higher education includes any training or coursework at an accredited institution, as described in section 102 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1002), including training or coursework for the purpose of obtaining a degree or certification, or for completing a degree or certification that the worker had begun previously at an accredited institution of higher education. Higher education may be approved alone or in combination with work-based training. The distance learning requirements in paragraph (b)(2) of this section also apply to this paragraph (b)(3).


(c) *Other training.* In addition to the training programs discussed in paragraph (b) of this section, training programs that may be approved under § 618.610 (criteria for approval of training) include, but are not limited to:


(1)(i) Any program of remedial education, including ABE courses and other remedial education courses, ELA courses, and HSE preparation courses.


(ii) Remedial education may occur before, or while participating in, the requested training program;


(2) Career and technical education;


(3) Any training program approvable under § 618.610 for which all, or any portion, of the costs of training the trade-affected worker are paid:


(i) Under any other Federal or State program other than the TAA Program; or


(ii) From any source other than this part;


(4) Any training program provided by a State pursuant to title I of WIOA or any training program approved by an LWDB established under section 102 of WIOA;


(5) Any program of prerequisite education or coursework required by a training provider before advancing to further training; or


(6) Any other training program approved by the State that complies with this subpart.


(d) *Advanced degrees.* Training programs that will lead to an advanced degree may be approved; however, the time limits described at § 618.615(d)(3) must be met. States may not restrict access to advanced degrees where the other criteria of this subpart are met. All training programs must be evaluated on their individual merit.
