# § 618.655   Training for adversely affected incumbent workers.

(a) *AAIW training.* Pursuant to sections 236(a)(1) and 247(18) of the Act, a State may approve training for an AAIW, or training for a worker before separation occurs. An AAIW may apply for training and a State may approve training at any time after the date on which the AAIW is determined to be individually threatened with layoff without regard to whether such worker has applied for or exhausted all rights to any UI to which the worker is entitled.


(b) *Threat of layoff.* A State may determine that a worker has been individually threatened with total or partial separation when the worker has received a notice of termination or layoff from employment. Other documentation of a threat of total or partial separation from the firm or other reliable source may be accepted.


(c) *Approval of training.* Except as specified in this section, the provisions of this subpart extend to AAIWs. The following exceptions to the training approval requirements apply to AAIWs:


(1) The State may not approve OJT under § 618.635(a) for AAIWs.


(2) Customized training for AAIWs under § 618.635(b) may be approved only if the training is for a position other than the AAIW's adversely affected position.


(d) *Disqualification and restrictions.* (1) The State must periodically verify that the threat of total or partial separation continues to exist for the AAIW for the duration of the approved training. This may be accomplished by verifying with the AAIW's employer that the threat of separation still exists before funding each subsequent portion of the training.


(2) Funding of a training program must cease upon the removal of the threat. The AAIW must cease the training upon the conclusion of the most recently funded portion, semester or quarter for which expenses have already been accrued. No additional funding will be available while the threat of separation is removed. Funding may resume for the original training program that had been previously approved upon a determination by the State that the threat of separation has been reestablished, or upon total or partial separation from adversely affected employment, if the requirements under § 618.610 are still met. The AAIW's approved training program must be amended, as appropriate, in compliance with § 618.665.


(3) The one training program per certification rule, as described under § 618.615, is applicable to AAIWs. Thus, a training program begun prior to separation and while under a threat of layoff constitutes the one allowed training program available to that AAIW.


(4) The duration of training limitations, at § 618.615(d)(3) are applicable to AAIWs.


(5) An AAIW will not be eligible for a new training program when total or partial separation occurs; however, the existing training may be amended under the provisions of § 618.665.


(6) The State must not consider the AAIW's threatened employment to be suitable employment under § 618.610(a).


(e) *Separation from threatened employment.* (1) Upon a total or partial separation from threatened employment, an AAIW becomes an AAW under the following conditions:


(i) The separation must occur prior to the expiration of the certification period under which the worker was determined to be threatened; and


(ii) The total or partial separation must be for lack of work.


(2) When an AAIW becomes an AAW under the conditions in paragraph (e)(1) of this section:


(i) The State must amend the worker's approved training program, as described in § 618.665; and


(ii) The State must determine what other benefits under the TAA Program the worker may now be eligible for, including TRA. Any time spent in training as an AAIW applies to the duration limits contained in § 618.615.
