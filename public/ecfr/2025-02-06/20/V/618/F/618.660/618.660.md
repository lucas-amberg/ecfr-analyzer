# § 618.660   Training benchmarks.

(a) *Requirement for training benchmarks.* A State must establish and document training benchmarks, as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, for individual AAWs so that they can meet Completion TRA eligibility requirements, described at § 618.765. The benchmarks must be established when the worker enrolls in an approved training program, so that the State can monitor the worker's progress toward completing the approved training duration limits established at § 618.615.


(b) *Scope of requirement.* Training benchmarks must be established for all but short-term training programs.


(c) *Measurement against training benchmark.* To review the AAW's progress against the benchmarks, States may request that the training provider provide documentation of the worker's satisfactory progress, including instructor attestations, progress reports, etc. The case manager may attest to the worker's progress after consultation with the training provider and the worker.


(d) *Must be included in IEP.* The training benchmarks must be described in the AAW's IEP, if available, or otherwise documented in the worker's case file.


(e) *Benchmark qualities.* Benchmarks must be flexible enough to allow for some variability, and both practical and measurable enough to allow administration across a broad spectrum of training scenarios.


(f) *Review of benchmarks.* The State must evaluate and document satisfactory progress against the benchmarks in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section at intervals of not more than 60 days, beginning with the start of the approved training program:


(1) The AAW is maintaining satisfactory academic standing (e.g., not on probation or determined to be “at risk” by the instructor or training provider); and


(2) The AAW is on schedule to complete training within the timeframe identified in the approved training program.


(g) *Actions following failure to meet a benchmark.* (1) Upon failure to meet a benchmark, the State must provide a warning to the AAW that his or her eligibility for Completion TRA is in jeopardy. The warning may be provided verbally, in writing, or both, and must be documented in the worker's case file. In consultation with the worker, the State may amend a worker's training program as described in § 618.665.


(2) If a worker who has previously failed to meet a benchmark under paragraph (g)(1) of this section fails to meet a benchmark during a subsequent review under paragraph (f) of this section, the State must notify the worker of his or her ineligibility for Completion TRA. The worker may elect to continue in the approved training but will not receive any Completion TRA payments; or the training program must be amended, according to § 618.665, and Completion TRA may resume.
