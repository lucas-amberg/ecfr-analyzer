# § 618.725   Training enrollment deadlines.

(a) *Training enrollment deadlines.* As a condition for receiving Basic TRA, an AAW must meet the participation in approved training requirement in § 618.720(g)(1) no later than the latest of:


(1) The last day of the 26th week after the AAW's most recent qualifying separation;


(2) The last day of the 26th week after the week in which the certification was issued; or


(3) 45 days after the later of the dates specified in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, if there are extenuating circumstances that justify an extension of the enrollment period. Extenuating circumstances that justify the 45-day extension are circumstances that would constitute good cause, as established by § 618.730; that is, circumstances under which the AAW acted diligently yet was unable to enroll because of exigent circumstances.


(4) In the case of an AAW who fails to enroll by the date required by paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section due to a failure by the State to provide the AAW with timely information regarding the applicable training enrollment deadline, the AAW must be enrolled in training or obtain a waiver by the Monday of the first week occurring 60 consecutive calendar days following the date the worker was properly notified; or


(5) The Monday of the first week occurring 30 consecutive calendar days (or, if the State is closed that last day because that day falls on a weekend or holiday or for any other reason, the next business day) following the day of termination, whether by revocation or expiration or revocation of a waiver under § 618.735.


(b) *Exceptions*—(1) *Extended training enrollment deadline for delayed approval of application for TRA.* (i) The training enrollment deadlines of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply where:


(A) A State's negative determination on an initial application for TRA under § 618.715 has been reversed through redetermination or appeal;


(B) The AAW is unable to meet the training enrollment deadline because of the delay in obtaining the reversal of the negative determination; and


(C) The delay in obtaining the reversal is not attributable to the AAW.


(ii) Where the conditions of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section are met, the AAW will have until the last day of the 26th week following the date on which the negative determination was reversed to enroll in training or have a training waiver in effect.


(2) *Extended training enrollment deadline for period of duty in military service.* If an AAW who is a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces and has served a period of duty during the AAW's Basic TRA eligibility period but before enrolling in training, the AAW's training enrollment deadline will be the last day of the 26th week following the last day of the AAW's period of duty.


(3) *Good cause.* The training enrollment deadline may be extended for good cause as provided for in § 618.730.
