# ยง 618.775   Payment of Trade Readjustment Allowances during breaks in training.

(a) Basic and Additional TRA are payable to an otherwise eligible AAW during breaks in training (periods within or between courses, terms (quarters or semesters), and academic years) that do not exceed 30 days (counted in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section), only if:


(1) The AAW participated in approved training of this part immediately before the beginning of the break in training;


(2) The break in training was provided in the established schedule of the training provider; and


(3) The AAW resumes participation in the approved training immediately after the break ends.


(b) For the purpose of determining whether a break in training is within the 30-day maximum allowed under this section, all calendar days beginning with the first day of the training break and ending with the last day of the break, as provided in the published schedule of the training provider, must be counted. However, any Saturday, Sunday, or official State or national holiday occurring during the scheduled break in training is excluded from the 30-day count if training normally would not be scheduled in the training program during those days if there was no break.


(c) For Completion TRA, breaks in training are permissible during the 20-week eligibility period. However, payments during breaks in training are not allowed.
