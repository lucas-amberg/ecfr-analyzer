# § 618.832   Overpayments; penalties for fraud.

(a) *Determinations and repayment.* (1) If a State, the Department, or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any person has received any payment under this part to which the person was not entitled, including a payment referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, such person is required to repay such amount to the State or the Department, as appropriate, except that the State or the Department must waive such repayment if such State or the Department determines that:


(i) The payment was made without fault on the part of such person; and


(ii) Requiring such repayment would cause a financial hardship for the person (or the person's household, if applicable).


(2) States must provide persons determined to have received TAA overpayments a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate their eligibility for waiver under the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.


(3) A financial hardship exists if recovery of the overpayment would result in the person's (or the person's household's) loss of or inability to pay for ordinary and necessary living expenses. This determination must take into account the income and resources (including liquid financial resources) reasonably available to the person (and the person's household).


(4) Fault exists for purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section if any of the following criteria are met:


(i) Whether a material statement or representation was made by the person or individual in connection with the application for TAA that resulted in the overpayment, and whether the person knew or should have known that the statement or representation was inaccurate;


(ii) Whether the person failed or caused another to fail to disclose a material fact in connection with an application for TAA that resulted in the overpayment, and whether the person knew or should have known that the fact was material;


(iii) Whether the person knew or should have known that the person or individual was not entitled to the TAA payment;


(iv) Whether, for any other reason, the overpayment resulted directly or indirectly, and partially or totally, from any act or omission of the person or of which the person or individual had knowledge, and that was erroneous or inaccurate or otherwise wrong; or


(v) Whether there has been a determination of fraud under paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) *False representation or nondisclosure of material fact.* In addition to any other penalty provided by law, a person will be permanently ineligible for any further payments under this part if a State, the Department, or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that:


(1) Such person:


(i) Knowingly made, or caused another to make, a false statement or representation of a material fact; or


(ii) Knowingly failed, or caused another to fail, to disclose a material fact; and


(2) As a result of such false statement or representation, or of such nondisclosure, such person has received any payment under this part to which the person was not entitled.


(c) *Notice of determination, fair hearing, and finality.* Except for overpayments determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, no repayment may be required, and no deduction may be made, under this section until a determination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section by the State or the Department, as appropriate, has been made, notice of the determination and an opportunity for a fair hearing thereon has been given to the person concerned, and the determination has become final.


(d) *Training, job search and relocation allowances, and RTAA.* (1) If a trade-affected worker fails, with good cause, to complete training, a job search, or a relocation, any payment or portion of a payment made under this part to such person or individual properly and necessarily expended in attempting to complete such training, job search, or relocation is not an overpayment.


(2) If a trade-affected worker fails, without good cause, to complete training, a job search, or a relocation, then the portion of a payment for the noncompleted component of a benefit is an overpayment. Costs for the completed portions of the training program, job search, or relocation are not an overpayment.


(3) For purposes of this paragraph (d), good cause exists if the worker acted diligently yet was unable to complete training, a job search, or relocation because of exigent circumstances. The State must determine good cause on a worker-by-worker basis.


(4) An overpayment established under this paragraph (d) must be recovered or waived as provided in this section.


(5) For RTAA, an individual meets the “earns not more than $50,000 each year in wages from reemployment” requirement in section 246 of the Act for a given month if the monthly determination of annualized wages is accurate and complete at the time it is made. Payments derived from the annualized wage projection based on complete and accurate information at the time are valid payments that the individual was entitled to and are not overpayments.


(e) *Overpayment recovery of TAA Program funds by offset.* Unless an overpayment is otherwise recovered or is waived, the State-


(1) Must, subject to the limitation in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, recover the overpayment by deduction from any sums payable to such person under:


(i) This part;


(ii) Any Federal UI law administered by the State; or


(iii) Any other Federal law administered by the State that provides for the payment of unemployment assistance or an allowance with respect to unemployment.


(2) Must recover the overpayment from UI payable to such person under the applicable State law.


(3) Must not allow any single deduction under this paragraph (e) to exceed 50 percent of the amount otherwise payable to the person; except that if the applicable State law provides for an overpayment recovery deduction that is less than 50 percent of the amount otherwise payable, such recovery must be equal to that lesser percentage.


(f) *Fraud detection and prevention.* State procedures for the detection and prevention of fraudulent overpayments of TAA benefits must be, at a minimum, the same as the procedures adopted by the State with respect to State unemployment compensation, and consistent with the Department's “Standard for Fraud and Overpayment Detection,” Employment Security Manual, part V, sections 7510 through 7515 (appendix C to this part).


(g) *Person.* For purposes of this section and § 618.836 (recovery of debts due the United States or others by TAA offset), a person includes, in addition to a trade-affected worker or other individual, any employer or other entity or organization as well as the officers and officials thereof, including any training provider as well as the officers and officials thereof, who may bear individual responsibility for the overpayment.


(h) *Criminal penalties.* (1) Any person who makes a false statement of a material fact knowing it to be false, or knowingly fails to disclose a material fact under the circumstances described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, must be imprisoned for not more than 1 year, fined under title 18, United States Code, or both.


(i) For the purpose of obtaining or increasing for that person or for any other person any payment authorized to be furnished under the Act or pursuant to a Governor-Secretary Agreement under section 239 of the Act; or


(ii) When providing information during an investigation of a petition under section 221 of the Act.


(2) Whenever a violation under paragraph (h)(1) of this section is suspected, the State or the Department must refer the conduct to the U.S. Department of Labor Office of the Inspector General.
