# ยง 618.876   Verification of eligibility for program benefits.

(a) *Overall program eligibility.* In addition to all other eligibility criteria contained in this part, an individual must also be authorized to work in the United States to receive benefits under the TAA Program. States are required to verify the status of participants who are not a citizen or national of the United States.


(b) *Initial verification.* All States are required, under section 1137(d) of SSA (42 U.S.C. 1320b-7(d)), to initially verify the immigration status of self-reporting aliens who apply for UI through the system designated by the U.S. Customs and Immigration Service (or USCIS), currently the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlement (or SAVE) program. No further verification is required except as described in paragraph (c) of this section.


(c) *Reverification.* (1) Once a State has verified satisfactory immigration status initially, the State must reverify the worker's immigration status if the documentation provided during initial verification will expire during the period in which that worker is potentially eligible to receive benefits under this subchapter.


(2) The State must conduct such redetermination in a timely manner, using the immigration status verification system described in section 1137(d) of SSA (42 U.S.C. 1320b-7(d)) or by review of other documentation, as described in that provision.
