(OAA secs. 502(c)(6)(A)(iv), 518(a)(8).)


(b) To the extent practicable, the grantee or sub-recipient should arrange for the payment of these expenses from other resources.


(c) Grantees and sub-recipients are encouraged to contact placed participants throughout the first 12 months following placement to determine if they have the necessary supportive services to remain in the job and to provide or arrange to provide such services if feasible.
