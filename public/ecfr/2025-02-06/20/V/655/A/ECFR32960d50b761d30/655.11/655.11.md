All employers, including job contractors, that desire to hire H-2B workers must establish their need for services or labor is temporary by filing an *H-2B Registration* with the Chicago NPC.


(a) *Registration filing.* An employer must file an *H-2B Registration.* The *H-2B Registration* must be accompanied by documentation evidencing:


(1) The number of positions that will be sought in the first year of registration;


(2) The time period of need for the workers requested;


(3) That the nature of the employer's need for the services or labor to be performed is non-agricultural and temporary, and is justified as either a one-time occurrence, a seasonal need, a peakload need, or an intermittent need, as defined by DHS regulations and § 655.6 (or in the case of job contractors, a seasonal need or one-time occurrence); and


(4) For job contractors, the job contractor's own seasonal need or one-time occurrence, such as through the provision of payroll records.


(b) *Original signature.* The *H-2B Registration* must bear the original signature of the employer (and that of the employer's attorney or agent if applicable). If and when the *H-2B Registration* is permitted to be filed electronically, the employer will satisfy this requirement by signing the *H-2B Registration* as directed by the CO.


(c) *Timeliness of registration filing.* A completed request for an *H-2B Registration* must be received by no less than 120 calendar days and no more than 150 calendar days before the employer's date of need, except where the employer submits the *H-2B Registration* in support of an emergency filing under § 655.17.


(d) *Temporary need.* (1) The employer must establish that its need for non-agricultural services or labor is temporary, regardless of whether the underlying job is permanent or temporary, consistent with DHS regulations. A job contractor must also demonstrate through documentation its own seasonal need or one-time occurrence.


(2) The employer's need will be assessed in accordance with the definitions provided by the Secretary of Homeland Security and as further defined in § 655.6.


(e) *NPC review.* The CO will review the *H-2B Registration* and its accompanying documentation for completeness and make a determination based on the following factors:


(1) The job classification and duties qualify as non-agricultural;


(2) The employer's need for the services or labor to be performed is temporary in nature, and for job contractors, demonstration of the job contractor's own seasonal need or one-time occurrence;


(3) The number of worker positions and period of need are justified; and


(4) The request represents a bona fide job opportunity.


(f) *Mailing and postmark requirements.* Any notice or request pertaining to an *H-2B Registration* sent by the CO to an employer requiring a response will be mailed to the address provided on the *H-2B Registration* using methods to assure next day delivery, including electronic mail. The employer's response to the notice or request must be mailed using methods to assure next day delivery, including electronic mail, and be sent by the due date specified by the CO or by the next business day if the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or Federal holiday.


(g) *Request for information (RFI).* If the CO determines the *H-2B Registration* cannot be approved, the CO will issue an RFI. The RFI will be issued within 7 business days of the CO's receipt of the *H-2B Registration.* The RFI will:


(1) State the reason(s) why the *H-2B Registration* cannot be approved and what supplemental information or documentation is needed to correct the deficiencies;


(2) Specify a date, no later than 7 business days from the date the RFI is issued, by which the supplemental information or documentation must be sent by the employer;


(3) State that, upon receipt of a response to the RFI, the CO will review the *H-2B Registration* as well as any supplemental information and documentation and issue a Notice of Decision on the *H-2B Registration.* The CO may, at his or her discretion, issue one or more additional RFIs before issuing a Notice of Decision on the *H-2B Registration;* and


(4) State that failure to comply with an RFI, including not responding in a timely manner or not providing all required documentation within the specified timeframe, will result in a denial of the *H-2B Registration.*

(h) *Notice of Decision.* The CO will notify the employer in writing of the final decision on the *H-2B Registration.*

(1) Approved *H-2B Registration.* If the *H-2B Registration* is approved, the CO will send a Notice of Decision to the employer, and a copy to the employer's attorney or agent, if applicable. The Notice of Decision will notify the employer that it is eligible to seek H-2B workers in the occupational classification for the anticipated number of positions and period of need stated on the approved *H-2B Registration.* The CO may approve the *H-2B Registration* for a period of up to 3 consecutive years.


(2) Denied *H-2B Registration.* If the *H-2B Registration* is denied, the CO will send a Notice of Decision to the employer, and a copy to the employer's attorney or agent, if applicable. The Notice of Decision will:


(i) State the reason(s) why the *H-2B Registration* is denied;


(ii) Offer the employer an opportunity to request administrative review under § 655.61 within 10 business days from the date the Notice of Decision is issued and state that if the employer does not request administrative review within that period the denial is final.


(i) *Retention of documents.* All employers filing an *H-2B Registration* are required to retain any documents and records not otherwise submitted proving compliance with this subpart. Such records and documents must be retained for a period of 3 years from the date of certification of the last *Application for Temporary Employment Certification* supported by the *H-2B Registration,* if approved, or 3 years from the date the decision is issued if the *H-2B Registration* is denied or 3 years from the day the Department of Labor receives written notification from the employer withdrawing its pending *H-2B Registration.*

(j) *Transition period.* In order to allow OFLC to make the necessary changes to its program operations to accommodate the new registration process, OFLC will announce in the _Federal Register_ a separate transition period for the registration process, and until that time, will continue to adjudicate temporary need during the processing of applications.
