# § 655.32   Submission of a modified application or job order.

(a) *Review of a modified Application for Temporary Employment Certification or job order.* Upon receipt of a response to a Notice of Deficiency, including any modifications, the CO will review the response. The CO may issue one or more additional Notices of Deficiency before issuing a decision. The employer's failure to comply with a Notice of Deficiency, including not responding in a timely manner or not providing all required documentation, will result in a denial of the *Application for Temporary Employment Certification.*

(b) *Acceptance of a modified Application for Temporary Employment Certification or job order.* If the CO accepts the modification(s) to the *Application for Temporary Employment Certification* and/or job order, the CO will issue a Notice of Acceptance to the employer. The CO will send a copy of the Notice of Acceptance to the SWA instructing it to make any necessary modifications to the not yet posted job order and, if applicable, to the employer's attorney or agent, and follow the procedure set forth in § 655.33.


(c) *Denial of a modified Application for Temporary Employment Certification or job order.* If the CO finds the response to Notice of Deficiency unacceptable, the CO will deny the *Application for Temporary Employment Certification* in accordance with the labor certification determination provisions in § 655.51.


(d) *Appeal from denial of a modified Application for Temporary Employment Certification or job order.* The procedures for appealing a denial of a modified *Application for Temporary Employment Certification* and/or job order are the same as for appealing the denial of a non-modified *Application for Temporary Employment Certification* outlined in § 655.61.


(e) *Post acceptance modifications.* Irrespective of the decision to accept the *Application for Temporary Employment Certification,* the CO may require modifications to the job order at any time before the final determination to grant or deny the *Application for Temporary Employment Certification* if the CO determines that the offer of employment does not contain all the minimum benefits, wages, and working condition provisions as set forth in § 655.18. The employer must make such modification, or certification will be denied under § 655.53. The employer must provide all workers recruited in connection with the job opportunity in the *Application for Temporary Employment Certification* with a copy of the modified job order no later than the date work commences, as approved by the CO.
