# § 655.64   Special application filing and eligibility provisions for Fiscal Year 2025 under the December 2, 2024, supplemental cap increase.

(a) An employer filing a petition with USCIS under 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(xv) to request H-2B workers with FY 2025 employment start dates on or before September 30, 2025, must meet the following requirements:


(1) The employer must attest on the Form ETA-9142-B-CAA-9 that its business is suffering irreparable harm or will suffer impending irreparable harm (that is, permanent and severe financial loss) without the ability to employ all of the H-2B workers requested on the petition filed pursuant to 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(xv). The employer's attestation must identify the types of evidence the employer is relying on and will retain to meet the irreparable harm standard. The employer must attest that it has created a detailed written statement describing how it is suffering irreparable harm or will suffer impending irreparable harm and describing how such evidence demonstrates irreparable harm. In addition, the employer must attest that it will provide to DHS and/or DOL upon request all of the documentation it relied upon and retained as evidence that it meets the irreparable harm standard, including all of the supporting documentation the employer committed to retain at the time of filing on the employer's attestation form by selecting a checkbox next to the applicable type of documentation in section C, and the written statement describing how such evidence demonstrates irreparable harm.


(2) The employer must attest on Form ETA-9142-B-CAA-9 that each of the workers requested and/or instructed to apply for a visa, whether named or unnamed, on a petition filed pursuant to 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(xv), have been issued an H-2B visa or otherwise granted H-2B status during one of the last three (3) fiscal years (fiscal year 2022, 2023, or 2024), unless the H-2B worker is a national of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Haiti, Colombia, Ecuador, or Costa Rica and is counted towards the 20,000 cap described in 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(xv)(A)(*2*).


(3) The employer must attest on Form ETA-9142-B-CAA-9 that the employer will comply with all the assurances, obligations, and conditions of employment set forth on its approved *Application for Temporary Employment Certification.*

(4) An employer that submits Form ETA-9142B-CAA-9 and the I-129 petition 30 or more days after the certified start date of work, as shown on its approved Form ETA-9142B, *Final Determination: H-2B Temporary Labor Certification Approval,* must conduct additional recruitment of U.S. workers as follows:


(i) Not later than the next business day after submitting the I-129 petition for H-2B worker(s), the employer must place a new job order for the job opportunity with the State Workforce Agency (SWA), serving the area of intended employment. The employer must follow all applicable SWA instructions for posting job orders, concurrently inform the SWA and NPC that the job order is being placed in connection with a previously certified *Application for Temporary Employment Certification* for H-2B workers by providing the unique temporary labor certification (TLC) identification number, and receive applications in all forms allowed by the SWA, including online applications (sometimes known as “self-referrals”). The job order must contain the job assurances and contents set forth in § 655.18 for recruitment of U.S. workers at the place of employment, and remain posted for at least 15 calendar days;


(ii) During the period of time the SWA is actively circulating the job order described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section for intrastate clearance, the employer must contact, by email or other available electronic means, the nearest comprehensive American Job Center (AJC) serving the area of intended employment where work will commence, request staff assistance advertising and recruiting qualified U.S. workers for the job opportunity, and provide the AJC with the unique identification number associated with the job order placed with the SWA or, if unavailable, a copy of the job order. If a comprehensive AJC is not available, the employer must contact the nearest affiliate AJC serving the area of intended employment where work will commence to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (a)(4)(ii);


(iii) Where the occupation or industry is traditionally or customarily unionized, during the period of time the SWA is actively circulating the job order described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section for intrastate clearance, the employer must contact (by mail, email or other effective means) the nearest American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations office covering the area of intended employment and provide written notice of the job opportunity, by providing a copy of the job order placed pursuant to (a)(4)(i) of this section, and request assistance in recruiting qualified U.S. workers for the job;


(iv) During the period of time the SWA is actively circulating the job order described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section for intrastate clearance, the employer must contact (by mail or other effective means) its former U.S. workers, including those who have been furloughed or laid off, during the period beginning January 1, 2023, until the date the I-129 petition required under 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(xv) is submitted, who were employed by the employer in the occupation at the place of employment (except those who were dismissed for cause or who abandoned the worksite), disclose the terms of the job order placed pursuant to (a)(4)(i) of this section, and solicit their return to the job. The contact and disclosures required by this paragraph (a)(4)(iv) must be provided in a language understood by the worker, as necessary or reasonable, and in writing;


(v) During the period of time the SWA is actively circulating the job order described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section for intrastate clearance, the employer must engage in the recruitment of U.S. workers as provided in § 655.45(a) and (b). The contact and disclosures required by this paragraph (a)(4)(v) must be provided in a language understood by the worker, as necessary or reasonable, in writing; and


(vi) During the period of time the SWA is actively circulating the job order described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section for intrastate clearance, the employer must contact (by mail or other effective written means) all U.S. workers currently employed at the place of employment, disclose the terms of the job order placed pursuant to (a)(4)(i) of this section, and request assistance in recruiting qualified U.S. workers for the job. The contact, disclosure, and request for assistance required by this paragraph (a)(4)(vi) must be provided in a language understood by the worker, as necessary or reasonable, and in writing;


(vii) Where the employer maintains a website for its business operations, during the period of time the SWA is actively circulating the job order described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section for intrastate clearance, the employer must post the job opportunity in a conspicuous location on the website. The job opportunity posted on the website must disclose the terms of the job order placed pursuant to (a)(4)(i) of this section, and remain posted for at least 15 calendar days;


(viii) The employer must hire any qualified U.S. worker who applies or is referred for the job opportunity until the date on which the last H-2B worker departs for the place of employment, or 30 days after the last date on which the SWA job order is posted, whichever is later. Consistent with § 655.40(a), applicants can be rejected only for lawful job-related reasons.


(5) The employer must attest on Form ETA-9142-B-CAA-9 that it will fully cooperate with any audit, investigation, compliance review, evaluation, verification, or inspection conducted by DOL, including an on-site inspection of the employer's facilities, interview of the employer's employees and any other individuals possessing pertinent information, and review of the employer's records related to the compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to evidence pertaining to or supporting the eligibility criteria for the FY 2025 supplemental allocations outlined in this paragraph (a) and § 655.68(a), as a condition for the approval of the H-2B petition. Pursuant to this subpart A at § 655.73 and 29 CFR 503.25, the employer will not impede, interfere, or refuse to cooperate with an employee of the Secretary who is exercising or attempting to exercise DOL's audit or investigative authority. DOL may consider the failure to respond to and/or comply with an investigation or audit to be a willful misrepresentation of material fact or a substantial failure to meet the terms and conditions of the *H-2B Application for Prevailing Wage Determination,* or *Application for Temporary Employment Certification,* resulting in an adverse agency action on the employer, agent, or attorney, including assessment of a civil money penalty, revocation of the temporary labor certification, and/or program debarment for not less than 1 year or more than 5 years from the date of the final agency decision under 20 CFR 655.70, 655.72, 655.73 or 29 CFR part 503. A debarred party will be disqualified from filing any labor certification applications or labor condition applications with the Department of Labor by, or on behalf of, the debarred party for the same period of time set forth in the final debarment decision.


(b) This section expires on October 1, 2025.


(c) The requirements under paragraph (a) of this section are intended to be non-severable from the remainder of this section; in the event that paragraph (a)(1), (2), (3), (4), or (5) of this section is enjoined or held to be invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this section is also intended to be enjoined or held to be invalid in such jurisdiction, without prejudice to workers already present in the United States under this part, as consistent with law.
