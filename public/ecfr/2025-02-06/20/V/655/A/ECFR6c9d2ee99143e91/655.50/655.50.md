# ยง 655.50   Determinations.

(a) *Certifying Officers (COs).* The Administrator, OFLC is the Department's National CO. The Administrator, OFLC and the CO(s), by virtue of delegation from the Administrator, OFLC, have the authority to certify or deny *Applications for Temporary Employment Certification* under the H-2B nonimmigrant classification. If the Administrator, OFLC directs that certain types of temporary labor certification applications or a specific *Application for Temporary Employment Certification* under the H-2B nonimmigrant classification be handled by the OFLC's National Office, the Director of the NPC will refer such applications to the Administrator, OFLC.


(b) *Determination.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b), the CO will make a determination either to certify or deny the *Application for Temporary Employment Certification.* The CO will certify the application only if the employer has met all the requirements of this subpart, including the criteria for certification in ยง 655.51, thus demonstrating that there is an insufficient number of U.S. workers who are qualified and who will be available for the job opportunity for which certification is sought and that the employment of the H-2B workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.
