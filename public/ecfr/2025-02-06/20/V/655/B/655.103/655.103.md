# § 655.103   Overview of this subpart and definition of terms.

(a) *Overview.* In order to bring nonimmigrant workers to the United States to perform agricultural work, an employer must first demonstrate to the Secretary that there are not sufficient U.S. workers able, willing, and qualified to perform the work in the area of intended employment at the time needed and that the employment of foreign workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed. This subpart describes a process by which the DOL makes such a determination and certifies its determination to the DHS.


(b) *Definitions.* For the purposes of this subpart:


*Act.* The Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 *et seq.*

*Administrative Law Judge (ALJ).* A person within the Department's Office of Administrative Law Judges appointed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3105.


*Administrator. See* definitions of OFLC Administrator and WHD Administrator in this paragraph (b).


*Adverse effect wage rate (AEWR).* The wage rate published by the OFLC Administrator in the _Federal Register_ for non-range occupations as set forth in § 655.120(b) and range occupations as set forth in § 655.211(c).

(i) Is authorized to act on behalf of the employer for temporary agricultural labor certification purposes;

(iii) Is not under suspension, debarment, expulsion, or disbarment from practice before any court, the Department, or the Executive Office for Immigration Review or DHS under 8 CFR 292.3 or 1003.101.


*Agricultural association.* Any nonprofit or cooperative association of farmers, growers, or ranchers (including, but not limited to, processing establishments, canneries, gins, packing sheds, nurseries, or other similar fixed-site agricultural employers), incorporated or qualified under applicable State law, that recruits, solicits, hires, employs, furnishes, houses, or transports any worker that is subject to 8 U.S.C. 1188. An agricultural association may act as the agent of an employer, or may act as the sole or joint employer of any worker subject to 8 U.S.C. 1188.


*Applicant.* A U.S. worker who is applying for a job opportunity for which an employer has filed an *Application for Temporary Employment Certification* and job order.

*Area of intended employment (AIE).* The geographic area within normal commuting distance of the place of employment for which temporary agricultural labor certification is sought. There is no rigid measure of distance that constitutes a normal commuting distance or normal commuting area, because there may be widely varying factual circumstances among different areas (e.g., average commuting times, barriers to reaching the place of employment, or quality of the regional transportation network). If a place of employment is within an MSA, including a multistate MSA, any place within the MSA is deemed to be within normal commuting distance of the place of employment. The borders of MSAs are not controlling in the identification of the normal commuting area; a place of employment outside of an MSA may be within normal commuting distance of a place of employment that is inside (e.g., near the border of) the MSA.


*Attorney.* Any person who is a member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of any State, possession, territory, or commonwealth of the United States, or the District of Columbia (DC). Such a person is also permitted to act as an agent under this subpart. No attorney who is under suspension, debarment, expulsion, or disbarment from practice before any court, the Department, or the Executive Office for Immigration Review or DHS under 8 CFR 292.3 or 1003.101, may represent an employer under this subpart.
