# § 655.471   Assisted recruitment.

(a) *Requirement of assisted recruitment.* If, as a result of audit or otherwise, the CO determines that a violation has occurred that does not warrant debarment, the CO may require the employer to engage in assisted recruitment for a defined period of time for any future *CW-1 Application for Temporary Employment Certification.*

(b) *Notification of assisted recruitment.* The CO will notify the employer (and its attorney or agent, if applicable) in writing of the assisted recruitment that will be required of the employer for a period of up to 2 years from the date the notice is issued. The notification will state the reasons for the imposition of the additional requirements, state that the employer's agreement to accept the conditions will constitute their inclusion as bona fide conditions and terms of a *CW-1 Application for Temporary Employment Certification,* and offer the employer an opportunity to request an administrative review. If administrative review is requested, the procedures in § 655.461 apply.


(c) *Assisted recruitment.* The assisted recruitment process will be in addition to any recruitment required of the employer by §§ 655.442 through 655.445 and may consist of, but is not limited to, one or more of the following:
