# § 655.410   Offered wage rate and determination of prevailing wage.

(a) *Offered wage.* (1) The employer must advertise the position to all potential workers at a wage that is at least the highest of the following:


(i) The prevailing wage for the job opportunity obtained from the NPWC;


(ii) The Federal minimum wage; or


(iii) The Commonwealth minimum wage.


(2) The employer must offer and pay at least the wage provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to both its CW-1 workers and its workers in corresponding employment. The issuance of a PWD under this section does not permit an employer to pay a wage lower than the highest wage required by any applicable Federal or Commonwealth law.


(b) *Determinations*—(1) *Methods.* The OFLC Administrator will determine prevailing wages in the Commonwealth and occupational classification as follows:


(i) If the mean hourly wage for the occupational classification in the Commonwealth is reported by the Governor, annually, and meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, as determined by the OFLC Administrator, that wage must be the prevailing wage for the occupational classification;


(ii) If the OFLC Administrator has not approved a survey, as reported by the Governor, for the occupational classification under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, and the BLS OES survey reports a mean wage paid to workers in the SOC in Guam, the prevailing wage must be the mean wage paid to workers in the SOC in Guam from the BLS OES survey; and


(iii) If the OFLC Administrator has not approved a survey, as reported by the Governor, for the occupational classification under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and the BLS OES survey does not report the mean wage paid to workers in the SOC in Guam under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the prevailing wage must be the mean wage paid to workers in the SOC in the United States from the BLS OES Survey, adjusted based on the ratio of the mean wage paid to workers in all SOCs in Guam compared to the mean wage paid to workers in all SOCs in the United States from the BLS OES survey.


(2) *Multiple occupations.* If the job duties on the *Application for Prevailing Wage Determination* do not fall within a single occupational classification, the NPC will determine the applicable prevailing wage based on the highest prevailing wage for all applicable occupational classifications.


(c) *Request for PWD*—(1) *Filing requirement.* An employer must electronically request and receive a PWD from the NPWC then electronically file the *CW-1 Application for Temporary Employment Certification* with the NPC.


(2) *Location and methods of filing*—(i) *Electronic filing.* The employer must file the *Application for Prevailing Wage Determination* and all required supporting documentation with the NPWC using the electronic method(s) designated by the OFLC Administrator. The NPWC will return without review any application submitted using a method other than the designated electronic method(s), unless the employer submits with the application a statement of the need to file by mail.


(ii) *Filing by mail.* Employers that are unable to file electronically, either due to lack of internet access or physical disability precluding electronic filing, may file the application by mail. The mailed application must include a statement indicating the need to file by mail. The NPWC will return, without review, mailed applications that do not contain such a statement. OFLC will publish the address for mailed applications in the instructions to Form ETA-9141C.


(d) *NPWC action.* The NPWC will provide the PWD, indicate the source of the PWD, and return the *Application for Prevailing Wage Determination* with its endorsement to the employer.


(e) *Wage survey reported by the Governor.* The OFLC Administrator will issue a prevailing wage for the occupational classification in the Commonwealth based on a wage survey reported by the Governor if all of the following requirements are met:


(1) The survey was independently conducted and issued by the Governor of the Commonwealth, including through any Commonwealth agency, Commonwealth college, or Commonwealth university;


(2) The survey provides the arithmetic mean of the wages of workers in the occupational classification in the Commonwealth;


(3) The surveyor either made a reasonable, good faith attempt to contact all employers in the Commonwealth employing workers in the occupation or conducted a randomized sampling of such employers;


(4) The survey includes the wages of at least 30 workers in the Commonwealth;


(5) The survey includes the wages of workers in the Commonwealth employed by at least three employers;


(6) The survey was conducted across industries that employ workers in the occupational classification;


(7) The wage reported in the survey includes all types of pay;


(8) The survey is based on wages paid to workers in the occupational classification not more than 12 months before the date the survey is submitted to the OFLC Administrator for consideration; and


(9) The Governor submits the survey to the OFLC Administrator, with specific information about the survey methodology, including such items as sample size and source, sample selection procedures, and survey job descriptions, to allow a determination of the adequacy of the data provided and validity of the statistical methodology used in conducting the survey.


(f) *Review of wage survey reported by the Governor.* (1) If the OFLC Administrator finds the wage reported for any occupational classification not to be acceptable, the OFLC Administrator must inform the Governor in writing of the reasons the wage reported in the survey was not accepted.


(2) The Governor, after receiving notification from the OFLC Administrator that the wage reported in the survey it provided for consideration is not acceptable, may submit corrected wage data or conduct a new wage survey and submit revised wage data to the OFLC Administrator for consideration under this section.


(g) *Validity period.* The NPWC will specify the validity period of the prevailing wage, which in no event may be more than 365 days or fewer than 90 days from the date that the determination is issued.


(h) *Retention of documentation.* The employer must retain the PWD for 3 years from the date of issuance if not used in support of a TLC application or if it is used in support of a TLC application that is denied, and 3 years from the date on which the certification of the *CW-1 Application for Temporary Employment Certification* expires, whichever is later. The employer must submit the PWD to a CO if requested by a Notice of Deficiency (NOD), described in § 655.431, or audit, as described in § 655.470, or to any Federal Government Official performing an investigation, inspection, audit, or law enforcement function.
