# ยง 655.1220   Who can appeal the Administrator's findings and what is the process?

(a) Any interested party desiring review of a determination issued under ยง 655.1205(d), including judicial review, must make a request for an administrative hearing in writing to the Chief Administrative Law Judge at the address stated in the notice of determination. If such a request for an administrative hearing is timely filed, the Administrator's determination shall be inoperative unless and until the case is dismissed or the Administrative Law Judge issues an order affirming the decision. 


(b) An interested party may request a hearing in the following circumstances: 


(1) Where the Administrator determines that there is no basis for a finding of violation, the complainant or other interested party may request a hearing. In such a proceeding, the party requesting the hearing shall be the prosecuting party and the facility shall be the respondent; the Administrator may intervene as a party or appear as *amicus curiae* at any time in the proceeding, at the Administrator's discretion. 


(2) Where the Administrator determines that there is a basis for a finding of violation, the facility or other interested party may request a hearing. In such a proceeding, the Administrator shall be the prosecuting party and the facility shall be the respondent. 


(c) No particular form is prescribed for any request for hearing permitted by this part. However, any such request shall: 


(1) Be dated; 


(2) Be typewritten or legibly written; 


(3) Specify the issue or issues stated in the notice of determination giving rise to such request; 


(4) State the specific reason or reasons why the party requesting the hearing believes such determination is in error; 


(5) Be signed by the party making the request or by an authorized representative of such party; and 


(6) Include the address at which such party or authorized representative desires to receive further communications relating thereto. 


(d) The request for such hearing must be received by the Chief Administrative Law Judge, at the address stated in the Administrator's notice of determination, no later than 10 days after the date of the determination. An interested party which fails to meet this 10-day deadline for requesting a hearing may thereafter participate in the proceedings only by consent of the administrative law judge, either through intervention as a party under 29 CFR 18.10 (b) through (d) or through participation as an *amicus curiae* under 29 CFR 18.12. 


(e) The request may be filed in person, by facsimile transmission, by certified or regular mail, or by courier service. For the requesting party's protection, if the request is filed by mail, it should be certified mail. If the request is filed by facsimile transmission, the original of the request, signed by the requestor or authorized representative, must be filed within 10 days of the date of the Administrator's notice of determination. 


(f) Copies of the request for a hearing must be sent by the requestor to the Wage and Hour Division official who issued the Administrator's notice of determination, to the representative(s) of the Solicitor of Labor identified in the notice of determination, and to all known interested parties.
