# ยง 658.427   Severability.

Should a court hold any portion of any provision of this part to be invalid, the provision will be construed so as to continue to give the maximum effect to the provision permitted by law, unless such holding is one of total invalidity or unenforceability, in which event the provision or subprovision will be severable from this part and will not affect the remainder thereof.
