# § 658.500   Scope and purpose of subpart.

(a) This subpart contains the regulations governing the discontinuation of services provided by the ES to employers pursuant to parts 652 and 653 of this chapter.


(b) For purposes of this subpart only, where the term “employer” is used, it refers to employers, agents, farm labor contractors, joint employers, and successors in interest to any employer, agent, farm labor contractor, or joint employer, as defined at § 651.10 of this chapter. A successor in interest to an employer, agent, or farm labor contractor may be held liable for the duties and obligations of that employer, agent, or farm labor contractor for purposes of recruitment of workers through the ES clearance system or enforcement of ES regulations, regardless of whether such successor in interest has succeeded to all the rights and liabilities of the predecessor entity.
