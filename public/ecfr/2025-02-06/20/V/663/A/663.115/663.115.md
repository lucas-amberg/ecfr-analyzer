# § 663.115   What are the eligibility criteria for core services for dislocated workers in the adult and dislocated worker programs?

(a) To be eligible to receive core services as a dislocated worker in the adult and dislocated worker programs, an individual must meet the definition of “dislocated worker” at WIA section 101(9). Eligibility criteria for intensive and training services are found at §§ 663.220 and 663.310. 


(b) Governors and Local Boards may establish policies and procedures for One-Stop operators to use in determining an individual's eligibility as a dislocated worker, consistent with the definition at WIA section 101(9). These policies and procedures may address such conditions as: 


(1) What constitutes a “general announcement” of plant closing under WIA section 101(9)(B)(ii) or (iii); and 


(2) What constitutes “unemployed as a result of general economic conditions in the community in which the individual resides or because of natural disasters” for determining the eligibility of self-employed individuals, including family members and farm or ranch hands, under WIA section 101(9)(C).
