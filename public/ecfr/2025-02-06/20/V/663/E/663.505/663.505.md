# § 663.505   What are eligible providers of training services?

(a) Eligible providers of training services are described in WIA section 122. They are those entities eligible to receive WIA title I-B funds to provide training services to eligible adult and dislocated worker customers. 


(b) In order to provide training services under WIA title I-B, a provider must meet the requirements of this subpart and WIA section 122. 


(1) These requirements apply to the use of WIA title I adult and dislocated worker funds to provide training: 


(i) To individuals using ITA's to access training through the eligible provider list; and


(ii) To individuals for training provided through the exceptions to ITA's described at § 663.430 (a)(2) and (a)(3). 


(2) These requirements apply to all organizations providing training to adult and dislocated workers, including: 


(i) Postsecondary educational institutions providing a program described in WIA section 122(a)(2)(A)(ii); 


(ii) Entities that carry out programs under the National Apprenticeship Act (29 U.S.C. 50 *et seq.*); 


(iii) Other public or private providers of a program of training services described in WIA section 122(a)(2)(C); 


(iv) Local Boards, if they meet the conditions of WIA section 117(f)(1); and


(v) Community-based organizations and other private organizations providing training under § 663.430.
