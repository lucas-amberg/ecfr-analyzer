(1) The availability of funds under section 174(b) for technical assistance, demonstration and pilot projects, evaluations, and Incentive Grants and the needs for these activities; 


(2) The number of States that are eligible for Incentive Grants and their relative program formula allocations under title I; 


(3) The availability of funds under WIA section 136(g)(2) resulting from funds withheld for poor performance by States; and 


(4) The range of awards established in WIA section 503(c). 


(b) We will publish the award amount for eligible States, after consultation with the Secretary of Education, within 90 days after the due date, established under ยง 666.205(a), for the latest State performance progress report providing the annual information needed to determine State eligibility.

(2) The extent to which the negotiated levels of performance were exceeded; 


(3) Performance improvement relative to previous years; 


(4) Changes in economic conditions, participant characteristics and proposed service design since the negotiated levels of performance were agreed to;
