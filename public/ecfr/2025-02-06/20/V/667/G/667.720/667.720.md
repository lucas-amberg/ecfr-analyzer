# ยง 667.720   How do we handle a recipient's request for waiver of liability under WIA section 184(d)(2)?

(a) A recipient may request a waiver of liability, as described in WIA section 184(d)(2), and a Grant Officer may approve such a waiver under WIA section 184(d)(3). 


(b)(1) When the debt for which a waiver of liability is desired was established in a non-Federal resolution proceeding, the resolution report must accompany the waiver request. 


(2) When the waiver request is made during the ETA Grant Officer resolution process, the request must be made during the informal resolution period described in ยง 667.510(c). 


(c) A waiver of the recipient's liability shall be considered by the Grant Officer only when: 


(1) The misexpenditure of WIA funds occurred at a subrecipient's level; 


(2) The misexpenditure was not due to willful disregard of the requirements of title I of the Act, gross negligence, failure to observe accepted standards of administration, or did not constitute fraud; 


(3) If fraud did exist, it was perpetrated against the recipient/subrecipients; and


(i) The recipient/subrecipients discovered, investigated, reported, and cooperated in any prosecution of the perpetrator of the fraud; and


(ii) After aggressive debt collection action, it has been documented that further attempts at debt collection from the perpetrator of the fraud would be inappropriate or futile; 


(4) The recipient has issued a final determination which disallows the misexpenditure, the recipient's appeal process has been exhausted, and a debt has been established; and


(5) The recipient requests such a waiver and provides documentation to demonstrate that it has substantially complied with the requirements of section 184(d)(2) of the Act, and this section. 


(d) The recipient will not be released from liability for misspent funds under the determination required by section 184(d) of the Act unless the Grant Officer determines that further collection action, either by the recipient or subrecipients, would be inappropriate or would prove futile.
