# ยง 668.250   What happens if two or more entities apply for the same area?

(a) Every two years, unless there has been a waiver of competition for the area, we issue a Solicitation for Grant Application (SGA) seeking applicants for INA program grants. 


(b) If two or more entities apply for grants for the same service area, or for overlapping service areas, and a waiver of competition under WIA section 166(c)(2) is not granted to the incumbent grantee, the following additional procedures apply: 


(1) The Grant Officer will follow the regulations for priority designation at ยง 668.210. 


(2) If no applicant is entitled to priority designation, DINAP will inform each entity which submitted a NOI, including the incumbent grantee, in writing, of all the competing Notices of Intent no later than November 15 of the year the NOI's are received. 


(3) Each entity will have an opportunity to describe its service plan, and may submit additional information addressing the requirements of ยง 668.240(c) or such other information as the applicant determines is appropriate. Revised Notices must be received or contain an official U.S. Postal Service postmark, no later than January 5th (unless a later date is provided in DINAP's information notice). 


(4) The Grant Officer selects the entity that demonstrates the ability to produce the best outcomes for its customers.
