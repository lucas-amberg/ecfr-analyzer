# ยง 668.740   How will we review and approve such plans?

(a) We will approve a grantee's planning documents before the date on which funds for the program become available unless: 


(1) The planning documents do not contain the information specified in the regulations in this part and Departmental planning guidance; or 


(2) The services which the INA grantee proposes are not permitted under WIA or applicable regulations. 


(b) We may approve a portion of the plan, and disapprove other portions. The grantee also has the right to appeal the decision to the Office of the Administrative Law Judges under the procedures at 20 CFR 667.800 or 667.840. While the INA grantee exercises its right to appeal, the grantee must implement the approved portions of the plan. 


(c) If we disapprove all or part of an INA grantee's plan, and that disapproval is sustained in the appeal process, the INA grantee will be given the opportunity to amend its plan so that it can be approved. 


(d) If an INA grantee's plan is amended but is still disapproved, the grantee will have the right to appeal the decision to the Offices of the Administrative Law Judges under the procedures at 20 CFR 667.800 or 667.840.
