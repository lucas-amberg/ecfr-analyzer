# ยง 669.230   Can an NFJP grantee's designation be terminated?

Yes, a grantee's designation may be terminated for cause: 


(a) By the Secretary, in emergency circumstances when such action is necessary to protect the integrity of Federal funds or ensure the proper operation of the program. Any grantee so terminated will be provided with written notice and an opportunity for a hearing within 30 days after the termination (WIA sec. 184(e)); or 


(b) By the Grant Officer, if there is a substantial or persistent violation of the requirements in the Act or the WIA regulations. In such a case, the Grant Officer must provide the grantee with 60 days prior written notice, stating the reasons why termination is proposed, and the applicable appeal procedures.
