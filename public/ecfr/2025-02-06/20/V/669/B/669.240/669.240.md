# ยง 669.240   How do we use funds appropriated under WIA section 167 for the NFJP?

(a) At least 94 percent of the funds appropriated each year for WIA section 167 activities must be allocated to State service areas, based on the distribution of the eligible MSFW population determined under a formula which has been published in the _Federal Register._ Grants are awarded under a competitive process for the provision of services to eligible farmworkers within each service area. 


(b) The balance, up to 6 percent of the appropriated funds, will be used for discretionary purposes, for such activities as grantee technical assistance and support of farmworker housing activities.
