# § 670.965   What procedures apply to disclosure of information about Job Corps students and program activities?

(a) The Secretary develops procedures to respond to requests for information or records or other necessary disclosures pertaining to students. 


(b) DOL disclosure of Job Corps information must be handled according to the Freedom of Information Act and according to DOL regulations at 29 CFR part 70. 


(c) Job Corps contractors are not “agencies” for Freedom of Information Act purposes. Therefore, their records are not subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act or 29 CFR part 70.
