(a) If DOL receives a complaint or has reason to believe that a center or other service provider is failing to comply with the requirements of the Act or regulations, the Regional Director must investigate the allegation and determine within 90 days after receiving the complaint or otherwise learning of the alleged violation, whether such allegation or complaint is true. 


(b) As a result of such a determination, the Regional Director may: 


(1) Direct the center operator or service provider to handle a complaint through the grievance procedures established under ยง 670.990; or 


(2) Investigate and determine whether the center operator or service provider is in compliance with the Act and regulations. If the Regional Director determines that the center or service provider is not in compliance with the Act or regulations, the Regional Director may take action to resolve the complaint under ยง 670.991(b), or will report the incident to the DOL Office of the Inspector General, as described in 20 CFR 667.630.
