# § 678.725   What happens if consensus on infrastructure funding is not reached at the local level between the Local Workforce Development Board, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners?

With regard to negotiations for infrastructure funding for Program Year (PY) 2017 and for each subsequent program year thereafter, if the Local WDB, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners do not reach consensus on methods of sufficiently funding local infrastructure through the local funding mechanism in accordance with the Governor's guidance issued under § 678.705 and consistent with the regulations in §§ 678.715 and 678.720, and include that consensus agreement in the signed MOU, then the Local WDB must notify the Governor by the deadline established by the Governor under § 678.705(b)(3). Once notified, the Governor must administer funding through the State funding mechanism, as described in §§ 678.730 through 678.738, for the program year impacted by the local area's failure to reach consensus.
