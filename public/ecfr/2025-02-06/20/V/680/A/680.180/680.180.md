# § 680.180   What is an internship or work experience for adults and dislocated workers?

For the purposes of WIOA sec. 134(c)(2)(A)(xii)(VII), an internship or work experience is a planned, structured learning experience that takes place in a workplace for a limited period of time. Internships and other work experience may be paid or unpaid, as appropriate and consistent with other laws, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act. An internship or other work experience may be arranged within the private for profit sector, the non-profit sector, or the public sector. Labor standards apply in any work experience setting where an employee/employer relationship, as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act, exists. Transitional jobs are a type of work experience, as described in §§ 680.190 and 680.195.
