# ยง 680.510   In what ways can a Local Workforce Development Board supplement the information available from the State list of eligible training providers and programs?

(a) Local WDBs may supplement the criteria and information requirements established by the Governor in order to support informed consumer choice and the achievement of local performance indicators. However, the Local WDB may not do so for registered apprenticeship programs.


(b) This additional information may include:


(1) Information on programs of training services that are linked to occupations in demand in the local area;


(2) Performance and cost information, including program-specific performance and cost information, for the local outlet(s) of multi-site eligible training providers;


(3) Information that shows how programs are responsive to local requirements; and


(4) Other appropriate information related to the objectives of WIOA.
