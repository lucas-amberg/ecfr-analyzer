An OSY is an individual who is:


(a) Not attending any school (as defined under State law);


(b) Not younger than age 16 or older than age 24 at time of enrollment. Because age eligibility is based on age at enrollment, participants may continue to receive services beyond the age of 24 once they are enrolled in the program; and

(1) A school dropout;


(2) A youth who is within the age of compulsory school attendance, but has not attended school for at least the most recent complete school year calendar quarter.
