# ยง 681.650   How can parents, youth, and other members of the community get involved in the design and implementation of local youth programs?

Local WDBs and programs must provide opportunities for parents, participants, and other members of the community with experience working with youth to be involved in the design and implementation of youth programs. Parents, youth participants, and other members of the community can get involved in a number of ways, including serving on youth standing committees, if they exist and they are appointed by the Local WDB. They also can get involved by serving as mentors, serving as tutors, and providing input into the design and implementation of other program design elements. Local WDBs also must make opportunities available to successful participants to volunteer to help participants as mentors, tutors, or in other activities.
