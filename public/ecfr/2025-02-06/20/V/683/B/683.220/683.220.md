(a) Recipients and subrecipients of WIOA title I and Wagner-Peyser Act funds must have an internal control structure and written policies in place that provide safeguards to protect personally identifiable information, records, contracts, grant funds, equipment, sensitive information, tangible items, and other information that is readily or easily exchanged in the open market, or that the Department or the recipient or subrecipient considers to be sensitive, consistent with applicable Federal, State and local privacy and confidentiality laws. Internal controls also must include reasonable assurance that the entity is:
