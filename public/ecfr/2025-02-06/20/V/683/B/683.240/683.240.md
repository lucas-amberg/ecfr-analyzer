(a) *SESA properties.* Federal equity acquired in real property through grants to States awarded under title III of the Social Security Act or the Wagner-Peyser Act, including State Employment Security Agency (SESA) real property, is transferred to the States that used the grant to acquire such equity.


(1) The portion of any real property that is attributable to the Federal equity transferred under this section must be used to carry out activities authorized under WIOA, title III of the Social Security Act (Unemployment Compensation program), or the Wagner-Peyser Act.


(2) When such real property is no longer needed for the activities described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the States must request disposition instructions from the Grant Officer prior to disposition or sale of the property. The portion of the proceeds from the disposition of the real property that is attributable to the Federal equity transferred under this section must be used to carry out activities authorized under WIOA, title III of the Social Security Act, or the Wagner-Peyser Act.


(3) States must not use funds awarded under WIOA, title III of the Social Security Act, or the Wagner-Peyser Act to amortize the costs of real property that is purchased by any State on or after February 15, 2007, the date of enactment of the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2007.


(4) Properties occupied by the Wagner-Peyser Act Employment Service must be colocated with one-stop centers.


(b) *Reed Act-funded properties.* Properties with Reed Act equity may be used for the one-stop service delivery system to the extent that the proportionate share of Reed Act equity is less than or equal to the proportionate share of occupancy by the Unemployment Compensation and Wagner-Peyser Act programs in such properties. When such real property is no longer needed for authorized purposes, the State must request disposition instructions from the Grant Officer prior to disposition or sale. The portion of the proceeds from the disposition or sale of the real property that is attributable to the Reed Act equity must be returned to the State's account in the Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF) and used in accordance with Department-issued guidance.


(c) *Job Training Partnership Act and Workforce Investment Act-funded properties.* Real property that was purchased with WIA funds or that was transferred to WIA now is transferred to the WIOA title I programs and must be used for WIOA purposes. When such real property is no longer needed for the activities of WIOA, the recipient or subrecipient must seek instructions from the Grant Officer or State (in the case of a subrecipient) prior to disposition or sale.
