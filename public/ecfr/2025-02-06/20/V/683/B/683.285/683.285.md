# § 683.285   What are a recipient's obligations to ensure nondiscrimination and equal opportunity, and what are a recipient's obligations with respect to religious activities?

(a)(1) Recipients, as defined in 29 CFR 37.4, must comply with the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity provisions of WIOA sec. 188 and its implementing regulations, codified at 29 CFR part 38. Under that definition, the term “recipients” includes State and Local WDBs, one-stop operators, service providers, Job Corps contractors, and subrecipients, as well as other types of individuals and entities.


(2) Nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements and procedures, including complaint processing and compliance reviews, are governed by the regulations implementing sec. 188 of WIOA, codified at 29 CFR part 38, and are administered and enforced by the Department of Labor Civil Rights Center.


(3) Financial assistance provided under title I of WIOA may be used to meet a recipient's obligation to provide physical and programmatic accessibility and reasonable accommodation/modification in regard to the WIOA program, as required by sec. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended; sec. 188 of WIOA; and the regulations implementing these statutory provisions.


(4) No person may discriminate against an individual who is a participant in a program or activity that receives funds under title I of WIOA, with respect to the terms and conditions affecting, or rights provided to, the individual, solely because of the status of the individual as a participant.


(5) Participation in programs and activities or receiving funds under title I of WIOA must be available to citizens and nationals of the United States, lawfully admitted permanent resident aliens, refugees, asylees, and parolees, and other immigrants authorized by the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Secretary's designee to work in the United States.


(b)(1) Title 29 CFR part 2, subpart D, governs the circumstances under which recipients may use Department support, including WIOA title I and Wagner-Peyser Act financial assistance, to employ or train participants in religious activities. As explained in that subpart, such assistance may be used for such employment or training only when the assistance is provided indirectly within the meaning of the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution, and not when the assistance is provided directly. As explained in that subpart, assistance provided through an Individual Training Account is generally considered indirect, and other mechanisms also may be considered indirect. *See also* § 683.255 and 29 CFR 37.6(f)(1).


(2) Title 29 CFR part 2, subpart D, also contains requirements related to equal treatment of religious organizations in Department of Labor programs, and to protection of religious liberty for Department of Labor social service providers and beneficiaries. Limitations on the employment of participants under WIOA title I to carry out the construction, operation, or maintenance of any part of any facility used or to be used for religious instruction or as a place of religious worship are described at 29 CFR 37.6(f)(2). *See also* WIOA sec. 188(a)(3).
