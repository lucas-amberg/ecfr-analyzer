# ยง 683.430   How does the Secretary resolve investigative and monitoring findings?

(a) As a result of an investigation, on-site visit, other monitoring, or an audit (*i.e.,* Single Audit, OIG Audit, GAO Audit, or other audit), the Secretary will notify the direct recipient of the Federal award of the findings of the investigation and give the direct recipient a period of time (not more than 60 days) to comment and to take appropriate corrective actions.


(1) *Adequate resolution.* The Grant Officer in conjunction with the Federal project officer, reviews the complete file of the monitoring review, monitoring report, or final audit report and the recipient's response and actions under paragraph (a) of this section. The Grant Officer's review takes into account the sanction provisions of secs. 184(b)-(c) of WIOA. If the Grant Officer agrees with the recipient's handling of the situation, the Grant Officer so notifies the recipient. This notification constitutes final agency action.


(2) *Inadequate resolution.* If the direct recipient's response and actions to resolve the findings are found to be inadequate, the Grant Officer will begin the Grant Officer resolution process under ยง 683.440.


(b) Audits from 2 CFR part 200 will be resolved through the Grant Officer resolution process, as discussed in ยง 683.440.
