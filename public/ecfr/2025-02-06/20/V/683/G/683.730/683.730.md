(2) When the waiver request is made during the ETA Grant Officer resolution process, the request must be made during the informal resolution period described in ยง 683.440(c).


(c) A waiver of the recipient's liability must be considered by the Grant Officer only when:


(1) The misexpenditure of WIOA funds occurred at a subrecipient's level;


(2) The misexpenditure was not due to willful disregard of the requirements of title I of WIOA, gross negligence, failure to observe accepted standards of administration, and did not constitute fraud or failure to make the required disclosures in accordance with 2 CFR 200.113 addressing all violations of Federal criminal law involving fraud, bribery or gratuity violations (2 CFR part 180 and 31 U.S.C. 3321)

(5) The recipient provides documentation to demonstrate that it has substantially complied with the requirements of WIOA sec. 184(d)(2) and this section.


(d) The recipient will not be released from liability for misspent funds under the determination required by WIOA sec. 184(d) unless the Grant Officer determines that further collection action, either by the recipient or subrecipient(s), would be inappropriate or would prove futile.
