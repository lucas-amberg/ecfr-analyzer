# ยง 684.260   Does the Department have to award a grant for every part of the country?

No, if there are no entities meeting the requirements for a grant award in a particular area, or willing to serve that area, the Department will not award funds for that service area. The funds that otherwise would have been allocated to that area under ยง 684.270 will be distributed to other INA program grantees, or used for other program purposes such as technical assistance and training (TAT). Unawarded funds used for TAT are in addition to, and not subject to the limitations on, amounts reserved under ยง 684.270(e). Areas which are unserved by the INA program may be restored during a subsequent grant award cycle, when and if a current grantee or other eligible entity applies for a grant award to serve that area.
