# § 685.430   Under what circumstances are the terms of the grantee's program plan modified by the grantee or the Department?

(a) Plans must be modified to reflect the funding level for each year of the grant. The Department will provide instructions annually on when to submit modifications for each year of funding, which will generally be no later than June 1 prior to the start of the subsequent year of the grant cycle.


(b) The grantee must submit a request to the Department for any proposed modifications to its plan to add, delete, expand, or reduce any part of the program plan or allowable activities. The Department will consider the cost principles, uniform administrative requirements, and terms and conditions of award when reviewing modifications to program plans.


(c) If the grantee is approved for a regulatory waiver under §§ 685.460 and 685.470, the grantee must submit a modification of its grant plan to reflect the effect of the waiver.
