# ยง 686.410   Are there additional factors which are considered in selecting an eligible applicant for enrollment?

Yes, in accordance with procedures issued by the Secretary, an eligible applicant may be selected for enrollment only if:


(a) A determination is made, based on information relating to the background, needs, and interests of the applicant, that the applicant's educational and career and technical needs can best be met through the Job Corps program;


(b) A determination is made that there is a reasonable expectation the applicant can participate successfully in group situations and activities, and is not likely to engage in actions that would potentially:


(1) Prevent other students from receiving the benefit of the program;


(2) Be incompatible with the maintenance of sound discipline; or


(3) Impede satisfactory relationships between the center to which the student is assigned and surrounding local communities;


(c) The applicant is made aware of the center's rules, what the consequences are for failure to observe the rules, and agrees to comply with such rules, as described in procedures issued by the Secretary;


(d) The applicant has not been convicted of a felony consisting of murder, child abuse, or a crime involving rape or sexual assault. Other than these felony convictions, no one will be denied enrollment in Job Corps solely on the basis of contact with the criminal justice system. All applicants must submit to a background check conducted according to procedures established by the Secretary and in accordance with applicable State and local laws. If the background check finds that the applicant is on probation, parole, under a suspended sentence, or under the supervision of any agency as a result of court action or institutionalization, the court or appropriate supervising agency may certify in writing that it will approve of the applicant's participation in Job Corps, and provide full release from its supervision, and that the applicant's participation and release does not violate applicable laws and regulations; and


(e) Suitable arrangements are made for the care of any dependent children for the proposed period of enrollment.
