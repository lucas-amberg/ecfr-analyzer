The center operator must ensure that all students receive due process in disciplinary proceedings according to procedures developed by the Secretary. These procedures must include center fact-finding and behavior review boards, a code of sanctions under which the penalty of separation from Job Corps might be imposed, and procedures for students to submit an appeal to a Job Corps regional appeal board following a center's decision to discharge involuntarily the student from Job Corps.
