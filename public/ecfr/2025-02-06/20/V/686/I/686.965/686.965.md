# ยง 686.965   How does Job Corps ensure that complaints or disputes are resolved in a timely fashion?

(a) If a complaint is not resolved by the center operator or service provider in the time frames described in ยง 686.960, the person making the complaint may request that the Regional Director determine whether reasonable cause exists to believe that WIOA or regulations for this part of WIOA have been violated. The request must be filed with the Regional Director within 60 days from the date that the center operator or service provider should have issued the decision.


(b) Following the receipt of a request for review under paragraph (a) of this section, the Regional Director must determine within 60 days whether there has been a violation of WIOA or the WIOA regulations. If the Regional Director determines that there has been a violation of WIOA or WIOA regulations, (s)he may direct the operator or service provider to remedy the violation or direct the service provider to issue a decision to resolve the dispute according to the service provider's grievance procedures. If the service provider does not comply with the Regional Director's decision within 30 days, the Regional Director may impose a sanction on the center operator or service provider for violating WIOA or WIOA regulations, and/or for failing to issue a decision. Decisions imposing sanctions upon a center operator or service provider may be appealed to the Department of Labor Office of Administrative Law Judges under ยง 683.800 or ยง 683.840 of this chapter.
