# ยง 687.190   How do statutory and regulatory waivers apply to National Dislocated Worker Grants?

(a) For DWGs, utilization of statutory or regulatory waivers is limited to waivers already approved by the Department under sec. 189(i) of WIOA, separate from the DWG process. WIOA sec. 189(i) gives the Department the authority to waive provisions under subtitles A, B, and/or E of WIOA; requirements of DWGs in WIOA subtitle D cannot and will not be waived.


(b) A grant application must include a description of the approved waiver and request that the waiver be applied to the DWG. The Department will consider such requests as part of the overall DWG application review and decision process; however, applicants may not use this process to request new waivers.


(c) If during the operation of a DWG, the grantee wishes to utilize a statutory or regulatory waiver that the Department has already approved under sec. 189(i), but it was not included in the grantee's original DWG application, the grantee must submit a grant modification that describes the waiver and requests application of the waiver to the DWG. Grantees may not use this process to request new waivers.
