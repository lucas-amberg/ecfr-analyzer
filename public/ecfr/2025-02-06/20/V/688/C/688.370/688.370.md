# ยง 688.370   What are the requirements for exit from the YouthBuild program?

At a minimum, to be a successful exit, the Department of Labor requires that:


(a) Participants receive hands-on construction training or hands-on training in another industry or occupation, in the case of Construction Plus grantees; and


(b) Participants meet the exit policies established by the grantee.


(1) Such policies must describe the program outcomes and/or individual goals that must be met by each participant in order to successfully complete the program; and


(2) Grantees must apply the policies consistently to determine when a successful exit has occurred.
