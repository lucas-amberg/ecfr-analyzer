# ยง 688.410   What are the required levels of performance for the performance indicators?

(a) The Secretary must annually establish expected levels of performance for YouthBuild programs relating to each of the primary indicators of performance. The expected levels of performance for each of the performance indicators are national standards that are provided in separately issued guidance. Short-term or other performance indicators will be provided in separately issued guidance or as part of the FOA or grant agreement. Performance level expectations will be based on available YouthBuild data and data from similar WIOA youth programs and may change from one grant competition to another. The expected national levels of performance will take into account the extent to which the levels promote continuous improvement in performance.


(b) The levels of performance established will at a minimum:


(1) Be expressed in an objective, quantifiable, and measurable form; and


(2) Indicate continuous improvement in performance.
