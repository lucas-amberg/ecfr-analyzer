# § 702.102   Establishment and modification of compensation districts, establishment of suboffices and jurisdictional areas.

(a) The Director has, pursuant to section 39(b) of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. 939(b), established compensation districts as required for improved administration or as otherwise determined by the Director (see 51 FR 4282, Feb. 3, 1986). The boundaries of the compensation districts may be modified at any time, and the Director will notify all interested parties directly of the modifications.


(b) As administrative exigencies from time to time may require, the Director may, by administrative order, establish special areas outside the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii, or change or modify any areas so established, notwithstanding their inclusion within an established compensation district. Such areas will be designated “jurisdictional areas.” The Director will also designate which of his district directors will be in charge thereof.


(c) To further aid in the efficient administration of the OWCP, the Director may from time to time establish suboffices within compensation districts or jurisdictional areas, and will designate a person to be in charge thereof.
