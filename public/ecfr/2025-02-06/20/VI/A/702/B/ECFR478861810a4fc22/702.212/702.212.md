# ยง 702.212   Notice; when given; when given for certain occupational diseases.

(a) For other than occupational diseases described in (b), the employee must give notice within thirty (30) days of the date of the injury or death. For this purpose the date of injury or death is: 


(1) The day on which a traumatic injury occurs; 


(2) The date on which the employee or claimant is or by the exercise of reasonable diligence or by reason of medical advice, should have been aware of a relationship between the injury or death and the employment; or 


(3) In the case of claims for loss of hearing, the date the employee receives an audiogram, with the accompanying report which indicates the employee has suffered a loss of hearing that is related to his or her employment. (See ยง 702.441).


(b) In the case of an occupational disease which does not immediately result in disability or death, notice must be given within one year after the employee or claimant becomes aware, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence or by reason of medical advice, should have been aware, of the relationship between the employment, the disease and the death or disability. For purposes of these occupational diseases, therefore, the notice period does not begin to run until the employee is disabled, or in the case of a retired employee, until a permanent impairment exists. 


(c) For purposes of workers whose coverage under this Act is dependent on denial of coverage under a State compensation program, as described in ยง 701.401, the time limitations set forth above do not begin to run until a final decision denying State coverage is issued under the State compensation act.
