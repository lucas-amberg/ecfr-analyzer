# ยง 702.343   Formal hearings; oral argument and written allegations.

Any party upon request shall be allowed a reasonable time for presentation of oral argument and shall be permitted to file a pre-hearing brief or other written statement of fact or law. A copy of any such pre-hearing brief or other written statement shall be filed with the Chief Administrative Law Judge or the administrative law judge assigned to the case before or during the proceeding at which evidence is submitted to the administrative law judge and shall be served upon each other party. Post-hearing briefs will not be permitted except at the request of the administrative law judge or upon averment on the record of a party that the case presents a specific novel or difficult legal or factual issue (or issues) that cannot be adequately addressed in oral summation. When permitted, any such brief shall be limited to the issue or issues specified by the administrative law judge or by the party in his or her averment and shall be due from any party desiring to address such issue or issues within 15 days of the conclusion of the proceeding at which evidence is submitted to the administrative law judge. Enlargement of the time for filing such briefs shall be granted only if the administrative law judge is persuaded that the brief will be helpful to him or her and that the enlargement granted will not delay decision of the case.
