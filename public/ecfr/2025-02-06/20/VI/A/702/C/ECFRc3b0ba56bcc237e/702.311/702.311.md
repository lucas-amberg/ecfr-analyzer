# ยง 702.311   Handling of claims matters by district directors; informal conferences.

The district director is empowered to resolve disputes with respect to claims in a manner designed to protect the rights of the parties and also to resolve such disputes at the earliest practicable date. This will generally be accomplished by informal discussions by telephone or by conferences at the district director's office. Some cases will be handled by written correspondence. The regulations governing informal conferences at the district director's office with all parties present are set forth below. When handling claims by telephone, or at the office with only one of the parties, the district director and his staff shall make certain that a full written record be made of the matters discussed and that such record be placed in the administrative file. When claims are handled by correspondence, copies of all communications shall constitute the administrative file.
