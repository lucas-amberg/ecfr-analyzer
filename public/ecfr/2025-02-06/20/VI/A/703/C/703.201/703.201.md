# § 703.201   Deposits of security by insurance carriers.

The regulations in this subpart require certain insurance carriers to deposit security in the form of indemnity bonds, letters of credit or negotiable securities (chosen at the option of the carrier) of a kind and in an amount determined by the Office, and prescribe the conditions under which deposits must be made. Security deposits secure the payment of compensation and medical benefits when an insurance carrier defaults on any of its obligations under the LHWCA, regardless of the date such obligations arose. They also secure the payment of compensation and medical benefits when a carrier becomes insolvent and such obligations are not otherwise fully secured by a State guaranty fund. Any gap in State guaranty fund coverage will have a direct effect on the amount of security the Office will require a carrier to post. As used in this subpart, the terms “obligations under the Act” and “LHWCA obligations” mean a carrier's liability for compensation payments and medical benefits arising under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act and any of its extensions.
