# § 703.203   Application for security deposit determination; information to be submitted; other requirements.

(a) Each insurance carrier authorized by OWCP to write insurance under the LHWCA or any of its extensions, and each insurance carrier seeking initial authorization to write such insurance, must apply annually, on a schedule set by OWCP, for a determination of the extent of its unsecured obligations and the security deposit required. The application must be addressed to the Branch of Financial Management and Insurance (Branch) within OWCP's Division of Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation, and be made on a form provided by OWCP. The application must contain the following:


(1) Any carrier seeking an exemption from the security deposit requirements based on its financial standing (*see* § 703.204(c)(1)) must submit documentation establishing the carrier's current rating and its rating for the immediately preceding year from each insurance rating service designated by the Branch and posted on the Internet at *http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc.*

(2) All other carriers, and any carrier whose exemption request under paragraph (a)(1) of this section has been denied, must provide—


(i) A statement of the carrier's outstanding liabilities under the LHWCA or any of its extensions for its LHWCA obligations for each State in which the obligations arise; and


(ii) Any other information the Branch requests to enable it to give the application adequate consideration including, but not limited to, the reports set forth at § 703.212.


(b) If the carrier disagrees with any of OWCP's findings regarding State guaranty funds made under § 703.202(b) as they exist when it submits its application, the carrier may submit a statement of its unsecured obligations based on a different conclusion regarding the extent of coverage afforded by one or more State guaranty funds. The carrier must submit evidence and/or argument with its application sufficient to establish that such conclusion is correct.


(c) The carrier must sign and swear to the application. If the carrier is not an individual, the carrier's duly authorized officer must sign and swear to the application and list his or her official designation. If the carrier is a corporation, the officer must also affix the corporate seal.


(d) At any time after filing an application, the carrier must inform the Branch immediately of any material changes that may have rendered its application incomplete, inaccurate or misleading.


(e) By filing an application, the carrier consents to be bound by and to comply with the regulations and requirements in this part.
