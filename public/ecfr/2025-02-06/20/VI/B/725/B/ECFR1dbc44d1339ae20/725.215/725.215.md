# § 725.215   Determination of dependency; surviving spouse.

An individual who is the miner's surviving spouse (see § 725.214) shall be determined to have been dependent on the miner if, at the time of the miner's death: 


(a) The individual was living with the miner (see § 725.232); or 


(b) The individual was dependent upon the miner for support or the miner has been ordered by a court to contribute to such individual's support (see § 725.233); or 


(c) The individual was living apart from the miner because of the miner's desertion or other reasonable cause; or 


(d) The individual is the natural parent of the miner's son or daughter; or 


(e) The individual had legally adopted the miner's son or daughter while the individual was married to the miner and while such son or daughter was under the age of 18; or 


(f) The individual was married to the miner at the time both of them legally adopted a child under the age of 18; or 


(g)(1) The individual was married to the miner for a period of not less than 9 months immediately before the day on which the miner died, unless the miner's death: 


(i) Is accidental (as defined in paragraph (g)(2) of this section), or 


(ii) Occurs in line of duty while the miner is a member of a uniformed service serving on active duty (as defined in § 404.1019 of this title), and the surviving spouse was married to the miner for a period of not less than 3 months immediately prior to the day on which such miner died. 


(2) For purposes of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, the death of a miner is accidental if such individual received bodily injuries solely through violent, external, and accidental means, and as a direct result of the bodily injuries and independently of all other causes, dies not later than 3 months after the day on which such miner receives such bodily injuries. The term “accident” means an event that was unpremeditated and unforeseen from the standpoint of the deceased individual. To determine whether the death of an individual did, in fact, result from an accident the adjudication officer will consider all the circumstances surrounding the casualty. An intentional and voluntary suicide will not be considered to be death by accident; however, suicide by an individual who is so incompetent as to be incapable of acting intentionally and voluntarily will be considered to be a death by accident. In no event will the death of an individual resulting from violent and external causes be considered a suicide unless there is direct proof that the fatal injury was self-inflicted. 


(3) The provisions of paragraph (g) shall not apply if the adjudication officer determines that at the time of the marriage involved, the miner would not reasonably have been expected to live for 9 months.
