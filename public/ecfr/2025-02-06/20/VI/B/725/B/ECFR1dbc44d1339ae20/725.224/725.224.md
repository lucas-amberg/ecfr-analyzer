# ยง 725.224   Determination of relationship; parent, brother, or sister.

(a) An individual will be considered to be the parent, brother, or sister of a miner if the courts of the State in which the miner was domiciled (see ยง 225.231) at the time of death would find, under the law they would apply, that the individual is the miner's parent, brother, or sister. 


(b) Where, under State law, the individual is not the miner's parent, brother, or sister, but would, under State law, have the same status (*i.e.,* right to share in the miner's intestate personal property) as a parent, brother, or sister, the individual will be considered to be the parent, brother, or sister as appropriate.
