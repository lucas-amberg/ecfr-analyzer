(a) Pursuant to section 423 of part C of title IV of the Act, authorization to self-insure against liability incurred by coal mine operators on account of the total disability or death of miners due to pneumoconiosis may be granted or denied in the discretion of the Secretary. The provisions of this subpart describe the minimum requirements established by the Secretary for determining whether any particular coal mine operator may be authorized as a self-insurer.


(b) The minimum requirements which must be met by any operator seeking authorization to self-insure are as follows:


(1) The operator must demonstrate the administrative capacity to fully service such claims as may be filed against it; and,


(2) Such operator must obtain security, in a form approved by OWCP (see ยง 726.104) and in an amount to be determined by OWCP (see ยง 726.105).


(c) No application will be approved until OWCP receives security in the amount and in the form determined by OWCP. If the applicant is seeking authorization to self-insure for the first time, it is not authorized to self-insure while its application is under review.


(d) No operator whose application for authorization to self-insure or to renew authorization to self-insure is denied may reapply until 12 months after a final decision denying such application.
