# § 726.104   Action by OWCP upon application of operator.

(a) Within 30 days after determining that an applicant's application for authorization to self-insure or to renew authorization to self-insure is complete, OWCP will review and consider all relevant information submitted in the application and issue a written determination either denying the application or determining the amount of security which must be given by the applicant to guarantee the payment of benefits and the discharge of all other obligations which may be required of such applicant under the Act. OWCP may extend the 30-day deadline if it determines that additional evidence is needed or that the applicant's evidence is not in compliance with OWCP's requirements in this subpart.


(b) The applicant will thereafter be notified that they may give security in the amount fixed by OWCP (see § 726.105):


(1) In the form of an indemnity bond with sureties satisfactory to OWCP;


(2) By a deposit of negotiable securities with a Federal Reserve Bank in compliance with §§ 726.106(c) and 726.107;


(3) In the form of a letter of credit issued by a financial institution satisfactory to OWCP (except that a letter of credit is not sufficient by itself to satisfy a self- insurer's obligations under this part); or


(4) In the form of a trust pursuant to section 501(c)(21) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(21)) established prior to December 12, 2024. Operators using such trusts must submit quarterly financial statements to OWCP documenting the value of the trust every ninety days, beginning with ninety days from the date on which OWCP's authorization or reauthorization of the operator's self-insurance becomes effective under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.


(c) Operators that are required to submit an initial or increased security deposit may do so in quarterly increments over the course of one year. Such operators must deposit at least 25 percent of the newly required security amount within thirty days of OWCP issuing the notification provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, followed by at least 50 percent of their required security within four months, at least 75 percent within eight months, and 100 percent within one year. If an operator fails to timely submit any one of these security installments, OWCP will revoke its self-insurance authorization and the operator will be subject to the civil penalty provisions in subpart D of this part.


(d) If the applicant is receiving authorization to self-insure for the first time, OWCP will notify the applicant that:


(1) Its authorization to self-insure is contingent upon submitting the required security and completed agreement and undertaking; and


(2) The applicant's authorization to self-insure is effective for 12 months from the date such security (either the full amount or first quarterly installment under paragraph (c) of this section) and completed agreement and undertaking are received by OWCP.


(e) If OWCP renews the applicant's authorization to self-insure, OWCP will notify the applicant that:


(1) If there are no changes in the required security amount, the applicant's authorization to self-insure is granted and effective for 12 months from the date the applicant's completed agreement and undertaking is received by OWCP; or


(2) If changes are needed to the existing security amount, the applicant's authorization to self-insure is not granted until the applicant has submitted the required security (either the full amount or first quarterly installment under paragraph (c) of this section) and signed agreement and undertaking. The applicant's authorization to self-insure will be effective for 12 months from the date such updated security and completed agreement and undertaking are received by OWCP.


(f) Any applicant who cannot meet the security deposit requirements imposed by OWCP in this subpart should proceed to obtain a commercial policy or contract of insurance and submit proof of such coverage within 30 days after OWCP issues notification to the applicant of its decision. Any applicant for authorization to self-insure whose application has been denied or who believes that the security deposit requirements imposed by OWCP in this subpart are excessive may appeal such determination in the manner set forth in § 726.116.
