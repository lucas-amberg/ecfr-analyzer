# ยง 726.106   Type of security.

(a) OWCP will determine the type or types of security which an applicant must or may procure. An operator may not provide any form of security other than those provided for in ยง 726.104(b).


(b) In the event the indemnity bond option is selected, the bond must be in such form and contain such provisions as OWCP prescribes: *Provided* that only corporations may act as sureties on such indemnity bonds. In each case in which the surety on any such bond is a surety company, such company must be one approved by the U.S. Treasury Department under the laws of the United States and the applicable rules and regulations governing bonding companies (see Department of Treasury's Circular-570).


(c) If the form of negotiable securities is selected, the operator must deposit the amount fixed by OWCP in any negotiable securities acceptable as security for the deposit of public moneys of the United States under regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury in 31 CFR part 225. The approval, valuation, acceptance, and custody of such securities is hereby committed to the several Federal Reserve Banks and the Treasurer of the United States.
