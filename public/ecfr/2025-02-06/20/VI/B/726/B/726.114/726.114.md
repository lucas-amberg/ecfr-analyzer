# ยง 726.114   Authorization and reauthorization timeframes.

(a) No initial or renewed authorization to self-insure may be granted for a period in excess of 12 months unless OWCP determines that extenuating circumstances exist to allow an extension.


(b) If an applicant is seeking to renew its authority to self-insure, the applicant must file its application no later than 90 days before its existing authorization period ends.


(c) Each operator authorized to self-insure under this part must apply for reauthorization for any period during which it engages in the operation of a coal mine and for additional periods after it ceases operating a coal mine. Upon application by the operator, accompanied by proof that the security it has posted is sufficient to secure all benefits potentially payable to miners formerly employed by the operator, OWCP will issue a certification that the operator is exempt from the coal mine operator insurance requirements of this part based on its prior operation of a coal mine. The civil money penalty provisions of subpart D of this part will be applicable to any operator that fails to apply for reauthorization in accordance with the provisions of this section.
