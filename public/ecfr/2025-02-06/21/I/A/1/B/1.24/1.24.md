In the case of food packed in random packages at one place for subsequent shipment and sale at another, the price sections of the label may be left blank provided they are filled in by the seller prior to retail sale. This exemption shall also apply to uniform weight packages of cheese and cheese products labeled in the same manner and by the same type of equipment as random food packages exempted by this paragraph (a)(2) except that the labels shall bear a declaration of price per pound and not price per specified number of pounds.
