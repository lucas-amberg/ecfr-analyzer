# ยง 1.1385   What process will FDA follow when adopting modified requirements or granting an exemption on our own initiative?

(a) If FDA, on our own initiative, determines that adopting modified requirements or granting an exemption from the requirements for a food or type of entity is appropriate, we will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ setting forth the proposed modified requirements or exemption and the reasons for the proposal. The notice will establish a public docket so that interested persons may submit written comments on the proposal.


(b) After considering any comments timely submitted, we will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ stating whether we are adopting modified requirements or granting an exemption, and the reasons for our decision.
