# ยง 1.1400   What procedures apply if FDA tentatively determines that modified requirements or an exemption should be revised or revoked?

(a) If FDA tentatively determines that we should revise or revoke modified requirements or an exemption, we will provide the following notifications:


(1) We will notify the person that originally requested the modified requirements or exemption (if we adopted modified requirements or granted an exemption in response to a petition) in writing at the address identified in the petition; and


(2) We will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ of our tentative determination that the modified requirements or exemption should be revised or revoked and the reasons for our tentative decision. The notice will establish a public docket so that interested persons may submit written comments on our tentative determination.


(b) After considering any comments timely submitted, we will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ of our decision whether to revise or revoke the modified requirements or exemption and the reasons for the decision. If we do revise or revoke the modified requirements or exemption, the effective date of the decision will be 1 year after the date of publication of the notice, unless otherwise stated in the notice.
