# ยง 1.1440   What process will FDA follow when waiving a requirement of this subpart on our own initiative?

(a) If FDA, on our own initiative, determines that a waiver of one or more requirements for an individual entity or type of entity is appropriate, we will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ setting forth the proposed waiver and the reasons for such waiver. The notice will establish a public docket so that interested persons may submit written comments on the proposal.


(b) After considering any comments timely submitted, we will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ stating whether we are granting the waiver (in whole or in part) and the reasons for our decision.


(c) Any waiver for a type of entity that FDA grants will become effective on the date that notice of the waiver is published in the _Federal Register,_ unless otherwise stated in the notice.
