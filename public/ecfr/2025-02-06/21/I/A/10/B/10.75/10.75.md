(2) On the initiative of the supervisor.


(3) At the request of an interested person outside the agency.


(4) As required by delegations of authority.


(b)(1) The review will be made by consultation between the employee and the supervisor or by review of the administrative file on the matter, or both. The review will ordinarily follow the established agency channels of supervision or review for that matter.


(2) A sponsor, applicant, or manufacturer of a drug or device regulated under the act or the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262), may request review of a scientific controversy by an appropriate scientific advisory panel as described in section 505(n) of the act, or an advisory committee as described in section 515(g)(2)(B) of the act. The reason(s) for any denial of a request for such review shall be briefly set forth in writing to the requester. Persons who receive a Center denial of their request under this section may submit a request for review of the denial. The request should be sent to the Chief Mediator and Ombudsman.

(2) To review policy matters requiring the attention of center or agency management.


(3) In unusual situations requiring an immediate review in the public interest.


(4) As required by delegations of authority.

(e) Each request by an interested person for review of a decision within the Center for Devices and Radiological Health shall also comply with ยง 800.75 of this chapter.
