# ยง 14.147   Membership of a color additive advisory committee.

(a) The members of a color additive advisory committee are selected in the following manner:


(1) If a color additive advisory committee is established for purposes that do not include review of an issue arising under section 721(b)(5)(B) of the act, or is established on the initiative of the Commissioner, the Commissioner may use the procedure in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to select the members or may use an existing standing advisory committee listed in ยง 14.100, or may establish a new advisory committee under this subpart. Once the Commissioner has established a color additive advisory committee under this paragraph and has referred to it a matter relating to a color additive, no interested person may subsequently request that an additional or different color additive advisory committee be established to review and make recommendations about that color additive.


(2) If the Commissioner established a color additive advisory committee to review an issue arising under section 721(b)(5)(B) of the FD&C Act on the request of an interested person, it shall be established under the following requirements:


(i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section, the Commissioner will request the National Academy of Sciences to select the members of a color additive advisory committee from among experts qualified in the subject matter to be reviewed by the committee, and of adequately diversified professional backgrounds. The Commissioner will appoint one of the members as the Chairperson.


(ii) If the National Academy of Sciences is unable or refuses to select the members of a color additive advisory committee, the Commissioner will select the members.


(iii) If the Commissioner and the requesting party agree, section 721(b)(5)(D) of the FD&C Act may be waived and the matter may be referred to any standing advisory committee listed in ยง 14.100 or to any advisory committee established under any other procedure that is mutually agreeable. Once the Commissioner has established a color additive advisory committee and has referred to it a matter relating to a color additive, no interested person may subsequently request that an additional or different color additive advisory committee be established to review and make recommendations about that color additive.


(b) Members of a color additive advisory committee are subject to the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act and this subpart, except that no member of a color additive advisory committee may by reason of such membership alone be a special government employee or be subject to the conflict of interest laws and regulations.
