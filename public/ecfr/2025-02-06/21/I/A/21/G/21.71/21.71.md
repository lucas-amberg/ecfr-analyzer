(b) The Food and Drug Administration may in its discretion refuse to make a disclosure permitted under paragraph (a) of this section, if the disclosure would in the judgment of the agency, invade the privacy of the individual or be inconsistent with the purpose for which the information was collected.


(c) The Food and Drug Administration may require any person requesting a disclosure of a record under paragraph (a) of this section to provide:


(1) Information about the purposes to which the disclosed record is to be put, and


(2) A written statement certifying that the record will be used only for the stated purposes and will not be further disclosed without the written permission of the Food and Drug Administration.


(d) An accounting shall be made, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, of any disclosure under paragraph (a) of this section of a record that is not a disclosure under § 21.70.


(e) Where an accounting is required under paragraph (d) of this section, the Food and Drug Administration shall:


(1) Record the name and address of the person or agency to whom the disclosure is made and the date, nature, and purpose of the disclosure. The accounting shall not be considered a Privacy Act Record System.


(2) Retain the accounting for 5 years or for the life of the record, whichever is longer, following the disclosure.


(3) Notify those recipients listed in the accounting of amendments or disputes concerning the records previously disclosed to them pursuant to § 21.51(d)(3), § 21.53(c), or § 21.54(c).


(4) Except when the record is exempt from individual access and contest under § 21.61 or to the extent that the accounting describes a transfer for a law enforcement purpose pursuant to paragraph (a)(7) of this section, make the accounting available to the individual to whom the record pertains, in accordance with procedures of subpart D of this part.


(f) A single accounting may be used to cover disclosure(s) that consist of a continuing dialogue between two agencies over a prolonged period, such as discussion of an enforcement action between the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Justice. In such cases, a general notation may be made that, as of a certain date, contract was initiated, to continue until resolution of the matter.
