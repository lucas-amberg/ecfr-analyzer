# § 25.1   Purpose.

The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended, directs that, to the fullest extent possible, the policies, regulations, and public laws of the United States shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with the policies set forth in NEPA. All agencies of the Federal Government shall comply with the procedures in section 102(2) of NEPA except where compliance would be inconsistent with other statutory requirements. The regulations in this part implement section 102(2) of NEPA in a manner that is consistent with FDA's authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act. This part also supplements the regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of NEPA that were published by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) in 40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508 and the procedures included in the “HHS General Administration Manual, part 30: Environmental Protection” (45 FR 76519 to 76534, November 19, 1980).
