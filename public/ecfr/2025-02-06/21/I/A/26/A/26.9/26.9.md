# ยง 26.9   Equivalence determination.

(a) Equivalence is established by having in place regulatory systems covering the criteria referred to in appendix D of this subpart, and a demonstrated pattern of consistent performance in accordance with these criteria. A list of authorities determined as equivalent shall be agreed to by the Joint Sectoral Committee at the end of the transition period, with reference to any limitation in terms of inspection type (e.g., postapproval or preapproval) or product classes or processes.


(b) The parties will document insufficient evidence of equivalence, lack of opportunity to assess equivalence or a determination of nonequivalence, in sufficient detail to allow the authority being assessed to know how to attain equivalence.
