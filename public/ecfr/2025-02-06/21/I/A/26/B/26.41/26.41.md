Examples of such circumstances include indications of material inconsistencies or inadequacies in a report, quality defects identified in postmarket surveillance or other specific evidence of serious concern in relation to product quality or consumer safety. In such cases, the importing party may request clarification from the exporting party which may lead to a request for reinspection. The parties will endeavor to respond to requests for clarification in a timely manner. Where divergence is not clarified in this process, the importing party may carry out the quality system evaluation.
