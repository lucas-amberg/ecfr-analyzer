# ยง 54.5   Agency evaluation of financial interests.

(a) *Evaluation of disclosure statement.* FDA will evaluate the information disclosed under ยง 54.4(a)(2) about each covered clinical study in an application to determine the impact of any disclosed financial interests on the reliability of the study. FDA may consider both the size and nature of a disclosed financial interest (including the potential increase in the value of the interest if the product is approved) and steps that have been taken to minimize the potential for bias.


(b) *Effect of study design.* In assessing the potential of an investigator's financial interests to bias a study, FDA will take into account the design and purpose of the study. Study designs that utilize such approaches as multiple investigators (most of whom do not have a disclosable interest), blinding, objective endpoints, or measurement of endpoints by someone other than the investigator may adequately protect against any bias created by a disclosable financial interest.


(c) *Agency actions to ensure reliability of data.* If FDA determines that the financial interests of any clinical investigator raise a serious question about the integrity of the data, FDA will take any action it deems necessary to ensure the reliability of the data including:


(1) Initiating agency audits of the data derived from the clinical investigator in question;


(2) Requesting that the applicant submit further analyses of data, e.g., to evaluate the effect of the clinical investigator's data on overall study outcome;


(3) Requesting that the applicant conduct additional independent studies to confirm the results of the questioned study; and


(4) Refusing to treat the covered clinical study as providing data that can be the basis for an agency action.
