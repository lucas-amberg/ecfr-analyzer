# § 99.203   Request to extend the time for completing planned studies.

(a) A manufacturer may request, prior to or at the time of making a submission to FDA under § 99.201, that FDA extend the 36-month time period for completing the studies and submitting a supplemental application for the new use that is the subject of the information to be disseminated. Such request must set forth the reasons that such studies cannot be completed and submitted in a supplemental application within 36 months.


(b) A manufacturer who has certified that it will complete the studies necessary to submit a supplemental application for a new use within a specified period of time from the date that dissemination of information under this part can begin under § 99.201(a)(4)(ii), but later finds that it will be unable to complete such studies and submit a supplemental application within that time period may request an extension of time from FDA. The manufacturer, in its request for extension, shall identify the product, the new use, and shall:


(1) Describe the study or studies that cannot be completed on time and explain why the study or studies cannot be completed on time;


(2) Describe the current status of the incomplete study or studies and summarize the work conducted, including the dates on which principal events concerning the study or studies occurred; and


(3) Estimate the additional time needed to complete the studies and submit a supplemental application. The requested extension shall not exceed an additional 24 months.


(c) The manufacturer shall send three copies of the request for extension to the same FDA office that received the manufacturer's initial submission and certification statement. The outside of the envelope shall be marked as “Request for Time Extension—Dissemination of Information on an Unapproved Use.”
