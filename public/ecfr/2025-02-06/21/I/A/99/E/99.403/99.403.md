# ยง 99.403   Termination of approvals of applications for exemption.

(a) FDA may, at any time, terminate the approval of an application for an exemption from the requirement to file a supplemental application if:


(1) The application for an exemption had been deemed to be approved because the agency had not acted on the application within 60 days after its receipt by FDA;


(2) The manufacturer is disseminating written information on the new use; and


(3) FDA determines that it would be economically and ethically possible for the manufacturer to conduct the clinical studies needed to submit a supplemental application for the new use.


(b) If FDA terminates a deemed approval of an application for an exemption under paragraph (a) of this section, FDA also may:


(1) Order the manufacturer to cease disseminating information; and


(2) Order the manufacturer to take action to correct the information that has been disseminated if FDA determines that the new use described in the disseminated information would pose a significant risk to public health.


(c) FDA shall notify the manufacturer if it terminates the deemed approval of an application for an exemption under paragraph (a) of this section. If FDA also issues an order to cease dissemination of information, the manufacturer shall comply with the order no later than 60 days after its receipt.


(d) FDA may, at any time, terminate the approval of an application for an exemption from the requirement to file a supplemental application for a new use if, after consulting with the manufacturer that was granted such exemption, FDA determines that the manufacturer no longer meets the requirements for an exemption on the basis that it is economically prohibitive or unethical to conduct the studies needed to submit a supplemental application for the new use.


(e) If FDA terminates an approval of an application for an exemption under paragraph (d) of this section, the manufacturer must, within 60 days of being notified by FDA that its exemption approval has been terminated, file a supplemental application for the new use that is the subject of the information being disseminated under the exemption, certify, under ยง 99.201(a)(4)(i) or (a)(4)(ii) that it will file a supplemental application for the new use, or cease disseminating the information on the new use. FDA may require a manufacturer that ceases dissemination of information on the new use to undertake corrective action.
