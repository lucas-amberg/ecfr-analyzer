(3) Within 90 days of the date of receipt of the petition that is accepted for review (i.e., that has not been found to be incomplete and consequently denied, FDA will notify the petitioner by letter of the agency's decision to grant the petitioner permission to use the proposed term, with any conditions or limitations on such use specified, or to deny the petition, in which case the letter shall state the reasons therefor. Failure of the petition to fully address the requirements of this section shall be grounds for denial of the petition.
