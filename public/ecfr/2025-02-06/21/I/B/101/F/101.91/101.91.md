# § 101.91   Gluten-free labeling of food.

(a) *Definitions.* (1) The term “gluten-containing grain” means any one of the following grains or their crossbred hybrids (e.g., triticale, which is a cross between wheat and rye):


(i) Wheat, including any species belonging to the genus *Triticum;*

(ii) Rye, including any species belonging to the genus *Secale;* or


(iii) Barley, including any species belonging to the genus *Hordeum.*

(2) The term “gluten” means the proteins that naturally occur in a gluten-containing grain and that may cause adverse health effects in persons with celiac disease (e.g., prolamins and glutelins).


(3) The labeling claim “gluten-free” means:


(i) That the food bearing the claim in its labeling:


(A) Does not contain any one of the following:


(*1*) An ingredient that is a gluten-containing grain (e.g., spelt wheat);


(*2*) An ingredient that is derived from a gluten-containing grain and that has not been processed to remove gluten (e.g., wheat flour); or


(*3*) An ingredient that is derived from a gluten-containing grain and that has been processed to remove gluten (e.g., wheat starch), if the use of that ingredient results in the presence of 20 parts per million (ppm) or more gluten in the food (i.e., 20 milligrams (mg) or more gluten per kilogram (kg) of food); or


(B) Inherently does not contain gluten; and


(ii) Any unavoidable presence of gluten in the food bearing the claim in its labeling is below 20 ppm gluten (i.e., below 20 mg gluten per kg of food).


(b) *Requirements.* (1) A food that bears the claim “gluten-free” in its labeling and fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section and, if applicable, paragraphs (c)(2) through (4) of this section will be deemed misbranded.


(2) A food that bears the claim “no gluten,” “free of gluten,” or “without gluten” in its labeling and fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section and, if applicable, paragraphs (c)(2) through (4) of this section will be deemed misbranded.


(3) A food that bears the term “wheat” in the ingredient list or in a separate “Contains wheat” statement in its labeling, as required by 21 U.S.C. 343(w)(1)(A), and also bears the claim “gluten-free” or a claim identified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section will be deemed misbranded unless the word “wheat” in the ingredient list or in the “Contains wheat” statement is followed immediately by an asterisk (or other symbol) that refers to another asterisk (or other symbol) in close proximity to the ingredient statement that immediately precedes the following: “The wheat has been processed to allow this food to meet the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements for gluten-free foods.”


(c) *Compliance.* (1) When compliance with paragraph (b) of this section is based on an analysis of the food, FDA will use a scientifically valid method that can reliably detect and quantify the presence of 20 ppm gluten in a variety of food matrices, including both raw and cooked or baked products.


(2) When a scientifically valid method pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section is not available because the food is fermented or hydrolyzed, the manufacturer of such foods bearing the claim must make and keep records regarding the fermented or hydrolyzed food demonstrating adequate assurance that:


(i) The food is “gluten-free” in compliance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section before fermentation or hydrolysis;


(ii) The manufacturer has adequately evaluated their processing for any potential for gluten cross-contact; and


(iii) Where a potential for gluten cross-contact has been identified, the manufacturer has implemented measures to prevent the introduction of gluten into the food during the manufacturing process.


(3) When a scientifically valid method pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section is not available because the food contains one or more ingredients that are fermented or hydrolyzed, the manufacturer of such foods bearing the claim must make and keep records demonstrating adequate assurance that the fermented or hydrolyzed ingredients are “gluten-free” as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.


(4) Records necessary to verify compliance with paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section must be retained for at least 2 years after introduction or delivery for introduction of the food into interstate commerce and may be kept as original records, as true copies, or as electronic records. Manufacturers must provide those records to us for examination and copying during an inspection upon request.


(5) When a scientifically valid method pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section is not available because the food is distilled, FDA will evaluate compliance with paragraph (b) of this section by verifying the absence of protein in the distilled component using scientifically valid analytical methods that can reliably detect the presence or absence of protein or protein fragments in the food.


(d) *Preemption.* A State or political subdivision of a State may not establish or continue into effect any law, rule, regulation, or other requirement that is different from the requirements in this section for the definition and use of the claim “gluten-free,” as well as the claims “no gluten,” “free of gluten,” or “without gluten.”
