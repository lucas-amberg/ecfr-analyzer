The Agency will respond within 15 days of receipt by the Division of Enforcement of the request for termination.

The Agency will send such notification, unless the Agency has information from FDA's own audits or from other sources demonstrating that the recall has not been effective. The Agency may conclude that a recall has not been effective if:
