# § 112.54   What treatment processes are acceptable for a biological soil amendment of animal origin that I apply in the growing of covered produce?

Each of the following treatment processes are acceptable for a biological soil amendment of animal origin that you apply in the growing of covered produce, provided that the resulting biological soil amendments are applied in accordance with the applicable requirements of § 112.56:


(a) A scientifically valid controlled physical process (*e.g.,* thermal), chemical process (*e.g.,* high alkaline pH), biological process (*e.g.,* composting), or a combination of scientifically valid controlled physical, chemical and/or biological processes that has been validated to satisfy the microbial standard in § 112.55(a) for *Listeria monocytogenes* (*L. monocytogenes*), *Salmonella* species, and *E. coli* O157:H7; or


(b) A scientifically valid controlled physical, chemical, or biological process, or a combination of scientifically valid controlled physical, chemical, and/or biological processes, that has been validated to satisfy the microbial standard in § 112.55(b) for *Salmonella* species and fecal coliforms. Examples of scientifically valid controlled biological (*e.g.,* composting) processes that meet the microbial standard in § 112.55(b) include:


(1) Static composting that maintains aerobic (*i.e.,* oxygenated) conditions at a minimum of 131 °F (55 °C) for 3 consecutive days and is followed by adequate curing; and


(2) Turned composting that maintains aerobic conditions at a minimum of 131 °F (55 °C) for 15 days (which do not have to be consecutive), with a minimum of five turnings, and is followed by adequate curing.
