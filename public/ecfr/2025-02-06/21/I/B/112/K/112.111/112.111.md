# ยง 112.111   What measures must I take if I grow, harvest, pack or hold both covered and excluded produce?

If you grow, harvest, pack or hold produce that is not covered in this part (*i.e.,* excluded produce in accordance with ยง 112.2) and also conduct such activities on covered produce, and the excluded produce is not grown, harvested, packed or held in accordance with this part, you must take measures during these covered activities, as applicable, to:


(a) Keep covered produce separate from excluded produce (except when covered produce and excluded produce are placed in the same container for distribution); and


(b) Adequately clean and sanitize, as necessary, any food contact surfaces that contact excluded produce before using such food contact surfaces for covered activities on covered produce.
