# ยง 112.116   What measures must I take when using food-packing (including food packaging) material?

(a) You must use food-packing material that is adequate for its intended use, which includes being:


(1) Cleanable or designed for single use; and


(2) Unlikely to support growth or transfer of bacteria.


(b) If you reuse food-packing material, you must take adequate steps to ensure that food contact surfaces are clean, such as by cleaning food-packing containers or using a clean liner.
