# ยง 112.144   What testing must I do during growing, harvesting, packing, and holding sprouts?

All of the following testing must be done during growing, harvesting, packing, and holding sprouts:


(a) You must test the growing, harvesting, packing, and holding environment for *Listeria* species or *L. monocytogenes* in accordance with the requirements of ยง 112.145.


(b) You must either:


(1) Test spent sprout irrigation water from each production batch of sprouts for *E. coli* O157:H7, *Salmonella* species, and any pathogens meeting the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section, in accordance with the requirements of ยง 112.147; or


(2) If testing spent sprout irrigation water is not practicable (for example, soil-grown sprouts harvested with roots or for hydroponically grown sprouts that use very little water), test each production batch of sprouts at the in-process stage (*i.e.,* while sprouts are still growing) for *E. coli* O157:H7, *Salmonella* species, and any pathogens meeting the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section, in accordance with the requirements of ยง 112.147.


(c) In addition to *E. coli* O157:H7 and *Salmonella* species, you must conduct tests as provided in paragraph (b) of this section for additional pathogens when the following conditions are met:


(1) Testing for the pathogen is reasonably necessary to minimize the risk of serious adverse health consequences or death from use of, or exposure to, sprouts; and


(2) A scientifically valid test method for the pathogen is available to detect the pathogen in spent sprout irrigation water (or sprouts).
