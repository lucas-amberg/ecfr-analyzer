# ยง 112.145   What requirements apply to testing the environment for Listeria species or L. monocytogenes?

All of the following testing requirements apply for the growing, harvesting, packing, and holding environment for *Listeria* species or *L. monocytogenes.*

(a) You must establish and implement a written environmental monitoring plan that is designed to identify *L. monocytogenes* if it is present in the growing, harvesting, packing, or holding environment.


(b) Your written environmental monitoring plan must be directed to sampling and testing for either *Listeria* species or *L. monocytogenes.*

(c) Your written environmental monitoring plan must include a sampling plan that specifies:


(1) What you will test collected samples for (*i.e., Listeria* species or *L. monocytogenes*);


(2) How often you will collect environmental samples, which must be no less than monthly, and at what point during production you will collect the samples; and


(3) Sample collection sites; the number and location of sampling sites must be sufficient to determine whether measures are effective and must include appropriate food contact surfaces and non-food-contact surfaces of equipment, and other surfaces within the growing, harvesting, packing, and holding environment.


(d) You must aseptically collect environmental samples and test them for *Listeria* species or *L. monocytogenes* using a method as set forth in ยง 112.152.


(e) Your written environmental monitoring plan must include a corrective action plan that, at a minimum, requires you to take the actions in ยง 112.146, and details when and how you will accomplish those actions, if the growing, harvesting, packing, or holding environment tests positive for *Listeria* species or *L. monocytogenes.*
