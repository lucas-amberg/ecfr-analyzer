The dairy ingredients used are pasteurized.


(2) One or more of the dairy ingredients specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is subjected to the action of a harmless lactic acid-producing bacterial culture, with or without one or more of the clotting enzymes specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The mixture is held until the dairy ingredients coagulate. The coagulated mass may be warmed and stirred and it is drained. The moisture content may be adjusted with one of the optional ingredients in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. The curd may be pressed, chilled, worked, and heated until it becomes fluid. It may then be homogenized or otherwise mixed.
