# § 155.200   Certain other canned vegetables.

(a) The canned vegetables for which definitions and standards of identity are prescribed by this section are those named in column I of the table set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The vegetable ingredient in each such canned vegetable is obtained by proper preparation from the succulent vegetable prescribed in column II of such table. If two or more forms of such ingredient are designated in column III of such table, the vegetable in each such form is an optional ingredient.

The following optional ingredients, in the case of the vegetables specified, may be added:


(1) An edible vegetable oil, in the cases of artichokes and pimientos.
