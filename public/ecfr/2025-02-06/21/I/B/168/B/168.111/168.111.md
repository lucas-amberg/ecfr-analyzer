# § 168.111   Dextrose monohydrate.

(a) Dextrose monohydrate is purified and crystallized D-glucose containing one molecule of water of crystallization with each molecule of D-glucose.


(b) The food shall meet the following specifications:


(1) The total solids content is not less than 90.0 percent mass/mass (m/m), and the reducing sugar content (dextrose equivalent), expressed as D-glucose, is not less than 99.5 percent m/m calculated on a dry basis.


(2) The sulfated ash content is not more than 0.25 percent m/m (calculated on a dry basis), and the sulfur dioxide content is not more than 20 mg/kg.


(c) The name of the food is “Dextrose monohydrate” or “Dextrose” or alternatively, “______ sugar monohydrate” or “______ sugar”, with the blank to be filled with the name of the food source, for example, “Corn sugar monohydrate” or “Corn sugar”.


(d) For purposes of this section, the methods of analysis to be used to determine if the food meets the specifications of paragraph (b) (1) and (2) of this section are the following sections in “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 13th Ed.
