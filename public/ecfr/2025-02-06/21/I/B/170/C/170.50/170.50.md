# ยง 170.50   Glycine (aminoacetic acid) in food for human consumption.

(a) Heretofore, the Food and Drug Administration has expressed the opinion in trade correspondence that glycine is generally recognized as safe for certain technical effects in human food when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice; however:


(1) Reports in scientific literature indicate that adverse effects were found in cases where high levels of glycine were administered in diets of experimental animals.


(2) Current usage information indicates that the daily dietary intake of glycine by humans may be substantially increasing due to changing use patterns in food technology.


(b) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs concludes that by May 8, 1971, manufacturers:


(1) Shall reformulate food products for human use to eliminate added glycine and its salts; or


(2) Shall bring such products into compliance with an authorizing food additive regulation. A food additive petition supported by toxicity data is required to show that any proposed level of glycine or its salts added to foods for human consumption will be safe.


(c) The status of glycine as generally recognized as safe for use in animal feed, as prescribed in ยง 582.5049 of this chapter, remains unchanged because the additive is considered an essential nutrient in certain animal feeds and is safe for such use under conditions of good feeding practice.
