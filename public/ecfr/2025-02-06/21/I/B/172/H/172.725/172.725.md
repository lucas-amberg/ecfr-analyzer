(c) To insure the safe use of the food additives the label of the package shall bear, in addition to the other information required by the Act:


(1) The name of the additive, “gibberellic acid” or “potassium gibberellate”, whichever is appropriate.


(2) An accurate statement of the concentration of the additive contained in the package.


(3) Adequate use directions to provide not more than 2 parts per million of gibberellic acid in the finished malt.


(4) Adequate labeling directions to provide that the final malt is properly labeled as described in paragraph (d) of this section.
