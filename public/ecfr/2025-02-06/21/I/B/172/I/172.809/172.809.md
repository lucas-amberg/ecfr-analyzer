# § 172.809   Curdlan.

Curdlan may be safely used in accordance with the following conditions:


(a) Curdlan is a high molecular weight polymer of glucose (β-1,3-glucan; CAS Reg. No. 54724-00-4) produced by pure culture fermentation from the nonpathogenic and nontoxicogenic bacterium *Alcaligenes faecalis* var. *myxogenes.*

(b) Curdlan meets the following specifications when it is tested according to the methods described or referenced in the document entitled “Analytical Methods for Specification Tests for Curdlan,” by Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., 12-10 Nihonbashi, 2-Chome, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 103, Japan, 1996, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

(1) Positive for curdlan.


(2) Assay for curdlan (calculated as anhydrous glucose), not less than 80 percent.


(3) pH of 1 percent aqueous suspension, 6.0-7.5.


(4) Lead, not more than 0.5 mg/kg.


(5) Heavy metals (as Pb), not more than 0.002 percent.


(6) Total nitrogen, not more than 0.2 percent.


(7) Loss on drying, not more than 10 percent.


(8) Residue on ignition, not more than 6 percent.

3 dyne per square centimeter.


(10) Aerobic plate count, not more than 10
3 per gram.


(11) Coliform bacteria, not more than 3 per gram.


(c) Curdlan is used or intended for use in accordance with good manufacturing practice as a formulation aid, processing aid, stabilizer and thickener, and texturizer in foods for which standards of identity established under section 401 of the act do not preclude such use.
