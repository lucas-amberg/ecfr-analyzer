# § 173.160   

The food additive *Candida guilliermondii* may be safely used as the organism for fermentation production of citric acid in accordance with the following conditions:


(a) The food additive is the enzyme system of the viable organism *Candida guilliermondii* and its concomitant metabolites produced during the fermentation process.


(b)(1) The nonpathogenic and nontoxicogenic organism descending from strain, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) No. 20474, 
1 is classified as follows:


(2) The toxonomic characteristics of the reference culture strain ATCC No. 20474 agree in the essentials with the standard description for *Candida guilliermondii* variety *guilliermondii* listed in “The Yeasts—A Toxonomic Study;” 2d Ed. (1970), by Jacomina Lodder, which is incorporated by reference. Copies are available from the Office of Food Additive Safety (HFS-200), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740, 240-402-1200, or available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

(c)(1) The additive is used or intended for use as a pure culture in the fermentation process for the production of citric acid using an acceptable aqueous carbohydrate substrate.


(2) The organism *Candida quilliermondii* is made nonviable and is completely removed from the citric acid during the recovery and purification process.


(d) The additive is so used that the citric acid produced conforms to the specifications of the Food Chemicals Codex, 7th ed. (2010), pp. 226-227, which is incorporated by reference. The Director of the Office of the Federal Register approves this incorporation by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.
