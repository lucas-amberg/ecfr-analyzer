# § 173.395   Trifluoromethane sulfonic acid.

Trifluoromethane sulfonic acid has the empirical formula CF_3_SO_3_H (CAS Reg. No. 1493-13-6). The catalyst (Trifluoromethane sulfonic acid) may safely be used in the production of cocoa butter substitute from palm oil (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-stearin) (see § 184.1259 of this chapter) in accordance with the following conditions:


(a) The catalyst meets the following specifications:


(b) It is used at levels not to exceed 0.2 percent of the reaction mixture to catalyze the directed esterification.


(c) The esterification reaction is quenched with steam and water and the catalyst is removed with the aqueous phase. Final traces of catalyst are removed by washing batches of the product three times with an aqueous solution of 0.5 percent sodium bicarbonate.


(d) No residual catalyst may remain in the product at a detection limit of 0.2 part per million fluoride as determined by the method described in “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” sections 25.049-25.055, 13th Ed. (1980), which is incorporated by reference.
