# § 175.380   Xylene-formaldehyde resins condensed with 4,4′-isopropylidenediphenol-epichlorohydrin epoxy resins.

The resins identified in paragraph (a) of this section may be safely used as a food-contact coating for articles intended for use in contact with food, in accordance with the following prescribed conditions.


(a) The resins are produced by the condensation of xylene-formaldehyde resin and 4,4′-isopropylidenediphenol-epichlorohydrin epoxy resins, to which may have been added certain optional adjuvant substances required in the production of the resins or added to impart desired physical and technical properties. The optional adjuvant substances may include resins produced by the condensation of allyl ether of mono-, di-, or trimethylol phenol and capryl alcohol and also may include substances identified in § 175.300(b)(3), with the exception of paragraph (b)(3)(xxxi) and (xxxii) of that section.


(b) The resins identified in paragraph (a) of this section may be used as a food-contact coating for articles intended for contact at temperatures not to exceed 160 °F with food of Types I, II, VI-A and B, and VIII described in table 1 of § 176.170(c) of this chapter provided that the coating in the finished form in which it is to contact food meets the following extractives limitations when tested by the methods provided in § 175.300(e):


(1) The coating when extracted with distilled water at 180 °F for 24 hours yields total extractives not to exceed 0.05 milligram per square inch of food-contact surface.


(2) The coating when extracted with 8 percent (by volume) ethyl alcohol in distilled water at 160 °F for 4 hours yields total extractives not to exceed 0.05 milligram per square inch of food-contact surface.


(c) The resins identified in paragraph (a) of this section may be used as a food-contact coating for articles intended for contact at temperatures not to exceed room temperature with food of Type VI-C described in table 1 of § 176.170(c) of this chapter provided the coating in the finished form in which it is to contact food meets the following extractives limitations when tested by the methods provided in § 175.300(e):


(1) The coating when extracted with distilled water at 180 °F for 24 hours yields total extractives not to exceed 0.05 milligram per square inch of food-contact surface.


(2) The coating when extracted with 50 percent (by volume) ethyl alcohol in distilled water at 180 °F for 24 hours yields total extractives not to exceed 0.05 milligram per square inch.
