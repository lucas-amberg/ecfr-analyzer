(3) Substances which by regulation in parts 174, 175, 176, 177, 178 and ยง 179.45 of this chapter may be safely used as components of resinous or polymeric coatings and film used as food-contact surfaces, subject to the provisions of such regulation.


(e) The copolymer conforms with the following specifications:


(1) The copolymer, when extracted with distilled water at reflux temperature for 2 hours, yields total extractives not to exceed 0.05 percent.


(2) The copolymer, when extracted with ethyl acetate at reflux temperature for 2 hours, yields total extractives not to exceed 0.7 percent.


(3) The copolymer, when extracted with *n-*hexane at reflux temperature for 2 hours, yields total extractives not to exceed 0.05 percent.
