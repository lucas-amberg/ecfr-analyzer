Polyvinylidene fluoride resins may be safely used as articles or components of articles intended for repeated use in contact with food, in accordance with the following prescribed conditions:


(a) For the purpose of this section, the polyvinylidene fluoride resins consist of basic resins produced by the polymerization of vinylidene fluoride.


(b) The finished food-contact article, when extracted at reflux temperatures for 2 hours with the solvents distilled water, 50 percent (by volume) ethyl alcohol in distilled water, and *n-*heptane, yields total extractives in each extracting solvent not to exceed 0.01 milligram per square inch of food-contact surface tested; and if the finished food-contact article is itself the subject of a regulation in parts 174, 175, 176, 177, 178 and ยง 179.45 of this chapter, it shall also comply with any specifications and limitations prescribed for it by that regulation. (_Note:_ In testing the finished food-contact article, use a separate test sample for each required extracting solvent.)


(c) In accordance with good manufacturing practice, finished food-contact articles containing the polyvinylidene fluoride resins shall be thoroughly cleansed prior to their first use in contact with food.
