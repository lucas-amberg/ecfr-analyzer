Industrial starch-modified may be safely used as a component of articles intended for use in producing, manufacturing, packing, processing, preparing, treating, packaging, transporting, or holding food, subject to the provisions of this section.


(a) Industrial starch-modified is identified as follows:


(1) A food starch-modified or starch or any combination thereof that has been modified by treatment with one of the reactants hereinafter specified, in an amount reasonably required to achieve the desired functional effect but in no event in excess of any limitation prescribed, with or without subsequent treatment as authorized in § 172.892 of this chapter.


(2) A starch irradiated under one of the following conditions to produce free radicals for subsequent graft polymerization with the reactants listed in this paragraph (a)(2):


(i) Radiation from a sealed cobalt 60 source, maximum absorbed dose not to exceed 5.0 megarads.


(ii) An electron beam source at a maximum energy of 7 million electron volts of ionizing radiation, maximum absorbed dose not to exceed 5.0 megarads.


(b) The following adjuvants may be used as surface-active agents in the processing of industrial starch-modified:


(c) To insure safe use of the industrial starch-modified, the label of the food additive container shall bear the name of the additive “industrial starch-modified,” and in the instance of an industrial starch-modified which is limited with respect to conditions of use, the label of the food additive container shall contain a statement of such limited use.
