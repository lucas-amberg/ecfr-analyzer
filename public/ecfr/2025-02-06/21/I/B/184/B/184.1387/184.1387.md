# ยง 184.1387   Lactase enzyme preparation from Candida pseudotropicalis.

(a) This enzyme preparation is derived from the nonpathogenic, nontoxicogenic yeast *C. pseudotropicalis.* It contains the enzyme lactase (ฮฒ-D-galactoside galactohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.23), which converts lactose to glucose and galactose. It is prepared from yeast that has been grown by a pure culture fermentation process.


(b) The ingredient meets the general requirements and additional requirements for enzyme preparations in the Food Chemicals Codex, 3d ed. (1981), pp. 107-110, which are incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

(c) In accordance with ยง 184.1(b)(1), the ingredient is used in food with no limitations other than current good manufacturing practice. The affirmation of this ingredient as generally recognized as safe as a direct human food ingredient is based upon the following current good manufacturing practice conditions of use:


(1) The ingredient is used as an enzyme, as defined in ยง 170.3(o)(9) of this chapter, to convert lactose to glucose and galactose.


(2) The ingredient is used in food at levels not to exceed current good manufacturing practice. Current good manufacturing practice is limited to use of this ingredient to reduce the lactose content in milk and milk-derived food products where food standards do not preclude such use.
