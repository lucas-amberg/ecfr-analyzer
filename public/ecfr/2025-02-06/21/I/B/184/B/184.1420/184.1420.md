# § 184.1420   Lipase enzyme preparation derived from Rhizopus niveus.

(a) Lipase enzyme preparation contains lipase enzyme (CAS Reg. No. 9001-62-1), which is obtained from the culture filtrate resulting from a pure culture fermentation of a nonpathogenic and nontoxigenic strain of *Rhizopus niveus.* The enzyme preparation also contains diatomaceous earth as a carrier. The characterizing activity of the enzyme, which catalyzes the interesterification of fats and oils at the 1- and 3-positions of triglycerides, is triacylglycerol lipase (EC 3.1.1.3).


(b) The ingredient meets the general requirements and additional requirements for enzyme preparations in the monograph on Enzyme Preparations in the “Food Chemicals Codex,” 4th ed. (1996), pp. 133 and 134, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies are available from the National Academy Press, 2101 Constitution Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20418, or may be examined at the Dockets Management Staff (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852, 240-402-7500, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

(c) In accordance with § 184.1(b)(1), the ingredient is used in food with no limitation other than current good manufacturing practice. The affirmation of this ingredient as generally recognized as safe as a direct human food ingredient is based upon the following current good manufacturing practice conditions of use:


(1) The ingredient is used as an enzyme as defined in § 170.3(o)(9) of this chapter for the interesterification of fats and oils.


(2) The ingredient is used in food at levels not to exceed current good manufacturing practice.
