# § 184.1431   Magnesium oxide.

(a) Magnesium oxide (MgO, CAS Reg. No. 1309-48-4) occurs naturally as the colorless, crystalline mineral periclase. It is produced either as a bulky white powder (light) or a relatively dense white powder (heavy) by heating magnesium hydroxide or carbonate. Heating these magnesium salts under moderate conditions (400° to 900 °C for a few hours) produces light magnesium oxide. Heating the salts under more rigorous conditions (1200 °C for 12 hours) produces heavy magnesium oxide. Light magnesium oxide is converted to heavy magnesium oxide by sustained heating at high temperatures.


(b) The ingredient meets the specifications of the Food Chemicals Codex, 3d Ed. (1981), p. 178, which is incorporated by reference.
