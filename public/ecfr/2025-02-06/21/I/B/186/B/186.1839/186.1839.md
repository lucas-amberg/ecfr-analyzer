(a) Sorbose (L-sorbose, sorbinose) (C_6_H_12_O_6_, CAS Reg. No. 87-79-6) is an orthorhombic, bisphenoidal crystalline ketohexose. It was originally identifed in the juice of mature berries from the mountain ash (*Sorbus aucuparia*) where it occurs as the result of microbial oxidation of sorbitol. It also occurs naturally in other plants. Sorbose can be synthesized by the catalytic hydrogenation of glucose to D-sorbitol. The resulting sorbitol can be oxidized by *Acetobacter xylinum* or by *Acetobacter suboxydans.*

(b) The ingredient is used or intended for indirect food use as a constituent of cotton, cotton fabrics, paper, and paperboard in contact with dry food.


(c) The ingredient migrates to food at levels not to exceed good manufacturing practice.


(d) Prior sanctions for this ingredient different from the uses established in this section do not exist or have been waived.
