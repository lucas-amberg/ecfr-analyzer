# § 201.56   Requirements on content and format of labeling for human prescription drug and biological products.

(a) *General requirements.* Prescription drug labeling described in § 201.100(d) must meet the following general requirements:


(1) The labeling must contain a summary of the essential scientific information needed for the safe and effective use of the drug.

(3) The labeling must be based whenever possible on data derived from human experience. No implied claims or suggestions of drug use may be made if there is inadequate evidence of safety or a lack of substantial evidence of effectiveness. Conclusions based on animal data but necessary for safe and effective use of the drug in humans must be identified as such and included with human data in the appropriate section of the labeling.
