# § 201.105   Veterinary drugs.

A drug subject to the requirements of section 503(f)(1) of the act shall be exempt from section 502(f)(1) of the act if all the following conditions are met:

(ii) In the possession of a retail, hospital, or clinic pharmacy, or other person authorized under State law to dispense veterinary prescription drugs, who is regularly and lawfully engaged in dispensing drugs that are to be used only by or on the prescription or other order of a licensed veterinarian; or


(iii) In the possession of a licensed veterinarian for use in the course of his professional practice; and


(2) To be dispensed in accordance with section 503(f) of the act.


(b) The label of the drug bears:


(1) The statement “Caution: Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian”; and


(2) The recommended or usual dosage; and


(3) The route of administration, if it is not for oral use; and


(4) The quantity or proportion of each active ingredient as well as the information required by section 502(e) of the act; and


(5) If it is for other than oral use, the names of all inactive ingredients, except that:


(i) Flavorings and perfumes may be designated as such without naming their components.


(ii) Color additives may be designated as coloring without naming specific color components unless the naming of such components is required by a color additive regulation prescribed in subchapter A of this chapter.


(iii) Trace amounts of harmless substances added solely for individual product identification need not be named.


(6) An identifying lot or control number from which it is possible to determine the complete manufacturing history of the package of the drug;


(c)(1) Labeling on or within the package from which the drug is to be dispensed bears adequate information for its use, including indications, effects, dosages, routes, methods, and frequency and duration of administration, and any relevant hazards, contraindications, side effects, and precautions under which veterinarians licensed by law to administer the drug can use the drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended, including all purposes for which it is advertised or represented; and


(2) If the article is subject to section 512 or 572 of the act, the labeling bearing such information is the labeling authorized by the approved new animal drug application or contained in the index listing: *Provided, however*, That the information required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section may be omitted from the dispensing package if, but only if, the article is a drug for which directions, hazards, warnings, and use information are commonly known to veterinarians licensed by law to administer the drug. Upon written request, stating reasonable grounds therefore, the Commissioner will offer an opinion on a proposal to omit such information from the dispensing package under this proviso.


(d) Any labeling, as defined in section 201(m) of the act, whether or not it is on or within a package from which the drug is to be dispensed, distributed by or on behalf of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the drug, that furnishes or purports to furnish information for use or which prescribes, recommends, or suggests a dosage for the use of the drug (other than dose information required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section and § 201.100(b)(2)) contains:


(1) Adequate information for such use, including indications, effects, dosages, routes, methods, and frequency and duration of administration, and any relevant warnings, hazards, contraindications, side effects, and precautions, and including information relevant to compliance with the new animal drug provisions of the act, under which veterinarians licensed by law to administer the drug can use the drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended, including all conditions for which it is advertised or represented; and if the article is subject to section 512 or 572 of the act, the parts of the labeling providing such information are the same in language and emphasis as labeling approved, permitted, or indexed under the provisions of section 512 or 572, and any other parts of the labeling are consistent with and not contrary to such approved, permitted, or indexed labeling; and


(2) The same information concerning the ingredients of the drug as appears on the label and labeling on or within the package from which the drug is to be dispensed; 


(e) All labeling, except labels and cartons, bearing information for use of the drug also bears the date of the issuance or the date of the latest revision of such labeling.


(f) A prescription drug intended for both human and veterinary use shall comply with paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section and § 201.100.
