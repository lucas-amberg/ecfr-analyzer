# § 201.309   Acetophenetidin (phenacetin)-containing preparations; necessary warning statement.

(a) In 1961, the Food and Drug Administration, pursuant to its statutory responsibility for the safety and effectiveness of drugs shipped in interstate commerce, began an active investigation of reports of possible toxic effects and renal damage due to misuse of the drug acetophenetidin. This study led to the decision that there was probable cause to conclude that misuse and prolonged use of the drug were in fact responsible for kidney lesions and disease. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in December 1963, appointed an ad hoc Advisory Committee of Inquiry on Possible Nephrotoxicity Associated With the Abuse of Acetophenetidin (Phenacetin)-Containing Preparations. This committee, composed of scientists in the fields of pharmacology and medicine, on April 23, 1964, submitted its findings and conclusions in the matter and recommended that all acetophenetidin (phenacetin)-containing preparations bear a warning as provided in section 502(f)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.


(b) On the basis of the studies made by the Food and Drug Administration and the report of the Advisory Committee, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs has concluded that it is necessary for the protection of users that the label and labeling of all acetophenetidin (phenacetin)-containing preparations bear a warning statement to the following effect: “Warning—This medication may damage the kidneys when used in large amounts or for a long period of time. Do not take more than the recommended dosage, nor take regularly for longer than 10 days without consulting your physician.”
