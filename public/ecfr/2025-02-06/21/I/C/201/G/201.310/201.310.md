# § 201.310   Phenindione; labeling of drug preparations intended for use by man.

(a) Reports in the medical literature and data accumulated by the Food and Drug Administration indicate that phenindione, a synthetic anticoagulant drug, has caused a number of cases of agranulocytosis (with two fatalities). There are also reports implicating the drug in cases of hepatitis and hypersensitivity reactions. In view of the potentially serious effects found to be associated with preparations of this drug intended for use by man, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs will regard such preparations as misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f) (1) and (2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, unless the label and labeling on or within the package from which the drug is to be dispensed, and any other labeling furnishing or purporting to furnish information for use of the drug, bear a conspicuous warning statement to the following effect: “Warning: Agranulocytosis and hepatitis have been associated with the use of phenindione. Patients should be instructed to report promptly prodromal symptoms such as marked fatigue, chill, fever, and sore throat. Periodic blood studies and liver function tests should be performed. Use of the drug should be discontinued if leukopenia occurs or if evidence of hypersensitivity, such as dermatitis or fever, appears.”


(b) Regulatory action may be initiated with respect to preparations of phenindione intended for use by man found within the jurisdiction of the act on or after November 25, 1961, unless such preparations are labeled in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
