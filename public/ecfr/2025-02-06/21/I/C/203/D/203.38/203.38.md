# § 203.38   Sample lot or control numbers; labeling of sample units.

(a) *Lot or control number required on drug sample labeling and sample unit label.* The manufacturer or authorized distributor of record of a drug sample shall include on the label of the sample unit and on the outside container or packaging of the sample unit, if any, an identifying lot or control number that will permit the tracking of the distribution of each drug sample unit.


(b) *Records containing lot or control numbers required for all drug samples distributed.* A manufacturer or authorized distributor of record shall maintain for all samples distributed records of drug sample distribution containing lot or control numbers that are sufficient to permit the tracking of sample units to the point of the licensed practitioner.


(c) *Labels of sample units.* Each sample unit shall bear a label that clearly denotes its status as a drug sample, e.g., “sample,” “not for sale,” “professional courtesy package.” 


(1) A drug that is labeled as a drug sample is deemed to be a drug sample within the meaning of the act.


(2) A drug product dosage unit that bears an imprint identifying the dosage form as a drug sample is deemed to be a drug sample within the meaning of the act.


(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, any article that is a drug sample as defined in section 503(c)(1) of the act and § 203.3(i) that fails to bear the label required in this paragraph (c) is a drug sample.
