(2) Any active pharmaceutical ingredient or the strength of any active pharmaceutical ingredient;


(3) The dosage form;


(4) A change in the drug's status, between prescription and nonprescription, or for animal drugs, between prescription, nonprescription, or veterinary feed directive (VFD) status;


(5) A change in the drug's intended use between human and animal; or


(6) The drug's distinguishing characteristics such as size, shape, color, code imprint, flavor, and scoring (if any).


(c) When there is a change only to the package size or type, including the immediate unit-of-use container, if any, the proposed new NDC must include only a new package code and retain the existing product code unless all available package codes have already been combined with the existing product code in NDCs assigned by FDA.
