(i) Determine whether a drug in its possession or control that it intends to sell to the Importer under a SIP is a suspect foreign product. Upon making a determination that a drug in its possession or control is a suspect foreign product, or upon receiving a request for verification from FDA that the Foreign Seller has determined that a product within its possession or control is a suspect foreign product, a Foreign Seller must:


(A) Quarantine such product within its possession or control until such product is cleared or dispositioned;

(C) If the Foreign Seller makes the determination that a suspect foreign product is not an illegitimate foreign product, promptly notify FDA of such determination for those products that FDA has requested verification.


(ii) Determine whether a drug in its possession or control that it intends to sell to the Importer under a SIP is an illegitimate foreign product. Upon making a determination that a drug in its possession or control is an illegitimate foreign product, the Foreign Seller must:


(A) Quarantine such product within the possession or control of the Foreign Seller from product intended for distribution until such product is dispositioned;

(4) A Foreign Seller, upon receiving a shipment of eligible prescription drugs from the manufacturer, must:


(i) Separate the portion of drugs intended for sale to the Importer located in the United States, and store such portion separately from that portion of product intended for sale in the Canadian market;


(ii) Assign an SSI to each package and homogenous case intended for sale to the Importer in the United States, unless each such package and homogenous case displayed a manufacturer-affixed or imprinted product identifier, as such term is defined in section 581(14) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, at the time of receipt by the Foreign Seller;

(5) Upon receiving a request for verification from the Importer or other authorized repackager, wholesale distributor, or dispenser that is in possession or control of a product such person believes to be distributed by such Foreign Seller, a Foreign Seller must, not later than 24 hours after receiving the request for verification, or in such other reasonable time as determined by the FDA based on the circumstances of the request, notify the person making the request whether the SSI that is the subject of the request corresponds to the SSI affixed or imprinted by the Foreign Seller. If a Foreign Seller responding to a request for verification identifies an SSI that does not correspond to that SSI affixed or imprinted by the Foreign Seller, the Foreign Seller must treat such product as suspect foreign product and conduct an investigation as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If the Foreign Seller determines the product is an illegitimate foreign product, the Foreign Seller must advise the person making the request of such determination at the time such Foreign Seller responds to the request for verification.

(d) *Importers.* (1) An Importer of an eligible prescription drug must purchase the drug directly from a Foreign Seller in Canada.


(2) Upon receipt of an eligible prescription drug in a transaction from the Foreign Seller, an Importer must facilitate the affixation or imprinting of a product identifier, as defined in section 581(14) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, for all eligible prescription drugs. The Importer must ensure that such affixation or imprinting occurs at the same time the product is relabeled with the required U.S.-approved labeling for the drug product and, except for repackaging necessary to perform the relabeling described in this part, cannot otherwise relabel or repackage the product. The Importer may affix or imprint the product identifier, or the Importer may contract with an entity registered with FDA under part 207 of this chapter to accomplish such relabeling, provided that the entity does not otherwise relabel or repackage the product, except for repackaging that is necessary to perform the relabeling described in this part. Any entity with which the Importer contracts to accomplish such labeling must, even if not engaged in a repackaging operation with respect to the eligible prescription drug, have systems and processes in place to meet applicable requirements of a โrepackagerโ under section 582(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for any transaction involving the eligible prescription drug.


(3) The repackager that affixes or imprints the product identifier on each package and homogenous case of an eligible prescription drug in accordance with section 582 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which may be the Importer or the Importer's authorized repackagerโ

(ii) Must maintain the product identifier information for such drug for not less than 6 years; and


(iii) Must maintain records for not less than 6 years that associate the product identifier the repackager affixes or imprints with the serial number assigned by the Foreign Seller and the Canadian DIN.


(4) An Importer must retain records, for not less than 6 years, that allow the Importer to associate the product identifier affixed or imprinted on each package or homogenous case of product it received from the Foreign Seller, with the SSI that had been assigned by the Foreign Seller, and the Canadian DIN that was on the package when the Foreign Seller received the product from the manufacturer.


(5) An Importer must, upon receipt of an eligible prescription drug and records from a Foreign Seller, compare such information with information the Importer received from the manufacturer, including relevant documentation about the transaction that the manufacturer provided to the Foreign Seller upon its transfer of ownership of the product for the Canadian market.


(6) An Importer must comply with all applicable requirements of section 582 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including requirements that apply to subsequent transactions with trading partners, unless a waiver, exception, or exemption applies.
