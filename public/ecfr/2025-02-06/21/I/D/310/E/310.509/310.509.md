# § 310.509   Parenteral drug products in plastic containers.

(a) Any parenteral drug product packaged in a plastic immediate container is not generally recognized as safe and effective, is a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the act, and requires an approved new drug application as a condition for marketing. An “Investigational New Drug Application” set forth in part 312 of this chapter is required for clinical investigations designed to obtain evidence of safety and effectiveness.


(b) As used in this section, the term “large volume parenteral drug product” means a terminally sterilized aqueous drug product packaged in a single-dose container with a capacity of 100 milliliters or more and intended to be administered or used intravenously in a human.


(c) Until the results of compatibility studies are evaluated, a large volume parenteral drug product for intravenous use in humans that is packaged in a plastic immediate container on or after April 16, 1979, is misbranded unless its labeling contains a warning that includes the following information:


(1) A statement that additives may be incompatible.


(2) A statement that, if additive drugs are introduced into the parenteral system, aseptic techniques should be used and the solution should be thoroughly mixed.


(3) A statement that a solution containing an additive drug should not be stored.


(d) This section does not apply to a biological product licensed under the Public Health Service Act of July 1, 1944 (42 U.S.C. 201).
