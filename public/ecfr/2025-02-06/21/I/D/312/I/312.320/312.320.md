# ยง 312.320   Treatment IND or treatment protocol.

Under this section, FDA may permit an investigational drug to be used for widespread treatment use.


(a) *Criteria.* The criteria in ยง 312.305(a) must be met, and FDA must determine that:


(1) *Trial status.* (i) The drug is being investigated in a controlled clinical trial under an IND designed to support a marketing application for the expanded access use, or


(ii) All clinical trials of the drug have been completed; and


(2) *Marketing status.* The sponsor is actively pursuing marketing approval of the drug for the expanded access use with due diligence; and


(3) *Evidence.* (i) When the expanded access use is for a serious disease or condition, there is sufficient clinical evidence of safety and effectiveness to support the expanded access use. Such evidence would ordinarily consist of data from phase 3 trials, but could consist of compelling data from completed phase 2 trials; or


(ii) When the expanded access use is for an immediately life-threatening disease or condition, the available scientific evidence, taken as a whole, provides a reasonable basis to conclude that the investigational drug may be effective for the expanded access use and would not expose patients to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury. This evidence would ordinarily consist of clinical data from phase 3 or phase 2 trials, but could be based on more preliminary clinical evidence.


(b) *Submission.* The expanded access submission must include information adequate to satisfy FDA that the criteria in ยง 312.305(a) and paragraph (a) of this section have been met. The expanded access submission must meet the requirements of ยง 312.305(b).


(c) *Safeguard.* The sponsor is responsible for monitoring the treatment protocol to ensure that licensed physicians comply with the protocol and the regulations applicable to investigators.
