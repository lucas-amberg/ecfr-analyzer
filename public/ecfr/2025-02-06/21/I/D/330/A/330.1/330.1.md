(d) The advertising for the product prescribes, recommends, or suggests its use only under the conditions stated in the labeling.

Color additives may be used only in accordance with section 721 of the act and subchapter A of this chapter. 


(f) The product container and container components meet the requirements of § 211.94 of this chapter.
