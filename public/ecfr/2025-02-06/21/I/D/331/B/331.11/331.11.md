(2) Aluminum hydroxide (or as aluminum hydroxide-hexitol stabilized polymer, aluminum hydroxide-magnesium carbonate codried gel, aluminum hydroxide-magnesium trisilicate codried gel, aluminum-hydroxide sucrose powder hydrated). 


(3) Dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate and dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetic acid. 


(4) Aluminum phosphate gel when used as part of an antacid combination product and contributing at least 25 percent of the total acid neutralizing capacity; maximum daily dosage limit is 8 grams. 


(5) Dihydroxyaluminum sodium carbonate. 


(b) Bicarbonate-containing active ingredients: Bicarbonate ion; maximum daily dosage limit 200 mEq. for persons up to 60 years old and 100 mEq. for persons 60 years or older. 


(c) Bismuth-containing active ingredients: 


(1) Bismuth aluminate. 


(2) Bismuth carbonate. 


(3) Bismuth subcarbonate. 


(4) Bismuth subgallate. 


(5) Bismuth subnitrate. 


(d) Calcium-containing active ingredients: Calcium, as carbonate or phosphate; maximum daily dosage limit 160 mEq. calcium (e.g., 8 grams calcium carbonate). 


(e) Citrate-containing active ingredients: Citrate ion, as citric acid or salt; maximum daily dosage limit 8 grams. 


(f) Glycine (aminoacetic acid). 


(g) Magnesium-containing active ingredients: 


(1) Hydrate magnesium aluminate activated sulfate.

(i) Phosphate-containing active ingredients: 


(1) Aluminum phosphate; maximum daily dosage limit 8 grams. 


(2) Mono or dibasic calcium salt; maximum daily dosage limit 2 grams. 


(3) Tricalcium phosphate; maximum daily dosage limit 24 grams. 


(j) Potassium-containing active ingredients: 


(1) Potassium bicarbonate (or carbonate when used as a component of an effervescent preparation); maximum daily dosage limit 200 mEq. of bicarbonate ion for persons up to 60 years old and 100 mEq. of bicarbonate ion for persons 60 years or older. 


(2) Sodium potassium tartrate. 


(k) Sodium-containing active ingredients:
