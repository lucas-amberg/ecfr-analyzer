(a) *Specifications.* Each milliliter of solution contains 64.8 milligrams (mg) of sodium pentobarbital.


(b) *Sponsor.* See No. 000061 in § 510.600(c) of this chapter.


(c) *Conditions of use*—(1) *Amount.* The drug is administered intravenously “to effect”. For general surgical anesthesia, the usual dose is 11 to 13 mg per pound of body weight. For sedation, the usual dose is approximately 2 mg per pound of body weight. For relieving convulsive seizures caused by strychnine in dogs, the injection should be administered intravenously “to effect”. The drug may be administered intraperitoneally. When given intraperitoneally, it is administered at the same dosage level as for intravenous administration.


(2) *Indications for use.* The drug is indicated for use as a general anesthetic in dogs and cats. Although it may be used as a general surgical anesthetic for horses, it is usually given at a lower dose to cause sedation and hypnosis and may be supplemented with a local anesthetic. It may also be used in dogs for the symptomatic treatment of strychnine poisoning.


(3) *Limitations.* Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian.
