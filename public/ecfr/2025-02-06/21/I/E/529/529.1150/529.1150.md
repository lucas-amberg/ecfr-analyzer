# § 529.1150   Hydrogen peroxide.

(a) *Specifications.* Each milliliter of solution contains 396.1 milligrams (mg) hydrogen peroxide (a 35% w/w solution).


(b) *Sponsor.* See No. 050378 in § 510.600(c) of this chapter.


(c) *Conditions of use*—(1) *Indications and amount.* (i) Freshwater-reared finfish eggs for the control of mortality in due to saprolegniasis associated with fungi in the family Saprolegniaceae:


(A) For all coldwater and coolwater species of freshwater-reared finfish eggs: 500 to 1,000 mg per liter (/L) of culture water for 15 minutes in a continuous flow system once per day on consecutive or alternate days until hatch, or


(B) For all freshwater-reared warmwater finfish eggs: 750 to 1,000 mg/L for 15 minutes in a continuous flow system once per day on consecutive or alternate days until hatch.


(ii) Freshwater-reared finfish for the control of mortality due to saprolegniasis associated with the fungi in the family Saprolegniaceae: For freshwater-reared coldwater finfish including salmonids (all life stages), freshwater-reared coolwater finfish fingerlings and adults, and freshwater-reared warmwater finfish fingerlings and adults: 75 mg/L for 60 minutes in continuous flow water supply or as a static bath once per day on alternate days for three treatments.


(iii) Freshwater-reared salmonids for the control of mortality due to bacterial gill disease associated with *Flavobacterium branchiophilum:* 100 mg/L for 30 minutes, or 50 to 100 mg/L for 60 minutes, in a continuous flow water supply or as a static bath once per day on alternate days for three treatments.


(iv) Freshwater-reared salmonids for the treatment and control of *Gyrodactylus* spp: 100 mg/L for 30 minutes, or 50 mg/L for 60 minutes, in a continuous flow water supply or as a static bath once per day on alternate days for three treatments.


(v) Freshwater-reared coolwater and warmwater finfish fingerlings and adults for the control of mortality due to external columnaris disease associated with *Flavobacterium columnare:* 50 to 75 mg/L for 60 minutes in continuous flow water supply or as a static bath once per day on alternate days for three treatments.


(vi) Freshwater-reared coolwater finfish fry and warmwater finfish fry for the control of mortality due to external columnaris disease associated with *Flavobacterium columnare:* 50 mg/L for 60 minutes in continuous flow water supply or as a static bath once per day on alternate days for three treatments.


(2) *Limitations.* (i) Initial bioassay on a small number is recommended before treating the entire group.


(ii) Eggs: Some strains of rainbow trout eggs are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide treatment at a time during incubation concurrent with blastopore formation through closure, about 70 to 140 Daily Temperature Units, °C. Consider withholding treatment or using an alternate therapeutant during that sensitive time to reduce egg mortalities due to drug toxicity.


(iii) Finfish: Because finfish sensitivity to 35% PEROX-AID® increases with increasing water temperature, consider administering initial treatments at the lower end of the treatment regimen or reducing water temperature before treatment. Do not use this product to treat northern pike (*Esox lucius*) or paddlefish (*Polyodon spathula*) of any age. Do not use this product to treat pallid sturgeon fry. Use with caution on walleye (*Sander vitreus*) and ornamental finfish.


(iv) Preharvest withdrawal time: Zero days.
