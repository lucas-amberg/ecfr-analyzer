# ยง 530.22   Safe levels and analytical methods for food-producing animals.

(a) FDA may establish a safe level for extralabel use of an approved human drug or an approved new animal drug when the agency finds that there is a reasonable probability that an extralabel use may present a risk to the public health. FDA may:


(1) Establish a finite safe level based on residue and metabolism information from available sources;


(2) Establish a safe level based on the lowest level that can be measured by a practical analytical method; or 


(3) Establish a safe level based on other appropriate scientific, technical, or regulatory criteria.


(b) FDA may require the development of an acceptable analytical method for the quantification of residues above any safe level established under this part. If FDA requires the development of such an acceptable analytical method, the agency will publish notice of that requirement in the _Federal Register._

(c) The extralabel use of an animal drug or human drug that results in residues exceeding a safe level established under this part is an unsafe use of such drug.


(d) If the agency establishes a safe level for a particular species or category of animals and a tolerance or safe concentration is later established through an approval for that particular species or category of animals, for that species or category of animals, the safe level is superseded by the tolerance or safe concentration for that species or category of animals.
