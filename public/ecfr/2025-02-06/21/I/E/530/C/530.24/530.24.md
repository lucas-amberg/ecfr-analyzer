(a) FDA may issue an order announcing a specific analytical method or methods for the quantification of extralabel use drug residues above the safe levels established under ยง 530.22 for extralabel use of an approved human drug or an approved animal drug. The agency will publish in the _Federal Register_ a notice of the order, including the name of the specific analytical method or methods and the drug or drugs for which the method is applicable. 


(b) Copies of analytical methods for the quantification of extralabel use drug residues above the safe levels established under ยง 530.22 will be available upon request from the Communications and Education Branch (HFV-12), Division of Program Communication and Administrative Management, Center for Veterinary Medicine, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855.
