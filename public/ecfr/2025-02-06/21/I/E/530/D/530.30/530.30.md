# ยง 530.30   Extralabel drug use in nonfood animals.

(a) Because extralabel use of animal and human drugs in nonfood-producing animals does not ordinarily pose a threat to the public health, extralabel use of animal and human drugs is permitted in nonfood-producing animal practice except when the public health is threatened. In addition, the provisions of ยง 530.20(a)(1) will apply to the use of an approved animal drug.


(b) If FDA determines that an extralabel drug use in animals not intended for human consumption presents a risk to the public health, the agency may publish in the _Federal Register_ a notice prohibiting such use following the procedures in ยง 530.25. The prohibited extralabel drug use will be codified in ยง 530.41.
