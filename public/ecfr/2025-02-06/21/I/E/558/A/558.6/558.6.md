# § 558.6   Veterinary feed directive drugs.

(a) *General requirements related to veterinary feed directive (VFD) drugs.* (1) Animal feed bearing or containing a VFD drug or a combination VFD drug (a VFD feed or combination VFD feed) may be fed to animals only by or upon a lawful VFD issued by a licensed veterinarian.


(2) A VFD feed or combination VFD feed must not be fed to animals after the expiration date on the VFD.


(3) Use and labeling of a VFD drug or a combination VFD drug in feed is limited to the approved, conditionally approved, or indexed conditions of use. Use of feed containing this veterinary feed directive (VFD) drug in a manner other than as directed on the labeling (extralabel use) is not permitted.


(4) All involved parties (the veterinarian, the distributor, and the client) must retain a copy of the VFD for 2 years. The veterinarian must retain the original VFD in its original form (electronic or hardcopy). The distributor and client copies may be kept as an electronic copy or hardcopy.


(5) All involved parties must make the VFD and any other records specified in this section available for inspection and copying by FDA upon request.


(6) All labeling and advertising for VFD drugs, combination VFD drugs, and feeds containing VFD drugs or combination VFD drugs must prominently and conspicuously display the following cautionary statement: “Caution: Federal law restricts medicated feed containing this veterinary feed directive (VFD) drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian.”


(b) *Responsibilities of the veterinarian issuing the VFD.* (1) In order for a VFD to be lawful, the veterinarian issuing the VFD must:


(i) Be licensed to practice veterinary medicine; and


(ii) Be operating in the course of the veterinarian's professional practice and in compliance with all applicable veterinary licensing and practice requirements, including issuing the VFD in the context of a veterinarian-client-patient relationship (VCPR) as defined by the State. If applicable VCPR requirements as defined by such State do not include the key elements of a valid VCPR as defined in § 530.3(i) of this chapter, the veterinarian must issue the VFD in the context of a valid VCPR as defined in § 530.3(i) of this chapter.


(2) The veterinarian must only issue a VFD that is in compliance with the conditions for use approved, conditionally approved, or indexed for the VFD drug or combination VFD drug.


(3) The veterinarian must ensure that the following information is fully and accurately included on the VFD:


(i) The veterinarian's name, address, and telephone number;


(ii) The client's name, business or home address, and telephone number;


(iii) The premises at which the animals specified in the VFD are located;


(iv) The date of VFD issuance;


(v) The expiration date of the VFD. This date must not extend beyond the expiration date specified in the approval, conditional approval, or index listing, if such date is specified. In cases where the expiration date is not specified in the approval, conditional approval, or index listing, the expiration date of the VFD must not exceed 6 months after the date of issuance;


(vi) The name of the VFD drug(s);


(vii) The species and production class of animals to be fed the VFD feed;


(viii) The approximate number of animals to be fed the VFD feed by the expiration date of the VFD. The approximate number of animals is the potential number of animals of the species and production class identified on the VFD that will be fed the VFD feed or combination VFD feed at the specified premises by the expiration date of the VFD;


(ix) The indication for which the VFD is issued;


(x) The level of VFD drug in the VFD feed and duration of use;


(xi) The withdrawal time, special instructions, and cautionary statements necessary for use of the drug in conformance with the approval;

In cases where reorders (refills) are not specified on the labeling for an approved, conditionally approved, or index listed VFD drug, reorders (refills) are not permitted;


(xiii) The statement: “Use of feed containing this veterinary feed directive (VFD) drug in a manner other than as directed on the labeling (extralabel use) is not permitted.”;


(xiv) An affirmation of intent for combination VFD drugs as described in paragraph (6) of this section; and


(xv) The veterinarian's electronic or written signature.


(4) The veterinarian may, at his or her discretion, enter the following information on the VFD to more specifically identify the animals authorized to be treated/fed the VFD feed:


(i) A more specific description of the location of animals (*e.g.,* by site, pen, barn, stall, tank, or other descriptor that the veterinarian deems appropriate);


(ii) The approximate age range of the animals;


(iii) The approximate weight range of the animals; and


(iv) Any other information the veterinarian deems appropriate to identify the animals specified in the VFD.


(5) For VFDs intended to authorize the use of an approved, conditionally approved, or indexed combination VFD drug that includes more than one VFD drug, the veterinarian must include the drug-specific information required in paragraphs (b)(3)(vi), (ix), (x), and (xi) of this section for each VFD drug in the combination.


(6) The veterinarian may restrict VFD authorization to only include the VFD drug(s) cited on the VFD or may expand such authorization to allow the use of the cited VFD drug(s) along with one or more over-the-counter (OTC) animal drugs in an approved, conditionally approved, or indexed combination VFD drug. The veterinarian must affirm his or her intent regarding combination VFD drugs by including one of the following statements on the VFD:


(i) “This VFD only authorizes the use of the VFD drug(s) cited in this order and is not intended to authorize the use of such drug(s) in combination with any other animal drugs.”

(iii) “This VFD authorizes the use of the VFD drug(s) cited in this order in any FDA-approved, conditionally approved, or indexed combination(s) in medicated feed that contains the VFD drug(s) as a component.”


(7) The veterinarian must issue a written (nonverbal) VFD.


(8) The veterinarian must send a copy of the VFD to the distributor via hardcopy, facsimile (fax), or electronically. If in hardcopy, the veterinarian must send the copy of the VFD to the distributor either directly or through the client.


(9) The veterinarian must provide a copy of the VFD to the client.


(c) *Responsibilities of any person who distributes an animal feed containing a VFD drug or a combination VFD drug.* (1) The distributor is permitted to fill a VFD only if the VFD contains all the information required in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

(3) The distributor must keep records of the receipt and distribution of all medicated animal feed containing a VFD drug for 2 years.


(4) In addition to other applicable recordkeeping requirements found in this section, if the distributor manufactures the animal feed bearing or containing the VFD drug, the distributor must also keep VFD feed manufacturing records for 1 year in accordance with part 225 of this chapter. Such records must be made available for inspection and copying by FDA upon request.


(5) A distributor of animal feed containing a VFD drug must notify FDA prior to the first time it distributes animal feed containing a VFD drug. The notification is required one time per distributor and must include the following information:


(i) The distributor's complete name and business address;


(ii) The distributor's signature or the signature of the distributor's authorized agent; and


(iii) The date the notification was signed.


(6) A distributor must also notify FDA within 30 days of any change in ownership, business name, or business address.

(8) A distributor is permitted to distribute a VFD feed to another distributor only if the originating distributor (consignor) first obtains a written (nonverbal) acknowledgment letter, as defined in § 558.3(b)(11), from the receiving distributor (consignee) before the feed is shipped. Consignor distributors must retain a copy of each consignee distributor's acknowledgment letter for 2 years.
