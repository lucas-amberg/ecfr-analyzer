# § 573.130   Aminoglycoside 3′-phospho- transferase II.

The food additive aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase II may be safely used in the development of genetically modified cotton, oilseed rape, and tomatoes in accordance with the following prescribed conditions: 


(a) The food additive is the enzyme aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase II (CAS Reg. No. 58943-39-8) which catalyzes the phosphorylation of certain aminoglycoside antibiotics, including kanamycin, neomycin, and gentamicin. 


(b) Aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase II is encoded by the *kan*r gene originally isolated from transposon Tn*5* of the bacterium *Escherichia coli.*

(c) The level of the additive does not exceed the amount reasonably required for selection of plant cells carrying the *kan*r gene along with the genetic material of interest.
