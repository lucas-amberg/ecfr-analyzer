# ยง 589.1   Substances prohibited from use in animal food or feed.

(a) The substances listed in this part have been prohibited from use in animal food or feed by the Food and Drug Administration because of a determination that they present a potential risk to the public health or have not been shown by adequate scientific data to be safe for use in such food or feed. Use of any of these substances in violation of this part causes the animal food or feed involved to be adulterated and in violation of the Act. 


(b) This part includes only a partial list of substances prohibited from use in animal food or feed; it is for easy reference purposes and is not a complete list of substances that may not lawfully be used in such animal food or feed. No substance may be used in animal food or feed unless it meets all applicable requirements of the Act. 


(c) The Food and Drug Administration either on its own initiative or on behalf of any interested person who has submitted a petition, may publish a proposal to establish, amend, or repeal a regulation under this part on the basis of new scientific evaluation or information. Any such petition shall include an adequate scientific basis to support the petition, shall be the form set forth in ยง 571.1 of this chapter, and will be published in the _Federal Register_ for comment if it contains reasonable ground.
