Tests shall be performed on the final product to determine that it meets the following standards: 


(a) *Protein concentration.* Final product shall conform to one of the following concentrations: 4.0 ±0.25 percent; 5.0 ±0.30 percent; 20.0 ±1.2 percent; and 25.0 ±1.5 percent solution of protein. 


(b) *Protein composition.* At least 96 percent of the total protein in the final product shall be albumin, as determined by a method that has been approved for each manufacturer by the Director, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration. 


(c) *pH.* The pH shall be 6.9 ±0.5 when measured in a solution of the final product diluted to a concentration of 1 percent protein with 0.15 molar sodium chloride.


(d) *Sodium concentration.* The sodium concentration of the final product shall be 130 to 160 milliequivalents per liter.


(e) *Potassium concentration.* The potassium concentration of the final product shall not exceed 2 milliequivalents per liter.


(f) *Heat stability.* A final container sample of Albumin (Human) shall remain unchanged, as determined by visual inspection, after heating at 57 °C for 50 hours, when compared to its control consisting of a sample, from the same lot, which has not undergone this heating.
