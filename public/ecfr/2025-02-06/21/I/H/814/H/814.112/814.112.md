# ยง 814.112   Filing an HDE.

(a) The filing of an HDE means that FDA has made a threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Within 30 days from the date an HDE is received by FDA, the agency will notify the applicant whether the application has been filed. FDA may refuse to file an HDE if any of the following applies:


(1) The application is incomplete because it does not on its face contain all the information required under ยง 814.104(b);


(2) FDA determines that there is a comparable device available (other than another HUD approved under this subpart or a device under an approved IDE) to treat or diagnose the disease or condition for which approval of the HUD is being sought; or


(3) The application contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits material information.


(4) The HDE is not accompanied by a statement of either certification or disclosure, or both, as required by part 54 of this chapter.


(b) The provisions contained in ยง 814.42(b), (c), and (d) regarding notification of filing decisions, filing dates, the start of the 75-day review period, and applicant's options in response to FDA refuse to file decisions shall apply to HDE's.
