Guidance documents that discuss our current thinking on preparing a postmarket surveillance submission and designing a postmarket surveillance plan are available on the Center for Devices and Radiological Health's website, the Food and Drug Administration main website, and from the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Office of Policy, Guidance and Policy Development, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 66, Rm. 5431, Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002. They do not establish legally enforceable rights or responsibilities and do not legally bind you or FDA. You may choose to use an approach other than the one set forth in a guidance document, as long as your alternative approach complies with the relevant statutes (laws) and regulations. If you wish, we will meet with you to discuss whether an alternative approach you are considering will satisfy the requirements of the act and regulations.
