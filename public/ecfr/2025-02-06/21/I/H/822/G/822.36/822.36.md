We may, at a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner, inspect and copy any records pertaining to the conduct of postmarket surveillance that are required to be kept by this regulation. You must be able to produce records and information required by this regulation that are in the possession of others under contract with you to conduct the postmarket surveillance. Those who have signed agreements or are under contract with you must also produce the records and information upon our request.
