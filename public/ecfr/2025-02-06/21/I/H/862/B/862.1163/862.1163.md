# § 862.1163   Cardiac allograft gene expression profiling test system.

(a) *Identification.* A cardiac allograft gene expression profiling test system is a device that measures the ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression level of multiple genes and combines this information to yield a signature (pattern, classifier, index, score) to aid in the identification of a low probability of acute cellular rejection (ACR) in heart transplant recipients with stable allograft function.


(b) *Classification.* Class II (special controls). The special control is FDA's guidance document entitled “Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Cardiac Allograft Gene Expression Profiling Test Systems.” See § 862.1(d) for the availability of this guidance document.
