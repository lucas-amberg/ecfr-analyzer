(b) *Classification.* Class I (general controls). The device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to ยง 862.9. Particular components of TLC systems, i.e., the thin-layer chromatography apparatus, TLC atomizer, TLC developing tanks, and TLC ultraviolet light, are exempt from the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the quality system regulation in part 820 of this chapter, with the exception of ยง 820.180 of this chapter, with respect to general requirements concerning records, and ยง 820.198 of this chapter, with respect to complaint files.
