# ยง 864.7360   Erythrocytic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase assay.

(a) *Identification.* An erythrocytic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase assay is a device used to measure the activity of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase or of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase isoenzymes. The results of this assay are used in the diagnosis and treatment of nonspherocytic congenital hemolytic anemia or drug-induced hemolytic anemia associated with a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. This generic device includes assays based on fluorescence, electrophoresis, methemoglobin reduction, catalase inhibition, and ultraviolet kinetics. 


(b) *Classification.* Class II (performance standards).
