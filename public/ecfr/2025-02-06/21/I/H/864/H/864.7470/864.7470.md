(a) *Identification.* A glycosylated hemoglobin assay is a device used to measure the glycosylated hemoglobins (A_1a_, A_1b_, and A_1c_) in a patient's blood by a column chromatographic procedure. Measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin is used to assess the level of control of a patient's diabetes and to determine the proper insulin dosage for a patient. Elevated levels of glycosylated hemoglobin indicate uncontrolled diabetes in a patient.
