# ยง 864.9165   Blood establishment computer software and accessories.

(a) *Identification.* Blood establishment computer software (BECS) is a device used in the manufacture of blood and blood components to assist in the prevention of disease in humans by identifying ineligible donors, by preventing the release of unsuitable blood and blood components for transfusion or for further manufacturing into products for human treatment or diagnosis, by performing compatibility testing between donor and recipient, or by performing positive identification of patients and blood components at the point of transfusion to prevent transfusion reactions. This generic type of device may include a BECS accessory, a device intended for use with BECS to augment the performance of the BECS or to expand or modify its indications for use.


(b) *Classification.* Class II (special controls). The special controls for these devices are:


(1) Software performance and functional requirements including detailed design specifications (*e.g.,* algorithms or control characteristics, alarms, device limitations, and safety requirements).


(2) Verification and validation testing and hazard analysis must be performed.


(3) Labeling must include:


(i) Software limitations;


(ii) Unresolved anomalies, annotated with an explanation of the impact on safety or effectiveness;


(iii) Revision history; and


(iv) Hardware and peripheral specifications.


(4) Traceability matrix must be performed.


(5) Performance testing to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the system must be performed, including when adding new functional requirements (*e.g.,* electrical safety, electromagnetic compatibility, or wireless coexistence).
