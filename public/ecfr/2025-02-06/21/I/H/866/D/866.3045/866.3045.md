# § 866.3045   In vitro diagnostic device for 

(a) *Identification.* An in vitro diagnostic device for *Bacillus* species (spp.) detection is a prescription device used to detect and differentiate among *Bacillus* spp. and presumptively identify *B. anthracis* and other *Bacillus* spp. from cultured isolates or clinical specimens as an aid in the diagnosis of anthrax and other diseases caused by *Bacillus* spp. This device may consist of *Bacillus* spp. antisera conjugated with a fluorescent dye (immunofluorescent reagents) used to presumptively identify bacillus-like organisms in clinical specimens; bacteriophage used for differentiating *B. anthracis* from other *Bacillus* spp. based on susceptibility to lysis by the phage; or antigens used to identify antibodies to *B. anthracis* (anti-toxin and anti-capsular) in serum. Bacillus infections include anthrax (cutaneous, inhalational, or gastrointestinal) caused by *B. anthracis,* and gastrointestinal disease and non-gastrointestinal infections caused by* B.**cereus.*

(b) *Classification.* Class II (special controls). The special controls are set forth in FDA's special controls guideline document entitled “In Vitro Diagnostic Devices for *Bacillus* spp. Detection; Class II Special Controls Guideline for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.” For availability of the guideline document, see § 866.1(e).


(c) *Restriction on Distribution.* The distribution of these devices is limited to laboratories that follow public health guidelines that address appropriate biosafety conditions, interpretation of test results, and coordination of findings with public health authorities.

This information will not be required on so-called reminder-piece labeling which calls attention to the name of the device but does not include indications or other use information.
