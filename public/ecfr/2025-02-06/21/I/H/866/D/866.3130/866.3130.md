# § 866.3130   Clostridium difficile toxin gene amplification assay.

(a) *Identification.* A *Clostridium difficile* toxin gene amplification assay is a device that consists of reagents for the amplification and detection of target sequences in *Clostridium difficile* toxin genes in fecal specimens from patients suspected of having *Clostridium difficile* infection (CDI). The detection of clostridial toxin genes, in conjunction with other laboratory tests, aids in the clinical laboratory diagnosis of CDI caused by *Clostridium difficile.*

(b) *Classification.* Class II (special controls). The special controls are set forth in FDA's guideline document entitled: “Class II Special Controls Guideline: Toxin Gene Amplification Assays for the Detection of *Clostridium difficile;* Guideline for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.” See § 866.1(e) for information on obtaining this document.
