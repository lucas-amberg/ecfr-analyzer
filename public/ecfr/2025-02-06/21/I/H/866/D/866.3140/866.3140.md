(a) *Identification. Corynebacterium* spp. serological reagents are devices that consist of antisera conjugated with a fluorescent dye used to identify *Corynebacterium* spp. from clinical specimens. The identification aids in the diagnosis of disease caused by bacteria belonging to the genus *Corynebacterium* and provides epidemiological information on diseases caused by these microorganisms. The principal human pathogen of this genus, *Corynebacterium diphtheriae,* causes diphtheria. However, many other types of corynebacteria form part of the normal flora of the human respiratory tract, other mucus membranes, and skin, and are either nonpathogenic or have an uncertain role.


(b) *Classification.* Class I (general controls). The device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to ยง 866.9.
