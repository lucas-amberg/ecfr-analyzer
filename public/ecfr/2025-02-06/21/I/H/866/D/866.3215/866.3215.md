# ยง 866.3215   Device to detect and measure non-microbial analyte(s) in human clinical specimens to aid in assessment of patients with suspected sepsis.

(a) *Identification.* A device to detect and measure non-microbial analyte(s) in human clinical specimens to aid in assessment of patients with suspected sepsis is identified as an in vitro device intended for the detection and qualitative and/or quantitative measurement of one or more non-microbial analytes in human clinical specimens to aid in the assessment of patients with suspected sepsis when used in conjunction with clinical signs and symptoms and other clinical and laboratory findings.


(b) *Classification.* Class II (special controls). The special controls for this device are:


(1) Premarket notification submissions must include the device's detailed Indications for Use statement describing what the device detects and measures, the results provided to the user, whether the measure is qualitative and/or quantitative, the clinical indications for which the test is to be used, and the specific population(s) for which the device use is intended.


(2) Premarket notification submissions must include detailed documentation of the device description, including (as applicable), all device components, software, ancillary reagents required but not provided, explanation of the device principle and methodology, and for molecular devices include detailed documentation of the primer/probe sequence, design, and rationale for sequence selection.


(3) Premarket notification submissions must include detailed documentation of applicable analytical studies, such as, analytical sensitivity (Limit of Detection, Limit of Blank, and Limit of Quantitation), precision, reproducibility, analytical measuring range, interference, cross-reactivity, and specimen stability.


(4) Premarket notification submissions must include detailed documentation of a prospective clinical study or, if appropriate, results from an equivalent sample set. This detailed documentation must include the following information:


(i) Results must demonstrate adequate device performance relative to a well-accepted comparator.


(ii) Clinical sample results must demonstrate consistency of device output throughout the device measuring range likely to be encountered in the Intended Use population.


(iii) Clinical study documentation must include the original study protocol (including predefined statistical analysis plan), study report documenting support for the Indications for Use(s), and results of all statistical analyses.


(5) Premarket notification submissions must include evaluation of the level of the non-microbial analyte in asymptomatic patients with demographic characteristics (*e.g.,* age, racial, ethnic, and gender distribution) similar to the Intended Use population.


(6) As part of the risk management activities performed under 21 CFR 820.30 design controls, you must document an appropriate end user device training program that will be offered as part of your efforts to mitigate the risk of failure to correctly operate the instrument.


(7) A detailed explanation of the interpretation of results and acceptance criteria must be included in the device's 21 CFR 809.10(b)(9) compliant labeling, and a detailed explanation of the interpretation of the limitations of the samples (*e.g.,* collected on day of diagnosis) must be included in the device's 21 CFR 809.10(b)(10) compliant labeling.
