(a) *Identification. Flavobacterium* spp. serological reagents are devices that consist of antigens and antisera used in serological tests to identify *Flavobacteriuim* spp. from cultured isolates derived from clinical specimens. The identification aids in the diagnosis of disease caused by bacteria belonging to the genus *Flavobacterium* and provides epidemiological information on diseases caused by these microorganisms. Most members of this genus are found in soil and water and, under certain conditions, may become pathogenic to humans. *Flavobacterium meningosepticum* is highly virulent for the newborn, in whom it may cause epidemics of septicemia (blood poisoning) and meningitis (inflammation of the membranes of the brain) and is usually attributable to contaminated hospital equipment.


(b) *Classification.* Class I (general controls). The device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to the limitations in ยง 866.9.
