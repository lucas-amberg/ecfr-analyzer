(a) *Identification. Histoplasma capsulatum* serological reagents are devices that consist of antigens and antisera used in serological tests to identify antibodies to *Histoplasma capsulatum* in serum. Additionally, some of these reagents consist of *Histoplasma capsulatum* antisera conjugated with a fluorescent dye (immunofluorescent reagents) used to identify *Histoplasma capsulatum* from clinical specimens or cultured isolates derived from clinical specimens. The identification aids in the diagnosis of histoplasmosis caused by this fungus belonging to the genus *Histoplasma* and provides epidemiological information on the diseases caused by this fungus. Histoplasmosis usually is a mild and often asymptomatic respiratory infection, but in a small number of infected individuals the lesions may spread to practically all tissues and organs.


(b) *Classification.* Class II (special controls). The device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to ยง 866.9.
