(a) *Identification. Leptospira* spp. serological reagents are devices that consist of antigens and antisera used in serological tests to identify antibodies to *Leptospira* spp. in serum or identify *Leptospira* spp. from cultured isolates derived from clinical specimens. Additionally, some of these antisera are conjugated with a fluorescent dye (immunofluorescent reagents) and used to identify *Leptospira* spp. directly from clinical specimens. The identification aids in the diagnosis of leptospirosis caused by bacteria belonging to the genus *Leptospira* and provides epidemiological information on this disease. *Leptospira* infections range from mild fever-producing illnesses to severe liver and kidney involvement producing hemorrhage and dysfunction of these organs.


(b) *Classification.* Class II (special controls). The device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to ยง 866.9.
