(a) *Identification. Listeria* spp. serological reagents are devices that consist of antigens and antisera used in serological tests to identify *Listeria* spp. from cultured isolates derived from clinical specimens. Additionally, some of these reagents consist of *Listeria* spp. antisera conjugated with a fluorescent dye (immunofluorescent reagents) used to identify *Listeria* spp. directly from clinical specimens. The identification aids in the diagnosis of listeriosis, a disease caused by bacteria belonging to the genus *Listeria,* and provides epidemiological information on diseases caused by these microorganisms. *Listeria monocytogenes,* the most common human pathogen of this genus, causes meningitis (inflammation of the brain membranes) and meningoencephalitis (inflammation of the brain and brain membranes) and is often fatal if untreated. A second form of human listeriosis is an intrauterine infection in pregnant women that results in a high mortality rate for infants before or after birth.


(b) *Classification.* Class I (general controls). The device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to ยง 866.9.
