(a) *Identification. Mycoplasma* spp. serological reagents are devices that consist of antigens and antisera used in serological tests to identify antibodies to *Mycoplasma* spp. in serum. Additionally, some of these reagents consist of *Mycoplasma* spp. antisera conjugated with a fluorescent dye (immunofluorescent reagents) used to identify *Mycoplasma* spp. directly from clinical specimens. The identification aids in the diagnosis of disease caused by bacteria belonging to the genus *Mycoplasma* and provides epidemiological information on diseases caused by these microorganisms. *Mycoplasma* spp. are associated with inflammatory conditions of the urinary and respiratory tracts, the genitals, and the mouth. The effects in humans of infection with *Mycoplasma pneumoniae* range from inapparent infection to mild or severe upper respiratory disease, ear infection, and bronchial pneumonia.


(b) *Classification.* Class I (general controls). The device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to ยง 866.9.
