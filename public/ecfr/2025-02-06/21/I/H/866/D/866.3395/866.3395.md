These devices aid in the diagnosis of norovirus infection in the setting of an individual patient with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis when the individual patient is epidemiologically linked to other patients with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis and/or aid in the identification of norovirus as the etiology of an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis in the setting of epidemiologically linked patients with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis.


(b) *Classification.* Class II (special controls). The device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to the limitations in § 866.9. The special control is FDA's guidance document entitled “Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Norovirus Serological Reagents.” See § 866.1(e) for the availability of this guidance document.
