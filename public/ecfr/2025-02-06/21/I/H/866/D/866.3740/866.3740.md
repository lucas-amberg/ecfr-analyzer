(a) *Identification. Streptococcus* spp. serological reagents are devices that consist of antigens and antisera (excluding streptococcal exoenzyme reagents made from enzymes secreted by streptococci) used in serological tests to identify *Streptococcus* spp. from cultured isolates derived from clinical specimens. The identification aids in the diagnosis of diseases caused by bacteria belonging to the genus *Streptococcus* and provides epidemiological information on these diseases. Pathogenic streptococci are associated with infections, such as sore throat, impetigo (an infection characterized by small pustules on the skin), urinary tract infections, rheumatic fever, and kidney disease.


(b) *Classification.* Class I (general controls). The device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to ยง 866.9.
