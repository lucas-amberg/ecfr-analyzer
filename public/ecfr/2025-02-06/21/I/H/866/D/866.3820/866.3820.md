(a) *Identification. Treponema pallidum* nontreponemal test reagents are devices that consist of antigens derived from nontreponemal sources (sources not directly associated with treponemal organisms) and control sera (standardized sera with which test results are compared) used in serological tests to identify reagin, an antibody-like agent, which is produced from the reaction of treponema microorganisms with body tissues. The identification aids in the diagnosis of syphilis caused by microorganisms belonging to the genus *Treponema* and provides epidemiological information on syphilis.
