The detection of trichomonas nucleic acids, in conjunction with other laboratory tests, aids in the clinical laboratory diagnosis of trichomoniasis caused by *Trichomonas vaginalis*.


(b) *Classification.* Class II (special controls). The special controls are set forth in FDA's guideline document entitled: “Class II Special Controls Guideline: Nucleic Acid Amplification Assays for the Detection of *Trichomonas vaginalis;* Guideline for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.” See § 866.1(e) for information on obtaining this document.
