# ยง 866.3970   Device to detect and identify microbial pathogen nucleic acids in cerebrospinal fluid.

(a) *Identification.* A device to detect and identify microbial pathogen nucleic acids in cerebrospinal fluid is a qualitative in vitro device intended for the detection and identification of microbial-associated nucleic acid sequences from patients suspected of meningitis or encephalitis. A device to detect and identify microbial pathogen nucleic acids in cerebrospinal fluid is intended to aid in the diagnosis of meningitis or encephalitis when used in conjunction with clinical signs and symptoms and other clinical and laboratory findings.


(b) *Classification.* Class II (special controls). The special controls for this device are:


(1) Premarket notification submissions must include detailed device description documentation, including the device components, ancillary reagents required but not provided, and a detailed explanation of the methodology, including primer/probe sequence, design, and rationale for sequence selection.


(2) Premarket notification submissions must include detailed documentation from the following analytical studies: Analytical sensitivity (limit of detection), inclusivity, reproducibility, interference, cross reactivity, and specimen stability.


(3) Premarket notification submissions must include detailed documentation from a clinical study. The study, performed on a study population consistent with the intended use population, must compare the device performance to results obtained from well-accepted comparator methods.


(4) Premarket notification submissions must include detailed documentation for device software, including, but not limited to, software applications and hardware-based devices that incorporate software.


(5) The Intended Use statement in the device labeling must include a statement that the device is intended to be used in conjunction with standard of care culture.


(6) A detailed explanation of the interpretation of results and acceptance criteria must be included in the device's 21 CFR 809.10(b)(9) compliant labeling.


(7) The device labeling must include a limitation stating that the negative results do not preclude the possibility of central nervous system infection.


(8) The device labeling must include a limitation stating that device results are not intended to be used as the sole basis for diagnosis, treatment, or other patient management decisions.


(9) The device labeling must include a limitation stating that positive results do not mean that the organism detected is infectious or is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.


(10) As part of the risk management activities performed as part of your 21 CFR 820.30 design controls, you must document an appropriate end user device training program that will be offered as part of your efforts to mitigate the risk of failure to correctly operate the instrument.
