# ยง 866.4830   Rocket immunoelectrophoresis equipment.

(a) *Identification.* Rocket immunoelectrophoresis equipment for clinical use is a device used to perform a specific test on proteins by using a procedure called rocket immunoelectrophoresis. In this procedure, an electric current causes the protein in solution to migrate through agar gel containing specific antisera. The protein precipitates with the antisera in a rocket-shaped pattern, giving the name to the device. The height of the peak (or the area under the peak) is proportional to the concentration of the protein.


(b) *Classification.* Class I (general controls). The device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to the limitations in ยง 866.9.
