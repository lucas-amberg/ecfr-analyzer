# ยง 866.5250   Complement C

(a) *Identification.* A complement C_1_ inhibitor (inactivator) immunological test system is a device that consists of the reagents used to measure by immunochemical techniques the complement C_1_ inhibitor (a plasma protein) in serum. Complement C_1_ inhibitor occurs normally in plasma and blocks the action of the C_1_ component of complement (a group of serum proteins which destroy infectious agents). Measurement of complement C_1_ inhibitor aids in the diagnosis of hereditary angioneurotic edema (increased blood vessel permeability causing swelling of tissues) and a rare form of angioedema associated with lymphoma (lymph node cancer).


(b) *Classification.* Class II (performance standards).
