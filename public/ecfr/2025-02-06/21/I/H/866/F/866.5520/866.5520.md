(a) *Identification.* An immunoglobulin G (Fab fragment specific) immunological test system is a device that consists of the reagents used to measure by immunochemical techniques the Fab antigen-binding fragment resulting from breakdown of immunoglobulin G antibodies in urine, serum, and other body fluids. Measurement of Fab fragments of immunoglobulin G aids in the diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorders, such as multiple myeloma (tumor of bone marrow cells), Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (increased immunoglobulin production by the spleen and bone marrow cells), and lymphoma (tumor of the lymphoid tissues).


(b) *Classification.* Class I (general controls). The device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to the limitations in ยง 866.9.
