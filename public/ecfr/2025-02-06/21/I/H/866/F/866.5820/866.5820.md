# ยง 866.5820   Systemic lupus erythematosus immunological test system.

(a) *Identification.* A systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) immunological test system is a device that consists of the reagents used to measure by immunochemical techniques the autoimmune antibodies in serum and other body fluids that react with cellular nuclear double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or other nuclear constituents that are specifically diagnostic of SLE. Measurement of nuclear double-stranded DNA antibodies aids in the diagnosis of SLE (a multisystem autoimmune disease in which tissues are attacked by the person's own antibodies).


(b) *Classification.* Class II (performance standards).
