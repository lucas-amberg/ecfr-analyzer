# ยง 870.2200   Adjunctive cardiovascular status indicator.

(a) *Identification.* The adjunctive cardiovascular status indicator is a prescription device based on sensor technology for the measurement of a physical parameter(s). This device is intended for adjunctive use with other physical vital sign parameters and patient information and is not intended to independently direct therapy.


(b) *Classification.* Class II (special controls). The special controls for this device are:


(1) Software description, verification, and validation based on comprehensive hazard analysis must be provided, including:


(i) Full characterization of technical parameters of the software, including any proprietary algorithm(s);


(ii) Description of the expected impact of all applicable sensor acquisition hardware characteristics on performance and any associated hardware specifications;


(iii) Specification of acceptable incoming sensor data quality control measures; and


(iv) Mitigation of impact of user error or failure of any subsystem components (signal detection and analysis, data display, and storage) on accuracy of patient reports.


(2) Scientific justification for the validity of the status indicator algorithm(s) must be provided. Verification of algorithm calculations and validation testing of the algorithm using a data set separate from the training data must demonstrate the validity of modeling.


(3) Usability assessment must be provided to demonstrate that risk of misinterpretation of the status indicator is appropriately mitigated.


(4) Clinical data must be provided in support of the intended use and include the following:


(i) Output measure(s) must be compared to an acceptable reference method to demonstrate that the output measure(s) represent(s) the predictive measure(s) that the device provides in an accurate and reproducible manner;


(ii) The data set must be representative of the intended use population for the device. Any selection criteria or limitations of the samples must be fully described and justified;


(iii) Agreement of the measure(s) with the reference measure(s) must be assessed across the full measurement range; and


(iv) Data must be provided within the clinical validation study or using equivalent datasets to demonstrate the consistency of the output and be representative of the range of data sources and data quality likely to be encountered in the intended use population and relevant use conditions in the intended use environment.


(5) Labeling must include the following:


(i) The type of sensor data used, including specification of compatible sensors for data acquisition;


(ii) A description of what the device measures and outputs to the user;


(iii) Warnings identifying sensor reading acquisition factors that may impact measurement results;


(iv) Guidance for interpretation of the measurements, including warning(s) specifying adjunctive use of the measurements;


(v) Key assumptions made in the calculation and determination of measurements;


(vi) The measurement performance of the device for all presented parameters, with appropriate confidence intervals, and the supporting evidence for this performance; and


(vii) A detailed description of the patients studied in the clinical validation (*e.g.,* age, gender, race/ethnicity, clinical stability) as well as procedural details of the clinical study.
