# ยง 870.5600   Adjunctive open loop fluid therapy recommender.

(a) *Identification.* The adjunctive open loop fluid therapy recommender is a prescription device that uses software algorithms to analyze cardiovascular vital signs and predict a patient's estimated response to fluid therapy. The device is intended for adjunctive use with other physical vital sign parameters and patient information and is not intended to independently direct therapy.


(b) *Classification.* Class II (special controls). The special controls for this device are:


(1) Clinical performance testing under anticipated conditions of use must fulfill the following:


(i) A summary of the clinical performance testing must include the relevant patient demographics, and any statistical techniques used for analyzing the data;


(ii) Subjects must be representative of the intended use population for the device. Any selection criteria or sample limitations must be fully described and justified;


(iii) Testing must demonstrate the recommendation consistency using the expected range of data sources and data quality encountered in the intended patients, users, and environments; and


(iv) Testing must evaluate the relationship between algorithm recommendations, therapeutic actions, and predicted physiological event or status.


(2) A software description and the results of verification and validation testing based on a comprehensive hazard analysis and risk assessment must be provided, including:


(i) A full characterization of the software technical parameters, including algorithms;


(ii) A description of the expected recommendation, accounting for differences in patient condition and environment;


(iii) A description of all mitigations for user error or failure of any subsystem components (including signal detection, signal analysis, data display, and storage) that affect the device's recommendations;


(iv) A characterization of algorithm sensitivity to variations in user inputs;


(v) A characterization of sensor accuracy and performance;


(vi) A description of sensor data quality control measures; and


(vii) Safeguards to reduce the possibility of fluid overload.


(3) A scientific justification for the validity of the algorithm(s) must be provided. This justification must include non-clinical verification and validation of the algorithm calculations and clinical validation using an independent data set.


(4) A human factors and usability engineering assessment must be provided.


(5) Labeling must include:


(i) A description of what the device measures, how the device decides to issue recommendations, and the expected range of frequency of recommendations, while accounting for differences in patient condition and environment;


(ii) Detailed information regarding limitations of the device's algorithm, and key assumptions made when the device issues a recommendation;


(iii) Warnings identifying sensor acquisition factors that may impact measurement results;


(iv) Warnings identifying user errors that affect the device's recommendations;


(v) Detailed information regarding the expected impact of user input errors on the device recommendations;


(vi) Guidance for interpretation of the device's recommendations, including a description that the recommendation is adjunctive to other physical vital sign parameters and patient information;


(vii) Description of the impact of the compatible sensor(s) on the device's performance;


(viii) The expected performance of the device for all intended patients, users, and environments;


(ix) Relevant characteristics of the patients studied in the clinical validation (such as age, gender, race or ethnicity, and patient condition) and a summary of validation results; and


(x) Description of the software safeguards that are in place to prevent fluid overload, and description of any limitation of the software safeguards.
