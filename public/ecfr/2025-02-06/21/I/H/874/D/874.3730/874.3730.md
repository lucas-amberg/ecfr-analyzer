# ยง 874.3730   Laryngeal prosthesis (Taub design).

The device is interposed between openings in the trachea and the esophagus and may be removed and replaced each day by the patient. During phonation, air from the lungs is directed to flow through the device and over the esophageal mucosa to provide a sound source that is articulated as speech.


(b) *Classification.* Class II (special controls). The device, when it is a voice amplification device, is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to the limitations in ยง 874.9.
