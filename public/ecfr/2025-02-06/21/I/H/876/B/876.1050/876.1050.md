# ยง 876.1050   Endoscopic transhepatic venous access needle.

(a) *Identification.* An endoscopic transhepatic venous access needle is inserted through the liver into the patient's portal/hepatic venous system under endoscopic ultrasound guidance. It is connected to a separate device intended to measure a physiological parameter.


(b) *Classification.* Class II (special controls). The special controls for this device are:


(1) The patient-contacting components of the device must be demonstrated to be biocompatible.


(2) Performance data must demonstrate the sterility of the patient-contacting components of the device.


(3) The patient-contacting components of the device must be demonstrated to be non-pyrogenic.


(4) Performance testing must support the shelf life of device components provided sterile by demonstrating continued sterility and package integrity over the labeled shelf life.


(5) Non-clinical performance testing must demonstrate that the device performs as intended under anticipated conditions of use. The following must be tested:


(i) Needle crumple testing;


(ii) Tensile testing;


(iii) Dimensional verification for all components; and


(iv) Simulated use testing.


(6) Labeling must include the following:


(i) Instructions for use, including specific instructions regarding device preparation;


(ii) The recommended training for safe use of the device; and


(iii) A shelf life for any sterile components.
