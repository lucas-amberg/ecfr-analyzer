# ยง 882.4950   Diagnostic neurosurgical microscope filter.

(a) *Identification.* A diagnostic neurosurgical microscope filter is a device intended for use during neurosurgery to visualize fluorescence and enhance visualization of tissue associated with a specific disease or condition.


(b) *Classification.* Class II (special controls). The special controls for this device are:


(1) Non-clinical performance testing must demonstrate that the device performs as intended under anticipated conditions of use, and verify and validate filter specifications and functional characteristics, including the following:


(i) Spectrum and intensity of the illumination source;


(ii) Spectrum of the excitation and emission filter modules when integrated in the surgical operating microscope;


(iii) Excitation power and power density;


(iv) Optical path loss from illumination source to objective lens or microscope camera;


(v) Homogeneity of the excitation light at the focal plane;


(vi) Fluorescence detection sensitivity;


(vii) Verification of calibration or preoperative procedures; and


(viii) If camera-based, spectral sensitivity of the camera.


(2) Labeling must include:


(i) Identification of the filter characteristics in conjunction with a compatible surgical operating microscope, to include the following:


(A) Illumination spectrum and power density; and


(B) Excitation and emission filter spectra.


(ii) Instructions for calibration or preoperative checks to ensure device functionality prior to each use;


(iii) Instructions for use with compatible surgical operating microscopes, external light sources, and cameras;


(iv) A warning that the device should only be used with fluorophores approved for use within the specified spectral ranges; and


(v) A warning that the device is not a standalone diagnostic.
