# ยง 882.5860   Implanted neuromuscular stimulator.

(a) *Identification.* An implanted neuromuscular stimulator is a device that provides electrical stimulation to a patient's peroneal or femoral nerve to cause muscles in the leg to contract, thus improving the gait in a patient with a paralyzed leg. The stimulator consists of an implanted receiver with electrodes that are placed around a patient's nerve and an external transmitter for transmitting the stimulating pulses across the patient's skin to the implanted receiver. The external transmitter is activated by a switch in the heel in the patient's shoe. 


(b) *Classification.* Class III (premarket approval). 


(c) *Date PMA or notice of completion of PDP is required.* A PMA or notice of completion of a PDP for a device described in paragraph (b) of this section is required to be filed with the Food and Drug Administration on or before July 13, 1999 for any implanted neuromuscular stimulator that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or that has, on or before July 13, 1999, been found to be substantially equivalent to an implanted neuromuscular stimulator that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. Any other implanted neuromuscular stimulator shall have an approved PMA or declared completed PDP in effect before being placed in commercial distribution.
