# § 884.4150   Bipolar endoscopic coagulator-cutter and accessories.

(a) *Identification.* A bipolar endoscopic coagulator-cutter is a device used to perform female sterilization and other operative procedures under endoscopic observation. It destroys tissue with high temperatures by directing a high frequency electrical current through tissue between two electrical contacts of a probe. This generic type of device may include the following accessories: an electrical generator, probes, and electrical cables. 


(b) *Classification.* Class II. The special controls for this device are: 


(1) FDA's: 


(i) “Use of International Standard ISO 10993 ‘Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices—Part I: Evaluation and Testing,’ ” 


(ii) “510(k) Sterility Review Guidance 2/12/90 (K-90),” and 


(iii) “Guidance (‘Guidelines’) for Evaluation of Laproscopic Bipolar and Thermal Coagulators (and Accessories),” 


(2) International Electrotechnical Commission's IEC 60601-1-AM2 (1995-03), Amendment 2, “Medical Electrical Equipment—Part 1: General Requirements for Safety,” 


(3) American National Standards Institute/American Association for Medical Instrumentation's HF-18, 1993, “Electrosurgical Devices,” 


(4) Labeling: 


(i) Indication: For female tubal sterilization, and 


(ii) Instructions for use: 


(A) Destroy at least 2 centimeters of the fallopian tubes, 


(B) Use a cut or undampened sinusoidal waveform, 


(C) Use a minimum power of 25 watts, and 


(D) For devices with ammeters: continue electrode activation for 5 seconds after the visual endpoint (tissue blanching) is reached or current flow ceases indicating adequate tissue destruction.
