# ยง 886.1840   Simulatan (including crossed cylinder).

(a) *Identification.* A simulatan (including crossed cylinder) is a device that is a set of pairs of cylinder lenses that provides various equal plus and minus refractive strengths. The lenses are arranged so that the user can exchange the positions of plus and minus cylinder lenses of equal strengths. The device is intended for subjective refraction (refraction in which the patient judges whether a given object is clearly in focus, as the examiner uses different lenses). 


(b) *Classification.* Class I (general controls). The device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter, subject to the limitations in ยง 886.9. The device is also exempt from the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the quality system regulation in part 820 of this chapter, with the exception of ยง 820.180, with respect to general requirements concerning records, and ยง 820.198, with respect to complaint files.
