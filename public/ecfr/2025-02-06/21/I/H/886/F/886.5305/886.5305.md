# ยง 886.5305   Electromechanical tear stimulator.

(a) *Identification.* An electromechanical tear stimulator is a non-implantable device intended to increase tear production via mechanical stimulation.


(b) *Classification.* Class II (special controls). The special controls for this device are:


(1) Clinical performance testing under anticipated conditions of use must evaluate tear production and all adverse events, including tissue damage, pain, headache, and discomfort.


(2) Non-clinical performance testing must demonstrate that the device performs as intended under anticipated conditions of use. The following must be conducted:


(i) An assessment of mechanical output specifications, including vibration amplitude and frequency, pressure and force, and acoustic (noise level) properties;


(ii) Mechanical safety testing to validate safeguards related to the pressure aspects of the device; and


(iii) Use life testing.


(3) Performance data must demonstrate the electrical safety, thermal safety, and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of all electrical components of the device.


(4) All patient-contacting components of the device must be demonstrated to be biocompatible.


(5) Software verification, validation, and hazard analysis must be performed.


(6) Physician and patient labeling must include:


(i) A detailed summary of the device's technical parameters;


(ii) Instructions for use, including an explanation of all user-interface components and information regarding proper device placement;


(iii) Information related to electromagnetic compatibility classification;


(iv) Instructions on how to clean and maintain the device;


(v) A summary of the clinical performance testing conducted with the device;


(vi) Language to direct end users to contact the device manufacturer and MedWatch if they experience any adverse events with this device; and


(vii) Information on how the device operates and the typical sensations experienced during treatment.
