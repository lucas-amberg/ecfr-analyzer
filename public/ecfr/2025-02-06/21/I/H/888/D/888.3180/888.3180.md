# ยง 888.3180   Elbow joint humeral (hemi-elbow) metallic uncemented prosthesis.

(a) *Identification.* An elbow joint humeral (hemi-elbow) metallic uncemented prosthesis is a device intended to be implanted made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, that is used to replace the distal end of the humerus formed by the trochlea humeri and the capitulum humeri. The generic type of device is limited to prostheses intended for use without bone cement (ยง 888.3027). 


(b) *Classification.* Class III. 


(c) *Date PMA or notice of completion of a PDP is required.* A PMA or a notice of completion of a PDP is required to be filed with the Food and Drug Administration on or before December 26, 1996 for any elbow joint humeral (hemi-elbow) metallic uncemented prosthesis that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or that has, on or before December 26, 1996 been found to be substantially equivalent to an elbow joint humeral (hemi-elbow) metallic uncemented prosthesis that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. Any other elbow joint humeral (hemi-elbow) metallic uncemented prosthesis shall have an approved PMA or a declared completed PDP in effect before being placed in commercial distribution.
