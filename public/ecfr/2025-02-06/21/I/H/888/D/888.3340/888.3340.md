# ยง 888.3340   Hip joint metal/composite semi-constrained cemented prosthesis.

(a) *Identification.* A hip joint metal/composite semi-constrained cemented prosthesis is a two-part device intended to be implanted to replace a hip joint. The device limits translation and rotation in one or more planes via the geometry of its articulating surfaces. It has no linkage across-the-joint. This generic type of device includes prostheses that consist of a femoral component made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, and an acetabular component made of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene with carbon fibers composite. Both components are intended for use with bone cement (ยง 888.3027). 


(b) *Classification.* Class II.
