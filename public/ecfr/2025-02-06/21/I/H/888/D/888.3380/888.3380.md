# ยง 888.3380   Hip joint femoral (hemi-hip) trunnion-bearing metal/polyacetal cemented prosthesis.

(a) *Identification.* A hip joint femoral (hemi-hip) trunnion-bearing metal/polyacetal cemented prosthesis is a two-part device intended to be implanted to replace the head and neck of the femur. This generic type of device includes prostheses that consist of a metallic stem made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, with an integrated cylindrical trunnion bearing at the upper end of the stem that fits into a recess in the head of the device. The head of the device is made of polyacetal (polyoxymethylene) and it is covered by a metallic alloy, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum. The trunnion bearing allows the head of the device to rotate on its stem. The prosthesis is intended for use with bone cement (ยง 888.3027). 


(b) *Classification.* Class III. 


(c) *Date PMA or notice of completion of a PDP is required.* A PMA or a notice of completion of a PDP is required to be filed with the Food and Drug Administration on or before December 26, 1996 for any hip joint femoral (hemi-hip) trunnion-bearing metal/polyacetal cemented prosthesis that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or that has, on or before December 26, 1996 been found to be substantially equivalent to a hip joint femoral (hemi-hip) trunnion-bearing metal/polyacetal cemented prosthesis that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. Any other hip joint femoral (hemi-hip) trunnion-bearing metal/polyacetal cemented prosthesis shall have an approved PMA or a declared completed PDP in effect before being placed in commercial distribution.
