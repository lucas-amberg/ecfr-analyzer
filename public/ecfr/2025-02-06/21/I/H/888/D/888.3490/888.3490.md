# ยง 888.3490   Knee joint femorotibial metal/composite non-constrained cemented prosthesis.

(a) *Identification.* A knee joint femorotibial metal/composite non-constrained cemented prosthesis is a device intended to be implanted to replace part of a knee joint. The device limits minimally (less than normal anatomic constraints) translation in one or more planes. It has no linkage across-the-joint. This generic type of device includes prostheses that have a femoral condylar resurfacing component or components made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, and a tibial condylar component or components made of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene with carbon fibers composite and are intended for use with bone cement (ยง 888.3027). 


(b) *Classification.* Class II.
