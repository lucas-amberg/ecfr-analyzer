# ยง 888.3590   Knee joint tibial (hemi-knee) metallic resurfacing uncemented prosthesis.

(a) *Identification.* A knee joint tibial (hemi-knee) metallic resurfacing uncemented prosthesis is a device intended to be implanted to replace part of a knee joint. The device limits minimally (less than normal anatomic constraints) translation in one or more planes. It has no linkage across-the-joint. This prosthesis is made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, and is intended to resurface one tibial condyle. The generic type of device is limited to those prostheses intended for use without bone cement (ยง 888.3027). 


(b) *Classification.* Class II.
