(a) *Identification.* A shoulder joint glenoid (hemi-shoulder) metallic cemented prosthesis is a device that has a glenoid (socket) component made of alloys, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum, or alloys with ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene and intended to be implanted to replace part of a shoulder joint. This generic type of device is limited to those prostheses intended for use with bone cement (ยง 888.3027). 


(b) *Classification.* Class III. 


(c) *Date PMA or notice of completion of a PDP is required.* A PMA or a notice of completion of a PDP is required to be filed with the Food and Drug Administration on or before December 26, 1996 for any shoulder joint glenoid (hemi-shoulder) metallic cemented prosthesis that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or that has, on or before December 26, 1996 been found to be substantially equivalent to a shoulder joint glenoid (hemi-shoulder) metallic cemented prosthesis that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976.
