# ยง 892.1000   Magnetic resonance diagnostic device.

(a) *Identification.* A magnetic resonance diagnostic device is intended for general diagnostic use to present images which reflect the spatial distribution and/or magnetic resonance spectra which reflect frequency and distribution of nuclei exhibiting nuclear magnetic resonance. Other physical parameters derived from the images and/or spectra may also be produced. The device includes hydrogen-1 (proton) imaging, sodium-23 imaging, hydrogen-1 spectroscopy, phosphorus-31 spectroscopy, and chemical shift imaging (preserving simultaneous frequency and spatial information). 


(b) *Classification.* Class II (special controls). A magnetic resonance imaging disposable kit intended for use with a magnetic resonance diagnostic device only is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to the limitations in ยง 892.9.
