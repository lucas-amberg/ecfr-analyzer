(iv) If the mammography report identifies the breast density as โThe breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small massesโ or โThe breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography,โ the lay summary shall include the statement โBreast tissue can be either dense or not dense. Dense tissue makes it harder to find breast cancer on a mammogram and also raises the risk of developing breast cancer. Your breast tissue is dense. In some people with dense tissue, other imaging tests in addition to a mammogram may help find cancers. Talk to your healthcare provider about breast density, risks for breast cancer, and your individual situation.โ




(3) *Communication of mammography results to health care providers.* When the patient has a referring health care provider or the patient has named a health care provider, the facility shall:
