# § 1107.18   Required content and format of an SE Report.

(a) *Overview.* The SE Report must provide information uniquely identifying the new tobacco product and the predicate tobacco product, and compare the new tobacco product to either a tobacco product commercially marketed (other than for test marketing) in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or a tobacco product that FDA previously found to be substantially equivalent. The SE Report must provide sufficient information as described in this section to enable FDA to determine whether the new tobacco product is substantially equivalent to a tobacco product that was commercially marketed (other than for test marketing) in the United States as of February 15, 2007. If FDA cites deficiencies and requests information to support a statement in the SE Report, the applicant must provide that information for review to continue, or FDA may issue an order under § 1107.48. FDA generally intends to refuse to accept an SE Report for review if it does not comply with § 1105.10 and this section. The SE Report must contain the following information:


(1) General information (as described in paragraph (c) of this section);


(2) Summary (as described in paragraph (d) of this section);


(3) New tobacco product description (as described in paragraph (e) of this section);


(4) Predicate tobacco product description (as described in paragraph (f) of this section), including a statement that the predicate tobacco product has not been removed from the market at the initiative of FDA and has not been determined by judicial order to be adulterated or misbranded, and the submission tracking number of the SE order finding the predicate product SE, or the submission tracking number of, or information to support, that the predicate tobacco product was commercially marketed (other than for test marketing) in the United States as of February 15, 2007;


(5) Comparison information (as described in paragraph (g) of this section);


(6) Comparative testing information (as described in paragraph (h) of this section);


(7) Statement of compliance with applicable tobacco product standards (as described in paragraph (i) of this section);


(8) Health information summary or statement that such information will be made available upon request (as described in paragraph (j) of this section);


(9) Compliance with part 25 of this chapter (as described in paragraph (k) of this section); and


(10) Certification statement (as described in paragraph (*l*) of this section).


(b) *Format.* The applicant must submit the SE Report using the form(s) that FDA provides. The SE Report must contain a comprehensive index and table of contents, be well-organized and legible, and be written in English. As described in § 1107.62, the applicant must submit the SE Report and all information supporting the SE Report in an electronic format that FDA can process, read, review, and archive, unless FDA has provided a waiver under § 1107.62(b).


(c) *General information.* The SE Report must include the following information, using the form FDA provides:


(1) The date the SE Report is submitted;


(2) Type of submission (*e.g.,* the SE Report or amendment to a report);


(3) FDA STN, if previously assigned;


(4) Any other relevant FDA STN, such as a voluntary request for a determination that a tobacco product was commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or SE Report previously found substantially equivalent (if applicable), and cross-references to meetings with FDA regarding the new tobacco product;


(5) Applicant name, address, and contact information (including email address);


(6) Authorized representative or U.S. agent (for a foreign applicant), including the name, address, and contact information (including email address);

(i) Manufacturer;


(ii) Product name, including the brand and sub brand (or other commercial name used in commercial distribution); and


(iii) Product category, product subcategory, and product properties (if the product does not have a listed product property, *e.g.,* ventilation or characterizing flavor, the report must state “none” for that property) as provided in the following table:


(8) Address and the FDA Establishment Identifier number(s) of the establishments involved in the manufacture and/or importation of the new and predicate tobacco products.


(d) *Summary.* The SE Report must include a summary at the beginning of the SE Report that includes the following:


(1) A concise description of the characteristics of the new tobacco product;


(2) A statement as to whether the applicant believes the new tobacco product has the same characteristics as the predicate tobacco product or has different characteristics but any differences in characteristics do not cause the new tobacco product to raise different questions of public health; and


(3) A concise description of the similarities and differences between the new tobacco product and the predicate tobacco product with respect to their characteristics (materials, ingredients, design, composition, heating source, or other features).


(e) *New tobacco product description.* The applicant must identify one new tobacco product in the SE Report for comparison to one predicate tobacco product. The SE Report must describe the new tobacco product in sufficient detail to enable FDA to evaluate its characteristics. This part of the SE Report must include:


(1) A narrative description of the new tobacco product and detailed drawings or schematics of the new tobacco product, including its container closure system, illustrating all components or parts of the product. For a portioned tobacco product, the SE Report must also include a diagram illustrating all components or parts of the individual unit of use;


(2) A description and the function of each component or part of the new tobacco product, and an explanation of how each component or part is integrated into the design of the new tobacco product; and


(3) A concise overview of the process used to manufacture the new tobacco product. If the manufacturing process for the new tobacco product does not affect the characteristics of the new tobacco product beyond what is described elsewhere in the SE Report, an applicant must state that to satisfy this provision.


(f) *Description of predicate tobacco product.* (1) The applicant must identify a predicate tobacco product that is either a tobacco product commercially marketed (other than for test marketing) as of February 15, 2007, or a tobacco product that FDA previously found to be substantially equivalent.


(2) A tobacco product to which a new tobacco product is compared must:
