Comparison testing must be conducted on a sufficient sample size and on test samples that reflect the finished tobacco product composition and design. The SE report must state whether the same test methods were used for the new tobacco product and the predicate product, and if the methods differed, an explanation as to how the results of the different test methods can be compared. The SE report must identify national and international standards used to test the new and predicate tobacco products and explain any deviations from the standard, or state that no standards were used for the testing. The SE report must include the following:

(g) *Applicant's basis for substantial equivalence determination.* The applicant must state that the new tobacco product has either:


(1) The same characteristics as the predicate tobacco product and the basis for this determination, or


(2) Different characteristics than the predicate tobacco product. Where an applicant states that its new tobacco product has different characteristics than the predicate tobacco product, the applicant must also include an explanation as to why a difference in any of the following characteristics do not cause the new product to raise different questions of public health: Product design (paragraph (a) of this section); heating source (paragraph (b) of this section); materials and ingredients (paragraph (c) of this section); and other features (paragraph (d) of this section). In addition, to demonstrate that a new tobacco product is substantially equivalent, an applicant must also explain why any differences in the manufacturing process between the new tobacco product and the predicate tobacco product would not change the characteristics of the new tobacco product such that the new tobacco product could raise different questions of public health (ยง 1107.18(e)). Similarly, for smokeless tobacco products and tobacco products that contain fermented tobacco, an applicant must explain why any difference in stability between the new tobacco product and the predicate tobacco product does not cause the new tobacco product to raise different questions of public health (paragraph (f) of this section).


(h) *Comparison to original predicate tobacco product.* If the applicant is comparing the new tobacco product to a predicate tobacco product that FDA has previously found to be substantially equivalent, FDA may request that the applicant include information related to the original predicate tobacco product that was commercially marketed (other than for test marketing) in the United States as of February 15, 2007, even if that original predicate tobacco product is back several predicate tobacco products. FDA will request this information when necessary to ensure that any order the Agency issues finding the new tobacco product substantially equivalent complies with section 910(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. FDA may need to review the first SE Report that received a finding of substantial equivalence using the original predicate tobacco product as a predicate tobacco product in order to make this finding.
