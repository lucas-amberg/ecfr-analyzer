# ยง 1141.1   Scope.

(a) This part sets forth the requirements for the display of required warnings on cigarette packages and in advertisements for cigarettes.


(b) The requirements of this part do not apply to manufacturers or distributors of cigarettes that do not manufacture, package, or import cigarettes for sale or distribution within the United States.


(c) A cigarette retailer will not be in violation of ยง 1141.10 for packaging that:


(1) Contains a warning;


(2) Is supplied to the retailer by a license- or permit-holding tobacco product manufacturer, or distributor; and


(3) Is not altered by the retailer in a way that is material to the requirements of section 4 of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (15 U.S.C. 1333) or this part.


(d) Section 1141.10(d) applies to a cigarette retailer only if that retailer is responsible for or directs the warnings required under ยง 1141.10 for advertising. However, this paragraph (d) does not relieve a retailer of liability if the retailer displays, in a location open to the public, an advertisement that does not contain a warning or has been altered by the retailer in a way that is material to the requirements of section 4 of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act or this part.
