# § 1250.84   Water in galleys and medical care spaces.

(a) Potable water, hot and cold, shall be available in the galley and pantry except that, when potable water storage is inadequate, nonpotable water may be piped to the galley for deck washing and in connection with garbage disposal. Any tap discharging nonpotable water which is installed for deck washing purposes shall not be more than 18 inches above the deck and shall be distinctly marked “For deck washing only”. 


(b) In the case of existing vessels on which heat treated wash water has been used for the washing of utensils prior to the effective date of the regulations in this part, such water may continue to be so used provided controls are employed to insure the heating of all water to at least 170 °F before discharge from the heater. 


(c) Potable water, hot and cold, shall be available in medical care spaces for hand-washing and for medical care purposes excluding hydrotherapy.
