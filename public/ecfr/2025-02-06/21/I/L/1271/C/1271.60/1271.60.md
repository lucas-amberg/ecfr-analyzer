# § 1271.60   What quarantine and other requirements apply before the donor-eligibility determination is complete?

(a) *Quarantine.* You must keep an HCT/P in quarantine, as defined in § 1271.3(q), until completion of the donor-eligibility determination required by § 1271.50. You must quarantine semen from anonymous donors until the retesting required under § 1271.85(d) is complete.


(b) *Identification of HCT/Ps in quarantine.* You must clearly identify as quarantined an HCT/P that is in quarantine pending completion of a donor-eligibility determination. The quarantined HCT/P must be easily distinguishable from HCT/Ps that are available for release and distribution.


(c) *Shipping of HCT/Ps in quarantine.* If you ship an HCT/P before completion of the donor-eligibility determination, you must keep it in quarantine during shipment. The HCT/P must be accompanied by records:


(1) Identifying the donor (e.g., by a distinct identification code affixed to the HCT/P container);


(2) Stating that the donor-eligibility determination has not been completed; and


(3) Stating that the product must not be implanted, transplanted, infused, or transferred until completion of the donor-eligibility determination, except under the terms of paragraph (d) of this section.


(d) *Use in cases of urgent medical need.* (1) This subpart C does not prohibit the implantation, transplantation, infusion, or transfer of an HCT/P from a donor for whom the donor-eligibility determination is not complete if there is a documented urgent medical need for the HCT/P, as defined in § 1271.3(u).


(2) If you make an HCT/P available for use under the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, you must prominently label it “NOT EVALUATED FOR INFECTIOUS SUBSTANCES,” and “ WARNING: Advise patient of communicable disease risks.” The following information must accompany the HCT/P:


(i) The results of any donor screening required under § 1271.75 that has been completed;


(ii) The results of any testing required under § 1271.80 or 1271.85 that has been completed; and


(iii) A list of any screening or testing required under § 1271.75, 1271.80 or 1271.85 that has not yet been completed.


(3) If you are the establishment that manufactured an HCT/P used under the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, you must document that you notified the physician using the HCT/P that the testing and screening were not complete.


(4) In the case of an HCT/P used for an urgent medical need under the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, you must complete the donor-eligibility determination during or after the use of the HCT/P, and you must inform the physician of the results of the determination.
