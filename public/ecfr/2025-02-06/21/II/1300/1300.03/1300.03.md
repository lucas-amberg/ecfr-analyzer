# § 1300.03   Definitions relating to electronic orders for controlled substances and electronic prescriptions for controlled substances.

For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings specified:


*Application service provider* means an entity that sells electronic prescription or pharmacy applications as a hosted service, where the entity controls access to the application and maintains the software and records on its servers.


*Audit trail* means a record showing who has accessed an information technology application and what operations the user performed during a given period.


*Authentication* means verifying the identity of the user as a prerequisite to allowing access to the information application.


*Authentication protocol* means a well specified message exchange process that verifies possession of a token to remotely authenticate a person to an application.


*Biometric authentication* means authentication based on measurement of the individual's physical features or repeatable actions where those features or actions are both distinctive to the individual and measurable.


*Biometric subsystem* means the hardware and software used to capture, store, and compare biometric data. The biometric subsystem may be part of a larger application. The biometric subsystem is an automated system capable of:


(1) Capturing a biometric sample from an end user.


(2) Extracting and processing the biometric data from that sample.


(3) Storing the extracted information in a database.


(4) Comparing the biometric data with data contained in one or more reference databases.


(5) Determining how well the stored data matches the newly captured data and indicating whether an identification or verification of identity has been achieved.


*Cache* means to download and store information on a local server or hard drive.


*Certificate policy* means a named set of rules that sets forth the applicability of the specific digital certificate to a particular community or class of application with common security requirements.


*Certificate revocation list (CRL)* means a list of revoked, but unexpired certificates issued by a certification authority.


*Certification authority (CA)* means an organization that is responsible for verifying the identity of applicants, authorizing and issuing a digital certificate, maintaining a directory of public keys, and maintaining a Certificate Revocation List.


*Certified information systems auditor (CISA)* means an individual who has been certified by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association as qualified to audit information systems and who performs compliance audits as a regular ongoing business activity.


*Credential* means an object or data structure that authoritatively binds an identity (and optionally, additional attributes) to a token possessed and controlled by a person.


*Credential service provider (CSP)* means a trusted entity that issues or registers tokens and issues electronic credentials to individuals. The CSP may be an independent third party or may issue credentials for its own use.


*CSOS* means controlled substance ordering system.


*Digital certificate* means a data record that, at a minimum—


(1) Identifies the certification authority issuing it;


(2) Names or otherwise identifies the certificate holder;


(3) Contains a public key that corresponds to a private key under the sole control of the certificate holder;


(4) Identifies the operational period; and


(5) Contains a serial number and is digitally signed by the certification authority issuing it.


*Digital signature* means a record created when a file is algorithmically transformed into a fixed length digest that is then encrypted using an asymmetric cryptographic private key associated with a digital certificate. The combination of the encryption and algorithm transformation ensure that the signer's identity and the integrity of the file can be confirmed.


*Digitally sign* means to affix a digital signature to a data file.


*Electronic prescription* means a prescription that is generated on an electronic application and transmitted as an electronic data file.


*Electronic prescription application provider* means an entity that develops or markets electronic prescription software either as a stand-alone application or as a module in an electronic health record application.


*Electronic signature* means a method of signing an electronic message that identifies a particular person as the source of the message and indicates the person's approval of the information contained in the message.


*False match rate* means the rate at which an impostor's biometric is falsely accepted as being that of an authorized user. It is one of the statistics used to measure biometric performance when operating in the verification or authentication task. The false match rate is similar to the false accept (or acceptance) rate.


*False non-match rate* means the rate at which a genuine user's biometric is falsely rejected when the user's biometric data fail to match the enrolled data for the user. It is one of the statistics used to measure biometric performance when operating in the verification or authentication task. The false match rate is similar to the false reject (or rejection) rate, except that it does not include the rate at which a biometric system fails to acquire a biometric sample from a genuine user.


*FIPS* means Federal Information Processing Standards. These Federal standards, as incorporated by reference in § 1311.08 of this chapter, prescribe specific performance requirements, practices, formats, communications protocols, etc., for hardware, software, data, etc.

*FIPS 180-2,* as incorporated by reference in § 1311.08 of this chapter, means the National Institute of Standards and Technology publication entitled “Secure Hash Standard,” a Federal secure hash standard.


*FIPS 180-3,* as incorporated by reference in § 1311.08 of this chapter, means the National Institute of Standards and Technology publication entitled “Secure Hash Standard (SHS),” a Federal secure hash standard.


*FIPS 186-2,* as incorporated by reference in § 1311.08 of this chapter, means the National Institute of Standards and Technology publication entitled “Digital Signature Standard,” a Federal standard for applications used to generate and rely upon digital signatures.


*FIPS 186-3,* as incorporated by reference in § 1311.08 of this chapter, means the National Institute of Standards and Technology publication entitled “Digital Signature Standard (DSS),” a Federal standard for applications used to generate and rely upon digital signatures.


*Hard token* means a cryptographic key stored on a special hardware device (e.g., a PDA, cell phone, smart card, USB drive, one-time password device) rather than on a general purpose computer.


*Identity proofing* means the process by which a credential service provider or certification authority validates sufficient information to uniquely identify a person.


*Installed electronic prescription application* means software that is used to create electronic prescriptions and that is installed on a practitioner's computers and servers, where access and records are controlled by the practitioner.


*Installed pharmacy application* means software that is used to process prescription information and that is installed on a pharmacy's computers or servers and is controlled by the pharmacy.


*Intermediary* means any technology system that receives and transmits an electronic prescription between the practitioner and pharmacy.
