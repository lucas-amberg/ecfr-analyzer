(b) Whenever the ownership of a pharmacy is being transferred from one person to another, if the transferee owns at least one other pharmacy licensed in the same State as the one the ownership of which is being transferred, the transferee may apply for registration prior to the date of transfer. The Administrator may register the applicant and authorize him to obtain controlled substances at the time of transfer. Such registration shall not authorize the transferee to dispense controlled substances until the pharmacy has been issued a valid State license. The transferee shall include with his/her application the following affidavit:


This statement is submitted in order to obtain a Drug Enforcement Administration registration number.


(c) If at the time of application for a separate registration at a long term care facility, the retail pharmacy has been issued a license, permit, or other form of authorization from the appropriate State agency to install and operate an automated dispensing system for the dispensing of controlled substances at the long term care facility, the applicant must include with his/her application for registration (DEA Form 224) an affidavit as to the existence of the State authorization.

If the statements prove to be false, the Administrator may revoke the registration on the basis of section 304(a)(1) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824(a)(1)) and suspend the registration immediately by pending revocation on the basis of section 304(d) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824(d)). At the same time, the Administrator may seize and place under seal all controlled substances possessed by the applicant under section 304(f) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824(f)).
