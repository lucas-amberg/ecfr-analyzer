# § 1301.76   Other security controls for practitioners.

(a) The registrant shall not employ, as an agent or employee who has access to controlled substances, any person who has been convicted of a felony offense relating to controlled substances or who, at any time, had an application for registration with the DEA denied, had a DEA registration revoked or has surrendered a DEA registration for cause. For purposes of this subsection, the term “for cause” means a surrender in lieu of, or as a consequence of, any federal or state administrative, civil or criminal action resulting from an investigation of the individual's handling of controlled substances.


(b) The registrant shall notify the Field Division Office of the Administration in his area, in writing, of the theft or significant loss of any controlled substances within one business day of discovery of such loss or theft. The registrant must also file a complete and accurate DEA Form 106 with the Administration through DEA's Diversion Control Division secure network application within 45 days after discovery of the theft or loss.   When determining whether a loss is significant, a registrant should consider, among others, the following factors:


(1) The actual quantity of controlled substances lost in relation to the type of business;


(2) The specific controlled substances lost;


(3) Whether the loss of the controlled substances can be associated with access to those controlled substances by specific individuals, or whether the loss can be attributed to unique activities that may take place involving the controlled substances;


(4) A pattern of losses over a specific time period, whether the losses appear to be random, and the results of efforts taken to resolve the losses; and, if known,


(5) Whether the specific controlled substances are likely candidates for diversion;


(6) Local trends and other indicators of the diversion potential of the missing controlled substance.


(c) Whenever the registrant distributes a controlled substance (without being registered as a distributor as permitted in §§ 1301.13(e)(1), 1307.11, 1317.05, and/or 1317.10 of this chapter), he/she shall comply with the requirements imposed on non-practitioners in § 1301.74(a), (b), and (e).


(d) Central fill pharmacies must comply with § 1301.74(e) when selecting private, common or contract carriers to transport filled prescriptions to a retail pharmacy for delivery to the ultimate user. When central fill pharmacies contract with private, common or contract carriers to transport filled prescriptions to a retail pharmacy, the central fill pharmacy is responsible for reporting in-transit losses upon discovery of such loss by use of a DEA Form 106. Retail pharmacies must comply with § 1301.74(e) when selecting private, common or contract carriers to retrieve filled prescriptions from a central fill pharmacy. When retail pharmacies contract with private, common or contract carriers to retrieve filled prescriptions from a central fill pharmacy, the retail pharmacy is responsible for reporting in-transit losses upon discovery of such loss by use of a DEA Form 106.
