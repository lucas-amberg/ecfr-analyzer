# § 1312.44   Request for hearing or appearance; waiver.

(a) Any applicant entitled to a hearing pursuant to § 1312.42 and who desires a hearing on the denial of his application for an import, export, or transshipment permit shall, within 30 days after the date of receipt of the denial of his application, file with the Administrator a written request for a hearing in the form prescribed in § 1316.47 of this chapter. 


(b) Any applicant entitled to a hearing pursuant to § 1312.42 may, within the period permitted for filing a request for a hearing, file with the Administrator a waiver of an opportunity for a hearing, together with a written statement regarding his position on the matters of fact and law involved in such hearing. Such statement, if admissible, shall be made a part of the record and shall be considered in light of the lack of opportunity for cross-examination in determining the weight to be attached to matters of fact asserted therein. 


(c) If any applicant entitled to a hearing pursuant to § 1312.42 fails to appear at the hearing, he shall be deemed to have waived his opportunity for the hearing unless he shows good cause for such failure. 


(d) If the applicant waives or is deemed to have waived this opportunity for the hearing, the Administrator may cancel the hearing, if scheduled, and issue his final order pursuant to § 1312.47 without a hearing.
