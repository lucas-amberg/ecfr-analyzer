(c) An application shall be accompanied by an export license, permit, or a certified copy of the export license, permit, or other authorization, issued by a competent authority of the country of origin (or other documentary evidence deemed adequate by the Administrator). 


(d) An application shall be accompanied by an import license or permit or a certified copy of such license or permit issued by a competent authority of the country of destination (or other documentary evidence deemed adequate by the Administrator), indicating that the controlled substance: 


(1) Is to be applied exclusively to scientific, medical or other legitimate uses within the country of destination; 


(2) Will not be exported from such country; 


(3) Is needed therein because there is an actual shortage thereof and a demand therefor for scientific, medical or other legitimate uses within such country; and


(4) If the import license or permit, or the certified copy of such, is not written in English or bilingual with another language and English, the application must include a certified translation of the permit or license.

(f) The Administrator may require an applicant to submit such documents or written statements of fact relevant to the application as he deems necessary to determine whether the application should be granted. The failure of the applicant to provide such documents or statements within a reasonable time after being requested to do so shall be deemed to be a waiver by the applicant of an opportunity to present such documents or facts for consideration by the Administrator in granting or denying the application. 


(g) The Administrator shall, within 21 days from the date of receipt of the application, either grant or deny the application. The applicant shall be accorded an opportunity to amend the application, with the Administrator either granting or denying the amended application within 7 days of its receipt. If the Administrator does not grant or deny the application within 21 days of its receipt, or in the case of an amended application, within 7 days of its receipt, the application shall be deemed approved and the applicant may proceed.
