# § 3.11   Responsibility of chief of mission to inform host government of restrictions on employees' receipt of gifts and decorations.

A special provision of the Act requires the President to direct every chief of a United States diplomatic mission to inform the host government that it is a general policy of the United States Government to prohibit its employees from receiving gifts of more than minimal value or decorations that have not been tendered “in recognition of active field service in time of combat operations or awarded for other outstanding or unusually meritorious performance.” Accordingly, all Chiefs of Mission shall in January of each year conduct a thorough and explicit program of orientation aimed at appropriate officials of the host government concerning the operation of the Act.
