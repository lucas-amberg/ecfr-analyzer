# § 9.6   Derivative classification.

(a) *Definition.* Derivative classification is: the incorporating, paraphrasing, restating, or generating in new form information that is already classified and the marking of the new material consistent with the classification of the source material, or the marking of the information in accordance with an authorized classification guide. Duplication or reproduction of existing classified information is not derivative classification. Persons who apply classification markings derived from source material or as directed by a classification guide need not possess original classification authority.


(b) *Responsibility.* Information classified derivatively from other classified information shall be classified and marked in accordance with instructions from an authorized classifier or in accordance with an authorized classification guide and shall comply with the standards set forth in sections 2.1-2.2 of the Executive Order and 32 CFR 2001.22. The duration of classification of a document classified by a derivative classifier using a classification guide shall not exceed 25 years except for:


(1) Information that would reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source (50X1-HUM) or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction (50X2-WMD), and


(2) Specific information incorporated into the classification guide under section 2.2(e) of the Executive Order relating to exemptions from automatic declassification.


(c) *Department of State Classification Guide.* The Department of State Classification Guide (DSCG) is the primary authority for the classification of information in documents created by Department of State personnel. The Guide is classified “Confidential” and is found on the Department of State's classified Web site.
