# § 9b.8   Term and renewal of Department of State press building passes.

(a) Department of State press building passes for U.S. citizens are issued with three years' validity. Subject to positive completion of an international background check, passes for non-U.S. citizens are issued with one year's validity and may be renewed for three years. Notwithstanding its initial validity, any press building pass that has not been used for a twelve-month period, as recorded by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security's turnstyle entry devices, will become invalid at the end of that twelve-month period.


(b) For any valid passes issued before October 1, 1995, notification shall be sent by the Department of State to the holder of the pass that the pass has become invalid by reason of lack of use for 12-month period. However, failure of the holder for any reason to receive such a notification shall not affect the invalidity of the pass. Anyone whose pass has become invalid may apply for a new pass in accordance with §§ 9b.2 through 9b.5.
