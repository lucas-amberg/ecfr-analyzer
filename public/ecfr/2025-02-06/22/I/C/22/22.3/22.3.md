# § 22.3   Remittances in the United States.

(a) *Type of remittance.* Remittances shall be in the form of: (1) Check or bank draft drawn on a bank in the United States; (2) money order—postal, international or bank; or (3) U.S. currency. Remittances shall be made payable to the order of the Department of State. The Department will assume no responsibility for cash which is lost in the mail.


(b) *Exact payment of fees.* Fees must be paid in full prior to issuance of requested documents. If uncertainty as to the existence of a record or as to the number of sheets to be copied precludes remitting the exact fee chargeable with the request, the Department of State will inform the interested party of the exact amount required.
