# § 40.11   Medical grounds of ineligibility.

(a) *Decision on eligibility based on findings of medical doctor.* A finding of a panel physician designated by the post in whose jurisdiction the examination is performed pursuant to INA 212(a)(1) shall be binding on the consular officer, except that the officer may refer a panel physician finding in an individual case to USPHS for review. 


(b) *Waiver of ineligibility—INA 212(g).* If an immigrant visa applicant is inadmissible under INA 212(a)(1)(A)(i), (ii), or (iii) but is qualified to seek the benefits of INA 212(g)(1)(A) or (B), 212(g)(2)(C), or 212(g)(3), the consular officer shall inform the alien of the procedure for applying to DHS for relief under the applicable provision of law. A visa may not be issued to the alien until the consular officer has received notification from DHS of the approval of the alien's application under INA 212(g), unless the consular officer has been delegated authority by the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant the particular waiver under INA 212(g). 


(c) *Waiver authority—INA 212(g)(2)(A) and (B).* The consular officer may waive section 212(a)(1)(A)(ii) visa ineligibility if the alien qualifies for such waiver under the provisions of INA 212(g)(2)(A) or (B).
