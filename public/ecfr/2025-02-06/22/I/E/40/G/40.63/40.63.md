(a) *Fraud and misrepresentation and INA 212(a)(6)(C) applicability to certain refugees.* An alien who seeks to procure, or has sought to procure, or has procured a visa, other documentation, or entry into the United States or other benefit provided under the INA by fraud or by willfully misrepresenting a material fact at any time shall be ineligible under INA 212(a)(6)(C); *Provided,* That the provisions of this paragraph are not applicable if the fraud or misrepresentation was committed by an alien at the time the alien sought entry into a country other than the United States or obtained travel documents as a bona fide refugee and the refugee was in fear of being repatriated to a former homeland if the facts were disclosed in connection with an application for a visa to enter the United States: *Provided further,* That the fraud or misrepresentation was not committed by such refugee for the purpose of evading the quota or numerical restrictions of the U.S. immigration laws, or investigation of the alien's record at the place of former residence or elsewhere in connection with an application for a visa. 


(b) *Misrepresentation in application under Displaced Persons Act or Refugee Relief Act.* Subject to the conditions stated in INA 212(a)(6)(c)(i), an alien who is found by the consular officer to have made a willful misrepresentation within the meaning of section 10 of the Displaced Persons Act of 1948, as amended, for the purpose of gaining admission into the United States as an eligible displaced person, or to have made a material misrepresentation within the meaning of section 11(e) of the Refugee Relief Act of 1953, as amended, for the purpose of gaining admission into the United States as an alien eligible thereunder, shall be considered ineligible under the provisions of INA 212(a)(6)(C). 


(c) *Waiver of ineligibility—INA 212(i).* If an immigrant applicant is ineligible under INA 212(a)(6)(C) but is qualified to seek the benefits of INA 212(i), the consular officer shall inform the alien of the procedure for applying to DHS for relief under that provision of law. A visa may not be issued to the alien until the consular officer has received notification from DHS of the approval of the alien's application under INA 212(i).
