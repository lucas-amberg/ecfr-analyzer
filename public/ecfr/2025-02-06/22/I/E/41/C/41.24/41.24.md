# § 41.24   International organization aliens.

(a) *Definition of international organization.* “International organization” means: 


(1) Any public international organization which has been designated by the President by Executive Order as entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities provided for in the International Organizations Immunities Act (59 Stat. 669, 22 U.S.C. 288); and 


(2) For the purpose of special immigrant status under INA 101(a)(27)(I), INTELSAT or any successor or separated entity thereof.


(b) *Aliens coming to international organizations.* (1) An alien is classifiable under INA 101(a)(15)(G) if the consular officer is satisfied that the alien is within one of the classes described in that section and seeks to enter or transit the United States in pursuance of official duties. If the purpose of the entry or transit is other than pursuance of official duties, the alien is not classifiable under INA *section* 101(a)(15)(G).


(2) An alien applying for a visa under the provisions of INA *section* 101(a)(15)(G) may not be refused solely on the grounds that the applicant is not a national of the country whose government the applicant represents.


(3) An alien seeking to enter the United States as a foreign government representative to an international organization, who is also proceeding to the United States on official business as a foreign government official within the meaning of INA *section* 101(a)(15)(A), shall be issued a visa under that section, if otherwise qualified.


(4) An alien not classifiable under INA section 101(a)(15)(A) or in NATO-1 through NATO-6 classification but entitled to classification under INA section 101(a)(15)(G) shall be classified under section 101(a)(15)(G), even if also eligible for another nonimmigrant classification. An alien classified under INA section 101(a)(15)(G) as an immediate family member of a principal alien classifiable G-1, G-2, G-3 or G-4, may continue to be so classified even if he or she obtains employment subsequent to his or her initial entry into the United States that would allow classification under INA section 101(a)(15)(A). Such alien shall not be classified in a category other than A or G, even if also eligible for another nonimmigrant classification.


(c) *Officers and employees of privatized INTELSAT, their family members and domestic servants.* (1) Officers and employees of privatized INTELSAT who both were employed by INTELSAT, and held status under INA 101(a)(15)(G)(iv) for at least six months prior to privatization on July 17, 2001, will continue to be so classifiable for so long as they are officers or employees of INTELSAT or a successor or separated entity thereof. 


(2) Aliens who had had G-4 status as officers and employees of INTELSAT but became officers or employees of a successor or separated entity of INTELSAT after at least six months of such employment, but prior to and in anticipation of privatization and subsequent to March 17, 2000, will also continue to be classifiable under INA 101(a)(15)(G)(iv) for so long as that employment continues. 


(3) Family members of officers and employees described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section who qualify as “immediate family” under § 41.21(a)(3) and who are accompanying or following to join the principal are also classifiable under INA 1010(a)(15)(G)(iv) for so long as the principal is so classified. 


(4) Attendants, servants, and personal employees of officers and employees described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section are not eligible for classification under INA 101(a)(15)(G)(v), given that the officers and employees described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section are not officers or employees of an “international organization” for purposes of INA 101(a)(15)(G).
