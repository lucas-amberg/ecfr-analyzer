(a) The Department shall certify or authenticate audio-visual materials submitted for review as educational, scientific and cultural in character and in compliance with the standards set forth in Article I of the Beirut Agreement when: (1) Their primary purpose or effect is to instruct or inform through the development of a subject or aspect of a subject, or when their content is such as to maintain, increase or diffuse knowledge, and augment international understanding and goodwill; and


(2) The materials are representative, authentic, and accurate; and


(3) The technical quality is such that it does not interfere with the use made of the material.

(6) Stimulates the use of a special process or product, advertises a particular organization or individual, raises funds, or makes unsubstantiated claims of exclusivity.

(2) It might lend itself to misinterpretation, or to misrepresentation of the United States or other countries, or their people or institutions;


(3) It is not representative, authentic, or accurate or does not represent the current state of factual knowledge of a subject or aspect of a subject unless the material contains widespread and gross misstatements of fact;


(4) It does not augment international understanding and goodwill, unless its primary purpose or effect is not to instruct or inform through the development of a subject or an aspect of a subject and its content is not such as to maintain, increase, or diffuse knowledge; or


(5) In the opinion of the Department the material is propaganda.


(d) The Department may certify or authenticate materials which have not been produced at the time of application upon an affirmative determination that:


(1) The materials will be issued serially,


(2) Representative samples of the serial material have been provided at the time of application,


(3) Future titles and release dates have been provided to the Department at the time of application,


(4) The applicant has affirmed that:


(i) Future released materials in the series will conform to the substantive criteria for certification delineated at paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section;


(ii) Such materials will be similar to the representative samples provided to the Department on application; and


(iii) The applicant will provide the Department with copies of the items themselves or descriptive materials for post-certification review.


(e) If the Department determines through a post-certification review that the materials do not comply with the substantive criteria for certification delineated at paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, the applicant will no longer be eligible for serial certifications. Ineligibility for serial certifications will not affect an applicant's eligibility for certification of materials reviewed prior to production.
