# ยง 64.9   Termination of approval.

If at any time it appears to the Secretary of State that the purpose of a program which has been approved has been changed so that it no longer meets the criteria of ยง 516.5 or that the program is being misused, the Secretary of State may terminate such approval, or suspend such approval pending the supplying of additional information. However, a termination or suspension shall not affect a grant which has been made under a previously approved program.
