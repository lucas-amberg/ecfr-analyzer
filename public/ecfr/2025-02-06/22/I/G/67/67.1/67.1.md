# § 67.1   Introduction.

(a) The National Endowment for Democracy (hereinafter “NED”) was created in 1983 to stregthen democratic values and institutions around the world through nongovernmental efforts. Incorporated in the District of Columbia and governed by a bipartisan Board of Directors, NED is tax-exempt, nonprofit, private corporation as defined in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Through its worldwide grant program, NED seeks to enlist the energies and talents of private citizens and groups to work with partners abroad who wish to build for themselves a democratic future.


(b) Since its establishment in 1983, NED has received an annual appropriation approved by the United States Congress as part of the United States Information Agency budget. Appropriations for NED are authorized in the National Endowment for Democracy Act (the “Act”), 22 U.S.C. 4411 *et seq.*

(c) The activities supported by NED are guided by the six purposes set forth in NED's Articles of Incorporation and the National Endowment for Democracy Act. These six purposes are: 


(1) To encourage free and democratic institutions throughout the world through private-sector initiatives, including activities which promote the individual rights and freedoms (including internationally recognized human rights) which are essential to the functioning of democratic institutions; 


(2) To facilitate exchanges between U.S. private sector groups (especially the two major American political parties, labor and business) and democratic groups abroad; 


(3) To promote U.S. nongovernmental participation (especially through the two major American political parties, labor, and business) in democratic training programs and democratic institution-building abroad; 


(4) To strengthen democratic electoral processes abroad through timely measures in cooperation with indigenous democratic forces; 


(5) To support the participation of the two major American political parties, labor, business, and other U.S. private-sector groups in fostering cooperation with those abroad dedicated to the cultural values, institutions, and organizations of democratic pluralism; and 


(6) To encourage the establishment and growth of democratic development in a manner consistent both with the broad concerns of United States national interests and with the specific requirements of the democratic groups in other countries which are aided by NED-supported programs.
