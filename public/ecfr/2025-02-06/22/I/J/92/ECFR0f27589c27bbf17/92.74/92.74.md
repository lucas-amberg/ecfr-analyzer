# § 92.74   Services in connection with United States securities or interests therein.

(a) *Authority and responsibility.* Assignments or requests for payment of United States securities, or securities for which the Treasury Department acts as transfer agent, or powers of attorney in connection therewith where authorized by the Treasury Department, should, in a foreign country, be executed before a United States consular or diplomatic officer. However, if they are executed before a foreign official having power to administer oaths, the Treasury Department requires that the official character and jurisdiction on the foreign official be certified by a United States diplomatic or consular officer. (See §§ 92.36 to 92.41 on authentications.)


(b) *Fees.* Officers of the Foreign Service should charge no fees for notarial services they perform in connection with the execution of documents, including the certification or authentication of documents where necessary, which affect United States securities or securities for which the Treasury Department acts as transfer agent, or which may be required in the collection of interest thereon. Item 58(b) of the Tariff of Fees, Foreign Service of the United States of America (§ 22.1 of this chapter) applies in cases of this nature.
