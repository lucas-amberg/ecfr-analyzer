# ยง 92.94   Replying to inquiries regarding service of process or other documents.

Officers should make prompt and courteous replies to all inquiries regarding the service of legal process or documents of like nature, and should render such assistance as they properly can to the court and to interested parties. Such assistance could include furnishing information as to the standard procedure of the locality for service of legal papers, with the name and address of the local office having a bailiff authorized to effect and make return of service; it could include furnishing a list of local attorneys capable of making necessary arrangements; or it could, where appropriate, include a suggestion that the request of the American court might be presented to the foreign judicial authorities in the form of letters rogatory (see definition, ยง 92.54, and procedures, ยง 92.66 (b)). If the person upon whom the process is intended to be served is known to be willing to accept service, or if it is clear that it would be in his interest at least to be informed of the matter, the consular officer may suggest to the interested parties in the United States the drawings up of papers for voluntary execution by such person, such as a waiver of service or a document which would be acceptable to the American court to signify the person's entering an appearance in the action pending therein.
