When, however it is necessary to procure the attendance of a witness on behalf of the United States or an indigent party, an officer or agent of the United States may negotiate with the witness to pay compensation at such higher rate as may be approved by the Attorney General, plus the mileage allowance stated above (5 U.S.C. 341). The expense of the compensation and mileage of each witness will be borne by the party, or parties, applying for the commission unless the commission is accompanied by an order of court (18 U.S.C. 3495(b) that all fees, compensations, and other expenses authorized by these regulations are chargeable to the United States (18 U.S.C. 3495).


(b) *Fee payable to counsel.* Each counsel who represents a party to the action or proceeding in the examination before the commissioner will receive compensation for each day of attendance at a rate of not less than $15 a day and not more than $50 a day, as agreed between him and the party whom he represents, plus such actual and necessary expenses as may be allowed by the commissioner upon verified statements filed with him. If the commission is issued on application of the United States, the compensation and expenses of counsel representing each party are chargeable to the United States under section 3495(b) of title 18 of the United States Code (18 U.S.C. 3495 and 3496, and E.O. 10307, 3 CFR, 1949-1953 Comp.).


(c) *Fees payable to interpreters and translators.* Each interpreter and translator employed by the commissioner under these regulations shall receive an allowance of $10 a day, plus 8 cents a mile for going from his place of residence or business to the place of examination and returning, by the shortest feasible route. The compensation and mileage of interpreters and translators shall be chargeable to the United States.


(d) *Time for paying fees.* Witnesses, counsel, interpreters, and translators will be paid, in accordance with the foregoing regulations, by the commissioner at the conclusion of their services. Other expenses authorized by these regulations will be paid by the commissioner as they are incurred.


(e) *Payment of fees by the United States.* When it appears that the commission was issued on application of the United States or when the commission is accompanied by an order of court that all fees, compensation, and other expenses authorized by these regulations are chargeable to the United States under section 3495(b) of title 18 of the United States Code, the commissioner shall execute the commission without charge for his service as commissioner in connection therewith. The Commissioner shall pay witnesses, counsel, interpreter, or translator, and other expenses authorized by these regulations through the disbursing officer in his area in accordance with instructions which will be issued in each case.


(f) *Payment of fees by other parties.* When fees, compensation, and other expenses authorized by this section are chargeable to any party other than the United States, the commissioner shall undertake the execution of the commission only if such party deposits with the Department of State or with the appropriate Foreign Service post, in advance, an amount to be set by the court as apparently adequate to defray all fees, compensation, and other expenses authorized by this part. If the amount of the deposit is later found to be insufficient, the depositor shall be so notified, and the commissioner shall retain the commission and other papers until a sufficient supplemental amount has been deposited. If the amount of the deposit exceeds the aggregate amount of fees, compensation, and other expenses authorized by this part, the excess shall be returned to the party, or parties, entitled thereto. The commissioner shall pay witnesses, counsel, interpreter, or translator, and other expenses authorized by this section, from the proceeds of a check which the disbursing officer for his area will be authorized to draw on the Treasurer of the United States.
