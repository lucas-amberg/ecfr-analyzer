# ยง 96.20   Choosing an accrediting entity.

(a) An agency that seeks to become accredited must apply to an accrediting entity that is designated to provide accreditation services and that has jurisdiction over its application. A person that seeks to become approved must apply to an accrediting entity that is designated to provide approval services and that has jurisdiction over its application. The agency or person may apply to only one accrediting entity at a time.


(b)(1) If the agency or person is applying for accreditation or approval pursuant to this part for the first time, it may apply to any accrediting entity with jurisdiction over its application. However, the agency or person must apply to the same accrediting entity that handled its prior application when it next applies for accreditation or approval, if the agency or person:


(i) Has been denied accreditation or approval;


(ii) Has withdrawn its application in anticipation of denial;


(iii) Has had its accreditation or approval cancelled by an accrediting entity or the Secretary;


(iv) Has been temporarily debarred by the Secretary; or


(v) Has been refused renewal of its accreditation or approval by an accrediting entity.


(2) If the prior accrediting entity is no longer providing accreditation or approval services, the agency or person may apply to any accrediting entity with jurisdiction over its application.
