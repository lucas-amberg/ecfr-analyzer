The accrediting entity's evaluators must have expertise in intercountry adoption, standards evaluation, finance or accounting, or have experience with the management or oversight of child welfare organizations and must also meet any additional qualifications required by the Secretary in the agreement with the accrediting entity.


(b) To evaluate the agency's or person's eligibility for accreditation or approval, the accrediting entity must:


(1) Review the agency's or person's written application and supporting documentation;


(2) Verify the information provided by the agency or person by examining underlying documentation;


(3) Consider any complaints received by the accrediting entity pursuant to subpart J of this part; and


(4) Conduct site visit(s).


(c) The site visit(s) may include, but need not be limited to, interviews with birth parents, adoptive parent(s), prospective adoptive parent(s), and adult adoptee(s) served by the agency or person, interviews with the agency's or person's employees, and interviews with other individuals knowledgeable about the agency's or person's provision of adoption services. It may also include a review of on-site documents. The accrediting entity must, to the extent practicable, advise the agency or person in advance of the type of documents it wishes to review during the site visit. The accrediting entity must require at least one of the evaluators to participate in each site visit. The accrediting entity must determine the number of evaluators that participate in a site visit in light of factors such as:


(1) The agency's or person's size;


(2) The number of adoption cases it handles;


(3) The number of sites the accrediting entity decides to visit; and


(4) The number of individuals working at each site.


(d) Before deciding whether to accredit an agency or approve a person, the accrediting entity may, in its discretion, advise the agency or person of any deficiencies that may hinder or prevent its accreditation or approval and defer a decision to allow the agency or person to correct the deficiencies.
