# ยง 96.34   Compensation.

(a) The agency or person does not compensate or offer to compensate any individual or entity involved in an intercountry adoption with an incentive fee or contingent fee for each child located or placed for adoption.


(b) The agency or person compensates its directors, officers, employees, supervised providers, individuals, and entities involved in an intercountry adoption only for services actually rendered and only on a fee-for-service, hourly wage, or salary basis rather than a contingent fee basis.


(c) The agency or person does not make any payments, promise payment, or give other consideration to any individual or entity directly or indirectly involved in provision of adoption services in a particular case, except for salaries or fees for services actually rendered and reimbursement for costs incurred. This does not prohibit an agency or person from providing in-kind or other donations not intended to influence or affect a particular adoption.


(d) The fees, wages, or salaries paid to the directors, officers, employees, supervised providers, individuals, or entities involved in an intercountry adoption on behalf of the agency or person, are not unreasonably high in relation to the services actually rendered, taking into account the country in which the services are provided and norms for compensation within the intercountry adoption community in that country, to the extent that such norms are known to the accrediting entity; the location, number, and qualifications of staff; workload requirements; budget; and size of the agency or person.


(e) Any other compensation paid or offered to the agency's or person's directors or members of its governing body is not unreasonably high in relation to the services rendered, taking into account the same factors listed in paragraph (d) of this section and its for-profit or nonprofit status.


(f) The agency or person identifies all vendors to whom clients are referred for non-adoption services and discloses to the accrediting entity and the agency's or person's clients, any corporate or financial arrangements and any family relationships with such vendors.
