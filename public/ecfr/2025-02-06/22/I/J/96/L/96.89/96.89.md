# ยง 96.89   Procedures for debarment effective immediately.

If the Secretary finds that the agency's or person's continued accreditation or approval would risk significant harm to children or families, and that debarment should be effective immediately, the Secretary shall debar the agency or person from accreditation or approval by providing written notice of debarment to the agency or person.


(a) The notice of debarment shall include:


(1) A statement that the agency or person is debarred in accordance with ยง 96.85;


(2) The reasons for the debarment in terms sufficient to put the agency or person on notice of the conduct or transaction(s) upon which it is based;


(3) The standards in subpart F of this part with which the Secretary believes the agency or person is out of compliance;


(4) The period of the debarment, including effective dates;


(5) The effect of the debarment, including the debarred agency's or person's obligations; and


(6) The provisions of this section and any other procedures, if applicable, governing proceedings to contest the debarment action, including specifically the right to request a hearing, when applicable.


(b) If the agency or person elects to contest the Department's debarment action, it may do so in accordance with the following procedures:


(1) Within 30 days after receipt of the notice of debarment, the debarred agency or person may submit a written statement in opposition to the debarment. Such statement may include any evidence on which the debarred agency or person intends to rely in opposition to the debarment. Such statement may also include a request for a hearing. If a request for hearing is not included with the agency or person's statement, no hearing will be held, and the Secretary's debarment decision will be based upon his or her review of the written record only.


(2) Within 30 days after its receipt of the agency's or person's written statement, the Department will give the debarred agency or person copies of the evidence relied on in support of the debarment action. In addition, the Department may choose to provide a written statement in response to the debarred agency's or person's submission.


(3) The debarred agency or person may, within 30 days of its receipt of the Department's response described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, submit a further statement in reply. The debarred agency or person will include with its reply, or will produce to the Department if it elects not to submit a reply, any additional physical or documentary evidence on which it will rely at the hearing.


(4) The statements described in this paragraph, and any evidence submitted therewith, will be made part of the record of the proceeding, and if no hearing was timely requested, will constitute the entire record of the proceeding.


(c) If a hearing was timely requested in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the provisions of ยง 96.88(c) shall apply, except that the Department will give notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing within 30 days of its receipt of the debarred agency's or person's written statement described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and will make reasonable efforts to hold the hearing within 90 days of such receipt.


(d) Upon review and consideration of the complete record of the proceeding and the preliminary findings of fact and recommendations of the hearing officer, the Secretary shall confirm the debarment, if he or she determines that it is supported by substantial evidence, or shall withdraw the debarment, if he or she determines that it is not supported by substantial evidence. The Secretary shall render his or her decision within 30 days of the date for submission of the debarred agency's or person's reply statement described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, if no hearing was requested; or within 45 days of the close of the hearing, if a hearing was held.


(1) The Department bears the burden to establish that substantial evidence exists:


(i) That the debarred agency or person is out of compliance with some, or all of the standards identified in the notice of debarment; and


(ii) That there is either a pattern of serious, willful, or grossly negligent failures to comply, or other aggravating circumstances indicating that continued accreditation or approval would not be in the best interests of the children and families concerned.


(2) The Secretary is not limited to the specific conduct or transactions identified in the notice of debarment, but may consider any evidence in the record of the proceeding that supplies substantial evidence of a violation of the standards identified in the notice of debarment.


(3) If the Secretary decides to confirm the debarment, the agency or person shall be given prompt notice:


(i) Referring to the notice of debarment;


(ii) Stating that the debarment is confirmed;


(iii) Specifying the reasons for the decision to confirm the debarment; and


(iv) Stating the period, including effective dates, of the debarment, if different from those set forth in the notice of debarment.


(e) The decision of the Secretary is final and is not subject to further administrative review.


(f) If the Secretary decides to withdraw the debarment, the agency or person shall be given prompt notice of that decision. A decision not to confirm the debarment shall be without prejudice to any adverse action imposed, or that may be imposed, on the agency or person by an accrediting entity.
