# ยง 97.2   Application for a Hague Adoption Certificate or a Hague Custody Declaration (outgoing Convention case).

(a) Once the Convention has entered into force for the United States, any party to an outgoing Convention adoption or custody proceeding may apply to the Secretary for a Hague Adoption Certificate or a Hague Custody Declaration. Any other interested person may also make such application, but such application will not be processed unless such applicant demonstrates that a Hague Adoption Certificate or Hague Custody Declaration is needed to obtain a legal benefit or for purposes of a legal proceeding, as determined by the Secretary in the Secretary's discretion.


(b) Applicants for a Hague Adoption Certificate or Hague Custody Declaration shall submit to the Secretary:


(1) A completed application form in such form as the Secretary may prescribe, with any required fee;


(2) An official copy of the order of the adoption court finding that the child is eligible for adoption and that the adoption or proposed adoption is in the child's best interests and granting the adoption or custody for purposes of adoption;


(3) An official copy of the adoption court's findings (either in the order granting the adoption or custody for purposes of adoption or separately) verifying, in substance, that each of the requirements of ยง 97.3 has been complied with or, if the adoption court has not verified compliance with a particular requirement in ยง 97.3, authenticated documentation showing that such requirement nevertheless has been met and a written explanation of why the adoption court's verification of compliance with the requirement cannot be submitted; and


(4) Such additional documentation and information as the Secretary may request at the Secretary's discretion.


(c) If the applicant fails to submit all of the documentation and information required pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section within 120 days of the Secretary's request, the Secretary may consider the application abandoned.
