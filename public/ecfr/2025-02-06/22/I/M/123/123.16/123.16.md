# § 123.16   Exemptions of general applicability.

(a) The following exemptions apply to exports of unclassified defense articles for which no approval is needed from the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. These exemptions do not apply to: Proscribed destinations under § 126.1 of this subchapter; exports for which Congressional notification is required (*see* § 123.15 of this subchapter); MTCR articles; Significant Military Equipment (SME); and may not be used by persons who are generally ineligible as described in § 120.16 of this subchapter. All shipments of defense articles, including but not limited to those to Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, require an Electronic Export Information (EEI) filing or notification letter. If the export of a defense article is exempt from licensing, the EEI filing must cite the exemption. Refer to § 123.22 of this subchapter for EEI filing and letter notification requirements.


(b) The following exports are exempt from the licensing requirements of this subchapter. 


(1) Port Directors of U.S. Customs and Border Protection shall permit the export without a license of defense hardware being exported in furtherance of a manufacturing license agreement, technical assistance agreement, distribution agreement or an arrangement for distribution of items identified in Category XIII(b)(1), approved in accordance with part 124, provided that:


(i) The defense hardware to be exported supports the activity and is identified by item, quantity and value in the agreement or arrangement; and


(ii) Any provisos or limitations placed on the authorized agreement or arrangement are adhered to; and 


(iii) The exporter identifies in the EEI filing by selecting the appropriate code that the export is exempt from the licensing requirements of this subchapter; and


(iv) The total value of all shipments does not exceed the value authorized in the agreement or arrangement.


(v) In the case of a distribution agreement, export must be made directly to the approved foreign distributor.


(2) Port Directors of U.S. Customs and Border Protection shall permit the export of parts or components without a license when the total value does not exceed $500 in a single transaction and:


(i) The components or spare parts are being exported to support a defense article previously authorized for export; and 


(ii) The spare parts or components are not going to a distributor, but to a previously approved end-user of the defense articles; and 


(iii) The spare parts or components are not to be used to enhance the capability of the defense article; 


(iv) Exporters shall not split orders so as not to exceed the dollar value of this exemption; 


(v) The exporter may not make more than 24 shipments per calendar year to the previously authorized end user; 


(vi) The exporter must certify on the invoice, the bill of lading, air waybill, or shipping documents that the export is exempt from the licensing requirements of this subchapter. This is done by writing “22 CFR 123.16(b)(2) applicable.”


(3) Port Directors of U.S. Customs and Border Protection shall permit the export without a license, of packing cases specially designed to carry defense articles.


(4) Port Directors of U.S. Customs and Border Protection shall permit the export without a license, of unclassified models or mock-ups of defense articles, provided that such models or mock-ups are inoperable and do not reveal any technical data in excess of that which is exempted from the licensing requirements of § 125.4(b) of this subchapter and do not contain components (*see* § 120.40(c) of this subchapter) covered by the U.S. Munitions List (*see* § 121.1 of this subchapter). Some models or mockups built to scale or constructed of original materials can reveal technical data. U.S. persons who avail themselves of this exemption must electronically submit a certification to U.S. Customs and Border Protection that these conditions are met, unless directed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to provide such a certification in another manner. This exemption does not imply that the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls will approve the export of any defense articles for which models or mocks-ups have been exported pursuant to this exemption.


(5) Port Directors of U.S. Customs and Border Protection shall permit the temporary export without a license of unclassified defense articles to any public exhibition, trade show, air show or related event if that article has previously been licensed for a public exhibition, trade show, air show or related event and the license is still valid. U.S. persons who avail themselves of this exemption must electronically submit a certification to U.S. Customs and Border Protection that these conditions are met, unless directed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to provide such a certification in another manner.


(6) For exemptions for personal protective gear, refer to § 123.17.


(7) [Reserved]


(8) For exports to Canada refer to § 126.5 of this subchapter. 


(9) Port Directors of U.S. Customs and Border Protection shall permit the temporary export without a license by a U.S. person of any unclassified component, part, tool or test equipment to a subsidiary, affiliate or facility owned or controlled by the U.S. person (see § 120.65 of this subchapter for definition of foreign ownership and foreign control) if the component, part, tool or test equipment is to be used for manufacture, assembly, testing, production, or modification provided:


(i) The U.S. person is registered with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and complies with all requirements set forth in part 122 of this subchapter;
