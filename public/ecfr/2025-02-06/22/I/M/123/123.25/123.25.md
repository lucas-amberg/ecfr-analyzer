# ยง 123.25   Amendments to licenses.

(a) The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls may approve an amendment to a license for permanent export, temporary export and temporary import of unclassified defense articles. A suggested format is available from the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls.


(b) The following types of amendments to a license will be considered: Addition of U.S. freight forwarder or U.S. consignor; change due to an obvious typographical error; change in source of commodity; and change of foreign intermediate consignee if that party is only transporting the equipment and will not process (e.g., integrate, modify) the equipment. For changes in U.S. dollar value see ยง 123.23.


(c) The following types of amendments to a license will not be approved: Additional quantity, changes in commodity, country of ultimate destination, end-use or end-user, foreign consignee and/or extension of duration. The foreign intermediate consignee may only be amended if that party is acting as freight forwarder and the export does not involve technical data. A new license is required for these changes. Any new license submission must reflect only the unshipped balance of quantity and dollar value.
