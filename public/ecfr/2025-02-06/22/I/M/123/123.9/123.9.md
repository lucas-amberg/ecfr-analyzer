# § 123.9   Country of ultimate destination and approval of reexports or retransfers.

(a) The country designated as the country of ultimate destination on an application for an export license, or in an Electronic Export Information filing where an exemption is claimed under this subchapter, must be the country of ultimate end-use. The written approval of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls must be obtained before reselling, transferring, reexporting, retransferring, transshipping, or disposing of a defense article to any end-user, end-use, or destination other than as stated on the export license, or in the Electronic Export Information filing in cases where an exemption is claimed under this subchapter, except in accordance with the provisions of an exemption under this subchapter that explicitly authorizes the resell, transfer, reexport, retransfer, transshipment, or disposition of a defense article without such approval. Exporters must determine the specific end-user, end-use, and destination prior to submitting an application to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls or claiming an exemption under this subchapter.


(b) The exporter, U.S. or foreign, must inform the end-user and all consignees that the defense articles being exported are subject to U.S. export laws and regulations as follows:


(1) The exporter must incorporate the following information as an integral part of the commercial invoice, whenever defense articles are to be shipped (exported in tangible form), retransferred (in tangible form), or reexported (in tangible form) pursuant to a license or other approval under this subchapter:


(i) The country of ultimate destination;


(ii) The end-user;


(iii) The license or other approval number or exemption citation; and


(iv) The following statement: “These items are controlled by the U.S. government and authorized for export only to the country of ultimate destination for use by the ultimate consignee or end-user(s) herein identified. They may not be resold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of, to any other country or to any person other than the authorized ultimate consignee or end-user(s), either in their original form or after being incorporated into other items, without first obtaining approval from the U.S. government or as otherwise authorized by U.S. law and regulations.”


(2) When exporting items subject to the EAR pursuant to a Department of State license or other approval, the U.S. exporter must also provide the end-user and consignees with the appropriate EAR classification information for each item. This includes the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) or EAR99 designation.


(c) Any U.S. person or foreign person requesting written approval from the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls for the reexport, retransfer, other disposition, or change in end-use, end-user, or destination of a defense article initially exported or transferred pursuant to a license or other written approval, or an exemption under this subchapter, must submit all the documentation required for a permanent export license (*see* § 123.1 of this subchapter) and shall also submit the following:


(1) The license number, written authorization, or exemption under which the defense article or defense service was previously authorized for export from the United States (_Note:_ For exports under exemptions at § 126.16 or § 126.17 of this subchapter, the original end-use, program, project, or operation under which the item was exported must be identified.);


(2) A precise description, quantity, and value of the defense article or defense service;


(3) A description and identification of the new end-user, end-use, and destination; and


(4) With regard to any request for such approval relating to a defense article or defense service initially exported pursuant to an exemption contained in § 126.16 or § 126.17 of this subchapter, written request for the prior approval of the transaction from the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls must be submitted: By the original U.S. exporter, provided a written request is received from a member of the Australian Community, as identified in § 126.16 of this subchapter, or the United Kingdom Community, as identified in § 126.17 of this subchapter (where such a written request includes a written certification from the member of the Australian Community or the United Kingdom Community providing the information set forth in § 126.17 of this subchapter); or by a member of the Australian Community or the United Kingdom Community, where such request provides the information set forth in this section. All persons must continue to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements outside of this subchapter concerning the import of defense articles and defense services or the possession or transfer of defense articles, including, but not limited to, regulations issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives found at 27 CFR parts 447, 478, and 479, which are unaffected by the Defense Trade Cooperation Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom and continue to apply fully to defense articles and defense services subject to either of the aforementioned treaties and the exemptions contained in § 126.17 of this subchapter.


(d) The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls may authorize reexport or retransfer of an item subject to the EAR provided that:


(1) The item was initially exported, reexported or transferred pursuant to a Department of State license or other approval;


(2) The item is for end-use in or with a defense article; and


(3) All requirements of paragraph (c) of this section are satisfied for the item subject to the EAR, as well as for the associated defense article.


(e) Reexports or retransfers of U.S.-origin components incorporated into a foreign defense article to NATO, NATO agencies, a government of a NATO country, or the governments of Australia, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, or the Republic of Korea are authorized without the prior written approval of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, provided:


(1) The U.S.-origin components were previously authorized for export from the United States, either by a license, written authorization, or an exemption other than those described in either § 126.16 or § 126.17 of this subchapter;


(2) The U.S.-origin components are not significant military equipment, the items are not major defense equipment sold under contract in the amount of $25,000,000 ($25 million) or more; the articles are not defense articles or defense services sold under a contract in the amount of $100,000,000 ($100 million) or more; and are not identified in part 121 of this subchapter as Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) items; and


(3) The person reexporting the defense article provides written notification to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls of the retransfer not later than 30 days following the reexport. The notification must state the articles being reexported and the recipient government.


(4) The original license or other approval of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls did not include retransfer or reexport restrictions prohibiting use of this exemption.
