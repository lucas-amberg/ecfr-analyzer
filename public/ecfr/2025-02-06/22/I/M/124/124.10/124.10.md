# ยง 124.10   Nontransfer and use assurances.

(a) Types of agreements requiring assurances. With respect to any manufacturing license agreement or technical assistance agreement which relates to significant military equipment or classified defense articles, including classified technical data, a Nontransfer and Use Certificate (Form DSP-83) (see ยง 123.10 of this subchapter) signed by the applicant and the foreign party must be submitted to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. With respect to all agreements involving classified articles, including classified technical data, an authorized representative of the foreign government must sign the DSP-83 (or provide the same assurances in the form of a diplomatic note), unless the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls has granted an exception to this requirement. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls may require that a DSP-83 be provided in conjunction with an agreement that does not relate to significant military equipment or classified defense articles. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls may also require with respect to any agreement that an appropriate authority of the foreign party's government also sign the DSP-83 (or provide the same assurances in the form of a diplomatic note).


(b) *Timing of submission of assurances.* Submission of a Form DSP-83 and/or diplomatic note must occur as follows:


(1) Agreements which have been signed by all parties before being submitted to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls may only be submitted along with any required DSP-83 and/or diplomatic note.


(2) If an agreement has not been signed by all parties before being submitted, the required DSP-83 and/or diplomatic note must be submitted along with the signed agreement.
