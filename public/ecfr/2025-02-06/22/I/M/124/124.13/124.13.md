# § 124.13   Procurement by U.S. persons in foreign countries (offshore procurement).

Notwithstanding the other provisions in part 124 of this subchapter, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls may authorize by means of a license (DSP-5) the export of unclassified technical data to foreign persons for offshore procurement of defense articles, provided that:


(a) The contract or purchase order for offshore procurement limits delivery of the defense articles to be produced only to the person in the United States or to an agency of the U.S. Government; and 


(b) The technical data of U.S.-origin to be used in the foreign manufacture of defense articles does not exceed that required for bid purposes on a build-to-print basis; and


(c) The contract or purchase order between the person in the United States and the foreign person: 


(1) Limits the use of the technical data to the manufacture of the defense articles required by the contract or purchase order only; and 


(2) Prohibits the disclosure of the data to any other person except subcontractors within the same country; and 


(3) Prohibits the acquisition of any rights in the data by any foreign person; and


(4) Provides that any subcontracts between foreign persons in the approved country for manufacture of equipment for delivery pursuant to the contract or purchase order contain all the limitations of this paragraph (c); and


(5) Requires the foreign person, including subcontractors, to destroy or return to the person in the United States all of the technical data exported pursuant to the contract or purchase order upon fulfillment of their terms; and


(6) Requires delivery of the defense articles manufactured abroad only to the person in the United States or to an agency of the U.S. Government; and


(d) The person in the United States provides the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls with a copy of each contract, purchase order or subcontract for offshore procurement at the time it is accepted. Each such contract, purchase order or subcontract must clearly identify the article to be produced and must identify the license number or exemption under which the technical data was exported; and


(e) Licenses issued pursuant to this section must be renewed prior to their expiration if offshore procurement is to be extended beyond the period of validity of the original approved license. In all instances a license for offshore procurement must state as the purpose “Offshore procurement in accordance with the conditions established in the ITAR, including § 124.13. No other use will be made of the technical data.” If the technical data involved in an offshore procurement arrangement is otherwise exempt from the licensing requirements of this subchapter (e.g., § 126.4), the DSP-5 referred to in the first sentence of this section is not required. However, the exporter must comply with the other requirements of this section and provide a written certification to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls annually of the offshore procurement activity and cite the exemption under which the technical data was exported. The exemptions under § 125.4 of this subchapter may not be used to establish offshore procurement arrangements.
