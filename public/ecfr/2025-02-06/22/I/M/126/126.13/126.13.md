# § 126.13   Required information.

(a) All applications for licenses (DSP-5, DSP-61, DSP-73, and DSP-85), all requests for approval of agreements and amendments thereto under part 124 of this subchapter, and all requests for other written authorizations (including requests for retransfer or reexport pursuant to § 123.9 of this subchapter) must include a letter signed by a responsible official empowered by the applicant and addressed to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, stating whether:


(1) The applicant or the chief executive officer, president, vice-presidents, secretary, partner, member, other senior officers or officials (e.g., comptroller, treasurer, general counsel) or any member of the board of directors is the subject of an indictment or has been otherwise charged (e.g., by criminal information in lieu of indictment) for, or has been convicted of, violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in § 120.6 of this subchapter;


(2) The applicant or the chief executive officer, president, vice-presidents, secretary, partner, member, other senior officers or officials (e.g., comptroller, treasurer, general counsel) or any member of the board of directors is ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or other approval to temporarily import or export defense articles or defense services from any agency of the U.S. Government;


(3) To the best of the applicant's knowledge, any party to the export as defined in § 120.68(a) of this subchapter has been convicted of violating any of the U.S. criminal statutes enumerated in § 120.6 of this subchapter, or is ineligible to contract with, or to receive a license or other approval to temporarily import or export defense articles or defense services from any agency of the U.S. government; and


(4) The natural person signing the application, notification, or other request for approval (including the statement required by this subchapter) is a citizen or national of the United States, has been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence (and maintains such lawful permanent residence status) under the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(20), 66 Stat. 163), or is an official of a foreign government entity in the United States, or is a foreign person making a request pursuant to § 123.9 of this subchapter.


(b) In addition, all applications for licenses must include the complete names and addresses of all U.S. consignors and freight forwarders, and all foreign consignees and foreign intermediate consignees involved in the transaction. Port Directors of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Department of Defense transmittal authorities will permit only those U.S. consignors or freight forwarders listed on the license to make shipments under the license, and only to those foreign consignees and foreign intermediate consignees listed on the license. Applicants should list all freight forwarders who may be involved with shipments under the license to ensure that the list is complete and to avoid the need for amendments after the license has been approved. If there are unusual or extraordinary circumstances that preclude the specific identification of all the U.S. consignors and freight forwarders and all foreign consignees and foreign intermediate consignees, the applicant must provide a letter of explanation with each application.


(c) In cases when natural foreign persons are employed at or assigned to security-cleared facilities, provision by the applicant of a technology control plan will facilitate processing.
