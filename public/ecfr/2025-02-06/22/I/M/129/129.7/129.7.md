(c) No person may engage in or make a proposal to engage in brokering activities without first obtaining approval of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls if such activities involve countries or persons identified by the Department of State through notice in the _Federal Register,_ with respect to which certain limitations on defense articles or defense services are imposed for reasons of U.S. national security, foreign policy, or law enforcement interests (e.g., an individual subject to debarment pursuant to § 127.7 of this subchapter). (*See* § 127.1(c) of this subchapter for additional disclosure and approval requirements applicable to brokering activities.)


(d) It is the policy of the Department of State to deny requests for approval of brokering activities or proposals to engage in brokering activities involving the countries or persons referred to in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. Any person who knows or has reason to know of brokering activities involving such countries or persons must immediately inform the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls.
