(a) *Development, procurement, maintenance, or use of ICT.* When developing, procuring, maintaining, or using ICT, the Department shall ensure, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the Department, that the ICT allows, regardless of the type of medium of the technology, that—


(1) Individuals with disabilities who are Department employees have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access to and use of the information and data by Department employees who are not individuals with disabilities; and


(2) Individuals with disabilities who are members of the public seeking information or services from the Department have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access to and use of the information and data by such members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities.


(b) In meeting its obligations under paragraph (a) of this section, the Department shall comply with the Revised 508 Standards (36 CFR 1194.1 and appendices A, C and D to 36 CFR part 1194).


(c) *Alternative means of access when undue burden is imposed.* When development, procurement, maintenance, or use of ICT that meets the standards as provided in 36 CFR part 1194.1 would impose an undue burden, the Department shall provide individuals with disabilities covered by this section with the relevant information and data by an alternative means of access that allows the individual to use the information and data.


(d) *Procedures for determining undue burden.* The Department procedures for finding that full compliance with 36 CFR part 1194.1 would impose an undue burden can be found at: *http://www.state.gov/m/irm/impact/126338.htm.*
