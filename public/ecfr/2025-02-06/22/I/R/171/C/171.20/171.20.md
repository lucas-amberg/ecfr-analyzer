# ยง 171.20   Purpose and scope.

This subpart contains the rules that the Department follows when implementing certain provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (PA), as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a. These rules should be read together with the statute. The rules in this subpart apply to all records in systems of records maintained by the Department that are retrieved by an individual's name or personal identifier. They describe the procedures by which individuals may request access to records about themselves, request amendment or correction of those records, and request an accounting of disclosures of those records by the Department. If any records retrieved pursuant to an access request under the PA are found to be exempt from access under that Act, they will be processed for possible disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended. No fees shall be charged when an individual requests access to or amendment of his or her own PA records.
