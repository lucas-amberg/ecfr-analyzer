# ยง 171.22   Request for access to records.

(a) *In general.* Requests for access to records under the PA must be made in writing and sent to the Office of Information Programs and Services, the Law Enforcement Liaison Division of the Passport Services directorate within the Bureau of Consular Affairs, or the Office of Inspector General at the addresses given in ยง 171.4. The Director of the Office of Information Programs and Services (A/GIS/IPS) is responsible for acting on all PA requests for Department records except for requests received directly by the Office of Inspector General, which processes its own requests for information, and the Law Enforcement Liaison Division of the Passport Services directorate within the Bureau of Consular Affairs, which receives directly and processes its own PA requests for information as described in PA System of Record Notice STATE-26. All processing of PA requests coming under the jurisdiction of the Directorates for Visa Services and Overseas Citizens Services in the Bureau of Consular Affairs, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, the Bureau of Global Talent Management, the Bureau of Medical Services, and the Foreign Service Grievance Board (FSGB) are handled by those bureaus or offices.


(b) *Description of records sought.* Requests for access should describe the requested record(s) in sufficient detail to permit identification of the record(s). At a minimum, requests should include the individual's full name (including maiden name, if appropriate) and any other names used, current complete mailing address, and date and place of birth (city, state, and country). Helpful information includes the approximate time period of the record and the circumstances that give the individual reason to believe that the Department maintains a record under the individual's name or personal identifier, and, if known, the system of records in which the record is maintained. In certain instances, it may be necessary for the Department to request additional information from the requester, either to ensure a full search, or to ensure that a record retrieved does in fact pertain to the individual.


(c) *Verification of personal identity.* The Department will require reasonable identification of individuals requesting records about themselves under the PA's access provisions to ensure that records are only accessed by the proper persons. Requesters must state their full name, current address, citizenship or legal permanent resident alien status, and date and place of birth (city, state, and country). The request must be signed, and the requester's signature must be either notarized or made under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746. If the requester seeks records under another name the requester has used, a statement, under penalty of perjury, that the requester has also used the other name must be included. Requesters seeking access to copies of the Passport Services' passport records must meet the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section.


(d) *Special requirements for passport records.* Given the sensitive nature of passport records and their use, requesters seeking access to copies of passport records from Passport Services under the PA must submit a letter that is either notarized or made under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746, which includes the full name at birth and any subsequent name changes of the individual whose records are being requested (if submitting the request on behalf of a minor, provide the representative's full name as well); the date and place of birth of the individual whose records are being requested; the requester's current mailing address; and, if available, daytime telephone number and email address; the date or estimated date the passport(s) was issued; the passport number of the person whose records are being sought, if known; and any other information that will help to locate the records. The requester must also include a clear copy of both sides of the requester's valid government-issued photo identification, e.g., a driver's license.


(e) *Authorized third party access.* The Department shall process all properly authorized third party requests, as described in this section, under the PA. In the absence of proper authorization from the individual to whom the records pertain, the Department will process third party requests under the FOIA. The Department's forms DS-4240-R and DS-4240-C, respectively, may be used to certify identity and provide third party authorization. Forms created by other Federal agencies will not be accepted.


(1) *Parents and guardians of minor children.* Upon presentation of acceptable documentation of the parental or guardian relationship, a parent or guardian of a U.S. citizen or LPR minor (an unmarried person under the age of 18) may, on behalf of the minor, request records under the PA pertaining to the minor. In any case, U.S. citizen or LPR minors may request such records on their own behalf. When making a request as the parent or guardian of a minor child, for access to records about that individual, a requester must establish: (1) the identity of the individual who is the subject of the records, by stating the name, current address, date and place of birth; (2) the requester's own identity, as required in paragraph (c) of this section; (3) that the requester is the parent of that individual, which the requester may prove by providing a copy of the individual's birth certificate showing parentage, or by providing a court order establishing guardianship; and (4) that the requester is acting on behalf of that individual in making the request.


(2) *Guardians of incompetent adults.* A guardian of an individual who has been declared by a court to be incompetent may act for and on behalf of the incompetent individual upon presentation of appropriate documentation of the guardian relationship.


(i) *Verification of guardianship of incompetent adult.* When making a request as the guardian of someone determined by a court to be incompetent, for access to records about that individual, a requester must establish: (1) the identity of the individual who is the subject of the records, by stating the name, current address, date and place of birth; (2) the requester's own identity, as required in paragraph (c) of this section; (3) that the requester is the guardian of that individual, which the requester may prove by providing a copy of a court order establishing guardianship; and (4) that the requester is acting on behalf of that individual in making the request.


(ii) *Authorized representatives or designees.* When an individual wishes to authorize the Department to permit a third party access to his or her records, the individual to whom the records pertain must submit, in addition to the identity verification information described in paragraph (c) (or paragraph (d) of this section if the request is for passport records), a signed statement from the individual to whom the records pertain, either notarized or made under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746, giving the Department authorization to release records about the individual to the third party. The designated third party must submit identity verification information described in paragraph (c). Third party requesters seeking access to copies of the Passport Office's records must submit a clear copy of both sides of a valid government-issued photo identification (e.g., a driver's license) in addition to the other information described above.


(f) *Referrals and consultations.* If the Department determines that records retrieved as responsive to the request were created by another agency, it ordinarily will refer the records to the originating agency for direct response to the requester. If the Department determines that Department records retrieved as responsive to the request are of interest to another agency, it may consult with the other agency before responding to the request. The Department may make agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals for particular types of records.


(g) *Records relating to civil actions.* Nothing in this subpart entitles an individual to access any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.


(h) *Time limits.* The Department will acknowledge the request promptly and furnish the requested information as soon as possible thereafter.
