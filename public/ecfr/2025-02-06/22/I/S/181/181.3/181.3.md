# ยง 181.3   Determinations with respect to international agreements.

(a) Whether any undertaking, document, or set of documents constitutes or would constitute an international agreement within the meaning of the Act shall be determined by the Legal Adviser of the Department of State, a Deputy Legal Adviser, or in most cases the Assistant Legal Adviser for Treaty Affairs. Such determinations shall be made either on a case-by-case basis, or on periodic consultation, as appropriate.

The transmittal shall be made prior to or simultaneously with the request for consultations with the Secretary of State required by subsection (g) of the Act and ยง 181.6.


(c) Agencies to which paragraph (b) of this section applies shall consult periodically with the Assistant Legal Adviser for Treaty Affairs in order to determine which categories of arrangements for which they are responsible are likely to be international agreements within the meaning of the Act.
