(a) The Secretary of State from time to time shall declare when and where individuals in the civil or uniformed services of the United States, or a citizen or resident alien of the United States rendering personal services to the United States abroad similar to the service of a civil officer or employee of the United States, have been placed in captive status because of hostile action abroad directed against the United States and occurring or continuing between November 4, 1979, and such date as may be declared by the President under section 101(2)(A) of the Hostage Relief Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-449, hereafter “the Act”) or January 1, 1983, whichever is later. Each such declaration shall be published in the _Federal Register._

(b) The Secretary of State upon his or her own initiative, or upon application under § 191.2 shall determine which individuals in captive status as so declared shall be considered hostages eligible for benefits under the Act. The Secretary shall also determine who is eligible under the Act for benefits as a member of a family or household of a hostage. The determination of the Secretary shall be final, but any interested person may request reconsideration on the basis of information not considered at the time of original determination. The criteria for determination are set forth in sections 101 and 205 of the Act, and in these regulations.
