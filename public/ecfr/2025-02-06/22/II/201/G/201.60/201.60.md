# ยง 201.60   Purpose and applicability of this subpart.

This subpart prescribes rules relating to prices, discounts, commissions, credits, allowances, and other payments. These rules shall be observed in the procurement of commodities and commodity-related services financed under this part. The rules implement and supplement the requirements of the Act relating to prices in such procurement. The general purpose of these rules is to assure the prudent use of USAID funds. 


(a) *Statutory price limitations.* (1) Section 604(a) of the Act provides *inter alia* that funds made available under this Act may be used for procurement outside the United States only if the price of any commodity procured in bulk is lower than the market price prevailing in the United States at the time of procurement adjusted for differences in the cost of transportation to destination, quality, and terms of payment. 


(2) Section 604(b) of the Act provides that no funds made available under this Act shall be used for the purchase in bulk of any commodities at prices higher than the market price prevailing in the United States at the time of purchase, adjusted for differences in the cost of transportation to destination, quality, and terms of payment. 


(b) *Transactions covered.* The rules and conditions prescribed by this subpart apply to all USAID-financed transactions subject to this regulation, whether or not the commodities are purchased in bulk. 


(c) *Compliance.* Compliance with this subpart G and with any additional price requirement contained in the implementing document shall be a condition to the financing by USAID of procurement transactions under this part. Post-audit of transactions will be made by USAID to determine whether there has been such compliance.
