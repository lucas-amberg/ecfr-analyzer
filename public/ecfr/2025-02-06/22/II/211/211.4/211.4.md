# § 211.4   Availability and shipment of commodities.

(a) *Shipment, distribution and use of commodities.* Commodities shall be available for shipment, distribution and use in accordance with the provisions of the approved Operational Plan and AER, or TA and this Regulation 11. 


(b) *Transfer of title and delivery.* (1) Unless the approved Operational Plan or TA provides otherwise, title to the commodity shall pass—


(i) For nongovernmental cooperating sponsors, at the point in the United States at which the ocean carrier or its agents take possession of the cargo (generally f.a.s. or f.o.b. vessel U.S. port); or 


(ii) For governmental cooperating sponsors, at the destination port of entry, upon completion of discharge by the ocean carrier (non-landlocked countries), or at the destination point of entry, upon completion of delivery by the inland carrier (landlocked countries). 


(2) Nongovernmental cooperating sponsors shall make the necessary arrangements to accept commodities at the points of availability designated by CCC. 


(c) *Processing, handling, transportation and other costs.* (1) Except as othervise provided in the Operational Plan or TA, the United States will pay in accordance with this paragraph (c) processing, handling, transportation, and other incidental costs incurred in making commodities available to cooperating sponsors at U.S. ports or U.S. inland destinations, up to the point at which the ocean carrier takes possession of the cargo. 


(2) The United States will finance the transfer of commodities at the lowest combination inland and ocean transportation costs as determined by the United States and in sizes and types of packages announced as applicable. If a nongovernmental cooperating sponsor requests changes to these standards which are made by the United States as an accommodation to the cooperating sponsor and these changes result in costs over those the United States otherwise would have incurred, the cooperating sponsor shall reimburse the United States for these increased costs promptly upon request. 


(3) All costs and expenses incurred subsequent to the transfer of title to cooperating sponsors shall be borne by them except as otherwise provided herein. Upon the determination that it is in the interests of the program to do so, the United States may pay or reimburse the following additional costs: 


(i) Ocean transportation costs from U.S. ports to the designated ports of entry abroad; or 


(ii) Ocean transportation costs from U.S. ports to designated points of entry abroad in the case—


(A) Of landlocked countries, 


(B) Where ports cannot be used effectively because of natural or other disturbances, 


(C) Where carriers to a specific country are unavailable, or 


(D) Where a substantial savings in cost or time can be effected by the utilization of points of entry other than ports; or 


(iii) In the case of commodities for urgent and extraordinary relief requirements, including prepositioned commodities, transportation costs from designated points of entry or ports of entry abroad to storage and distribution centers and associated storage and distribution costs. 


(d) *Payment or reimbursement of ocean freight costs.* When A.I.D. contracts for ocean carriage, carriers shall be paid by A.I.D., as provided in their contracts of affreightment, upon presentation of Standard Form 1034 and three copies of 1034A (Public Voucher for purchases and services other than personal), together with three copies of the related on-board ocean bill of lading, one copy of which must contain the following certification signed by an authorized representative of the steamship company: 


(e) *Shipping instructions*—(1) *Shipments booked by A.I.D.* Requests for shipment of commodities shall originate with the cooperating sponsor and shall be submitted to USAID or the Diplomatic Post for clearance and transmittal to AID/W. AID/W shall, through cables or letters to USAID or the Diplomatic Post, provide cooperating sponsors (and, where applicable, private voluntary organization or cooperative headquarters) with names of vessels, expected times of arrival (ETAs), and other pertinent information on shipments booked by A.I.D. As soon as possible but not later than 7 days from the time of exportation of commodities, A.I.D.'s freight forwarding contractor shall send applicable ocean bills of lading by airmail, or by the fastest means available, to USDA (Chief, Processed Commodities Division, Kansas City ASCS Commodity Office (KCCO), P.O. Box 419205, Kansas City, Missouri 64141-6205), to USAID or the Diplomatic Post (and where applicable to the USAID Controller and nongovernmental cooperating sponsor headquarters and field representative), to AID/W, FA/OP/TRANS (see § 211.4(d)), and to the consignee in sufficient time to advise of the arrival of the shipment. 


(2) *Shipments booked by nongovernmental cooperating sponsor.* Requests for shipment of commodities shall originate with the cooperating sponsor and shall be cleared by USAID or the Diplomatic Post before transmittal to the cooperating sponsor's headquarters for concurrence and issuance. USAID or the Diplomatic Post shall promptly clear such requests for shipment of commodities or, if there is reason for delay or disapproval, advise the cooperating sponsor and AID/W within seven (7) days of receipt of requests for shipment. After the cooperating sponsor headquarters concurs in the request and issues the order, the original will be sent promptly to AID/W which will forward it to CCC for procurement action with a copy to USAID or the Diplomatic Post. Headquarters of cooperating sponsors which book their own shipments shall provide their representatives and USAID or the Diplomatic Post with the names of vessels, ETAs and other pertinent information on shipments booked. At the time of exportation of commodities, the booking agent representing the cooperating sponsor shall send applicable ocean bills of lading by airmail or by the fastest means available to USDA (Chief, Processed Commodities Division, Kansas City ASCS Commodity Office (KCCO), P.O. Box 419205, Kansas City, Missouri 64141-6205), to USAID or the Diplomatic Post (and where applicable to the USAID Controller and the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor representative), to AID/W, FA/OP/TRANS (see § 211.4(d)), and to the consignee in the country of destination in sufficient time to advise of the arrival of the shipment. Nongovernmental cooperating sponsors also will forward cable advice of actual exportation to their program directors in countries within the Caribbean area in view of the short transit time from U.S. port to destination. 


(3) Cooperating sponsors awarding USAID-financed ocean transportation bookings of food aid under the Public Law 480, title II program shall follow consistent, transparent, fair and effective procedures. In order to promote these objectives, USAID may formulate, and from time-to-time amend, uniform standard booking guidelines relating to such bookings. Guidelines will be finalized only after consultation with affected cooperating sponsors, freight forwarders and carriers as required by the Agricultural Development and Trade Act of 1990 or other applicable legislation. Copies of the guidelines and any proposed amendments may be obtained from the Transportation Division, Office of Procurement, Agency for International Development, Washington, DC 20523.


(f) *Tolerances.* Delivery by the United States to the cooperating sponsor at point of transfer of title within a tolerance of 5 percent (2 percent in the case of quantities over 10,000 metric tons) plus or minus, of the quantity ordered for shipment shall be regarded as completion of delivery. There shall be no tolerance with respect to the ocean carrier's responsibility to deliver the entire cargo shipped and the United States assumes no obligation for failure by an ocean carrier to complete delivery to port of discharge. 


(g) *Conflict of interest.* (1) Pursuant to section 407(c)(4) of Public Law 480, a person may not be an agent, broker, consultant, or other representative of the U.S. Government, an importer, or an importing country in connection with agricultural commodities provided under Public Law 480 during a fiscal year in which such person acts as an agent, broker, consultant or other representative of a person engaged in providing ocean transportation or ocean transportation-related services for such commodities. 


(i) For purposes of section 407(c)(4), the term “transportation-related services” means lightening, stevedoring, bagging or inland transportation to the destination point. 


(ii) The prohibition does not preclude payment by ocean carriers of compensation or brokerage fees on a shipment-by-shipment basis as provided in governing tariffs or charter parties to persons performing freight forwarding or charter broking services under contract to the U.S. Government. 


(2) Pursuant to section 407(d)(3) of Public Law 480, freight agents employed by A.I.D. under title I, II or III of Public Law 480 shall not represent any other foreign government during the period of their contract with the United States Government. This restriction applies both to charter brokers and freight forwarders whether they are prime contractors or subcontractors of A.I.D. 


(3) This paragraph (g) does not apply to shipments booked by nongovernmental cooperating sponsors or their agents.
