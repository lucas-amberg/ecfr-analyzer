# § 211.9   Liability for loss damage or improper distribution of commodities.

(Where the instructions in this § 211.9 state that the cooperating sponsor should contact USDA or CCC, the contact office is: Kansas City ASCS Commodity Office (KCCO), P.O. Box 419205, Kansas City, Missouri 64141-6205. For Section 211.9 (a) and (b) contact: KCCO, Chief, Processed Commodities Division. For § 211.9(c) contact: KCCO, Chief, Claims and Collections Division, Kansas City, Missouri 64141-6105.) 


(a) *Fault of cooperating sponsor prior to loading on ocean vessel.* A cooperating sponsor and A.I.D. shall agree on a schedule for shipping commodities. A nongovernmental cooperating sponsor that books cargo for ocean transportation must notify USDA immediately if the vessel does not arrive at the U.S. port of export in accordance with the agreed shipping schedule. USDA will determine whether the commodity shall be 


(1) Moved to another available outlet; 


(2) Stored at the port for delivery to the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor when a vessel is available for loading; or 


(3) Disposed of as USDA may deem proper.


(b) *Fault of others prior to loading on ocean vessel.* A nongovernmental cooperating sponsor shall immediately notify CCC if there is a loss of or damage to commodities, between the time title is transferred to the cooperating sponsor and the time the commodities are loaded on board the vessel, that is caused by the act or omission of a third party, such as a warehouseman or carrier, who is or may be legally liable for the loss or damage. The cooperating sponsor also shall promptly assign to CCC any claim it has against the third party and forward to CCC all documents relating to the loss or damage and the claim. CCC shall have the right to initiate, prosecute, and retain the proceeds all claims for such loss or damage. 


(c) *Ocean carrier loss and damage*—(1) *Survey and outturn reports.* (i) Nongovernmental cooperating sponsors shall arrange for an independent cargo surveyor to attend the discharge of the cargo and to count or weigh the cargo and examine its condition, unless USAID or the Diplomatic Post determines that such examination is not feasible, or if CCC has made other provision for such examinations and reports. The surveyor shall prepare a report of its findings showing the quantity and condition of the commodities discharged. The report also shall show the probable cause of any damage noted, and set forth the time and place when the examination was made. If practicable, the examination of the cargo shall be conducted jointly by the surveyor, the consignee, and the ocean carrier, and the survey report shall be signed by all parties. Customs receipts, port authority reports, shortlanding certificates, cargo boat notes, stevedore's tallies, etc., where applicable, shall be obtained and furnished with the report of the surveyor. Whenever a damaged commodity appears unfit for its intended use, the cooperating sponsor shall obtain 


(A) A certification by a public health official or similar competent authority regarding the condition of the commodity; and 


(B) A certificate of disposition if the commodity is determined to be unfit for its intended use. These certificates shall be obtained as soon as possible after discharge of the cargo. If the cooperating sponsor can provide a narrative chronology or other commentary to assist in the adjudication of ocean transportation claims, this information should be forwarded as follows: cooperating sponsors shall prepare such a statement in any case where the loss is estimated to be in excess of $5,000; all documentation shall be in English or supported by an English translation and shall be forwarded as set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) (iii) and (iv) of this section; and the cost of an English translation shall be incorporated into the survey fee. The cooperating sponsor may, at its option, also engage the independent surveyor to supervise clearance and delivery of the cargo from customs or port areas to the cooperating sponsor or its agent and to issue delivery survey reports thereon. 


(ii) In the event of cargo loss or damage, a nongovernmental cooperating sponsor shall provide the names and addresses of individuals who were present at the time of discharge and during survey and who can verify the quantity lost or damaged. In the case of bulk grain shipments, the cooperating sponsor shall obtain the services of an independent surveyor to: 


(A) Observe discharge of the cargo; 


(B) Report on discharging method (including whether a scale was used, its type and calibration and other factors affecting its accuracy, or an explanation of why a scale was not used and how weight was determined); 


(C) Furnish information as to whether cargo was discharged in accordance with port customs; 


(D) Provide actual or estimated (if scales not used) quantity of cargo lost during discharge and specify how such losses occurred; 


(E) Obtain copies of port and/or ship records including scale weights, where applicable, to show quantity discharged; 


(F) Verify that upon conclusion of discharge, cargo holds are empty; 


(G) Provide to USDA information as to quantity, type and cause of lost or damaged cargo; 


(H) Furnish daily tally totals and any other pertinent information about the bagging of the bulk cargo when cargo is bagged or stacked by vessel interests; and 


(I) Notify the cooperating sponsor immediately if additional services are necessary to protect cargo interests or if the surveyor has reason to believe that the correct quantity was not discharged.


(iii) Cooperating sponsors shall send to USDA copies of all reports and documents pertaining to the discharge of commodities. For those surveys arranged by CCC, the cooperating sponsors may obtain a copy of the report from the local USAID Food for Peace Officer. 


(iv) CCC will reimburse a nongovernmental cooperating sponsor for the costs incurred by it in obtaining the services of an independent surveyor to conduct examinations of the cargo and render the report set forth above. Reimbursement by CCC will be made upon receipt by CCC of the survey report and the surveyor's invoice or other documents that establish the survey cost. However, CCC will not reimburse a nongovernmental cooperating sponsor for the costs of only a delivery survey, in the absence of a discharge survey, or for any other survey not taken contemporaneously with the discharge of the vessel, unless such deviation from the documentation requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section is justified to the satisfaction of CCC.


(v) CCC normally will contract for the survey of cargo on shipments furnished under Transfer Authorizations, including shipments for which A.I.D. contracts for the ocean transportation services. Survey contracts normally will be let on a competitive bid basis. However, if a USAID or Diplomatic Post desires that CCC limit its consideration to only certain selected surveyors, USAID or the Diplomatic Post shall furnish AID/W a list of eligible surveyors for forwarding to CCC. Surveyors may be omitted from the list, for instance, based on foreign relations considerations, conflicts of interest, and/or lack of demonstrated capability to carry out surveying responsibilities properly as set forth in the requirements of CCC. Upon receipt of written justification for removal of a particular survey firm, CCC will consider removal of such firm and advise the USAID via AID/W of the final determination. AID/W will furnish CCC's surveying requirements to a USAID or Diplomatic Post upon request. If CCC is unable to find a surveyor at a port to which a shipment has been consigned, CCC may request AID/W to contact USAID or the Diplomatic Post to arrange for a survey. The surveyor's bill for such services shall be submitted to USAID or the Diplomatic Post for review. After the billing has been approved, USAID or the Diplomatic Post either may pay the bill using funds in CCC account 20FT401, if available, or forward the bill to AID/W for transmittal to CCC for payment. If USAID or the Diplomatic Post pays the bill, AID/W shall be advised of the amount paid, and CCC will reimburse USAID or the Diplomatic Post. 


(2) *Claims against ocean carriers.* (i) Whether or not title to commodities has transferred from CCC to the cooperating sponsor, if A.I.D. contracted for the ocean transportation, CCC shall have the right to initiate, prosecute, and retain the proceeds of all claims against ocean carriers for cargo loss and/or damage arising out of shipments of commodities transferred or delivered by CCC hereunder. 


(ii)(A) Unless otherwise provided in the Operational Plan or TA, nongovernmental cooperating sponsors shall file notice of any cargo loss and/or damage with the ocean carrier immediately upon discovery of any such loss and/or damage, promptly initiate claims against the ocean carrier for cargo loss and/or damage, take all necessary action to obtain restitution for losses within any applicable periods of limitations, and transmit to CCC copies of all such claims. However, the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor need not file a claim when the cargo loss and/or damage is not in excess of $100, or in any case when the loss and/or damage is between $100 and $300 and it is determined by the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor that the cost of filing and collecting the claim will exceed the amount of the claim. The nongovernmental cooperating sponsor shall transmit to CCC copies of all claims filed with the ocean carriers for cargo loss and/or damage, as well as information and/or documentation on shipments when no claim is to be filed. When General Average has been declared, no action will be taken by the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor to file or collect claims for loss or damage to commodities. (See paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.) 


(B) The value of commodities misused, lost or damaged shall be determined on the basis of the domestic market price at the time and place the misuse, loss or damage occurred, or, in case it is not feasible to obtain or determine such market price, the f.o.b. or f.a.s. commercial export price of the commodity at the time and place of export, plus ocean freight charges and other costs incurred by the U.S. Government in making delivery to the cooperating sponsor. When value is determined on a cost basis, nongovernmental cooperating sponsors may add to the value any provable costs they have incurred prior to delivery by the ocean carrier. In preparing the claim statement, these costs shall be clearly segregated from costs incurred by the U.S. Government. With respect to claims other than ocean carrier loss or damage claims, at the request of the cooperating sponsor or upon the recommendation of USAID or the Diplomatic Post, AID/W may determine that such value may be established on some other justifiable basis. When replacement is made, the value of commodities misused, lost or damaged shall be their value at the time and place the misuse, loss, or damage occurred and the value of the replacement commodities shall be their value at the time and place replacement is made. 


(C) Amounts collected by nongovernmental cooperating sponsors on claims against ocean carriers not in excess of $200 may be retained by the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor. On claims involving loss and/or damage having a value in excess of $200, nongovernmental cooperating sponsors may retain from collections received by them, the larger of: 


(*1*) The amount of $200 plus 10 percent of the difference between $200 and the total amount collected on the claim, up to a maximum of $500, or 


(*2*) Actual administrative expenses incurred in collection of the claim if approved by CCC.


(D) A nongovernmental cooperating sponsor may redetermine claims on the basis of additional documentation or information, not considered when the claims were originally filed when such documentation or information clearly changes the ocean carrier's liability. Approval of such changes by CCC is not required regardless of amount. However, copies of redetermined claims and supporting documentation or information shall be furnished to CCC. 


(E) A nongovernmental cooperating sponsor may negotiate compromise settlements of claims regardless of the amount thereof, except that proposed compromise settlements of claims having a value in excess of $5,000 shall not be accepted until such action has been approved in writing by CCC. When a claim is compromised, the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor may retain from the amount collected, the amounts authorized in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) and in addition, an amount representing such percentage of the special charges described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) as the compromised amount is to the full amount of the claim. When a claim is not in excess of $600, the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor may terminate collection activity on the claim according to the standards set forth in the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 4 CFR 104.3. Approval of such termination by CCC is not required, but the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor shall notify CCC when collection activity on a claim is terminated. 


(F) All amounts collected in excess of the amounts authorized herein to be retained shall be remitted to CCC. For the purpose of determining the amount to be retained by the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor from the proceeds of claims filed against ocean carriers, the word “claim” shall refer to the loss and/or damage to commodities which are shipped on the same voyage of the same vessel to the same port destination, irrespective of the kinds of commodities shipped or the number of different bills of lading issued by the carrier. If a nongovernmental cooperating sponsor is unable to collect a claim or negotiate an acceptable compromise settlement within the applicable period of limitation or any extension thereof granted in writing by the liable party or parties, the rights of the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor to the claim shall be assigned to CCC in sufficient time to permit the filing of legal action prior to the expiration of the period of limitation or any extension thereof. Nongovernmental cooperating sponsors shall promptly assign their claim rights to CCC upon request. In the event CCC collects or settles the claim after the rights of the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor to the claim have been assigned CCC, CCC shall, except as shown below, pay to the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor the amount the agency or organization would have been entitled to retain had they collected the same amount. However, the additional 10 percent on amounts collected in excess of $200 will be payable only if CCC determines that reasonable efforts were made to collect the claim prior to the assignment, or if payment is deemed to be commensurate with the extra efforts exerted in further documenting claims. In addition, if CCC determines that the documentation requirements of paragraph (c)(1) have not been fulfilled and the lack of such documentation has not been justified to the satisfaction of CCC, CCC reserves the right to deny payment of all allowances to the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor. 


(G) When nongovernmental cooperating sponsors fail to file claims, or permit claims to become time-barred, or fail to provide for the right of CCC to assert such claims, as provided in this § 211.9, and it is determined by CCC that such failure was due to the fault or negligence of the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor, the agency or organization shall be liable to the United States for the cost and freight (C&F) value of the commodities lost to the program. 


(iii) If a cargo loss has been incurred on a nongovernmental cooperating sponsor shipment, and general average has been declared, the nongovernmental cooperating sponsor shall furnish to CCC with a duplicate copy to AID/W— 


(A) Copies of booking confirmations and the applicable on-board bill(s) of lading, 


(B) The related outturn or survey report(s), 


(C) Evidence showing the amount of ocean transportation charges paid to the carrier(s), and 


(D) An assignment to CCC of the cooperating sponsor's right to the claim(s) for such loss. 


(iv) A.I.D. will initiate and prosecute claims against ocean carriers and defend claims by such carriers, arising from or relating to affreightment contracts booked by A.I.D. where the claims involve entitlement to freight and related costs from the U.S. Government. Proceeds of such claims received by A.I.D. shall be returned to CCC pursuant to agreed procedures. 


(d) *Fault of cooperating sponsor in country of distribution.* If a commodity, monetized proceeds or program income is used for a purpose not permitted under the Operational Plan or TA or this Regulation, or if a cooperating sponsor causes loss or damage to a commodity, monetized proceeds or program income through any act or omission or failure to provide proper storage, care and handling, the cooperating sponsor shall pay to the United States the value of the commodities, monetized proceeds or program income, lost, damaged, or misused, unless A.I.D. determines that such improper distribution or use, or such loss or damage, could not have been prevented by proper exercise of the cooperating sponsor's responsibility under the Operational Plan or TA and this Regulation. In determining whether there was a proper exercise of the cooperating sponsor's responsibility, A.I.D. shall consider normal commercial practices in the country of distribution and the problems associated with carrying out programs in developing countries. Payment by the cooperating sponsor shall be made in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, except that the USAID or Diplomatic Post may agree to permit a cooperating sponsor to replace commodities lost, damaged, or misused with similar commodities of equal value. 


(e) *Fault of others in country of distribution and in intermediate country.* (1) In addition to survey and/or outturn reports to determine ocean carrier loss and damage, the cooperating sponsor shall, in the case of landlocked countries, arrange for an independent survey at the point of entry into the recipient country and to make a report as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. CCC will reimburse the cooperating sponsor for the costs of a survey as set forth in paragraph (c)(1)(iv). 


(2) If a cooperating sponsor acquires any right against a person or governmental or nongovernmental organization based on an event for which the person or organization is responsible that resulted in the damage, loss or misuse of any commodity, monetized proceeds or program income, the cooperating sponsor shall file a claim against the liable party or parties for the value of the commodities, monetized proceeds or program income lost damaged or misused and shall make every reasonable effort to collect the claim. A copy of the claim and related documents shall be provided to USAID or the Diplomatic Post. Cooperating sponsors who fail to file or pursue such claims shall be liable to A.I.D. for the value of the commodities or monetized proceeds or program income lost, damaged, or misused: Provided, however, that the cooperating sponsor may elect not to file a claim if the loss is less than $500 and such action is not detrimental to the program. Cooperating sponsors may retain $150 of any amount collected on an individual claim. In addition, cooperating sponsors may, with the written approval of USAID or the Diplomatic Post, retain either special costs such as reasonable legal fees that they have incurred in the collection of a claim, or pay such legal fees with monetized proceeds or program income. Any proposed settlement for less than the full amount of the claim must be approved by USAID or the Diplomatic Post prior to acceptance. When the cooperating sponsor has exhausted all reasonable attempts to collect a claim, it shall request USAID or the Diplomatic Post to provide further instructions in accordance with paragraph (e)(4). 


(3) *Calculation of the amount of a claim against others.* A claim is the right a cooperating sponsor has against a third party as a result of an event for which the third party is responsible that caused the loss, damage or misuse of commodities, monetized proceeds or program income. The amount of the claim is based on the value of the commodities, monetized proceeds or program income lost, damaged or misused as a result of the event. An individual claim may not be broken down artificially to enlarge the amount the cooperating sponsor may retain as an administrative allowance on collection of the claim. For example, if a cooperating sponsor has a contract with a carrier to transport commodities, and losses occur during a single shipment of commodities from points A to B, the cooperating sponsor has one claim against the carrier, and the amount of the claim will be based on the total value of the commodities lost during the shipment from A to B even though some of the loss might have occurred on each of several trucks or by subcontractors used by the carrier to satisfy its contract responsibility to transport the commodities. 


(4) Reasonable attempts to collect the claim shall not be less than the follow-up of initial billings with three progressively stronger demands at not more than 30-day intervals. If these efforts fail to elicit a satisfactory response, legal action in the judicial system of the cooperating country should be pursued unless: 


(i) Liability of the third party is not provable, 


(ii) The cost of pursuing the claim would exceed the amount of the claim, 


(iii) The third party would not have enough assets to satisfy the claim after a judicial decision favorable to the cooperating sponsor, 


(iv) Maintaining legal action in the country's judicial system would seriously impair the cooperating sponsor's ability to conduct an effective program in the country, or 


(v) It is inappropriate for reasons relating to the judiciary or judicial system of the country. 


(5) As an alternative to legal action in the judicial system of the country with regard to claims against a public entity of the government of the cooperating country, the cooperating sponsor and the cooperating country may agree to settle disputed claims by an appropriate administrative procedure and/or arbitration. This alternative may be established in the Host Country Food for Peace Program Agreement required under § 211.3(b), or by a separate formal understanding, and must be submitted to USAID or the Diplomatic Post for review and approval. Resolution of disputed claims by any administrative procedure or arbitration agreed to by the cooperating sponsor and the cooperating country should be final and binding on the parties. 


(f) *Reporting losses to USAID or the Diplomatic Post.* (1) The cooperating sponsor shall provide the USAID or Diplomatic Post a quarterly report regarding any loss, damage or misuse of commodities, monetized proceeds or program income. The report must be provided within 30 days after the close of the calendar quarter and shall contain the following information except for commodity losses less than $500: who had possession of the commodities, monetized proceeds or program income; who, if anyone, might be responsible for the loss, damage or misuse; the kind and quantity of commodities; the size and type of containers; the time and place of loss, damage or misuse; the current location of the commodities; the program number; CCC contract number, if known, and if not known, other identifying numbers printed on the commodity containers; the action taken by the cooperating sponsor with respect to recovery or disposal; and the estimated value of the loss, damage or misuse. If any of this information is not available, the cooperating sponsor shall explain why it is not. The report simply may identify separately commodity losses valued at less than $500 and indicate the estimated value of the commodities lost damaged or misused and the action taken by the cooperating sponsor with respect to recovery or disposal, except that the cooperating sponsor shall inform the USAID or Diplomatic Post if it has reason to believe there is a pattern or trend in the loss, damage or misuse of such commodities and provide the information described above for losses of $500 or more together with such other information available to it. USAID or the Diplomatic Post may require additional information about any commodities lost, damaged or misused. Information in the quarterly report may be provided in tabular form to the extent possible, and the report shall enclose a copy of any claim made by the cooperating sponsor during the reporting period. 


(2) If any commodity, monetized proceeds or program income is lost or misused under circumstances which give a cooperating sponsor reason to believe that the loss or misuse has occurred as a result of criminal activity, the cooperating sponsor shall promptly report these circumstances to the A.I.D. Inspector General through AID/W, USAID or the Diplomatic Post, and subsequently to the appropriate authorities of the cooperating country unless instructed not to do so by A.I.D. The cooperating sponsor also shall cooperate fully with any subsequent investigation by the Inspector General and/or authorities of the cooperating country. 


(g) *Handling claims proceeds.* Claims against ocean carriers shall be collected in U.S. dollars (or in the currency in which freight is paid, or a pro rata share of each) and shall be remitted (less amounts authorized to be retained) by nongovernmental cooperating sponsors to CCC. With respect to commodities, claims against nongovernmental cooperating sponsors shall be paid to CCC or AID/W in U.S. dollars; amounts paid by other cooperating sponsors and third parties in the country of distribution shall be deposited with the U.S. Disbursing Officer, American Embassy, preferably in U.S. dollars with instructions to credit the deposit to CCC Account No. 12X4336, or in local currency with instructions to credit the deposit to Treasury sales account 20FT401. Any conversion required for these deposits shall be at the highest rate of exchange legally obtainable on the date of deposit unless A.I.D. agrees otherwise in writing. With respect to monetized proceeds and program income, amounts recovered should be deposited into the special interest-bearing account established for the monetized proceeds and may be used for purposes of the approved program. 


(h) *General average.* CCC shall— 


(1) Be responsible for settling general average and marine salvage claims; 


(2) Retain the authority to make or authorize any disposition of commodities which have not commenced ocean transit or of which the ocean transit is interrupted, and receive and retain any monetary proceeds resulting from such disposition; 


(3) In the event of a declaration of general average, initiate, prosecute, and retain all proceeds of cargo loss and damage claims against ocean carriers; and 


(4) Receive and retain any allowance in general average. CCC will pay any general average or marine salvage claims determined to be due.
