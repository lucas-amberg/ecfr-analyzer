# § 213.1   Purpose and scope.

(a) *Purpose.* This part prescribes standards and procedures for the collection and disposal of claims due to the United States from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). This part covers USAID's administrative actions to collect claims/debts (including administrative and salary offsets; compromise; suspension or termination of collection actions; transfer and/or referral of claims to the U.S. Departments of the Treasury and Justice). The terms “claim” and “debt” are synonymous and interchangeable. They refer to an amount of money, funds, or property that an appropriate USAID official has determined to be due to the United States from any person, organization, or entity except another Federal Department or Agency.


(b) *Scope.* The standards and procedures in this part are applicable to all claims and debts for which a statute, regulation, or contract does not prescribe different standards or procedures.


(c) *Applicability.* This part does not apply to USAID:


(1) Claims arising out of loans for which compromise and collection authority is conferred by section 635(g)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended;


(2) Claims arising from investment guaranty operations for which settlement and arbitration authority is conferred by section 635(l) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended;


(3) Claims against any foreign country or any political subdivision thereof, or any public international organization;


(4) Claims where the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) determines that the achievement of the purposes of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, or any other provision of law administered by USAID require a different course of action;


(5) Claims owed USAID by other Federal Departments and Agencies. Such debts will be resolved by negotiation between the Departments/Agencies; and


(6) Claims that appear to be fraudulent, false, or misrepresented by a party with an interest in the claim except to the extent provided in § 213.4.
