# ยง 213.32   Standards for termination of collection action.

The CFO may terminate collection action on a debt when he or she determines that:


(a) The Government cannot collect or enforce collection of any significant sum from the debtor, having due regard for available judicial remedies, the debtor's ability to pay, and the exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law; 


(b) The debtor cannot be located, there is no security remaining to be liquidated, and the prospects of collecting by offset are too remote to justify retention of the claim;


(c) The cost of further collection action is likely to exceed the amount recoverable; 


(d) The claim is determined to be legally without merit or enforcement of the debt is barred by any applicable statute of limitations; 


(e) The evidence necessary to prove the claim cannot be produced or the necessary witnesses are unavailable and efforts to induce voluntary payment have failed; or 


(f) The debt against the debtor has been discharged in bankruptcy.
