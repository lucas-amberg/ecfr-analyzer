# ยง 213.37   Referrals to the U.S. Department of Justice.

(a) The CFO, through USAID's cross-servicing agreement with Fiscal Service and by direct action, refers to DOJ for litigation all claims on which the Federal Government has taken aggressive collection actions but which could not be collected, compromised, suspended, or terminated. USAID makes such referrals as early as possible, consistent with aggressive Agency collection action, and within the period for bringing a timely suit against the debtor. Unless otherwise provided by DOJ's regulations or procedures, USAID refers for litigation debts of more than $2,500 but less than $1 million to DOJ's Nationwide Central Intake Facility, as required by the instructions for the Claims-Collection Litigation Report (CCLR). USAID shall refer debts of more than $1 million to the Civil Division at DOJ.


(b) The CFO will clearly indicate on the CCLR the actions the DOJ should take on the referred claim.
