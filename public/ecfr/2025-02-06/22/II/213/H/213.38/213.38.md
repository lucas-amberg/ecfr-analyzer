# § 213.38   Mandatory transfer of debts to Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service—general.

(a) USAID's procedures call for the transfer of legally enforceable debt to Fiscal Service 90 days from the date provided on the Agency's initial written demand-for-payment notice issued to the debtor. A debt is legally enforceable if the Agency has made a final determination that the debt, in the amount stated, is due and there are no legal bars to collection action. A debt is not considered legally enforceable for purposes of mandatory transfer to Fiscal Service if a debt is the subject of a pending administrative review process required by statute or regulation and collection action during the review process is prohibited.


(b) Except as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, USAID will transfer any debt covered by this part that is more than 120 days delinquent to Fiscal Service for debt-collection services. A debt is considered 120 days delinquent for purposes of this section if it is 120 days past due and is legally enforceable.
