(4) Peace Corps' willingness to discuss alternative payment arrangements and how the debtor may enter into a written agreement to repay the debt under terms acceptable to Peace Corps;


(5) The name, address, and telephone number of a contact person or office within Peace Corps;


(6) Peace Corps' intention to enforce collection if the debtor fails to pay or otherwise resolve the debt, by taking one or more of the following actions:

(ii) Referral to private collection agency;


(iii) Report to credit bureaus;


(iv) Administrative wage garnishment;


(v) Referral to Department of Justice for litigation action;


(vi) Referral to Financial Management Service of the Department of the Treasury for collection;


(vii) Other actions as permitted by the FCCS and applicable law.


(7) How the debtor may inspect and copy records related to the debt;

(9) The debtor's right, if any, to request waiver of collection of certain debts, as applicable;


(10) Requirement that the debtor advise Peace Corps of any bankruptcy proceeding of the debtor.


(c) Peace Corps may omit from a notice to a debtor one or more of the provisions contained in paragraphs (b) (6) through (10) of this section if Peace Corps determines that any provision is not legally required given the collection remedies to be applied to a particular debt, or which have already been provided by prior notice, applicable agreement, or contract.
