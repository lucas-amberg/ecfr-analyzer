# ยง 904.3   Relationship to other remedies.

(a) A grievant may not file a grievance with the Board if the grievant has formally requested, prior to filing a grievance, that the matter or matters which are the basis of the grievance be considered or resolved and relief provided under another provision of law, regulation, or executive order, and the matter has been carried to final decision under such provision on its merits or is still under consideration. This provision shall not apply to grievants who have filed a prohibited personnel practice charge before the Special Counsel for the Merit Systems Protection Board.


(b) If a grievant is not prohibited from filing a grievance under paragraph (a) of this section, the grievant may file with the Board a grievance which is also eligible for consideration, resolution, and relief as a prohibited personnel practice complaint under the provisions of law relating to the Merit Systems Protection Board or Special Counsel, or under a regulation or executive order. An election of remedies under this section shall be final upon the acceptance of jurisdiction by the Board.
