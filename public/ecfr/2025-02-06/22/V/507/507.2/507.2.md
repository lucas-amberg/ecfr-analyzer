# § 507.2   Definitions.

The following definitions apply:


(a) The term *agency* includes any establishment in the executive branch of the government headed by a collegial body composed of two or more individual members, a majority of whom are appointed to such position by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, and any subdivision thereof authorized to act on behalf of the agency. The Broadcasting Board of Governors is a government agency headed by a nine-member board, eight of whom are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, and the ninth being the Secretary of State. Therefore, the Broadcasting Board of Governors is an “agency” under these terms.


(b) The term *meeting* means the deliberation of this Board where such deliberations determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of official Board business.


(c) The term *member* means an individual who belongs to the Board who has been appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate or is the Secretary of State.
