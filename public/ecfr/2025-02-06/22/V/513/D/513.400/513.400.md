# § 513.400   General.

(a) The suspending official may suspend a person for any of the causes in § 513.405 using procedures established in §§ 513.410 through 513.413.


(b) Suspension is a serious action to be imposed only when:


(1) There exists adequate evidence of one or more of the causes set out in § 513.405, and


(2) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest. 


(c) In assessing the adequacy of the evidence, the Board should consider how much information is available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. This assessment should include an examination of basic documents such as grants, cooperative agreements, loan authorizations, and contracts.
