# ยง 713.3   How do I request nonpublic records or testimony?

To request nonpublic records or the testimony of an DFC employee, you must submit a written request as described in ยง 713.4 to the Vice-President/General Counsel of DFC. If you serve a subpoena on DFC or an DFC employee before submitting a written request and receiving a final determination, DFC will oppose the subpoena on the grounds that you failed to follow the requirements of this part.
