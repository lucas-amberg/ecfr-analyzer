# ยง 713.9   If my request is granted, what restrictions may apply?

(a) *Records.* The Vice-President/General Counsel may impose conditions or restrictions on the release of nonpublic records, including a requirement that you obtain a protective order or execute a confidentiality agreement with the other parties in the legal proceeding that limits access to and any further disclosure of the nonpublic records. The terms of a confidentiality agreement or protective order must be acceptable to the Vice-President/General Counsel. In cases where protective orders or confidentiality agreements have already been executed, DFC may condition the release of nonpublic records on an amendment to the existing protective order or confidentiality agreement.


(b) *Testimony.* The Vice-President/General Counsel may impose conditions or restrictions on the testimony of DFC employees, including, for example, limiting the areas of testimony or requiring you and the other parties to the legal proceeding to agree that the transcript of the testimony will be kept under seal or will only be used or made available in the particular legal proceeding for which you requested the testimony. The Vice-President/General Counsel may also require you to provide a copy of the transcript of the testimony to DFC at your expense.
