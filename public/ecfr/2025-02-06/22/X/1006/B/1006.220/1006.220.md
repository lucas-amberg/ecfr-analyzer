# § 1006.220   Are any procurement contracts included as covered transactions?

(a) Covered transactions under this part—


(1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a Federal agency; but 


(2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal participants in nonprocurement covered transactions (see appendix to this part). 


(b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered transaction if any of the following applies: 


(1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement transaction that is covered under § 1006.210, and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000. 


(2) The contract requires the consent of a(n) Inter-American Foundation official. In that case, the contract, regardless of the amount, always is a covered transaction, and it does not matter who awarded it. For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the appendix to this part. 


(3) The contract is for federally-required audit services.
