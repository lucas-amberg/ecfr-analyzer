# § 1203.735-402   Employees not required to submit statements.

(a) Employees in positions that meet the criteria in paragraph (c) of § 1203.735-401 may be excluded from the reporting requirement when the agency head or designee determines that:


(1) The duties of the position are such that the likelihood of the incumbent's involvement in a conflict-of-interest situation is remote;


(2) The duties of the position are at such a level of responsibility that the submission of a statement of employment and financial interests is not necessary because of the degree of supervision and review over incumbent or the inconsequential effect on the integrity of the Government.


(b) A statement of employment and financial interests is not required by the regulations in this part from an agency head, or a full-time member of a committee, board, or commission appointed by the President. These employees are subject to separate reporting requirements under section 401 of Exective Order 11222.


(c) Special Government employees not required to submit statements. An agency head may waive the requirement of this section for the submission of a statement of employment and financial interest in the case of a special Government employee who is not a consultant or an expert when the agency finds that the duties of the position held by that special Government employee are of a nature and at such a level of responsibility that the submission of the statement by the incumbent is not necessary to protect the integrity of the Government. For the purpose of this paragraph, “consultant” and “expert” have the meanings given those terms by chapter 304 of the Federal Personnel Manual, but do not include a physician, dentist, or allied medical specialist whose services are procured to provide care and service to patients.
