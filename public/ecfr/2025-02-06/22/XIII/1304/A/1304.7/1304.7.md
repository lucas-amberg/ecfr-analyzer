# § 1304.7   Responses to requests.

(a) *General information.* MCC, to the extent practicable, will communicate with requesters who have access to the internet via email or web portal.


(b) *Acknowledgment of requests.* MCC shall acknowledge the request in writing and assign a tracking number for processing purposes.


(c) *Estimated dates of completion and interim responses.* Upon request, MCC shall provide an estimated response date. If a request involves a voluminous amount of material or searches in multiple locations, MCC shall provide interim responses by releasing the records on a rolling basis.


(d) *Granting requests.* MCC will notify the requestor in writing if it determines that it will grant a request in full or in part. MCC shall inform the requester of any fees charged and shall disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees.


(e) *Partial grant of requests.* MCC shall consider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever the agency determines that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible. MCC shall take reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information.


(f) *Denial or adverse determination of requests.* Except as otherwise provided in this part, MCC shall withhold information only if—


(1) It reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption under the FOIA or disclosure is prohibited by law;


(2) The request does not reasonably describe the records sought;


(3) The information sought is not a record subject to the FOIA;


(4) The information sought does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or


(5) The records are not in the readily producible form or format sought by the requester.


(g) *Markings on released documents.* Records disclosed in part shall be marked clearly to show the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption.
