# ยง 1500.6   Procedure for announcing meetings.

(a) In the case of each meeting of the Board of Directors, the Foundation shall make public, at least one week before the meeting, the following information:


(1) Time of the meeting;


(2) Place of the meeting;


(3) Subject matter of the meeting;


(4) Whether the meeting or parts thereof are to be open or closed to the public; and


(5) The name and telephone number of the person designated by the Board to respond to requests for information about the meeting.


(b) The period of one week for the public announcement required by paragraph (a) of this section may be reduced if a majority of the Board of Directors of the Foundation determines by a recorded vote that the Foundation requires that such a meeting be called at an earlier date, in which case the Foundation shall make public announcement of the time, place, and subject matter of such meeting, and whether open or closed to the public, at the earliest practicable time.


(c) Immediately following the public announcement, the Foundation shall publish the announcement in the _Federal Register._

(d) The *earliest practicable time,* as used in this subsection, means as soon as possible, which should not be later than the commencement of the meeting or portion in question.


(e) The Secretary of the Foundation shall use reasonable means to assure that the public is fully informed by the public announcements required by this section. Such public announcements may be made by posting notices in the public areas of the Foundation's headquarters and mailing notices to the persons on a list maintained for those who want to receive such announcements.
