# § 1502.4   Written requests.

In order to facilitate the processing of written requests, every petitioner should:


(a) Address his or her request to: Chief FOIA Officer, United States African Development Foundation, 1400 I Street NW., Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20005.


Both the envelope and the request itself, or the email, should be clearly marked: “Freedom of Information Act Request.”


(b) Identify the desired record by name, title, author, a brief description, or number, and date, as applicable. The identification should be specific enough so that a record can be identified and found without unreasonably burdening or disrupting the operations of the Foundation. If the Foundation determines that a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the requestor shall be advised what additional information is needed or informed why the request is insufficient.


(c) Include a check or money order to the order of the “United States African Development Foundation” covering the appropriate search and copying fees, or a request for determination of the fee, or a specified amount that the requestor is willing to pay in connection with the FOIA request.
