# ยง 1506.26   What happens if my employment with USADF ends prior to repaying the full amount of my debt?

If the employee retires, resigns, or the period of employment ends before collection of the debt is completed, the remainder of the debt will be offset from subsequent payments of any nature due the employee (*e.g.* final salary payment, lump-sum leave, etc.).
