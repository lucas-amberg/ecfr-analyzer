Fees to be charged, if any, to any individual for making copies of his or her record will be as follows:


(a) Photocopy reproductions from all types of copying processes, each reproduction image, $0.10 per page.


(b) Where the Foundation undertakes to perform for an individual making a request, or for any other person, services which are very clearly not required to be performed under section 552a, title 5, United States Code, either voluntarily or because such services are required by some other law (e.g., the formal certification of records as true copies, attestation under the seal of the Foundation, etc.), the question of charging fees for such services will be determined by the Director of Administration and Finance, in light of the Federal user charge statute (31 U.S.C. 483a), and any other applicable law.


(c) No fees shall be charged for search time expended by the Foundation to produce a record.
