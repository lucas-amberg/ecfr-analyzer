# ยง 172.1   Purpose and applicability.

This part prescribes the requirements for the procurement, management, and administration of engineering and design related services under 23 U.S.C. 112 and as supplemented by the Uniform Administrative Requirements For Federal Awards rule. The Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements For Federal Awards rule (2 CFR part 200) shall apply except where inconsistent with the requirements of this part and other laws and regulations applicable to the Federal-aid highway program (FAHP). The requirements herein apply to federally funded contracts for engineering and design related services for projects subject to the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 112(a) (related to construction) and are issued to ensure that a qualified consultant is obtained through an equitable qualifications-based selection procurement process, that prescribed work is properly accomplished in a timely manner, and at fair and reasonable cost. State transportation agencies (STA) (or other recipients) shall ensure that subrecipients comply with the requirements of this part and the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements For Federal Awards rule. Federally funded contracts for services not defined as engineering and design related, or for services not in furtherance of a highway construction project or activity subject to the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 112(a), are not subject to the requirements of this part and shall be procured and administered under the requirements of the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements For Federal Awards rule and procedures applicable to such activities.
