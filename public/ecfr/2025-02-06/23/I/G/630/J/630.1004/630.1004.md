# § 630.1004   Definitions and explanation of terms.

As used in this subpart:


*Agency* means a State or local highway agency or authority that receives Federal-aid highway funding.


*Highway workers* include, but are not limited to, personnel of the contractor, subcontractor, agency, utilities, and law enforcement, performing work within the right-of-way of a transportation facility.


*Mobility* is the ability to move from place to place and is significantly dependent on the availability of transportation facilities and on system operating conditions. With specific reference to work zones, mobility pertains to moving road users efficiently through or around a work zone area with minimum delay compared to baseline travel when no work zone is present, while not compromising the safety of highway workers or road users. The commonly used performance measures for the assessment of mobility include delay, speed, travel time, and queue lengths.


*Safety* is a representation of the level of exposure to potential hazards for users of transportation facilities and highway workers. With specific reference to work zones, safety refers to minimizing potential hazards to road users in the vicinity of a work zone and highway workers at the work zone interface with traffic. The commonly used performance measures for highway work zone safety are the number of crashes or the consequences of crashes (fatalities and injuries) at a given location or along a section of highway during a period of time. In terms of highway worker safety performance measures, the number of highway worker fatalities and injuries at a given location or along a section of highway during a period of time are commonly used measures.


*State* refers to a State department of transportation.


*Transportation management plan (TMP)* consists of strategies to manage the work zone impacts of a project. Its scope, content, and degree of detail may vary based upon the agency's work zone policy and the agency's understanding of the expected work zone impacts of the project. Refer to § 630.1010(d) and § 630.1012(b) for more information on a TMP and its components.


*Work zone* is an area of a highway with construction, maintenance, or utility work activities. A work zone is typically marked by one or more of the following: signs, channelizing devices, barriers, pavement markings, or work vehicles. It extends from the first warning sign or high intensity rotating, flashing, oscillating, or strobe lights on a vehicle to the END ROAD WORK sign or the last temporary traffic control (TTC) device. See MUTCD, Part 6, “Temporary Traffic Control” (incorporated elsewhere in this subpart).


*Work zone crash* is a crash that occurs in or related to a construction, maintenance, or utility work zone, whether or not workers were actually present at the time of the crash. “Work zone-related” crashes may also include crashes involving motor vehicles slowed or stopped because of the work zone, even if the first harmful event occurred before the first warning sign. See “Model Minimum Uniform Crash Criteria Guideline” (MMUCC), 5thEd. (Electronic), 2017, produced by NHTSA. Available at the following website: *https://www.nhtsa.gov/mmucc-1.*

*Work zone impacts* refer to work zone-induced deviations from the normal range of transportation system safety and mobility. The extent of the work zone impacts may vary based on factors such as: road classification and geometrics; area type (urban, suburban, and rural); traffic and travel characteristics (volumes, speeds, vehicle mix and classification, etc.); type of work being performed; type of temporary traffic control; distance between workers and traffic; availability of escape paths for workers; time of day/night; and complexity and duration of the project. These impacts may extend beyond the physical location of the work zone itself, including upstream or downstream of the work zone location, other highway corridors, other modes of transportation, and/or the regional transportation network.


*Work zone programmatic review* is a data-driven, systematic, and holistic analysis that uses quantitative and qualitative data from different sources to assess the safety and mobility performance of work zones under a State's jurisdiction in order to identify improvements to that agency's work zone processes and procedures.
