Such action shall include, but not be limited to the following: recruitment or recruitment advertising, hiring, firing, upgrading, promotion, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, rates of pay or other forms of compensation or benefits, selection for training or apprenticeship, use of facilities and treatment of employees.

a. The contractor, with regard to the work performed by him after award and prior to completion of the contract work, will not discriminate on the ground of race, color, sex, or national origin in the selection and retention of subcontractors, including procurements of materials and leases of equipment. The contractor will not participate either directly or indirectly in the discrimination prohibited by Section 21.5 of the Regulations.


b. In all solicitations either by competitive bidding or negotiation made by the contractor for work to be performed under a subcontract, including procurements of materials or leases of equipment, each potential subcontractor, supplier, or lessor shall be notified by the contractor of the contractor's obligations under this contract and the Regulations relative to nondiscrimination on the ground of race, color, sex, or national origin.


The contractor will provide all information and reports required by the Regulations, or orders and instructions issued pursuant thereto, and will permit access to its books, records, accounts, other sources of information, and its facilities as may be determined by the State highway department or the Federal Highway Administration to be pertinent to ascertain compliance with such Regulations, orders and instructions. Where any information required of a contractor is in the exclusive possession of another who fails or refuses to furnish this information, the contractor shall so certify to the State highway department, or the Federal Highway Administration as appropriate, and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information.


The contractor will include these additional required contract provisions in every subcontract, including procurements of materials and leases of equipment, unless exempt by the Regulations or orders, or instructions issued pursuant thereto. The contractor will take such action with respect to any subcontract, procurement, or lease as the State highway department or the Federal Highway Administration may direct as a means of enforcing such provisions including sanctions for non-compliance: *Provided, however,* That, in the event a contractor becomes involved in, or is threatened with, litigation with a subcontractor, supplier, or lessor as a result of such directed action, the contractor may request the State to enter into such litigation to protect the interest of the State, and, in addition, the contractor may request the United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interest of the United States.


In the event of the contractor's noncompliance with sections 1 through 5 above, the State highway department shall impose such contract sanctions as it or the Federal Highway Administration may determine to be appropriate, including but not limited to.
