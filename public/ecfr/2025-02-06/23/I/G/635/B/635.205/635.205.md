# ยง 635.205   Finding of cost effectiveness.

(a) It may be found cost effective for a State transportation department or county to undertake a federally financed highway construction project by force account when a situation exists in which the rights or resposibilities of the community at large are so affected as to require some special course of action, including situations where there is a lack of bids or the bids received are unreasonable.


(b) Pursuant to authority in 23 U.S.C. 112(b), it is hereby determined that by reason of the inherent nature of the operations involved, it is cost effective to perform by force account the adjustment of railroad or utility facilities and similar types of facilities owned or operated by a public agency, a railroad, or a utility company provided that the organization is qualified to perform the work in a satisfactory manner. The installation of new facilities shall be undertaken by competitive bidding except as provided in ยง 635.204(c). Adjustment of railroad facilities shall include minor work on the railroad's operating facilities routinely performed by the railroad with its own forces such as the installation of grade crossing warning devices, crossing surfaces, and minor track and signal work. Adjustment of utility facilities shall include minor work on the utility's existing facilities routinely performed by the utility with its own forces and includes minor installations of new facilities to provide power, minor lighting, telephone, water and similar utility service to a rest area, weigh-station, movable bridge, or other highway appurtenance, provided such installation cannot feasibly be done as incidental to a major installation project such as an extensive highway lighting system.
