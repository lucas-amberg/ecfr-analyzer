# § 636.103   What are the definitions of terms used in this part?

Unless otherwise specified in this part, the definitions in 23 U.S.C. 101(a) are applicable to this part. Also, the following definitions are used: 


*Adjusted low bid* means a form of best value selection in which qualitative aspects are scored on a 0 to 100 scale expressed as a decimal; price is then divided by qualitative score to yield an “adjusted bid” or “price per quality point.” Award is made to offeror with the lowest adjusted bid. 


*Best value selection* means any selection process in which proposals contain both price and qualitative components and award is based upon a combination of price and qualitative considerations. 


*Clarifications* means a written or oral exchange of information which takes place after the receipt of proposals when award without discussions is contemplated. The purpose of clarifications is to address minor or clerical revisions in a proposal. 


*Communications* are exchanges, between the contracting agency and offerors, after receipt of proposals, which lead to the establishment of the competitive range. 


*Competitive acquisition* means an acquisition process which is designed to foster an impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals, leading to the selection of the proposal representing the best value to the contracting agency. 


*Competitive range* means a list of the most highly rated proposals based on the initial proposal rankings. It is based on the rating of each proposal against all evaluation criteria. 


*Contracting agency* means the public agency awarding and administering a design-build contract. The contracting agency may be the STD or another State or local public agency. 


*Deficiency* means a material failure of a proposal to meet a contracting agency requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. 


*Design-bid-build* means the traditional project delivery method where design and construction are sequential steps in the project development process. 


*Design-build contract* means an agreement that provides for design and construction of improvements by a contractor or private developer. The term encompasses design-build-maintain, design-build-operate, design-build-finance and other contracts that include services in addition to design and construction. Franchise and concession agreements are included in the term if they provide for the franchisee or concessionaire to develop the project which is the subject of the agreement. 


*Design-builder* means the entity contractually responsible for delivering the project design and construction. 


*Discussions* mean written or oral exchanges that take place after the establishment of the competitive range with the intent of allowing the offerors to revise their proposals.


*Final design* means any design activities following preliminary design and expressly includes the preparation of final construction plans and detailed specifications for the performance of construction work.


*Fixed price/best design* means a form of best value selection in which contract price is established by the owner and stated in the Request for Proposals document. Design solutions and other qualitative factors are evaluated and rated, with award going to the firm offering the best qualitative proposal for the established price. 


*Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) services* means services which provide for the acquisition of technologies or systems of technologies (e.g., computer hardware or software, traffic control devices, communications link, fare payment system, automatic vehicle location system, etc.) that provide or contribute to the provision of one or more ITS user services as defined in the National ITS Architecture. 


*Modified design-build* means a variation of design-build in which the contracting agency furnishes offerors with partially complete plans. The design-builders role is generally limited to the completion of the design and construction of the project. 


*Organizational conflict of interest* means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the owner, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage. 


*Preliminary design* defines the general project location and design concepts. It includes, but is not limited to, preliminary engineering and other activities and analyses, such as environmental assessments, topographic surveys, metes and bounds surveys, geotechnical investigations, hydrologic analysis, hydraulic analysis, utility engineering, traffic studies, financial plans, revenue estimates, hazardous materials assessments, general estimates of the types and quantities of materials, and other work needed to establish parameters for the final design. Prior to completion of the NEPA review process, any such preliminary engineering and other activities and analyses must not materially affect the objective consideration of alternatives in the NEPA review process.


*Prequalification* means the contracting agency's process for determining whether a firm is fundamentally qualified to compete for a certain project or class of projects. The prequalification process may be based on financial, management and other types of qualitative data. Prequalification should be distinguished from short listing. 


*Price proposal* means the price submitted by the offeror to provide the required design and construction services.


*Price reasonableness* means the determination that the price of the work for any project or series of projects is not excessive and is a fair and reasonable price for the services to be performed.


*Proposal modification* means a change made to a proposal before the solicitation closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or made to correct a mistake at any time before award. 


*Proposal revision* means a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a contracting officer, as the result of negotiations.


*Public-private agreement* means an agreement between a public agency and a private party involving design and construction of transportation improvements by the private party to be paid for in whole or in part by Federal-aid highway funds. The agreement may also provide for project financing, at-risk equity investment, operations, or maintenance of the project.


*Qualified project* means any design-build project (including intermodal projects) funded under Title 23, United States Code, which meets the requirements of this part and for which the contracting agency deems to be appropriate on the basis of project delivery time, cost, construction schedule, or quality.


*Request for Proposals (RFP)* means the document that describes the procurement process, forms the basis for the final proposals and may potentially become an element in the contract. 


*Request for Qualification (RFQ)* means the document issued by the owner in Phase I of the two-phased selection process. It typically describes the project in enough detail to let potential offerors determine if they wish to compete and forms the basis for requesting qualifications submissions from which the most highly qualified offerors can be identified.


*Short listing* means the narrowing of the field of offerors through the selection of the most qualified offerors who have responded to an RFQ.


*Single-phase selection process* means a procurement process where price and/or technical proposals are submitted in response to an RFP. Short listing is not used. 


*Solicitation* means a public notification of an owner's need for information, qualifications, or proposals related to identified services. 


*Stipend* means a monetary amount sometimes paid to unsuccessful offerors. 


*Technical proposal* means that portion of a design-build proposal which contains design solutions and other qualitative factors that are provided in response to the RFP document. 


*Tradeoff* means an analysis technique involving a comparison of price and non-price factors to determine the best value when considering the selection of other than the lowest priced proposal. 


*Two-phase selection process* means a procurement process in which the first phase consists of short listing (based on qualifications submitted in response to an RFQ) and the second phase consists of the submission of price and technical proposals in response to an RFP. 


*Weakness* means a flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. A significant weakness in the proposal is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. 


*Weighted criteria process* means a form of best value selection in which maximum point values are pre-established for qualitative and price components, and award is based upon high total points earned by the offerors.
