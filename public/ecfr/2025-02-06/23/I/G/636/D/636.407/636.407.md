# ยง 636.407   Am I limited in holding communications with certain firms?

Yes, if you establish a competitive range, you must do the following: 


(a) Hold communications with offerors whose past performance information is the determining factor preventing them from being placed within the competitive range; 


(b) Address adverse past performance information to which an offeror has not had a prior opportunity to respond; and 


(c) Hold communications only with those offerors whose exclusion from, or inclusion in, the competitive range is uncertain.
