# ยง 636.503   Must I notify offerors of my intent to use/not use discussions?

Yes, in competitive acquisitions, the solicitation must notify offerors of your intent. You should either: 


(a) Notify offerors that discussions may or may not be held depending on the quality of the proposals received (except clarifications may be used as described in ยง 636.401). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint; or 


(b) Notify offerors of your intent to establish a competitive range and hold discussions.
