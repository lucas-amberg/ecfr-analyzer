(a) Access roads to permanent defense installations and all replacement roads shall be designed to conform to the same standards as the agency having jurisdiction is currently using for other comparable highways under similar conditions in the area. In general, where the agency having jurisdiction does not have established standards, the design shall conform to American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards. Should local agencies desire higher standards than are currently being used for other comparable highways under similar conditions in the area, they shall finance the increases in cost.


(b) Access roads to temporary military establishments or for service to workers temporarily engaged in construction of defense installations should be designed to the minimum standards necessary to provide service for a limited period without intolerable congestion and hazard. As a guide, widening to more than two lanes generally will not be undertaken to accommodate anticipated one-way, peak-hour traffic of less than 1,200 vehicles per hour and resurfacing or strengthening of existing pavements will be held to the minimum type having the structural integrity to carry traffic for the short period of anticipated use.
