# ยง 661.23   How will a bridge project be programmed for funding once eligibility has been determined?

(a) All projects will be ranked and prioritized for funding after a completed application package is received and accepted by FHWA. At that time, the project will be acknowledged as either BIA and Tribally owned, or non-BIA/non-Tribally owned and placed in either a PE or a construction queue.


(b) All projects will be ranked and prioritized based on the following criteria:


(1) Bridge condition with bridges in poor condition having precedence over bridges in fair condition, and bridges in fair condition having precedence over bridges in good condition;


(2) Operating rating for bridges in poor condition with lower operating rating having precedence over higher operating rating;


(3) Bridges on school bus routes;


(4) New bridge construction;


(5) Bypass detour length;


(6) Annual average daily traffic; and


(7) Annual average daily truck traffic.


(c) Queues will carryover from fiscal year to fiscal year as made necessary by the amount of annual funding made available.


(d) TTF bridges will be classified as good, fair, or poor based on the following criteria:


(1) *Good:* When the lowest rating of the 3 NBI items for a bridge (Deck Condition Rating, Superstructure Condition Rating, Substructure Condition Rating) is 7, 8, or 9, the bridge will be classified as good. When the rating of the NBI item for a culvert (Culvert Condition Rating) is 7, 8, or 9, the culvert will be classified as good.


(2) *Fair:* When the lowest rating of the three NBI items for a bridge is 5 or 6, the bridge will be classified as fair. When the rating of the NBI item for a culvert is 5 or 6, the culvert will be classified as fair.


(3) *Poor:* When the lowest rating of the three NBI items for a bridge is 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0, the bridge will be classified as poor. When the rating of the NBI item for a culvert is 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0, the culvert will be classified as poor. A poor condition bridge with a lower condition rating will have precedence over a poor condition bridge with a higher condition rating.
