# ยง 661.29   How does ownership impact project selection?

(a) Primary consideration will be given to eligible projects on BIA and Tribally owned TTF bridges. A smaller percentage of available funds will be set aside for non-BIA/non-Tribally owned TTF bridges, since States and counties have access to Federal-aid and other funding to design, replace, and rehabilitate their bridges.


(b) The program policy will be to maximize the number of TTF bridges participating in the TTFBP in a given fiscal year regardless of ownership.
