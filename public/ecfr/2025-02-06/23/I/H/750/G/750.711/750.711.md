# § 750.711   Structures which have never displayed advertising material.

Structures, including poles, which have never displayed advertising or informative content are subject to control or removal when advertising content visible from the main-traveled way is added or affixed. When this is done, an “outdoor advertising sign” has then been erected which must comply with the State law in effect on that date.
