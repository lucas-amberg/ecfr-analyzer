The State highway agency, after reviewing the application, may request the Federal Highway Administrator to authorize the State to make available to the publicly-owned mass transit authority the land needed for the proposed facility. A request shall be accompanied by evidence that utilization of the land for the proposed purposes will not impair future highway improvements or the safety of highway users.
