# § 971.208   Federal lands pavement management system (PMS).

In addition to the requirements provided in § 971.204, the PMS must meet the following requirements: 


(a) The tri-party partnership shall have PMS coverage of all FHs and other associated facilities, as appropriate, funded under the FLHP. 


(b) The PMS may be based on the concepts described in the AASHTO's “Pavement Management Guide.”

(c) The PMS may be utilized at various levels of technical complexity depending on the nature of the transportation network. These different levels may depend on mileage, functional classes, volumes, loading, usage, surface type, or other criteria the tri-party partnership deems appropriate. 


(d) The PMS shall be designed to fit the FH program goals, policies, criteria, and needs using the following components, at a minimum, as a basic framework for a PMS: 


(1) A database and an ongoing program for the collection and maintenance of the inventory, inspection, cost, and supplemental data needed to support the PMS. The minimum PMS database shall include: 


(i) An inventory of the physical pavement features including the number of lanes, length, width, surface type, functional classification, and shoulder information; 


(ii) A history of project dates and types of construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, and preventive maintenance. If some of the inventory or historic data is difficult to establish, it may be collected when preservation or reconstruction work is performed; 


(iii) A condition survey that includes ride, distress, rutting, and surface friction (as appropriate); 


(iv) Traffic information including volumes and vehicle classification (as appropriate); and 


(v) Data for estimating the costs of actions. 


(2) A system for applying network level analytical procedures that are capable of analyzing data for all FHs and other appropriate associated facilities in the inventory or any subset. The minimum analyses shall include: 


(i) A pavement condition analysis that includes ride, distress, rutting, and surface friction (as appropriate); 


(ii) A pavement performance analysis that includes present and predicted performance and an estimate of the remaining service life. Performance and remaining service life may be developed with time; and 


(iii) An investment analysis that: 


(A) Identifies alternative strategies to improve pavement conditions; 


(B) Estimates costs of any pavement improvement strategy; 


(C) Determines maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation strategies for pavements using life cycle cost analysis or a comparable procedure; 


(D) Provides for short and long term budget forecasting; and 


(E) Recommends optimal allocation of limited funds by developing a prioritized list of candidate projects over a predefined planning horizon (both short and long term). 


(e) For any FHs and other appropriate associated facilities in the inventory or subset thereof, PMS reporting requirements shall include, but are not limited to, percentage of roads in good, fair, and poor condition.
