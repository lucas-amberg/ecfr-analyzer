# § 971.210   Federal lands bridge management system (BMS).

In addition to the requirements provided in § 971.204, the BMS must meet the following requirements: 


(a) The tri-party partnership shall have a BMS for the FH bridges funded under the FLHP and required to be inventoried and inspected under 23 CFR 650, subpart C, National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS). 


(b) The BMS may be based on the concepts described in the AASHTO's “Guidelines for Bridge Management Systems.” 
2

(c) The BMS shall be designed to fit the FH program goals, policies, criteria, and needs using the following components, as a minimum, as a basic framework for a BMS: 


(1) A database and an ongoing program for the collection and maintenance of the inventory, inspection, cost, and supplemental data needed to support the BMS. The minimum BMS database shall include:


(i) The inventory data required by the NBIS (23 CFR 650, subpart C);


(ii) Data characterizing the severity and extent of deterioration of bridge elements;


(iii) Data for estimating the cost of improvement actions;


(iv) Traffic information including volumes and vehicle classification (as appropriate); and


(v) A history of conditions and actions taken on each bridge, excluding minor or incidental maintenance.


(2) A system for applying network level analytical procedures at the State or local area level, as appropriate, and capable of analyzing data for all bridges in the inventory or any subset. The minimum analyses shall include:


(i) A prediction of performance and estimate of the remaining service life of structural and other key elements of each bridge, both with and without intervening actions; and


(ii) A recommendation for optimal allocation of limited funds through development of a prioritized list of candidate projects over predefined short and long-term planning horizons.


(d) The BMS may include the capability to perform an investment analysis, as appropriate, considering size of structure, traffic volume, and structural condition. The investment analysis may:


(1) Identify alternative strategies to improve bridge condition, safety, and serviceability;


(2) Estimate the costs of any strategies ranging from maintenance of individual elements to full bridge replacement;


(3) Determine maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation strategies for bridge elements using life cycle cost analysis or a comparable procedure; and


(4) Provide short and long-term budget forecasting.


(e) For any bridge in the inventory or subset thereof, BMS reporting requirements shall include, but are not limited to, percentage of non-deficient bridges.
