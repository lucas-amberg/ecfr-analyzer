# ยง 971.214   Federal lands congestion management system (CMS).

(a) For purposes of this section, congestion means the level at which transportation system performance is no longer acceptable due to traffic interference. For portions of the FH network outside the boundaries of TMAs, the tri-party partnership shall:


(1) Develop criteria to determine when a CMS is to be implemented for a specific FH; and


(2) Have CMS coverage for the transportation systems providing access to and within National Forests, as appropriate, that meet minimum CMS criteria.


(b) The tri-party partnership shall consider the results of the CMS when selecting the implementation of strategies that provide the most efficient and effective use of existing and future transportation facilities.


(c) In addition to the requirements provided in ยง 971.204, the CMS must meet the following requirements:


(1) For those FH transportation systems that require a CMS, in both metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas, consideration shall be given to strategies that reduce private automobile travel and improve existing transportation efficiency. Approaches may include the use of alternative mode studies and implementation plans as components of the CMS.


(2) A CMS will:


(i) Identify and document measures for congestion (e.g., level of service);


(ii) Identify the causes of congestion;


(iii) Include processes for evaluating the cost and effectiveness of alternative strategies to manage congestion;


(iv) Identify the anticipated benefits of appropriate alternative traditional and nontraditional congestion management strategies;


(v) Determine methods to monitor and evaluate the performance of the multi-modal transportation system; and


(vi) Appropriately consider the following example categories of strategies, or combinations of strategies for each area:


(A) Transportation demand management measures;


(B) Traffic operational improvements;


(C) Public transportation improvements;


(D) ITS technologies; and


(E) Additional system capacity.
