# § 972.104   Definitions.

*Alternative transportation systems* means modes of transportation other than private vehicles, including methods to improve system performance such as transportation demand management, congestion management, and intelligent transportation systems. These mechanisms help reduce the use of private vehicles and thus improve overall efficiency of transportation systems and facilities. 


*Elements* mean the components of a bridge important from a structural, user, or cost standpoint. Examples are decks, joints, bearings, girders, abutments, and piers. 


*Federal lands bridge management system (BMS)* means a systematic process used by the Forest Service (FS), the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Park Service (NPS) for analyzing bridge data to make forecasts and recommendations, and provides the means by which bridge maintenance, rehabilitation, and replacement programs and policies may be effectively considered. 


*Federal lands congestion management system (CMS)* means a systematic process used by the FS, FWS and NPS for managing congestion that provides information on transportation system performance and alternative strategies for alleviating congestion and enhancing the mobility of persons and goods to levels that meet Federal, State and local needs. 


*Federal Lands Highway Program (FLHP)* means a federally funded program established in 23 U.S.C. 204 to address transportation needs of Federal and Indian lands. 


*Federal lands pavement management system (PMS)* means a systematic process used by the FS, FWS and NPS that provides information for use in implementing cost-effective pavement reconstruction, rehabilitation, and preventive maintenance programs and policies and that results in pavement designed to accommodate current and forecasted traffic in a safe, durable, and cost-effective manner. 


*Federal lands safety management system (SMS)* means a systematic process used by the FS, FWS and NPS with the goal of reducing the number and severity of traffic accidents by ensuring that all opportunities to improve roadway safety are identified, considered, implemented and evaluated as appropriate, during all phases of highway planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance, by providing information for selecting and implementing effective highway safety strategies and projects. 


*Fish and Wildlife Service transportation plan* means the official Fish and Wildlife Service-wide multimodal transportation plan that is developed through the Fish and Wildlife Service transportation planning process pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 204. 


*Highway safety* means the reduction of traffic accidents, and deaths, injuries, and property damage resulting therefrom, on public roads. 


*Intelligent transportation system (ITS)* means electronics, communications, or information processing used singly or in combination to improve the efficiency and safety of a surface transportation system. 


*Life-cycle cost analysis* means an evaluation of costs incurred over the life of a project allowing a comparative analysis between or among various alternatives. Life-cycle cost analysis promotes consideration of total cost, to include maintenance and operation expenditures. Comprehensive life-cycle costs analysis includes all economic variables essential to the evaluation: User costs such as delay and safety costs associated with maintenance and rehabilitation projects, agency capital cost, and life-cycle maintenance costs. 


*Metropolitan planning area* means the geographic area in which the metropolitan transportation planning process required by 23 U.S.C. 134 and 49 U.S.C. 5303-5306 must be carried out. 


*Metropolitan planning organization (MPO)* means the forum for cooperative transportation decision-making for the metropolitan planning area pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 134 and 49 U.S.C. 5303. 


*National Wildlife Refuge System (Refuge System)* means all the lands and waters reported by the FWS as being part of the National Wildlife Refuge System in the annual “Report of Lands Under Control of the U.S. FWS.” 
1 Included in the Refuge System are those lands that are generally known as refuges, waterfowl production areas, wetland management districts, and coordination areas. 


*Operations* means those activities associated with managing, controlling, and regulating highway traffic. 


*Refuge road* means a public road that provides access to or is located within a unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System and for which title and maintenance responsibilities are vested in the United States Government. 


*Refuge Roads Program* means the funds allocated each fiscal year, as described in 23 U.S.C. 202(e) and 23 U.S.C. 204(k). 


*Refuge Roads transportation improvement program (RRTIP)* means a staged, multiyear, multimodal program of transportation projects for the Refuge Roads Program consistent with the Fish and Wildlife Service transportation plan and planning processes pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 204(a) and (k). 


*Secretary* means the Secretary of Transportation. 


*State* means any one of the fifty States, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico. 


*Transportation facilities* means roads, streets, bridges, parking areas, transit vehicles, and other related transportation infrastructure. 


*Transportation Management Area (TMA)* means an urbanized area with a population over 200,000 (as determined by the latest decennial census) or other area when TMA designation is requested by the Governor and the MPO (or affected local officials), and officially designated by the Administrators of the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration. The TMA designation applies to the entire metropolitan planning area(s).
