# § 973.208   Indian lands pavement management system (PMS).

In addition to the requirements provided in § 973.204, the PMS must meet the following requirements:


(a) The BIA shall have PMS coverage for all federally and tribally owned, paved IRRs included in the IRR inventory.


(b) Where a tribe collects data for the tribe's PMS, the tribe shall provide the data to the BIA to be used in the nationwide PMS.


(c) The nationwide and tribal PMSs may be based on the concepts described in the AASHTO's “Pavement Management Guide.”

(d) The nationwide and tribal PMSs may be utilized at various levels of technical complexity depending on the nature of the pavement network. These different levels may depend on mileage, functional classes, volumes, loading, usage, surface type, or other criteria the BIA and ITGs deem appropriate.


(e) A PMS shall be designed to fit the BIA's or tribes' goals, policies, criteria, and needs using the following components, at a minimum, as a basic framework for a PMS:


(1) A database and an ongoing program for the collection and maintenance of the inventory, inspection, cost, and supplemental data needed to support the PMS. The minimum PMS database shall include:


(i) An inventory of the physical pavement features including the number of lanes, length, width, surface type, functional classification, and shoulder information;


(ii) A history of project dates and types of construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, and preventive maintenance. If some of the inventory or historic data is difficult to establish, it may be collected when preservation or reconstruction work is performed;


(iii) A condition survey that includes ride, distress, rutting, and surface friction (as appropriate);


(iv) Traffic information including volumes and vehicle classification (as appropriate); and


(v) Data for estimating the costs of actions.


(2) A system for applying network level analytical procedures that are capable of analyzing data for all federally and tribally owned IRR in the inventory or any subset. The minimum analyses shall include:


(i) A pavement condition analysis that includes ride, distress, rutting, and surface friction (as appropriate);


(ii) A pavement performance analysis that includes present and predicted performance and an estimate of the remaining service life (performance and remaining service life to be developed with time); and


(iii) An investment analysis that:


(A) Identifies alternative strategies to improve pavement conditions;


(B) Estimates costs of any pavement improvement strategy;


(C) Determines maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation strategies for pavements using life cycle cost analysis or a comparable procedure;


(D) Performs short and long term budget forecasting; and


(E) Recommends optimal allocation of limited funds by developing a prioritized list of candidate projects over a predefined planning horizon (both short and long term).


(f) For any roads in the inventory or subset thereof, PMS reporting requirements shall include, but are not limited to, percentage of roads in good, fair, and poor condition.
