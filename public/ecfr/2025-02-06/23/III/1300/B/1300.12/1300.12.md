# § 1300.12   Annual grant application.

The State's annual grant application provides project level information on the State's highway safety program and demonstrates alignment with the State's most recent triennial HSP. Each fiscal year, the State shall submit an annual grant application, including appendices A and B to this part, that meets the following requirements:


(a) *Due date for submission.* A State shall submit its annual grant application electronically to NHTSA no later than 11:59 p.m. EDT on August 1 preceding the fiscal year to which the application applies. Failure to meet this deadline may result in delayed approval and funding of a State's Section 402 grant or disqualification from receiving a Section 405 or Section 1906 racial profiling data collection grant to avoid a delay in awarding grants to all States.


(b) *Contents.* In order to be approved, the annual grant application submitted by the State must contain the following components:


(1) *Updates to triennial HSP.* Any updates, as necessary, to any analysis included in the triennial Highway Safety Plan of the State, at the level of detail required by § 1300.11, including at a minimum:


(i) *Adjustments to countermeasure strategy for programming funds.* (A) If the State adjusts the strategy for programming funds, a narrative description of the means by which the State's strategy for programming funds was adjusted and informed by the most recent annual report submitted under § 1300.35; or


(B) If the State does not adjust the strategy for programming funds, a written explanation of why the State made no adjustments.


(ii) The State may add performance measures based on updated traffic safety problem identification or as part of an application for a grant under section 405, but may not amend existing performance targets. Provided, however, that States may amend common performance targets developed under § 1300.11(b)(3)(iv) only if necessary to submit identical targets to FHWA in the HSIP annual reports.


(2) *Project and subrecipient information.* For each project to be funded by the State using grant funds during the fiscal year covered by the application, the State must provide—


(i) Project name and description, including, at a minimum, a description of activities conducted, location where the project is performed, and affected communities, where applicable;


(ii) Federal funding source(s) (*i.e.,* Section 402, Section 405(b), etc.);


(iii) Project agreement number (which, if necessary, may be provided in a later amendment to the annual grant application);


(iv) Subrecipient(s) (including name and type of organization; e.g., county or city DOT, State or local law enforcement, non-profit, EMS agency, etc.);


(v) Amount of Federal funds;


(vi) Eligible use of funds;


(vii) Whether the costs are Planning and Administration costs pursuant to § 1300.13(a) and the amount;


(viii) Whether the project will be used to meet the requirements of § 1300.41(b); and


(ix) The countermeasure strategy or strategies for programming funds identified in the most recently submitted triennial HSP under § 1300.11(b)(4) or in an update to the triennial HSP submitted under paragraph (b)(1) of this section that the project supports.


(3) *Section 405 grant and Section 1906 racial profiling data collection grant applications.* Application(s) for any of the national priority safety program grants and the racial profiling data collection grant, in accordance with the requirements of subpart C of this part and as provided in appendix B to this part, signed by the Governor's Representative for Highway Safety.


(4) *Certifications and Assurances.* The Certifications and Assurances for 23 U.S.C. Chapter 4 and Section 1906 grants contained in appendix A, signed by the Governor's Representative for Highway Safety, certifying to the annual grant application contents and providing assurances that the State will comply with applicable laws and financial and programmatic requirements.


(c) *Review and approval procedures*—(1) *General.* Upon receipt and initial review of the annual grant application, NHTSA may request additional information from a State to ensure compliance with the requirements of this part. Failure to respond promptly to a request for additional information concerning the Section 402 grant application may result in delayed approval and funding of a State's Section 402 grant. Failure to respond promptly to a request for additional information concerning a Section 405 or Section 1906 grant application may result in a State's disqualification from consideration for a Section 405 or Section 1906 grant to avoid a delay in awarding grants to all States. NHTSA will not approve a grant application that does not meet the requirements of this section.


(2) *Approval or disapproval of annual grant application.* Within 60 days after receipt of the annual grant application under this subpart, the NHTSA administrator shall notify States in writing of grant awards and specify any conditions or limitations imposed by law on the use of funds.


(d) *Amendments to project and subrecipient information.* Notwithstanding the requirement in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to provide project and subrecipient information at the time of application, States may amend the annual grant application throughout the fiscal year of the grant to add projects or to update project information for previously submitted projects, consistent with the process set forth in § 1300.32, provided that all required project and subrecipient information must be complete at the time the State submits the annual report required under § 1300.35.
