(a) The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 556 and 557, which govern formal hearings in adjudicatory proceedings, do not apply to informal rule making proceedings described in this part. When opportunity is afforded for oral presentation, such informal *hearing* is a nonadversary, fact-finding proceeding. Any rule issued in a proceeding under this part in which a hearing is held is not based exclusively on the record of such hearing.


(b) When a hearing is provided, the Secretary will designate a representative to conduct the hearing, and if the presence of a legal officer is desirable, the General Counsel will designate a staff attorney to serve as the officer.
