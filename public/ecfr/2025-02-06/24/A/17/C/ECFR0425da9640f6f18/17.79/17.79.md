(a) *Referrals for nonpayment of debt.* When a contractor, grantee, or other participant in a program sponsored by HUD, fails to pay its debt to HUD within a reasonable time after demand, HUD shall take such measures to:


(1) Refer such contractor, grantee, or other participant to the Office of General Counsel for investigation of the matter and possible suspension or debarment pursuant to 2 CFR part 2424, 2 CFR 180.800, and 48 CFR subpart 9.4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR); and


(2) In the case of matters involving fraud or suspected fraud, refer such contractor, grantee, or other participant to the Office of Inspector General for investigation.
