# ยง 25.8   Factors considered in taking administrative action.

In determining which administrative action under 12 U.S.C. 1708(c), if any, should be taken, the Board will consider, among other factors, the seriousness and extent of the violations, the degree of mortgagee responsibility for the occurrences, and any other mitigating or aggravating facts. Where the Board is considering a withdrawal action, the Board will also consider whether the violations were egregious or willful, in order to determine whether a permanent withdrawal is mandated by 12 U.S.C. 1708(c).
