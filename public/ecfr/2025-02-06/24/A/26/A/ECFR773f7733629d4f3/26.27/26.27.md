(a) *Interlocutory rulings by the hearing officer.* A party seeking review of an interlocutory ruling shall file a motion with the hearing officer within 10 days of the ruling requesting certification of the ruling for review by the Secretary, or in cases arising under 2 CFR part 2424, with the Debarring Official. Certification may be granted if the hearing officer believes that:


(1) It involves an important issue of law or policy as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion; and


(2) An immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.


(b) *Petition for review.* Any party may file a petition for review of an interlocutory ruling within 10 days of the hearing officer's determination regarding certification.


(c) *Secretarial review.* The Secretary, or designee, or Debarring Official shall review a certified ruling. The Secretary, designee, or Debarring Official has the discretion to grant or deny a petition for review from an uncertified ruling.


(d) *Continuation of hearing.* Unless otherwise ordered by the hearing officer or the Secretary, designee, or Debarring Official, the hearing shall proceed pending the determination of any interlocutory appeal, and the order or ruling of the hearing officer shall be effective pending review.
