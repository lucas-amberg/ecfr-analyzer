(a) *Interlocutory rulings by the ALJ.* A party seeking review of an interlocutory ruling shall file a motion with the ALJ within 10 days of the ruling requesting certification of the ruling for review by the Secretary. Certification may be granted if the ALJ believes that:


(1) It involves an important issue of law or policy as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion; and


(2) An immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.


(b) *Petition for review.* Any party may file a petition for review of an interlocutory ruling within 10 days of the ALJ's determination regarding certification.


(c) *Secretarial review.* The Secretary, or designee, shall review a certified ruling. The Secretary, or designee, has the discretion to grant or deny a petition for review from an uncertified ruling.


(d) *Continuation of hearing.* Unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ or the Secretary, or designee, the hearing shall proceed pending the determination of any interlocutory appeal, and the order or ruling of the ALJ shall be effective pending review.
