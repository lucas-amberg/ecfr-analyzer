(a) The foreclosure sale shall be conducted in a manner and at a time and place as identified in the Notice of Default and Foreclosure Sale and in accordance with the provisions of the Statute. 


(b) In addition to bids made in person at the sale, the foreclosure commissioner shall accept written one-price sealed bids from any party, including the Secretary, for entry by announcement at the sale so long as those bids conform to the requirements described in the Notice of Default and Foreclosure Sale. The foreclosure commissioner shall announce the name of each such bidder and the amount of the bid. The commissioner shall accept oral bids from any party, including parties who submitted one-price sealed bids, if those oral bids conform to the requirements in the Notice of Default and Foreclosure Sale. Before the close of the sale the commissioner shall announce the amount of the high bid and the name of the successful bidder. If the successful bidder fails to comply with the terms of the sale, the HUD Field Office representative will provide instructions to the commissioner about offering the property to the second highest bidder, or having a new sale, or other instruction at the discretion of the HUD representative. 


(c) *Prohibited participants.* Relatives of the foreclosure commissioner who may not bid include parents, siblings, spouses and children. A related business entity that may not bid or whose employees may not bid is one whose relationship (at the time the foreclosure commissioner is designated and during the term of service as foreclosure commissioner) with the entity of the foreclosure commissioner is such that, directly or indirectly, one entity formulates, directs, or controls the other entity; or has the power to formulate, direct, or control the other entity; or has the responsibility and authority to prevent, or promptly to correct, the offensive conduct of the other entity. 


(d) *Auctioneers.* If the commissioner employs an auctioneer to conduct the foreclosure sale, the auctioneer must be a licensed auctioneer, an officer of State or local government, or any other person who commonly conducts foreclosure sales in the area in which the security property is located.
