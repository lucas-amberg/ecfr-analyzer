(i) A summary of the nature, dates, scope, and results (including clearance) of the hazard reduction activities;


(ii) A contact name, address, and telephone number for more information;


(iii) Available information on the location of any remaining lead-based paint in the rooms, spaces, or areas where hazard reduction activities were conducted, on a surface-by-surface basis; and


(iv) The date of the notice.


(2) Update the notice, based on reevaluation of the residential property and as any additional hazard reduction work is conducted.


(3) Provision of a notice of hazard reduction is not required if a clearance examination is not required.


(c) *Availability of notices of evaluation, presumption, and hazard reduction activities.* (1) The notices of evaluation, presumption, and hazard reduction shall be of a size and type that is easily read by occupants.


(2) To the extent practicable, each notice shall be made available, upon request, in a format accessible to persons with disabilities (e.g., Braille, large type, computer disk, audio tape).


(3) Each notice shall be provided in the occupants' primary language or in the language of the occupants' contract or lease.


(4) The designated party shall provide each notice to the occupants by:


(i) Posting and maintaining it in centrally located common areas and distributing it to any dwelling unit if necessary because the head of household is a person with a known disability; or


(ii) Distributing it to each occupied dwelling unit affected by the evaluation, presumption, or hazard reduction activity or serviced by common areas in which an evaluation, presumption or hazard reduction has taken place.


(iii) However, for the protection of the privacy of the child and the child's family or guardians, no notice of environmental investigation shall be posted to any centrally located common area.
