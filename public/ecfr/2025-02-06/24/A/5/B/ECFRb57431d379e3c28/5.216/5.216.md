The processing entity must grant an extension of one additional 90-day period if the processing entity determines that, in its discretion, the assistance applicant's failure to comply was due to circumstances that could not reasonably have been foreseen and were outside the control of the assistance applicant. If the applicant family fails to produce the documentation required in paragraph (g)(1) of this section within the required time period, the processing entity must follow the provisions of § 5.218.
