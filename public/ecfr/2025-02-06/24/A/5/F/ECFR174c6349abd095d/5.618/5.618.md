# § 5.618   Restriction on assistance to families based on assets.

(a) *Restrictions based on net assets and property ownership.* (1) A dwelling unit in the public housing program may not be rented, and assistance under the Section 8 (tenant-based and project-based) programs may not be provided, either initially or upon reexamination of family income, to any family if:


(i) The family's net assets (as defined in § 5.603) exceed $100,000, which amount will be adjusted annually by HUD in accordance with the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers; or


(ii) The family has a present ownership interest in, a legal right to reside in, and the effective legal authority to sell, based on State or local laws of the jurisdiction where the property is located, real property that is suitable for occupancy by the family as a residence, except this real property restriction does not apply to:


(A) Any property for which the family is receiving assistance under 24 CFR 982.620; or under the Homeownership Option in 24 CFR part 982;


(B) Any property that is jointly owned by a member of the family and at least one non-household member who does not live with the family, if the non-household member resides at the jointly owned property;


(C) Any person who is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as defined in this part 5 (subpart L); or


(D) Any family that is offering such property for sale.


(2) A property will be considered “suitable for occupancy” under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section unless the family demonstrates that it:


(i) Does not meet the disability-related needs for all members of the family (*e.g.,* physical accessibility requirements, disability-related need for additional bedrooms, proximity to accessible transportation, etc.);


(ii) Is not sufficient for the size of the family;


(iii) Is geographically located so as to be a hardship for the family (*e.g.,* the distance or commuting time between the property and the family's place of work or school would be a hardship to the family, as determined by the PHA or owner);


(iv) Is not safe to reside in because of the physical condition of the property (*e.g.,* property's physical condition poses a risk to the family's health and safety and the condition of the property cannot be easily remedied); or


(v) Is not a property that a family may reside in under the State or local laws of the jurisdiction where the property is located.


(b) *Acceptable documentation; confidentiality.* (1) A PHA or owner may determine the net assets of a family based on a certification by the family that the net family assets (as defined in § 5.603) do not exceed $50,000, which amount will be adjusted annually in accordance with the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, without taking additional steps to verify the accuracy of the declaration. The declaration must state the amount of income the family expects to receive from such assets; this amount must be included in the family's income.


(2) A PHA or owner may determine compliance with paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section based on a certification by a family that certifies that such family does not have any present ownership interest in any real property at the time of the income determination or review.


(3) When a family asks for or about an exception to the real property restriction because a family member is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, the PHA or owner must comply with the confidentiality requirements under § 5.2007. The PHA or owner must accept a self-certification from the family member, and the restrictions on requesting documentation under § 5.2007 apply.


(c) *Enforcement.* (1) When recertifying the income of a family that is subject to the restrictions in paragraph (a) of this section, a PHA or owner may choose not to enforce such restrictions, or alternatively, may establish exceptions to the restrictions based on eligibility criteria.


(2) The PHA or owner may choose not to enforce the restrictions in paragraph (a) of this section or establish exceptions to such restrictions only pursuant to a policy adopted by the PHA or owner.


(3) Eligibility criteria for establishing exceptions may provide for separate treatment based on family type and may be based on different factors, such as age, disability, income, the ability of the family to find suitable alternative housing, and whether supportive services are being provided. Such policies must be in conformance with all applicable fair housing statutes and regulations, as discussed in this part 5.


(d) *Delay of eviction or termination of assistance.* The PHA or owner may delay for a period of not more than 6 months the initiation of eviction or termination proceedings of a family based on noncompliance under this provision unless it conflicts with other provisions of law.


(e) *Applicability.* This section applies to the Section 8 (tenant-based and project-based) and public housing programs.
