# ยง 5.707   Uniform self-inspection requirement and report.

All PHAs and owners of HUD housing subject to an assistance contract, other than owners participating in the HCV, PBV, and Moderate Rehabilitation programs, are required to annually self-inspect their properties, including all units, to ensure the units are maintained in accordance with the standards in ยง 5.703. The owner or PHA must maintain the results of such self-inspections for three years and must provide the results to HUD upon request. This self-inspection is independent of other HUD inspections discussed in ยง 5.705. The owner or PHA may choose to conduct this inspection after a HUD inspection to satisfy this requirement and the post-report survey requirement at ยง 5.711(c)(2) simultaneously.
