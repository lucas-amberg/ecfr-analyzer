# § 55.8   Limitations on HUD assistance in floodplains.

(a) HUD financial assistance (including mortgage insurance) may not be approved with respect to:


(1) Any action located in a floodway unless one of the following applies:


(i) An exception listed in § 55.12 applies; or


(ii) A permanent covenant or comparable restriction will preserve all onsite FFRMS floodplain and/or wetland areas from future development or expansion of existing uses in the floodplain and/or wetland areas. Any rehabilitation, including reconstruction in the case of properties affected by Presidentially declared disasters, that does not expand the footprint of the buildings or the number of units on the site would be allowed within the FFRMS floodplain outside of the floodway. No buildings or improvements may modify or occupy the floodway, with the exception of:


(A) Functionally dependent uses (as defined in § 55.2(b)(7)) and utility lines;


(B) De minimis improvements, including minimal ground disturbance or placement of impervious surface area to ensure accessibility where this is permitted by local ordinances and does not increase flood risk to the property; or


(C) Buildings and improvements that will be removed as part of the proposed action.


(2) Any critical action located in a floodway, other than a functionally dependent use where any existing or new structure has been or will be elevated or floodproofed to the FFRMS elevation for critical actions; or any critical action in a coastal high hazard area or LiMWA, other than a functionally dependent use where any existing or new structure has been or will be elevated and constructed in accordance with current FEMA V-zone construction standards at 44 CFR 60.3(e); provided that, for a critical action that is insurance of a mortgage on a property containing a floodway with no structures or improvements in the floodway, paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies; or


(3) Any noncritical action located in a coastal high hazard area, or LiMWA, unless the action is a functionally dependent use, is limited to existing structures or improvements, or is reconstruction following destruction caused by a Presidentially declared disaster. If the action is not a functionally dependent use, the action must be designed for location in a coastal high hazard area. An action will be considered designed for a coastal high hazard area if:


(i) In the case of reconstruction following destruction caused by a disaster, or substantial improvement, the work meets the current standards for V zones in FEMA regulations (44 CFR 60.3(e)) and, if applicable, the Minimum Property Standards for such construction in 24 CFR 200.926d(c)(4)(iii); or


(ii) In the case of existing construction (including any minor improvements that are not substantial improvements):


(A) The work met FEMA elevation and construction standards for a coastal high hazard area (or if such a zone or such standards were not designated, the 1-percent-annual-chance floodplain) applicable at the time the original improvements were constructed; or


(B) If the original improvements were constructed before FEMA standards for the 1-percent-annual-chance floodplain became effective or before FEMA designated the location of the action as within the 1-percent-annual-chance floodplain, the work would meet at least the earliest FEMA standards for construction in the 1-percent-annual-chance floodplain.


(b) All determinations made pursuant to this section shall be based on the effective FIRM or FIS unless FEMA has provided more current information. When FEMA provides interim flood hazard data, such as ABFE or preliminary maps and studies, HUD or the responsible entity shall use the latest of these sources. However, a base flood elevation from an interim or preliminary source cannot be used if it is lower than the base flood elevation on the current FIRM and FIS.


(c) Where HUD assistance is proposed for actions subject to § 55.20 on structures designated by FEMA as Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL) properties, and FEMA has approved measures that if implemented would qualify the property for a status of “Mitigated” as to the SRL list, HUD or the responsible entity will ensure that FEMA-identified mitigation measures are identified and implemented as part of the decision making process under § 55.20(e).
