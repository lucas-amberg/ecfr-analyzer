# § 55.21   Alternate processing for existing nonconforming sites.

Notwithstanding the limitations on HUD assistance defined in § 55.8, in exceptional circumstances, the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development may approve HUD assistance or insurance to improve an existing property with ongoing HUD assistance or mortgage insurance if the following conditions are satisfied:


(a) HUD completes an environmental review pursuant to 24 CFR part 50, including the 8-step decision making process pursuant to § 55.20, that:


(1) Documents that it is not practicable to transfer the HUD assistance to a site with lower flood risk under existing program rules, financial limitations, and site availability; and


(2) Mandates measures to ensure that the elevated flood risk is the only environmental hazard or impact that does not comply or that requires mitigation to comply, with HUD's environmental requirements at 24 CFR parts 50, 51, 55, and 58; and


(b) The proposed project incorporates all practicable measures to minimize flood risk, preserve the function of the floodplain and any impacted wetlands as described in § 55.20(e), and increase the overall resilience of the site, as approved and/or required by HUD. At minimum, these measures must include:


(1) Removal of all residential units and critical action structures from the floodway;


(2) Identification of evacuation routes out of the FFRMS floodplain;


(3) A No-Rise Certification for any new improvements in the floodway; and


(4) Elevation (or floodproofing pursuant to § 55.20(e)(1)) of existing structures within the FFRMS Floodplain, where practicable.
