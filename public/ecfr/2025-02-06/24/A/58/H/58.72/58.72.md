# ยง 58.72   HUD or State actions on RROFs and certifications.

The actions which HUD (or a State) may take with respect to a recipient's environmental certification and RROF are as follows: 


(a) In the absence of any receipt of objection to the contrary, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, HUD (or the State) will assume the validity of the certification and RROF and will approve these documents after expiration of the 15-day period prescribed by statute. 


(b) HUD (or the state) may disapprove a certification and RROF if it has knowledge that the responsible entity or other participants in the development process have not complied with the items in ยง 58.75, or that the RROF and certification are inaccurate. 


(c) In cases in which HUD has approved a certification and RROF but subsequently learns (e.g., through monitoring) that the recipient violated ยง 58.22 or the recipient or responsible entity otherwise failed to comply with a clearly applicable environmental authority, HUD shall impose appropriate remedies and sanctions in accord with the law and regulations for the program under which the violation was found.
