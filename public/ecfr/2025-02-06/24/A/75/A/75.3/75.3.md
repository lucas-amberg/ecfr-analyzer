(a) *General applicability.* Section 3 applies to public housing financial assistance and Section 3 projects, as follows:


(1) *Public housing financial assistance.* Public housing financial assistance means:


(i) Development assistance provided pursuant to section 5 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (the 1937 Act);


(ii) Operations and management assistance provided pursuant to section 9(e) of the 1937 Act;


(iii) Development, modernization, and management assistance provided pursuant to section 9(d) of the 1937 Act; and


(iv) The entirety of a mixed-finance development project as described in 24 CFR 905.604, regardless of whether the project is fully or partially assisted with public housing financial assistance as defined in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.


(2) *Section 3 projects.* (i) Section 3 projects means housing rehabilitation, housing construction, and other public construction projects assisted under HUD programs that provide housing and community development financial assistance when the total amount of assistance to the project exceeds a threshold of $200,000. The threshold is $100,000 where the assistance is from the Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes programs, as authorized by Sections 501 or 502 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970 (12 U.S.C. 1701z-1 or 1701z-2), the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C 4801 *et seq.*); and the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 4851 *et seq.*). The project is the site or sites together with any building(s) and improvements located on the site(s) that are under common ownership, management, and financing.


(ii) The Secretary must update the thresholds provided in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section not less than once every 5 years based on a national construction cost inflation factor through _Federal Register_ notice not subject to public comment. When the Secretary finds it is warranted to ensure compliance with Section 3, the Secretary may adjust, regardless of the national construction cost factor, such thresholds through _Federal Register_ notice, subject to public comment.


(iii) The requirements in this part apply to an entire Section 3 project, regardless of whether the project is fully or partially assisted under HUD programs that provide housing and community development financial assistance.


(b) *Contracts for materials.* Section 3 requirements do not apply to material supply contracts.


(c) *Indian and Tribal preferences.* Contracts, subcontracts, grants, or subgrants subject to Section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5307(b)) or subject to tribal preference requirements as authorized under 101(k) of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (25 U.S.C. 4111(k)) must provide preferences in employment, training, and business opportunities to Indians and Indian organizations, and are therefore not subject to the requirements of this part.


(d) *Other HUD assistance and other Federal assistance.* Recipients that are not subject to Section 3 are encouraged to consider ways to support the purpose of Section 3.
