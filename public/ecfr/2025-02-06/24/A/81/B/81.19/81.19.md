# § 81.19   Affordability—Rent level definitions—tenant income is not known.

For purposes of determining whether a rental unit is affordable to very-low-, low-, or moderate-income families where the income of the family in the dwelling unit is not known to the GSE, the affordability of the unit is determined based on unit size as follows: 


(a) *For moderate-income,* maximum affordable rents to count as housing for moderate-income families shall not exceed the following percentages of area median income with adjustments, depending on unit size: 


(b) *For low-income,* maximum affordable rents to count as housing for low-income families shall not exceed the following percentages of area median income with adjustments, depending on unit size:


(c) *For very-low-income,* maximum affordable rents to count as housing for very-low-income families shall not exceed the following percentages of area median income with adjustments, depending on unit size: 


(d) *For especially-low-income,* maximum affordable rents to count as housing for especially-low-income families shall not exceed the following percentages of area median income with adjustments, depending on unit size: 


(e) *Missing Information.* Each GSE shall make every effort to obtain the information necessary to make the calculations in this section. If a GSE makes such efforts but cannot obtain data on the number of bedrooms in particular units, in making the calculations on such units, the units shall be assumed to be efficiencies except as provided in § 81.15(e)(6)(i).
