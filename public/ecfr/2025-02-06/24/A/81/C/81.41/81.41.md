# ยง 81.41   General.

In this subpart, the Secretary: prohibits discrimination by the GSEs in their mortgage purchases because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, age, or national origin, including any consideration of the age or location of a dwelling or age of the neighborhood or census tract where the dwelling is located in a manner that has a discriminatory effect; requires that the GSEs submit information to the Secretary to assist Fair Housing Act and ECOA investigations; provides for advising the GSEs of Fair Housing Act and ECOA violations; provides for reviewing the GSEs' underwriting and appraisal guidelines to ensure compliance with the Fair Housing Act; and requires that the GSEs take actions as directed by the Secretary following Fair Housing Act and ECOA adjudications. Because FHEFSSA provides, generally, that the Director of OFHEO shall enforce violations by the GSEs of FHEFSSA and regulations in this subpart, this subpart also provides for referral of such cases to the Director.
