# § 81.52   Requirement for program requests.

(a) Before implementing a new program, a GSE shall submit a request for new program approval (“program request”) to the Secretary for the Secretary's review. Submission of a program request is not required where the program that the GSE proposes to implement is not significantly different from: 


(1) A program that has already been approved in writing by the Secretary; or 


(2) A program that was engaged in by the GSE prior to October 28, 1992. 


(b) If a GSE does not submit a program request for a program, the Secretary may request information about the program and require that the GSE submit a program request. The GSE shall comply with the request and may indicate in such response its views respecting whether the program is subject to the Secretary's review.
