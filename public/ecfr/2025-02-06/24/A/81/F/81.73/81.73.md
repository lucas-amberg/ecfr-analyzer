# § 81.73   GSE request for proprietary treatment.

(a) *General.* A GSE may request proprietary treatment of any mortgage data or AHAR information that the GSE submits to the Secretary. Such a request does not affect the GSE's responsibility to provide data or information required by the Secretary. Where the Secretary grants a request for proprietary treatment, HUD will not include the data or information in the public-use database or publicly disclose the data or information, except as otherwise provided in accordance with this subpart. 


(b) *Request for proprietary treatment of mortgage data and AHAR information.* Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a GSE requesting proprietary treatment of mortgage data or AHAR information shall: 


(1) Clearly designate those portions of the mortgage data or AHAR information to be treated as proprietary, with a prominent stamp, typed legend, or other suitable form of notice, stating “Proprietary Information—Confidential Treatment Requested by [name of GSE]” on each page or portion of page to which the request applies. If such marking is impractical, the GSE shall attach to the mortgage data or information for which confidential treatment is requested a cover sheet prominently marked “Proprietary Information—Confidential Treatment Requested by [name of GSE];” 


(2) Accompany its request with a certification by an officer or authorized representative of the GSE that the mortgage data or information is proprietary; and 


(3) Submit any additional statements in support of proprietary designation that the GSE chooses to provide. 


(c) *Alternative procedure available for mortgage data or AHAR information subject to a temporary order, final order, or regulation in effect.* When the request for proprietary treatment pertains to mortgage data or AHAR information that has been deemed proprietary by the Secretary under a temporary order, final order, or regulation in effect, the GSE may reference such temporary order, final order, or regulation in lieu of complying with paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section. 


(d) *Nondisclosure during pendency.* Except as may otherwise be required by law, during the time any Request for Proprietary Treatment under § 81.73 is pending determination by the Secretary, the data or information submitted by the GSE that is the subject of the request shall not be disclosed to, or be subject to examination by, the public or any person or representative of any person or agency outside of HUD.
