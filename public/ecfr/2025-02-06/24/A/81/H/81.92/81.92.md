# ยง 81.92   Law governing rights and obligations of United States, Federal Reserve Banks, and GSEs; rights of any Person against United States, Federal Reserve Banks, and GSEs; Law governing other interests.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the following rights and obligations are governed solely by the book-entry regulations contained in this subpart H, the Securities Documentation, and Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circulars (but not including any choice of law provisions in the Security Documentation to the extent such provisions conflict with the Book-entry regulations contained in this subpart H): 


(1) The rights and obligations of a GSE and the Federal Reserve Banks with respect to: 


(i) A Book-entry GSE Security or Security Entitlement; and 


(ii) The operation of the Book-entry System as it applies to GSE Securities; and 


(2) The rights of any Person, including a Participant, against a GSE and the Federal Reserve Banks with respect to: 


(i) A Book-entry GSE Security or Security Entitlement; and 


(ii) The operation of the Book-entry System as it applies to GSE Securities; 


(b) A security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank from a Participant and that is not recorded on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to ยง 81.93(c)(1), is governed by the law (not including the conflict-of-law rules) of the jurisdiction where the head office of the Federal Reserve Bank maintaining the Participant's Securities Account is located. A security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank from a Person that is not a Participant, and that is not recorded on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to ยง 81.93(c)(1), is governed by the law determined in the manner specified in paragraph (d) of this section. 


(c) If the jurisdiction specified in the first sentence of paragraph (b) of this section is a State that has not adopted Revised Article 8, then the law specified in paragraph (b) of this section shall be the law of that State as though Revised Article 8 had been adopted by that State. 


(d) To the extent not otherwise inconsistent with this subpart H, and notwithstanding any provision in the Security Documentation setting forth a choice of law, the provisions set forth in 31 CFR 357.11 regarding law governing other interests apply and shall be read as though modified to effectuate the application of 31 CFR 357.11 to the GSEs.
