# § 9.130   General prohibitions against discrimination.

(a) No qualified individual with disabilities shall, on the basis of disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency. 


(b)(1) The agency, in providing any housing, aid, benefit, or service, may not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, on the basis of disability—


(i) Deny a qualified individual with disabilities the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the housing, aid, benefit, or service; 


(ii) Afford a qualified individual with disabilities an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the housing, aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others; 


(iii) Provide a qualified individual with disabilities with any housing, aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others; 


(iv) Provide different or separate housing, aid, benefits, or services to individuals with disabilities or to any class of individuals with disabilities than is provided to others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified individuals with disabilities with housing, aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others; 


(v) Deny a qualified individual with disabilities the opportunity to participate as a member of planning or advisory boards; 


(vi) Deny a dwelling to an otherwise qualified buyer or renter because of a disability of that buyer or renter or a person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is sold, rented or made available; or 


(vii) Otherwise limit a qualified individual with disabilities in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving the housing, aid, benefit, or service. 


(2) For purposes of this part, housing, aids, benefits, and services, to be equally effective, are not required to produce the identical result or level of achievement for individuals with disabilities and for persons without disabilities, but must afford individuals with disabilities equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement. 


(3) The agency may not deny a qualified individual with disabilities the opportunity to participate in programs or activities that are not separate or different, despite the existence of programs or activities that are permissibly separate or different for persons with disabilities. 


(4) The agency may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration the purpose or effect of which would: 


(i) Subject qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability; or 


(ii) Defeat or substantially impair accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with respect to individuals with disabilities. 


(5) The agency may not, in determining the site or location of a facility, make selections the purpose or effect of which would: 


(i) Exclude individuals with disabilities from, deny them the benefits of, or otherwise subject them to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency; or 


(ii) Defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with respect to individuals with disabilities. 


(6) The agency, in the selection of procurement contractors, may not use criteria that subject qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability. 


(7) The agency may not administer a licensing or certification program in a manner that subjects qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability, nor may the agency establish requirements for the programs or activities of licensees or certified entities that subject qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability. However, the programs or activities of entities that are licensed or certified by the agency are not, themselves, covered by this part. 


(c)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, persons without disabilities may be excluded from the benefits of a program if the program is limited by Federal statute or Executive order to individuals with disabilities. A specific class of individuals with disabilities may be excluded from a program if the program is limited by Federal statute or Executive order to a different class of individuals. 


(2) Certain agency programs operate under statutory definitions of “persons with disabilities” that are more restrictive than the definition of “individual with disabilities” contained in § 9.103. Those definitions are not superseded or otherwise affected by this regulation. 


(d) The agency shall administer programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities. 


(e) The obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or alleviated by any State or local law or other requirement that, based on disability, imposes inconsistent or contradictory prohibitions or limits upon the eligibility of qualified individuals with disabilities to receive services or to practice any occupation or profession. 


(f) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section does not limit the general prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.
