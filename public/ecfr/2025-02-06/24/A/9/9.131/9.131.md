# § 9.131   Direct threat.

(a) This part does not require the agency to permit an individual to participate in, or benefit from the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of that agency when that individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others. 


(b) “Direct threat” means a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services. 


(c) In determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others, the agency must make an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence to ascertain: the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures will mitigate the risk.
