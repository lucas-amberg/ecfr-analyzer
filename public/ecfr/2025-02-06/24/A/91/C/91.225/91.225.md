Where the HOPWA funds are to be received by a city that is the most populous unit of general local government in an EMSA, it must obtain and keep on file certifications of consistency from the authorized public officials for each other locality in the EMSA in which housing assistance is provided. 


(6) *Acquisition and relocation.* The jurisdiction must submit a certification that it will comply with the acquisition and relocation requirements of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4601), and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24.

(i) With respect to activities expected to be assisted with CDBG funds, the Action Plan has been developed so as to give the maximum feasible priority to activities that will benefit low- and moderate-income families or aid in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight. The plan may also include CDBG-assisted activities that are certified to be designed to meet other community development needs having particular urgency because existing conditions pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community where other financial resources are not available to meet such needs; 


(ii) The aggregate use of CDBG funds, including section 108 guaranteed loans, during a period specified by the jurisdiction, consisting of one, two, or three specific consecutive program years, shall principally benefit low- and moderate-income families in a manner that ensures that at least 70 percent of the amount is expended for activities that benefit such persons during the designated period (see 24 CFR 570.3 for definition of “CDBG funds”); and

In addition, with respect to properties owned and occupied by moderate-income (but not low-income) families, an assessment or charge may be made against the property with respect to the public improvements financed by a source other than CDBG funds if the jurisdiction certifies that it lacks CDBG funds to cover the assessment.

(4) In the case of assistance involving shelter operations or essential services related to street outreach or emergency shelter, the jurisdiction will provide services or shelter to homeless individuals and families for the period during which the ESG assistance is provided, without regard to a particular site or structure, so long as the jurisdiction serves the same type of persons (*e.g.,* families with children, unaccompanied youth, disabled individuals, or victims of domestic violence) or persons in the same geographic area;


(5) Any renovation carried out with ESG assistance shall be sufficient to ensure that the building involved is safe and sanitary;

(9) To the maximum extent practicable, the jurisdiction will involve, through employment, volunteer services, or otherwise, homeless individuals and families in constructing, renovating, maintaining, and operating facilities assisted under the ESG program, in providing services assisted under the program, and in providing services for occupants of facilities assisted under the program;


(10) All activities the jurisdiction undertakes with assistance under ESG are consistent with the jurisdiction's consolidated plan; and


(11) The jurisdiction will establish and implement, to the maximum extent practicable and where appropriate, policies and protocols for the discharge of persons from publicly funded institutions or systems of care (such as health-care facilities, mental health facilities, foster care or other youth facilities, or correction programs and institutions) in order to prevent this discharge from immediately resulting in homelessness for these persons.
