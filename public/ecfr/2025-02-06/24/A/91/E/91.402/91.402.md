# § 91.402   Consolidated program year.

(a) *Same program year for consortia members.* All units of general local government that are members of a consortium must be on the same program year for CDBG, HOME, ESG, and HOPWA. The program year shall run for a twelve month period and begin on the first calendar day of a month. 


(b) *Transition period.* (1) A consortium in existence on February 6, 1995, with all members having aligned program years must comply with paragraph (a) of this section. A consortium in existence on February 6, 1995, in which all members do not have aligned program years will be allowed a transition period during the balance of its current consortium agreement to bring the program year for all members into alignment. 


(2) During any such transition period, the lead agency (if it is a CDBG entitlement community) must submit, as its consolidated plan, a plan that complies with this subpart for the consortium, plus its nonhousing Community Development Plan (in accordance with § 91.215). All other CDBG entitlement communities in the consortium may submit their respective nonhousing Community Development Plans (§ 91.215(e)), an Action Plan (§ 91.220) and the certifications (§ 91.425(a) and (b)) in accordance with their individual program years.
