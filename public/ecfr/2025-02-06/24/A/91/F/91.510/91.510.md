# ยง 91.510   Consistency determinations.

(a) *Applicability.* For competitive programs, a certification of consistency of the application with the approved consolidated plan for the jurisdiction may be required, whether the applicant is the jurisdiction or another applicant. 


(b) *Certifying authority.* (1) The certification must be obtained from the unit of general local government if the project will be located in a unit of general local government that: is required to have a consolidated plan, is authorized to use an abbreviated consolidated plan but elects to prepare and has submitted a full consolidated plan, or is authorized to use an abbreviated consolidated plan and is applying for the same program as the applicant pursuant to the same Notice of Funding Availability (and therefore has or will have an abbreviated consolidated plan for the fiscal year for that program). 


(2) If the project will not be located in a unit of general local government, the certification may be obtained from the State or, if the project will be located in a unit of general local government authorized to use an abbreviated consolidated plan, from the unit of general local government if it is willing to prepare such a plan. 


(3) Where the recipient of a HOPWA grant is a city that is the most populous unit of general local government in an EMSA, it also must obtain and keep on file certifications of consistency from such public officials for each other locality in the EMSA in which housing assistance is provided. 


(c) *Meaning.* A jurisdiction's certification that an application is consistent with its consolidated plan means the jurisdiction's plan shows need, the proposed activities are consistent with the jurisdiction's strategic plan, and the location of the proposed activities is consistent with the geographic areas specified in the plan. The jurisdiction shall provide the reasons for the denial when it fails to provide a certification of consistency.
