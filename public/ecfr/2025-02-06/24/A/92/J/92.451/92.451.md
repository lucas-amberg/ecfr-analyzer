(ii) Provide notice of its intent to become a participating jurisdiction in accordance with § 92.103; or 


(iii) Submit its consolidated plan, in accordance with 24 CFR part 91; or 


(2) HUD after providing for amendments and resubmissions in accordance with 24 CFR part 91 disapproves the jurisdiction's consolidated plan. 


(b) *Designation revoked.* HUD will reallocate, under this section, any funds remaining in a jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund after HUD has revoked the jurisdiction's designation as a participating jurisdiction under § 92.107. 


(c) *Manner of reallocation.* HUD will reallocate funds that are subject to reallocation under this section in the following manner: 


(1) If the funds to be reallocated under this section are from a State, HUD will: 


(i) Make the funds available by competition in accordance with criteria in § 92.453 among applications submitted by units of general local government within the State and with preference being given to applications from units of general local government that are not participating jurisdictions, and 


(ii) Reallocate the remainder by formula in accordance with § 92.454. 


(2) If the funds to be reallocated are from a unit of general local government:
