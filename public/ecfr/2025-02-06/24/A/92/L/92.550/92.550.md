# ยง 92.550   Performance reviews.

(a) *General.* HUD will review the performance of each participating jurisdiction in carrying out its responsibilities under this part whenever determined necessary by HUD, but at least annually. In conducting performance reviews, HUD will rely primarily on information obtained from the participating jurisdiction's and, as appropriate, the State recipient's records and reports, findings from on-site monitoring, audit reports, and information generated from the disbursement and information system established by HUD. Where applicable, HUD may also consider relevant information pertaining to a participating jurisdiction's or State recipient's performance gained from other sources, including citizen comments, complaint determinations, and litigation. Reviews to determine compliance with specific requirements of this part will be conducted as necessary, with or without prior notice to the participating jurisdiction or State recipient. Comprehensive performance reviews under the standards in paragraph (b) of this section will be conducted after prior notice to the participating jurisdiction. 


(b) *Standards for comprehensive performance review.* A participating jurisdiction's performance will be comprehensively reviewed periodically, as prescribed by HUD, to determine: 


(1) For local participating jurisdictions and State participating jurisdictions administering their own HOME programs, whether the participating jurisdiction has committed the HOME funds in the United States Treasury account as required by ยง 92.500 and expended the funds in the United States Treasury account as required by ยง 92.500, and has met the requirements of this part, particularly eligible activities, income targeting, affordability, and matching requirements; or 


(2) For State participating jurisdictions distributing HOME funds to State recipients, whether the State has met the matching contribution and other requirements of this part; has distributed the funds in accordance with the requirements of this part; and has made such reviews and audits of its State recipients as may be appropriate to determine whether they have satisfied the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
