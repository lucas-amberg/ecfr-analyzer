# ยง 93.1   Overview.

(a) This part implements the Housing Trust Fund (HTF) program established under section 1338 of the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, as amended (12 U.S.C. 4501 *et seq.*) (the Act). In general, under the HTF program, HUD allocates funds by formula to eligible States to increase and preserve the supply of decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing, with primary attention to rental housing for extremely low-income and very low-income households, including homeless families.


(b) Section 1337 of the Act requires a percentage of the unpaid principal balance of total new business for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) (collectively, the government-sponsored enterprises or GSEs) to be setaside and allocated as a dedicated source of annual funding for the HTF, unless allocations are suspended by the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the agency that regulates the GSEs. These funds will be deposited into an HTF account established in the Treasury of the United States by the Secretary of the Treasury to carry out the HTF program. The Act also provides that the HTF may be funded with amounts appropriated, transferred, or credited to the HTF under other provisions of law.
