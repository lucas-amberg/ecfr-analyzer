(a) *Need factor one.* The ratio of the shortage of standard rental units both affordable and available to extremely low-income renter households in the State to the aggregate shortage of standard rental units both affordable and available to extremely low-income renter households in all the States.


(b) *Need factor two.* The ratio of the shortage of standard rental units both affordable and available to very low-income renter households in the State to the aggregate shortage of standard rental units both affordable and available to very low-income renter households in all the States.


(c) *Need factor three.* The ratio of:


(1) Extremely low-income renter households in the State living with either incomplete kitchen or plumbing facilities, more than one person per room, or paying more than 50 percent of income for housing costs, to

(e) *Construction cost factor.* The resulting sum calculated from the factors described in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section shall be multiplied by the relative cost of construction in the state. For purposes of calculating this factor, the term “cost of construction”:


(1) Means the cost of construction or building rehabilitation in the State relative to the national cost of construction or building rehabilitation; and


(2) Is calculated so that values higher than 1.0 indicate that the State's construction costs are higher than the national average, a value of 1.0 indicates that the State's construction costs are exactly the same as the national average, and values lower than 1.0 indicate that the State's cost of construction are lower than the national average.
