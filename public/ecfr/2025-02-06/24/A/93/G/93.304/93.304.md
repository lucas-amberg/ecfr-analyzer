# § 93.304   Qualification as affordable housing: Homeownership.

(a) *Homeownership activities.* Housing that is for purchase by a first-time homebuyer must meet the affordability requirements of this section.


(b) *Single family housing.* The housing must be single-family housing, as defined at § 93.2.


(c) *Modest housing.* The housing must be modest housing, in accordance with § 93.305.


(d) *First-time homebuyer and income requirements.* The housing must be acquired by a first-time homebuyer whose family qualifies as an income-eligible family in accordance with § 93.251 and the housing must be the principal residence of the family throughout the period described in paragraph (e) of this section. In determining the income eligibility of the family, the grantee must include the income of all persons living in the housing. Before purchasing the housing, the family must have completed a program of independent financial education and homeownership counseling from an eligible organization that has been certified in accordance with section 106(e) of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701x (e)).


(e) *Period of affordability.* The HTF-assisted housing must meet the affordability requirements for not less than 30 years.


(f) *Resale or recapture requirements.* The grantee must establish the resale or recapture requirements that comply with the standards of § 93.305 and set forth the requirements in its consolidated plan. HUD must determine that they are appropriate and must specifically approve them in writing.


(g) *Special considerations for single family properties with more than one unit.* (1) If the HTF funds are used only to assist an income-eligible homebuyer in acquiring one unit in a single family property containing more than one unit and the assisted unit will be the principal residence of the homebuyer, the affordability requirements of this section apply only to the assisted unit.


(2) If HTF funds are also used to assist the income-eligible homebuyer in acquiring one or more of the rental units in the single family property, the affordability requirements of § 93.302 apply to assisted rental units, except that the grantee must impose resale restrictions on all assisted units (owner-occupied and rental units) in the single-family housing. The affordability requirements on all assisted units continue for the period of affordability. If HTF funds are used to assist only the rental units in such a property, then the requirements of § 93.302 would apply and the owner-occupied unit would not be subject to the income targeting or affordability provisions of this section.


(h) *Lease-purchase.* (1) HTF funds may be used to assist homebuyers through lease-purchase programs for existing housing and for housing to be constructed. The housing must be purchased by an eligible homebuyer within 36 months of signing the lease-purchase agreement. The homebuyer must qualify as an income-eligible family at the time the lease-purchase agreement is signed.


(2) If HTF funds are used to acquire housing that will be resold to a homebuyer through a lease-purchase program, the HTF affordability requirements for rental housing in § 93.302 shall apply if the housing is not transferred to an eligible homebuyer within 42 months after project completion.


(i) *Contract to purchase.* If HTF funds are used to assist a homebuyer who has entered into a contract to purchase housing to be constructed, the homebuyer must qualify as an income-eligible family at the time the contract is signed.


(j) If there is no ratified sales contract with an eligible homebuyer for the housing within 9 months of the date of completion of construction or rehabilitation, the housing must be rented to an eligible tenant in accordance with § 93.301.


(k) *Preserving affordability.* (1) To preserve the affordability of housing that was previously assisted with HTF funds and subject to the requirements of this section, a grantee may use additional HTF funds to acquire the housing through a purchase option, right of first refusal, or other preemptive right before foreclosure, or to acquire the housing at the foreclosure sale, undertake any necessary rehabilitation, and provide assistance to another first-time homebuyer. The housing must be sold to a new eligible homebuyer in accordance with the requirements of this section. Additional HTF funds may not be used if the mortgage in default was funded with HTF funds.


(2) The total amount of original and additional HTF assistance may not exceed the maximum per-unit development subsidy amount established pursuant to § 93.300. As an alternative to charging the cost to the HTF program under § 93.201, the grantee may charge the cost to the HTF program under § 93.302 as a reasonable administrative cost of its HTF program, so that the additional HTF funds for the housing are not subject to the maximum per-unit subsidy amount.


(l) *Agreements with lending institutions.* (1) The grantee may provide homeownership assistance through written agreements with for-profit or nonprofit lending institutions that are providing the first mortgage loan to a family. The grantee must independently verify that the family is income-eligible and meets the definition of “first-time homebuyer,” and must inspect the housing for compliance with the applicable property standards.


(2) No fees may be charged to the family for the HTF homeownership assistance (*e.g.,* origination fees or points, processing fees, inspection fees). The grantee must determine that the fees and other amounts charged to the family by the lender for the first mortgage financing are reasonable. Reasonable administrative costs of the HTF homeownership assistance can be charged to the HTF program as a project cost. If the grantee requires lenders to pay a fee to participate in the HTF program, the fee is program income to the HTF program.


(m) *Written policies.* The grantee must have and follow written policies for:


(1) Underwriting standards for homeownership assistance that examine the family's housing debt, overall debt, income, and ability to maintain the housing;


(2) Anti-predatory lending; and


(3) Refinancing loans to which HTF loans are subordinated to ensure that the terms of the new loan are reasonable.
