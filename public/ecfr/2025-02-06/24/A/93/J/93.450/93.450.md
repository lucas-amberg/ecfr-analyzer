# § 93.450   Accountability of recipients.

The grantee shall review each recipient to determine compliance with the requirements of this part and the terms of the written agreement in accordance with the grantee's policies, procedures, and systems established pursuant to § 93.404(a).


(a) *Misuse of funds*—(1) *Reimbursement requirement.* If a recipient of HTF assistance is determined to have used HTF funds in a manner that is materially in violation of the requirements of this part or any requirements or conditions under which the funds were provided, the grantee must require that, within 12 months after the determination of such misuse, the recipient reimburse the grantee for such misused amounts and return to the grantee any such amounts that remain unused or uncommitted for use. The reimbursement is in addition to any other remedies that may be available under law.


(2) *Determination.* The grantee or HUD may make the determination, provided that:


(i) The grantee provides notification and opportunity for discretionary review to HUD; and


(ii) HUD does not subsequently reverse the determination.


(b) *Reduction for failure to obtain return of misused funds.* (1) If, in any year, a grantee fails to obtain reimbursement or return of the full amount required to be reimbursed or returned to the grantee during the year, the amount of the grant for the grantee for the succeeding year will be reduced by the amount by which the amounts required to be reimbursed or returned exceed the amount actually reimbursed or returned.


(2) In any case in which a failure to obtain reimbursement or return occurs during a year immediately preceding a year in which HTF grants will not be made, the grantee shall pay to HUD, for reallocation among the other grantees, an amount equal to the amount of the reduction for the entity that would otherwise apply.
