# § 93.453   Notice and opportunity for hearing; sanctions.

(a) If HUD finds after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing that a grantee has substantially failed to comply with any provision of this part, and until HUD is satisfied that there is no longer any such failure to comply:


(1) HUD shall reduce the funds in the grantee's HTF account by the amount of any expenditures that were not in accordance with the requirements of this part or require the grantee to repay to HUD any amount of the HTF grant that was not used in accordance with the requirements of this part; and


(2) HUD may do one or more of the following:


(i) Prevent withdrawals from the grantee's HTF account for activities affected by the failure to comply;


(ii) Restrict the grantee's activities under this part to activities or recipients not affected by the failure to comply;


(iii) Remove the State from participation in allocations or reallocations of funds made available under §§ 93.50 through 93.54 of this part; or


(iv) Terminate any HTF assistance to the grantee. HUD may, on due notice, suspend payments at any time after the issuance of a notice of opportunity for hearing pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, pending such hearing and a final decision, to the extent that HUD determines such action to be necessary to preclude the further expenditure of funds for activities affected by the failure to comply.


(b) *Proceedings.* When HUD proposes to take action pursuant to this section, the respondent in the proceedings will be the grantee. Proceedings will be conducted in accordance with 24 CFR part 26.
