(a) An ex parte communication is any direct or indirect communication concerning the merits of a pending proceeding, made by a party in the absence of any other party, to the presiding ALJ, and which was neither on the record nor on reasonable prior notice to all parties. Ex parte communications do not include communications made for the sole purpose of scheduling hearings, requesting extensions of time, or requesting information on the status of cases. 


(b) Ex parte communications are prohibited. 


(c) If the ALJ receives an ex parte communication that the ALJ knows or has reason to believe is prohibited, the ALJ shall promptly place the communication, or a written statement of the substance of the communication, in the record and shall furnish copies to all parties. Unauthorized communications shall not be taken into consideration in deciding any matter in issue. Any party making a prohibited ex parte communication may be subject to sanctions including, but not limited to, exclusion from the proceeding and an adverse ruling on the issue that is the subject of the prohibited communication.
