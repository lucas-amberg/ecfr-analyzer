(a) *Oral hearings.* Where there is an oral hearing, the hearing ends on the day of the adjournment of the oral hearing or, where written briefs are permitted, on the date that the written briefs are due. 


(b) *Hearing on written record.* Where the parties have waived an oral hearing, the hearing ends on the date set by the ALJ as the final date for the receipt of submissions by the parties. 


(c) *Receipt of evidence following hearing.* Following the end of the hearing, no additional evidence may be accepted into the record, except with the permission of the ALJ. The ALJ may receive additional evidence upon a determination that new and material evidence was not readily available before the end of the hearing, the evidence has been timely submitted, and its acceptance will not unduly prejudice the rights of the parties.
