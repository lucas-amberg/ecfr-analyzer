(2) A necessary legal conclusion is erroneous; 


(3) The decision is contrary to law, duly promulgated rules of HUD, or legal precedent; or 


(4) A prejudicial error of procedure was committed. 


(c) Each issue shall be plainly and concisely stated and shall be supported by citations to the record when assignments of error are based on the record, statutes, regulations, cases, or other authorities relied upon.
