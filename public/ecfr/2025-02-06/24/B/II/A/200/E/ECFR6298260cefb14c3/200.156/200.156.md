# ยง 200.156   Settlement of claims.

Upon the Secretary's approval of a claim, the claim will be settled by issuance of cash, debentures or both, and, in certain cases, by issuance of a certificate of claim. However, in the event a final claim is in a negative amount, the claim will be settled by the mortgagee's payment of cash or surrender of debentures at par plus accrued interest to the Secretary.
