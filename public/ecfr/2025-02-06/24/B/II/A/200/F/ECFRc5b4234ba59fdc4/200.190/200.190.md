# § 200.190   HUD list of qualified 203(k) consultants.

(a) *Qualified consultant list.* HUD maintains a list of qualified consultants for use in the rehabilitation loan insurance program authorized by section 203(k) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(k)) (referred to as the “203(k) Program”). 


(b) *Consultant functions.* Only a consultant included on the list may be selected by the lender to conduct any consultant function under the 203(k) Program (see § 203.50(l) of this title). 


(c) *Disclaimer.* The inclusion of a consultant on the list means only that the consultant has met the qualifications and conditions prescribed by the Secretary for placement on the list of consultants qualified for the 203(k) Program. The inclusion of a consultant on the list does not create or imply a warranty or endorsement by HUD of the consultant, nor does it represent a warranty of any work performed by the consultant.
