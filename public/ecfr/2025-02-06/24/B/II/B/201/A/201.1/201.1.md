# ยง 201.1   Purpose.

These regulations implement the provisions of section 2 of title I of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1703). They contain the requirements under which an approved financial institution may obtain insurance on loans made for the alteration, repair or improvement of property, for the purchase of a manufactured home and/or the lot on which to place such home, for the purchase and installation of fire safety equipment in existing health care facilities, and for the preservation of historic structures. The insurance granted by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall be available only for loans involving property located within a State, as that term is defined in ยง 201.2. The insurance can cover up to 10 percent of the amount of all insured Title I loans in the financial institution's portfolio, as reflected in the total amount of insurance coverage contained at any time in an insurance coverage reserve account established by the Secretary, less amounts for insurance claims paid. As limited by the amount of insurance coverage in such a reserve account, the insurance can cover up to 90 percent of the loss of any individual loan.
