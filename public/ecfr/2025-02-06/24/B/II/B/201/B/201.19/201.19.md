(3) Refinancing of a loan that was not secured when originated is not required to be secured if no additional funds are advanced.


(4) When a refinanced loan is secured, the lender shall obtain and record a new security instrument in accordance with § 201.24 and shall release the original lien, unless State law permits a renewal and extension of the original lien.


(5) Copies of all documents pertaining to the original loan must be retained in the loan file for the refinanced loan.

(ii) Constitutes the assumptor's agreement to pay penalties and administrative costs imposed by HUD as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3717. 


(4) If the other requirements of paragraph (c) of this section are met, the lender at its option may release the original borrower and any intervening assumptors from liability for the repayment of a loan obligation insured under this part. The prior approval of the Secretary under § 201.24(e) is not required. The lender shall retain documentation of the release in the loan file.
