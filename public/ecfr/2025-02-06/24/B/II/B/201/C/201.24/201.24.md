# § 201.24   Security requirements.

(a) *Property improvement loans*—(1) *Property improvement loans in excess of $7,500.* (i) Any property improvement loan in excess of $7,500 shall be secured by a recorded lien on the improved property. The lien shall be evidenced by a mortgage or deed of trust, executed by the borrower and all other owners in fee simple.


(ii) If the borrower is a lessee, the borrower and all owners in fee simple must execute the mortgage or deed of trust. If the borrower is purchasing the property under a land installment contract, the borrower, all owners in fee simple, and all intervening contract sellers must execute the mortgage or deed of trust.


(iii) The lien need not be a first lien on the property; however, the lien securing the Title I loan must hold no less than the second lien position. This requirement shall not apply where the first and second mortgages were made at the same time or the second mortgage was provided by a state or local government agency in conjunction with a downpayment assistance program.


(2) *Property improvement loans of $7,500 or less.* Any property improvement loan for $7,500 or less (other than a manufactured home improvement loan) shall be similarly secured if, including any such additional loans, the total amount of all Title I loans on the improved property is more than $7,500.


(3) *Manufactured home improvement loans.* Manufactured home improvement loans need not be secured.


(b) *Manufactured home loans.* Any manufactured home loan shall be secured by a recorded lien on the home (or lot or home and lot, as appropriate), its furnishings, equipment, accessories, and appurtenances. The lien shall be a first lien, superior to any other lien on that property, and shall be evidenced by a properly recorded financing statement, a properly recorded security instrument executed by the borrower and any other owner of the property, or another acceptable instrument, such as a certificate of title issued by the State and containing a recitation of the lender's lien interest in the manufactured home.


(c) *Recording and perfection of security.* The lender shall assure that the legal description of the property as recited in the security instrument is accurate, and that the security instrument creates a valid and enforceable lien on the property in the jurisdiction in which the property is located. The security instrument shall be recorded and perfected in the manner specified by applicable State law in the State where the property is located.


(d) *Substitution or subordination of security.* The Secretary may approve substitution or subordination of security where the security value will not be impaired or reduced.


(e) *Release of liability or lien.* The lender shall not release the borrower or any co-maker or co-signer from any liability under a note or from any lien securing a loan insured under this part without the prior approval of the Secretary.
