# ยง 201.42   Bankruptcy, insolvency or death of borrower.

(a) *Bankruptcy or insolvency.* The lender shall file a proof of claim with the court having jurisdiction when the lender has timely information that a borrower is involved in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, except that a proof of claim need not be filed if the court notifies the lender that the borrower has no assets and a proof of claim should not be filed. The notice of bankruptcy and a copy of the proof of claim (or the notice from the court that a proof of claim is not required) shall be retained in the loan file.


(b) *Death of a borrower.* The lender shall file a proof of claim with the court having jurisdiction when the lender has timely information that a borrower is deceased, unless the lender determines that there will not be a probate proceeding. A copy of the proof of claim (or documentation as to why a proof of claim was not filed) shall be retained in the loan file.


(c) *Responsibility of the lender after insurance claim is filed.* After the Secretary pays an insurance claim, the Secretary will notify the bankruptcy or probate court, as appropriate, that the loan has been assigned to the United States and will request substitution as the party to whom the claim is owed. Until the insurance claim is paid, the lender shall take all steps necessary to protect the interests of the holder of the note in any bankruptcy or probate proceeding.
