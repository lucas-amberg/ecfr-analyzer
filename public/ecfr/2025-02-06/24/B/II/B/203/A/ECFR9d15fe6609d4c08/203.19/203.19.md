# § 203.19   Qualified mortgage.

(a) *Definitions.* As used in this section:


(1) *Average prime offer rate* means an annual percentage rate that is derived from average interest rates, points, and other loan pricing terms currently offered to mortgagors by a representative sample of mortgagees for mortgage transactions that have low-risk pricing characteristics as published by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) from time to time in accordance with the CFPB's regulations at 12 CFR 1026.35, pertaining to prohibited acts or practices in connection with higher-priced mortgage loans.


(2) *Annual percentage rate* is the measure of the cost of credit, expressed as a yearly rate, that relates the amount and timing of value received by the mortgagor to the amount and timing of payments made and is the rate required to be disclosed by the mortgagee under 12 CFR 1026.18, pertaining to disclosure of finance charges for mortgages.


(3) *Points and fees* has the meaning given to “points and fees” in 12 CFR 1026.32(b)(1) as of January 10, 2014. Any changes made by the CFPB to the points and fees definition may be adopted by HUD through publication of a notice and after providing FHA-approved mortgagees with time, as may be determined necessary, to implement.


(b) *Qualified mortgage*—(1) *Limit.* For a single family mortgage to be insured under title II of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*), except for mortgages for manufactured housing and mortgages under paragraph (c) of this section, the total points and fees payable in connection with a loan used to secure a dwelling shall not exceed the CFPB's limit on points and fees for qualified mortgage in its regulations at 12 CFR 1026.43(e)(3) as of January 10, 2014. Any changes made by the CFPB to the limit on points and fees may be adopted by HUD through publication of a notice and after providing FHA-approved mortgagees with time, as may be determined necessary, to implement.


(2) *Rebuttable presumption qualified mortgage.* (i) A single family mortgage insured under title II of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*), except for mortgages for manufactured housing and mortgages under paragraph (c) of this section, that has an annual percentage rate that exceeds the average prime offer rate for a comparable mortgage, as of the date the interest rate is set, by more than the combined annual mortgage insurance premium and 1.15 percentage points for a first-lien mortgage is a rebuttable presumption qualified mortgage that is presumed to comply with the ability to repay requirements in 15 U.S.C. 1639c(a).


(ii) To rebut the presumption of compliance, it must be proven that the mortgage exceeded the points and fees limit in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or that, despite the mortgage having been endorsed for insurance under the National Housing Act, the mortgagee did not make a reasonable and good-faith determination of the mortgagor's repayment ability at the time of consummation, by failing to evaluate the mortgagor's income, credit, and assets in accordance with HUD underwriting requirements.


(3) *Safe harbor qualified mortgage.* (i) A mortgage for manufactured housing that is insured under Title II of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) is a safe harbor qualified mortgage that meets the ability to repay requirements in 15 U.S.C. 1639c(a); and


(ii) A single family mortgage insured under title II of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*), except for mortgages under paragraph (c) of this section, that has an annual percentage rate that does not exceed the average prime offer rate for a comparable mortgage, as of the date the interest rate is set, by more than the combined annual mortgage insurance premium and 1.15 percentage points for a first-lien mortgage is a safe harbor qualified mortgage that meets the ability to repay requirements in 15 U.S.C. 1639c(a).


(4) *Effect of indemnification on qualified mortgage status.* An indemnification demand or resolution of a demand that relates to whether the loan satisfied relevant eligibility and underwriting requirements at the time of consummation may result from facts that could allow a change to qualified mortgage status, but the existence of an indemnification does not per se remove qualified mortgage status.


(c) *Exempted transactions.* The following transactions are exempted from the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section:


(1) Home Equity Conversion Mortgages under section 255 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715z-20); and


(2) Mortgage transactions exempted by the CFPB in its regulations at 12 CFR 1026.43(a)(3) as of January 10, 2014. Any changes made by CFPB to the list of exempted transactions may be adopted by HUD through publication of a notice and after providing FHA-approved mortgagees with time, as may be determined necessary, to implement.


(d) *Ability to make adjustments to this section by notice.* The FHA Commissioner may make adjustments to this section, including the calculations of fees or the list of transactions excluded from compliance with the requirements of this section as the Commissioner determines necessary for purposes of meeting FHA's mission, after solicitation and consideration of public comments.
