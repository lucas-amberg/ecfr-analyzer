(c) The Commissioner may insure under this part, without regard to any limitation upon eligibility contained in the other provisions of this subpart, any mortgage given to refinance an existing mortgage insured under the National Housing Act. The refinancing mortgage must meet the following special requirements: 


(1)(i) Except as provided by paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the refinancing mortgage must be in an amount that does not exceed the least of (A) the original principal amount of the existing mortgage; (B) the sum of the outstanding principal balance of the existing mortgage, plus loan closing charges approved by the Commissioner; or (C) in the case of an eligible non-occupant mortgagor (as defined in § 203.18(f)), the outstanding balance of the existing mortgage. 


(ii) In the case of graduated payment mortgages insured under section 203 of the Act pursuant to section 245 (a) or (b) of the Act (§ 203.45 or § 203.46 [as in effect immediately before its removal at 52 FR 32754, published August 28, 1987]), the refinancing mortgage must have a principal amount that does not exceed the outstanding balance of the existing mortgage. 


(iii) If a one-time mortgage insurance premium (MIP) was financed as part of the existing mortgage referred to in paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, the amount of the premium refund to which the mortgagor is entitled must be deducted in determining the original principal amount and the unpaid principal balance of the existing mortgage under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section and the outstanding balance of the existing mortgage under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. However, the maximum amount of the refinancing mortgage computed in accordance with this paragraph (c)(1) may be increased by the amount of the one-time MIP (if any) associated with the refinancing mortgage; 


(2) It must have a term which does not exceed the unexpired term of the existing mortgage, except that in any case where the Commissioner determines that an extension of the term of the mortgage will inure to the benefit of the applicable insurance fund, taking into consideration the outstanding insurance liability under the existing insured mortgage, the term may be extended to the lesser of (i) 30 years or (ii) the unexpired term of the existing mortgage, plus 12 years; 


(3) The mortgage must result in a reduction in regular monthly payments by the mortgagor, except: 


(i) When a fixed rate mortgage is given to refinance an adjustable rate mortgage held by a mortgagor who is to occupy the dwelling as a principal residence or secondary residence, as these terms are defined in § 203.18(f); or 


(ii) When refinancing a mortgage for a shorter term will result in an increase in the mortgagor's regular monthly payments of no more than $50. In the case of a graduated payment mortgage, the reduction in regular monthly payments means a reduction from the payment due under the existing mortgage for the month in which the refinancing mortgage is executed. 


(4) It must be made by a mortgagor whose record of payment on the existing mortgage meets standards established by the Commissioner; and 


(5) The mortgagee may not require a minimum principal amount to be outstanding on the loan secured by the existing mortgage. 


(d)-(f) [Reserved] 


(g) The provisions of § 203.28 shall not apply to mortgages insured under this section. 


(h) The provisions of § 203.38 shall not apply to mortgages of the character described in paragraph (b) of this section and at the time any such mortgage is insured there must be located on the mortgaged property a dwelling unit designed principally for residential use for not more than eight families. 


(i)-(j) [Reserved] 


(k) The Commissioner may insure under this part, without regard to any limitation upon eligibility contained in this subpart, any mortgage assigned to the Commissioner in connection with payment under a contract of mortgage insurance, or executed in connection with a sale by the Commissioner of any property acquired in the settlement of an insurance claim under any section or title of the National Housing Act.
