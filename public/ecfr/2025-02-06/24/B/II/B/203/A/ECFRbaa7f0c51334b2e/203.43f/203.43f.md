Applications relating to insurance of mortgages under this paragraph (c) must be accompanied by an agreement in form satisfactory to the Commissioner executed by the seller or builder or such other person as the Commissioner may require agreeing that in the event of any sale or conveyance of the dwelling within a period of one year beginning with the date of initial occupancy, the seller, builder, or such other person will at the time of such sale or conveyance deliver to the purchaser or owner of such property the manufacturer's warranty on a form prescribed by the Commissioner, which shall provide that the manufacturer's warranty is in addition to and not in derogation of all other rights and remedies the purchaser or owner may have, and a warranty in form satisfactory to the Commissioner warranting that the manufactured home, the foundation, positioning and anchoring of the manufactured home to its permanent foundation, and all site improvements are constructed in substantial conformity with the plans and specifications (including amendments thereof or changes and variations therein which have been approved in writing by the Commissioner) on which the Commissioner has based his valuation of the dwelling. The warranty shall also include provisions that the manufactured home sustained no hidden damage during transportation, and if the manufactured home is a double-wide, that the sections were properly joined and sealed. Such agreement must provide that upon the sale or conveyance of the dwelling and delivery of the warranty, the seller, builder or such other person will promptly furnish the Commissioner with a conformed copy of the warranty establishing by the purchaser's receipt thereon that the original warranty has been delivered to the purchaser in accordance with this section.
