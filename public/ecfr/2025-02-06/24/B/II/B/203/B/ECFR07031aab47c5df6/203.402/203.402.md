The insurance benefits paid in connection with foreclosed properties, whether or not conveyed to the Commissioner; and those properties conveyed to the Commissioner as a result of a deed in lieu of foreclosure; and those properties sold under an approved pre-foreclosure sale shall include the following items: 


(a) Taxes, ground rents, water rates, and utility charges that are liens prior to the mortgage.


(b) Special assessments, which are noted on the application for insurance or which become liens after the insurance of the mortgage. 


(c) Hazard insurance premiums on the mortgaged property not in excess of a *reasonable rate* as defined in § 203.379(a)(4). 


(d) Periodic MIP or open-end insurance charges;


(e) Taxes imposed upon any deeds or other instruments by which said property was acquired by the mortgagee and transferred or conveyed to the Commissioner, or was acquired by the mortgagee and retained pursuant to § 203.368; 


(f) Foreclosure costs or costs of acquiring the property otherwise (including costs of acquiring the property by the mortgagee and of conveying and evidencing title to the property to HUD, but not including any costs borne by the mortgagee to correct title defects) actually paid by the mortgagee and approved by HUD, in an amount not in excess of two-thirds of such costs or $75, whichever is the greater. For mortgages insured on or after February 1, 1998, the Secretary will reimburse a percentage of foreclosure costs or costs of acquiring the property, which percentage shall be determined in accordance with such conditions as the Secretary shall prescribe. Where the foreclosure involves a mortgage sold by the Secretary on or after August 1, 1969, or a mortgage executed in connection with the sale of property by the Secretary on or after such date, the mortgagee shall be reimbursed (in addition to the amount determined under the foregoing) for any extra costs incurred in the foreclosure as a result of a defect in the mortgage instrument, or a defect in the mortgage transaction or a defect in title which existed at or prior to the time the mortgage (or its assignment by the Secretary) was filed for record, if the mortgagee establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that such extra costs are over and above those customarily incurred in the area.

(2) *For mortgages insured under firm commitments issued on or after November 19, 1992, or under direct endorsement processing where the credit worksheet was signed by the mortgagee's underwriter on or after November 19, 1992,* reasonable payments made by the mortgagee, with the approval of the Secretary, for the purpose of protecting, operating, or preserving the property, or removing debris from the property prior to the time of conveyance required by § 203.359 of this part. 


(3) Reasonable costs for performing the inspections required by § 203.377 of this part and to determine if the property is vacant or abandoned are considered to be costs of protecting, operating or preserving the property. 


(h) Any uncollected mortgage interest allowed pursuant to an approved forbearance plan;


(i) An amount which the Commissioner finds to be sufficient to compensate the mortgagee for any loss which it may have sustained on account of interest on debentures and the payment of any MIP and open-end insurance charge by reason of its having postponed the institution of foreclosure proceedings or the acquisition of the property by other means under a mortgage to which the provisions of sections 302 and 306 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, as amended, apply during any part or all of the period of the mortgagor's military service and three months thereafter;
