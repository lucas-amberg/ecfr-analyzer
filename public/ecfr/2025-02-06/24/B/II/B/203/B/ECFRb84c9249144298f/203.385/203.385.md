The following types of title evidence shall be satisfactory to the Commissioner: 


(a) *Fee or owner's title policy.* A fee or owner's policy of title insurance, a guaranty or guarantee of title, or a certificate of title, issued by a title company, duly authorized by law and qualified by experience to issue such instruments. If an owner's policy of title insurance is furnished, it shall show title in the Commissioner and inure to the benefit of his successors in office. 


(b) *Mortgagee's policy of title insurance.* A mortgagee's policy of title insurance supplemented by an Abstract and an Attorney's Certificate of Title covering the period subsequent to the date of the mortgage, the terms of the policy shall be such that the liability of the title company will continue in favor of the Commissioner after title is conveyed to him. The policy may be drawn in favor of the mortgagee and the Federal Housing Commissioner, “as their interests may appear”, with the consent of the title company endorsed thereon; 


(c) *Abstract and legal opinion.* An abstract of title prepared by an abstract company or individual engaged in the business of preparing abstracts of title and accompanied by the legal opinion as to the quality of such title signed by an attorney at law experienced in examination of titles. If title evidence consists of an Abstract and an Attorney's Certificate of Title, the search shall extend for at least forty years prior to the date of the Certificate to a well recognized source of good title; 


(d) *Torrens of similar certificate.* A Torrens or similar title certificate; or 


(e) *Title standard of U.S. or State government.* Evidence of title conforming to the standards of a supervising branch of the Government of the United States or of any State or Territory thereof.
