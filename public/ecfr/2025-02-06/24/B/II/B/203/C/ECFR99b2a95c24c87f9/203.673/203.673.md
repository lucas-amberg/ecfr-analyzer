(v) Adequate sanitary facilities and a safe method of sewage disposal. 


(2) The property shall be structurally sound, reasonably durable, and free from hazards that may adversely affect the health and safety of the occupants or may impair the customary use and enjoyment by the occupants. Unacceptable hazards include, but are not limited to, subsidence, erosion, flood, exposure to the elements, exposed or unsafe electrical wiring, or an accumulation of minor hazards, such as broken stairs.
