(v) All interest through the remainder of the payment term. The expected average mortgage interest rate shall be used for this purpose.


(2) The mortgagee shall make all monthly disbursements through the payment term even if the outstanding loan balance exceeds the principal limit because the actual average mortgage interest rate exceeds the expected average mortgage interest rate unless the HECM becomes due and payable under § 206.27(c). In the event of a deferral of due and payable status in accordance with § 206.27(c)(3), disbursements shall cease immediately upon the death of the borrower and no further disbursements are permissible.


(3) Mortgagees shall ensure that term monthly disbursements made to the borrower during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period do not exceed the Initial Disbursement Limit. If the sum of disbursements made during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period would exceed the Initial Disbursement Limit for that time period, the mortgagee shall decrease the monthly disbursements during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period to conform with the Initial Disbursement Limit; upon conclusion of the First 12-Month Disbursement Period, the borrower may request a payment plan recalculation.


(4) If the borrower makes a partial prepayment of the outstanding loan balance during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period, the mortgagee shall apply the funds from the partial prepayment in accordance with the Note.


(5) If the mortgagee receives repayment from insurance or condemnation proceeds after restoration or repair of the damaged property, the available principal limit and outstanding loan balance shall be reduced by the amount of such payments.


(f) *Monthly disbursements—tenure option.* (1) Monthly disbursements under the tenure payment option shall be calculated as if the number of months in the payment term equals 100 minus the lesser of the age of the youngest borrower or 95, multiplied by 12, but payments shall continue until the mortgage becomes due and payable under § 206.27(c), except that in the event that payments would exceed any maximum mortgage amount stated in the security instrument or would otherwise exceed the amount secured by the first lien, in accordance with § 206.19(h) payments will cease immediately; payments may be reinstated only in the event a new Note and mortgage are executed in accordance with § 206.27(b)(10); and in the event of a deferral of due and payable status in accordance with § 206.27(c)(3) payments will cease immediately upon the death of the borrower.


(2) Mortgagees shall ensure that tenure monthly disbursements made to the borrower during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period do not exceed the Initial Disbursement Limit. If the sum of disbursements made during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period would exceed the Initial Disbursement Limit for that time period, the mortgagee shall decrease the monthly disbursements during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period to conform with the maximum Initial Disbursement Limit; upon conclusion of the First 12-Month Disbursement Period, the borrower may request a payment plan recalculation.


(3) If the borrower makes a partial prepayment of the outstanding loan balance during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period, the mortgagee shall apply the funds from the partial prepayment in accordance with the Note.


(4) If the mortgagee receives repayment from insurance or condemnation proceeds after restoration or repair of the damaged property, the available principal limit and outstanding loan balance shall be reduced by the amount of such payments.


(g) *Line of credit separately or with monthly disbursements.* If the borrower has a line of credit, separately or combined with the term or tenure payment option, the principal limit is divided into an amount set aside for servicing charges under § 206.19(f)(3), an amount equal to the line of credit (including any portion of the principal limit set aside for repairs or property charges under § 206.19(f)(1) or (2)), and the remaining amount of the principal limit (if any). The line of credit amount increases at the same rate as the total principal limit increases under § 206.3. The sum of disbursements made during the First 12-Month Disbursement Period shall not exceed the Initial Disbursement Limit. If a requested disbursement would exceed the Initial Disbursement Limit, the mortgagee may make a partial disbursement to the borrower for the amount that will not exceed the limit. Upon the conclusion of the First 12-Month Disbursement Period, the borrower may request subsequent disbursements up to the available principal limit.


(h) *Single Lump Sum payment option.* (1) Under the Single Lump Sum payment option, the Borrower's Advance shall be made by the mortgagee to the borrower in an amount that does not exceed the maximum allowable Borrower's Advance under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.


(2) If the borrower makes a partial prepayment of the outstanding loan balance any time after loan closing and before the contract of insurance is terminated, the mortgagee shall apply the funds from the partial prepayment in accordance with the Note.


(i) *Payment of MIP and interest.* At the end of each month, including the first month, interest accrued during that month shall be added to the outstanding loan balance. Where the first month is a partial month, a prorated amount of interest shall be added. Monthly MIP, which will accrue from the closing date, shall be added to the outstanding loan balance beginning with the first day of the second month after closing when paid to the Commissioner.


(j) *Mortgagee late charge.* The mortgagee shall pay a late charge to the borrower for any late disbursement. If the mortgagee does not mail or electronically transfer a scheduled monthly disbursement to the borrower on the first business day of the month or make a line of credit disbursement within 5 business days of the date the mortgagee received the request, the late charge shall be 10 percent of the entire amount that should have been paid to the borrower for that month or as a result of that request. In no event shall the total late charge exceed five hundred dollars. For each additional day that the borrower does not receive payment, the mortgagee shall pay interest at the mortgage interest rate on the late payment. Any late charge and interest shall be paid from the mortgagee's funds and shall not be added to the outstanding loan balance.


(k) *No minimum payments.* A mortgagee shall not require, as a condition of providing a loan secured by a mortgage insured under this part, that the monthly payments under the term or tenure payment option or draws under the line of credit payment option exceed a minimum amount established by the mortgagee.
