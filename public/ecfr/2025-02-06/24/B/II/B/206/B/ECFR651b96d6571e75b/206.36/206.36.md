# ยง 206.36   Seasoning requirements for existing non-HECM liens.

(a) The Commissioner may establish, through notice, seasoning requirements for existing non-HECM liens. Such seasoning requirements shall not prohibit the payoff of existing non-HECM liens using HECM proceeds if the liens have been in place for longer than 12 months prior to the HECM closing or if the liens have resulted in cash to the borrower in an amount of $500 or less, whether at closing or through cumulative draws prior to the date of the HECM closing.


(b) Mortgagees must provide documentation satisfactory to the Commissioner as established by notice that the seasoning requirement was met.


(c) *Home Equity Lines of Credit.* The borrower may pay off, at closing, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) that does not meet seasoning requirements from borrower funds, the HECM funds, or a combination of HECM funds and borrower funds, as long as the draw from HECM funds does not exceed the percentage approved by the Commissioner under the authority of ยง 206.25(a).
