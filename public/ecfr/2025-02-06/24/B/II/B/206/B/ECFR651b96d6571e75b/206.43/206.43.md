# § 206.43   Information to borrower.

(a) *Disclosure of costs of obtaining mortgage.* The mortgagee shall ensure that the borrower has received full disclosure of all costs of obtaining the mortgage. The mortgagee shall ask the borrower about any costs or other obligations that the borrower has incurred to obtain the mortgage, as defined by the Commissioner, in addition to providing any disclosures required by law. The mortgagee shall clearly state to the borrower which charges are required to obtain the mortgage and which are not required to obtain the mortgage.


(b) *Lump sum disbursement.* (1) If the borrower requests that at least 25 percent of the principal limit amount (after deducting amounts excluded in the following sentence) be disbursed at closing to the borrower (or as otherwise permitted by § 206.25), the mortgagee must make sufficient inquiry at closing to confirm that the borrower will not use any part of the amount disbursed for payments to or on behalf of an estate planning service firm, with an explanation of § 206.32 as necessary or appropriate.


(2) This paragraph does not apply to any part of the principal limit used for the following:


(i) Initial MIP under § 206.105(a) or fees and charges allowed under § 206.31(a) paid by the mortgagee from mortgage proceeds instead of by the borrower in cash; and


(ii) Amounts set aside in accordance with § 206.19(f) for repairs under § 206.47, for property charges under § 206.205, or for servicing charges under § 206.207(b).
