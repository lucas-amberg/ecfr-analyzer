# ยง 206.142   Adjustment for damage or neglect.

(a) Except as provided for in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section: if the property has been damaged by fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, or tornado, the damage must be repaired before assignment of the mortgage to the Commissioner; if the property has suffered damage because of the mortgagee's failure to take action as required by ยง 206.140, the damage must be repaired before the mortgagee sells the property.


(1) If the prior approval of the Commissioner is obtained, there will be deducted from the insurance benefits the Commissioner's estimate of the cost of repairing the damage or any insurance recovery received by the mortgagee, whichever is greater.


(2) If the property has been damaged by fire and was not covered by fire insurance at the time of the damage, or the amount of insurance coverage was inadequate to repair fully the damage, only the amount of insurance recovery received by the mortgagee, if any, will be deducted from the insurance benefits, provided the mortgagee certifies, at the time that a claim is filed for insurance benefits, that:


(i) At the time the mortgage was insured, the property was covered by fire insurance in an amount at least equal to the lesser of 100 percent of the insurable value of the improvements, or the principal loan balance of the mortgage;


(ii) The insurer later cancelled this coverage or refused to renew it for reasons other than nonpayment of premium;


(iii) The mortgagee made diligent though unsuccessful efforts within 30 days of any cancellation or non-renewal of hazard insurance, and at least annually thereafter, to secure other coverage or coverage under a FAIR Plan, in an amount described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, or if coverage to such an extent was unavailable at a reasonable rate, the greatest extent of coverage that was available at a reasonable rate;


(iv) The extent of coverage obtained by the mortgagee in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section was the greatest available at a reasonable rate, or if the mortgagee was unable to obtain insurance, none was available at a reasonable rate; and


(v) The mortgagee took the actions required by ยง 206.140.


(b) If the property has been damaged during the time of the mortgagee's possession by events other than fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, or tornado, or if it was damaged notwithstanding reasonable action by the mortgagee as required by ยง 206.140, the mortgagee must provide notice of such damage to the Commissioner and may not sell the property until directed to do so by the Commissioner. The Commissioner will either:


(1) Allow the mortgagee to sell the property damaged; or


(2) Require the mortgagee to repair the damage before sale, and the Commissioner will reimburse the mortgagee for reasonable payments not in excess of the Commissioner's estimate of the cost of repair, less any insurance recovery.
