The claim shall not include accrued interest whether or not it has been included in the loan balance.


(f) *Amount of payment-borrower sells the property.* This paragraph describes the amount of payment if the property is sold in accordance with § 206.125(c) to one other than the mortgagee for less than the outstanding loan balance, and the mortgagee releases the mortgage to facilitate the sale.
