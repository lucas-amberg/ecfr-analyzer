# § 207.261   Capturing excess bond proceeds.

(a) A mortgagee that finances multifamily housing or healthcare facilities insured under Title II of the National Housing Act through the issuance and sale of bonds or bond anticipation notes and uses a project-specific trust indenture agreement, that clearly outlines the project and identifies by project the trust funds established by and administered in accordance with the terms of the trust indenture, shall:


(1) Include the following clause in the trust indenture: In the event of an assignment or conveyance of the mortgage to the Commissioner, subsequent to the issuance of the bonds, all money remaining in all funds and accounts other than the rebate fund, and any other funds remaining under the trust indenture after payment or provision for payment of debt service on the bonds and the fees and expenses of the credit enhancer, issuer, trustee, and other such parties unrelated to the mortgagor (other than funds originally deposited by the mortgagor or related parties on or before the date of issuance of the bonds) shall be returned to the mortgagee.


(2) Upon the Commissioner's payment of an FHA mortgage insurance claim under § 207.259, the mortgagee shall take all legally-entitled actions to enforce the clause required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section and pay the Commissioner any trust funds remaining after discharge by the trustee of all obligations of the trust indenture, no later than 6 months after the date of the Commissioner's final settlement of the FHA mortgage insurance claim.


(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the term “rebate fund” means a separate fund established under a contract or agreement for tax-exempt bonds in which amounts (excess interest earnings from the tax-exempt bonds) must be deposited to make rebate payments to the federal government under the Internal Revenue Code.
