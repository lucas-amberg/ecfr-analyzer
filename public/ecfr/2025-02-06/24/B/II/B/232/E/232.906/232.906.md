# § 232.906   Processing of applications and required fees.

(a) *Processing of applications.* The local HUD Office will determine whether participation in a preapplication conference is required as a condition to submission of an initial application for either a conditional or firm commitment. After the preapplication conference an application for a conditional or firm commitment for insurance of a mortgage on a project shall be submitted by the sponsor and an approved mortgagee. Such application shall be submitted to the local HUD Office on a HUD approved form. An application may, at the option of the applicant, be submitted for a firm commitment omitting the conditional commitment stage. No application shall be considered unless accompanied by all exhibits required by the form and program handbooks. An application may be made for a commitment which provides for the insurance of the mortgage upon completion of any improvements or for a commitment which provides, in accordance with standards established by the Commissioner, for the completing of specified repairs and improvements after endorsement. 


(b) *Application fee—conditional commitment.* An application-commitment fee of $3 per thousand dollars of the requested mortgage amount shall accompany an application for conditional commitment. 


(c) *Application fee—firm commitment.* An application for firm commitment shall be accompanied by an application-commitment fee of $5 per thousand dollars of the requested mortgage amount to be insured less any amount previously received for a conditional commitment. 


(d) *Inspection fee.* Where an application provides for the completion of repairs, replacements and/or improvements (repairs), the Commissioner will charge an inspection fee equal to one percent (1%) of the cost of the repairs. However, where the Commissioner determines the cost of repairs is minimal, the Commissioner may establish a minimum inspection fee that exceeds one percent of the cost of repairs and can periodically increase or decrease this minimum fee. 


(e) *Cross-reference.* The provisions of paragraphs (f)(1) (Fee on increases), (g) (Reopening of expired commitments), (h) (Transfer fee), (i) (Refund of fees), and (j) (Fees not required) of § 200.40 of this chapter apply to applications submitted under subpart E of this part.
