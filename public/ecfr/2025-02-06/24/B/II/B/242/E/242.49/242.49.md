# ยง 242.49   Funds and finances: deposits and letters of credit.

(a) *Deposits.* Where HUD requires the mortgagor to make a deposit of cash or securities, such deposit shall be with the mortgagee or a depository acceptable to the mortgagee and HUD. Any such deposit shall be held in a separate account for and on behalf of the mortgagor, and shall be the responsibility of that mortgagee or depository.


(b) *Letter of credit.* Where the use of a letter of credit is acceptable to HUD in lieu of a deposit of cash or securities, the letter of credit shall be issued to the mortgagee by a banking institution acceptable to the lender. The mortgagee shall be responsible to HUD for collection under the letter of credit. In the event a demand for payment thereunder is not immediately met, the mortgagee shall forthwith provide a cash deposit equivalent to the undrawn balance of the letter of credit.


(c) *Mortgagee not issuer.* The mortgagee of record may not be the issuer of the letter of credit without the prior written consent of HUD.
