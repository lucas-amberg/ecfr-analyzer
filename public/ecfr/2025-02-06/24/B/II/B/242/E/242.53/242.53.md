(a) Contracts relating to the construction of the project shall not be made with any person or entity that has been excluded from participation in federal programs, including but not limited to: A general contractor, a subcontractor, or construction manager (or any firm, corporation, partnership, or association in which such contractor, subcontractor, or construction manager has a substantial interest). Before entering into contracts with any such person or entity, owners must consult the government-wide list of excluded parties, and any list of excluded parties maintained by HUD.


(b) Contracts relating to the construction of the project shall not be made with a general contractor that has an identity of interest, as defined by HUD, with the mortgagor or mortgagee.


(c) If HUD determines that a contract has been made contrary to the requirements of paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section and so notifies the mortgagee, HUD will require the contractor or construction manager to cost-certify and may require other remedial action in addition to taking enforcement action, as HUD deems appropriate.
