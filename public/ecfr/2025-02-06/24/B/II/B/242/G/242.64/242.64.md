All equipment acquired by the hospital following initial endorsement and at any time during the term of the loan shall become subject to the lien of the security agreement and any Uniform Commercial Code Financing Statements filed pursuant to the security agreement, unless the mortgagor specifically requests and HUD, for good cause, approves subordination of the lien of the insured mortgagee on specific personalty for specific periods of time.
