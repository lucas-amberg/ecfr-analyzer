(a) The local HUD office will review the information submitted by the mortgagor together with the decision of the board, if any. The local HUD office will, if it finds that the delay or decision of the board fails to provide adequate residential income to protect the Department's economic interest in the projects and the board will not modify its position to the satisfaction of the local HUD office, make a report with appropriate recommendations concerning the actions that should be taken by HUD to the Office of Multifamily Housing Management and Occupancy, Headquarters. The report shall be sent to the Office of Multifamily Housing Management and Occupancy, Headquarters, and shall include appropriate recommendations concerning the action that should be taken by HUD. 


(b) The Office of Multifamily Housing Management and Occupancy will review the report and will consider whether to preempt the board's regulation. If it finds that the income level permitted by the board is inadequate to maintain the project as described in ยง 246.5, it shall issue a formal certification to the board that its authority has been preempted as to such rents. Copies of the certification shall be transmitted to the mortgagor, the local HUD office, and the board.
