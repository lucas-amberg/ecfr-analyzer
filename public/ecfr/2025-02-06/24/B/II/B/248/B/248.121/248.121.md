# § 248.121   Annual authorized return and aggregate preservation rents.

(a) *Annual authorized return.* For each eligible low income housing project appraised under § 248.111, the Commissioner shall set an annual authorized return on the project equal to 8 percent of the extension preservation equity. 


(b) *Aggregate preservation rents.* For each eligible low income housing project appraised under § 248.111, the Commissioner shall also determine the aggregate preservation rents. The aggregate preservation rents shall be used solely for the purposes of comparison with the Federal cost limit under § 248.123. Actual rents received by the owner (or a qualified purchaser) shall be determined pursuant to §§ 248.153, 248.157, and 248.161. 


(c) *Extension preservation rent.* The extension preservation rent shall be the gross potential income for the project, as determined by the Commissioner, that would be required to support—


(1) The annual authorized return determined under paragraph (a) of this section; 


(2) Debt service on any rehabilitation loan for the project, assuming a market rate of interest and customary terms; 


(3) Debt service on the federally-assisted mortgage(s) for the project; 


(4) Project operating expenses as determined by the Commissioner; and 


(5) Adequate reserves. 


(d) *Transfer preservation rent.* The transfer preservation rent shall be the gross potential income for the project, as determined by the Commissioner, that would be required to support—


(1) Debt service on the loan for acquisition of the project; 


(2) Debt service on any rehabilitation loan for the project, assuming a market rate of interest and customary terms;


(3) Debt service on the federally-assisted mortgage(s) for the project; 


(4) Project operating expenses as determined by the Commissioner; and 


(5) Adequate reserves. 


(e) *Adequate reserves and operating expenses.* For purposes of this section—


(1) Adequate reserves are the amount of funds which, when added to existing reserves, are sufficient to maintain the project, including needed deferred maintenance, at a level that meets the standards set forth in § 248.147; and 


(2) Project operating expenses shall be based on operating expenses for the preceding 3 years, adjusted for reasonable reductions in operating costs due to rehabilitation and energy improvements. For purposes of comparison to the gross rents used in determining the Federal cost limit, project operating expenses shall include the cost of utilities paid by the residents. 


(f) *Debt service.* For purposes of this section, the amount of debt service for an acquisition loan will be estimated based on the maximum loan to which the purchaser is entitled under § 241.1067 of this chapter. The debt service on any rehabilitation loan will be estimated using costs derived from the appraisals conducted under § 248.111, taking into account any funds provided for rehabilitation by State or local governments and assuming market rate interest rates.
