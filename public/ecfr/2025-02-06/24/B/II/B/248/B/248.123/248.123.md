# ยง 248.123   Determination of Federal cost limit.

(a) *Initial determination.* For each eligible low income housing project appraised under ยง 248.111, the Commissioner shall determine whether the aggregate preservation rents for the project exceed the amount determined by multiplying the number of dwelling units in the project, according to appropriate unit sizes, by 120 percent of the section 8 existing fair market rent for the appropriate unit sizes. 


(b) *Relevant local markets.* If either the extension or transfer preservation rent for a project exceeds the amount determined under paragraph (a) of this section, the Commissioner shall determine whether such extension or transfer preservation rent exceeds the amount determined by multiplying the number of units in the project, according to the appropriate unit sizes, by 120 percent of the prevailing rents in the local market area. The relevant local market, and the prevailing rents in such relevant local market, shall be determined on the basis of the appraisal conducted by the appraiser selected by the Commissioner pursuant to ยง 248.111 and any other information that the Commissioner determines is appropriate. If there are no comparables in the relevant local market and it is not otherwise possible to determine prevailing rents in that area, the section 8 existing fair market rent shall be the sole measure for determining the Federal cost limit. 


(c) *Effect.* The extension or transfer preservation rent for an eligible low income housing project appraised under ยง 248.111 shall be considered to exceed the Federal cost limit only if the extension or transfer preservation rent exceeds the amount determined under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
