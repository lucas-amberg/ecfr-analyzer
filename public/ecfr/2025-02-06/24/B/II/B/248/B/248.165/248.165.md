# § 248.165   Assistance for displaced tenants.

(a) *Section 8 assistance.* Each low income family that is displaced as a result of the prepayment of the mortgage, or voluntary termination of an insurance contract, on eligible low income housing shall, subject to the availability of funds, be offered the opportunity to receive tenant-based assistance under the Housing Choice Voucher Program in accordance with part 982 of this title.


(b) *Notification of Commissioner.* The owner of any eligible low income housing project who prepays the mortgage or voluntarily terminates the mortgage insurance contract pursuant to subpart B of this part, shall notify the Commissioner of: 


(1) The names and addresses of all of the tenants in the project who will be displaced; 


(2) The size of the unit in which each of the displaced tenants is currently dwelling; and 


(3) The names of all of the displaced tenants who are special needs tenants, as that term is defined in § 248.101, as well as a statement as to the nature of their special need. 


The owner shall provide the Commissioner with this information within 30 days of identifying such tenants for displacement, but in no event less than 30 days prior to the date when the tenants must vacate the premises. 


(c) *Relocation of displaced tenants.* The Commissioner shall coordinate with public housing agencies to ensure that any very low or low income family displaced from eligible low income housing as the result of prepayment of the mortgage or termination of the mortgage insurance contract on such project is able to acquire a suitable, affordable dwelling unit in the area where the project from which the displaced family is located. The Commissioner, upon receiving information from the owner under paragraph (b) of this section stating that certain tenants will be displaced, shall request from the public housing agencies located in the same area as the affected project, notices of vacancies in other affordable projects which would be suitable for the displaced tenants. The Commissioner shall convey the notices of vacancies to the tenants who will be displaced along with the addresses of the local public housing agencies. 


(d) *Relocation expenses.* The Commissioner shall require the owner of eligible low income housing who prepays or terminates the insurance contract resulting in the displacement of tenants to pay 50 percent of the relocation expenses of each family which is relocated, except that the Commissioner shall increase such percentage to the extent that State or local law of general applicability requires a higher payment by the owner. 


(e) *Continued occupancy.* Each owner who prepays the mortgage or terminates the mortgage insurance contract on eligible low income housing shall, as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, allow the tenants occupying units in such project on the date of submission of a notice of intent under § 248.105 to remain in the project for a period of three years, commencing on the date of prepayment or contract termination, at rent levels existing at the time of prepayment or termination, except for rent increases made necessary due to increased operating costs. 


(f) *Replacement unit.* In any case in which the Commissioner requires an owner to allow tenants to occupy units under paragraph (e) of this section, an owner may fulfill the requirements of such paragraph by providing such assistance necessary for the tenant to rent a decent, safe, and sanitary unit in another project for the same 3-year period and at a rental cost to the tenant not in excess of the rental amount the tenant would have been required to pay to the owner in the owner's project, except that the tenant must freely agree to waive the right to occupy the unit in the owner's project. The provisions of paragraph (d) of this section requiring an owner who prepays or terminates an insurance contract to pay a portion of the relocation expenses incurred by displaced tenants shall also be applicable to tenants who relocate pursuant to this paragraph. 


(g) *Applicability.* The provisions of paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section shall apply only to: 


(1) All tenants in eligible low income housing projects located in a low-vacancy area; and 


(2) Special needs tenants. 


(h) *Low Vacancy Areas.* The Commissioner shall notify the owner, within 30 days of the owner's request to prepay under § 248.169, whether the project is located in a low vacancy area for purposes of paragraph (g) of this section. 


(i) *Required acceptance of section 8 assistance.* Any owner who prepays the mortgage or terminates the mortgage insurance contract on eligible low income housing and maintains the project for residential rental occupancy may not refuse to rent, refuse to negotiate for the rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny the rental of a dwelling unit in such project to any person, or discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges or rental of a unit, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because the person receives tenant-based assistance under the Housing Choice Voucher Program. 


(j) *Regional pools.* In providing assistance under this section, the Commissioner shall allocate the assistance on a regional basis through the regional offices of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Commissioner shall allocate assistance under this section in a manner so that the total number of assisted units in each such region available for occupancy by, and affordable to, low income families and persons does not decrease because of the prepayment of a mortgage on eligible low income housing or the termination of an insurance contract on such project.


(k) This section shall only apply to prepayments and terminations occurring pursuant to §§ 248.157(l) and 248.169.
