# § 248.211   Notice of intent to prepay.

(a) An owner of eligible low-income housing seeking to prepay its mortgage or to negotiate changes in the terms of the mortgage or regulatory agreement in accordance with this part, including termination of the insurance contract pursuant to section 229 of the National Housing Act, shall file a notice of intent with the HUD field office in whose jurisdiction the project is located, and shall file a duplicate copy with the HUD Headquarters Office of Multifamily Housing Management, 451-7th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. The notice of intent shall identify the project by name, project number and location, briefly describe the owner's plans for the project, including any timetables or deadlines for actions to be taken, and the reason the owner seeks to prepay the mortgage or change the terms of the mortgage or regulatory agreement, and briefly describe any contacts that the owner has made or is making with other governmental agencies or other interested parties in connection with the notice of intent. 


(b) An owner simultaneously shall file the notice of intent with: 


(1) The chief executive officer of the appropriate State or local government in which the project is located, or any officer designated by executive order or State or local law to receive such information; 


(2) Each tenant in the project; and 


(3) The mortgagee.


(c) Upon receipt of a notice of intent, the Commissioner will provide the owner with information that the owner needs to prepare a plan of action. This information shall include information regarding the Commissioner's standards under § 248.221 of this part regarding the approval of a plan of action involving termination of low income affordability restrictions, and any relevant market area and demographic information that the Secretary has custody of and that the owner may use in preparing the plan of action; in addition, it shall include at a minimum a list of the Federal incentives authorized under § 248.231 of this part for those projects for which a plan of action involving termination of low income affordability restrictions would not be approvable. 


(d) Filing a notice of intent with the Commissioner will lead to one of the following results: 


(1) Where the project meets the requirements of § 248.221 of this part— 


(i) The Commissioner will approve the prepayment or the termination of mortgage insurance pursuant to § 248.221 of this part, and all low income affordability restrictions will be terminated with respect to some or all of the units; however, the owner would be responsible for ensuring that displaced current tenants are relocated to affordable housing, if necessary. 


(ii) The Commissioner will approve the prepayment or termination of mortgage insurance pursuant to § 248.221 of this part, and all low income affordability restrictions will be terminated, except (where necessary because the project is located in a housing market where there is insufficient comparable, decent, safe and sanitary affordable housing to meet the needs of all current tenants) with regard to protection of current very low income, low income and moderate income tenants; 


(2) Where the plan of action would not be approvable under § 248.221 of this part— 


(i) The Commissioner will approve prepayment or the termination of mortgage insurance, but the owner will receive assistance under a State, local or other Federal government housing program, and will receive incentives pursuant to § 248.231 of this part from the Federal government in return for agreeing to conditions related to the continued use of the project as low income housing in accordance with § 248.233 of this part. 


(ii) The Commissioner will not approve prepayment or the termination of mortgage insurance, but will provide incentives to the owner pursuant to § 248.231 of this part in accordance with a plan of action meeting the standards of § 248.233 of this part;


(iii) The Commissioner will not approve prepayment or the termination of mortgage insurance, but, after failing to reach agreement on a negotiated plan of action, the owner and the Commissioner will agree to a package of incentives and restrictions prescribed by § 248.241 of this part; or


(iv) The Commissioner will not approve prepayment or the termination of mortgage insurance, and will not offer incentives of any kind.
