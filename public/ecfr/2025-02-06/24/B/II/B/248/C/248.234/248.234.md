(a) When providing rental assistance under section 8, the Commissioner may enter into a contract with an owner, contingent upon the future availability of appropriations for the purpose of renewing expiring contracts for rental assistance as provided in appropriations Acts, to extend the term of such rental assistance for such additional period or periods as is necessary to carry out an approved plan of action. 


(b) The contract and the approved plan of action shall provide that, if the Commissioner is unable to develop a revised package of incentives providing benefits to the owner comparable to those received under the original approved plan of action, the Commissioner, upon the request of the owner, shall take the following actions (subject to the limitations under the following paragraphs): 


(1) Modification of the binding commitments made pursuant to ยง 248.233(d) that are dependent on such rental assistance. 


(2) If action under paragraph (b)(1) is not feasible, release of an owner from the binding commitments made pursuant to ยง 248.233(d) that are dependent on such rental assistance. 


(3) If actions under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) would, in the determination of the Commissioner, result in the default of the insured loan, approval of the revised plan of action, notwithstanding ยง 248.221, that involves the termination of low-income affordability restrictions. 


(c) The approved plan of action shall specify actions that the Commissioner and the owner shall take to ensure that any tenants displaced as a result of actions taken under paragraph (b) of this section are relocated to affordable housing. 


(d) At least 30 days prior to making a request under the preceding sentence, an owner shall notify the Commissioner of the owner's intention to submit the request. The Commissioner shall have a period of 90 days following receipt of such notice to take action to extend the rental assistance contract and to continue the binding commitments under paragraph (b).
