# § 266.1   Purpose and scope.

(a) *Authority and scope.* (1) Section 542 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (12 U.S.C. 1715z-22), directs the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), acting through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), to carry out programs that will provide new forms of Federal credit enhancement for multifamily loans. Section 542, entitled, “Multifamily Mortgage Credit Programs,” provides insurance authority independent from that provided by the National Housing Act.


(2) Section 542(c) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 specifically directs HUD to carry out a program of risk-sharing with qualified State and local housing finance agencies (HFAs). The qualified HFAs are authorized to underwrite and process loans. HUD provides full mortgage insurance on affordable multifamily housing projects processed by such HFAs under this program. Through risk-sharing agreements with HUD, HFAs contract to reimburse HUD for a portion of the loss from any defaults that occur while HUD insurance is in force.


(3) The extent to which HUD directs qualified HFAs regarding their underwriting standards, loan terms and conditions, and asset management and servicing procedures is related to the proportion of the risk taken by an HFA.


(b) *Purpose.* The primary purpose of this program is to provide credit enhancement for multifamily loans, *i.e.,* utilization of full insurance by HUD, pursuant to risk-sharing agreements with qualified housing finance agencies, for the development of affordable housing. The utilization of Federal credit enhancements increases access to capital markets and, thereby, increases the supply of affordable multifamily housing. By permitting HFAs to underwrite, process, and service loans and to manage and dispose of properties that fall into default, affordable housing is made available to eligible families and individuals in a timely manner.
