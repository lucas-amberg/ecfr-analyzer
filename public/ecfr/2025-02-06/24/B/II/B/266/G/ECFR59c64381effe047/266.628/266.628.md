(a) *Determination of initial claim amount.* (1) The initial claim amount is based on the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage note as of the date of default, plus interest at the mortgage note rate from date of default to date of initial claim payment. The mortgage note interest component of the initial claim amount is subject to curtailment as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. 


(2) HUD shall make an initial claim payment to the HFA that is equal to the initial claim amount, less any delinquent mortgage insurance premiums, late charges and interest, assessed under ยง 266.604(d). 


(3) The HFA must use the proceeds of the initial claim payment to retire any bonds or any other financing mechanisms securing the mortgage within 30 calendar days of the initial claim payment. Any excess funds resulting from such retirement or repayment shall be returned to HUD within 30 calendar days of the retirement. 


(b) *Curtailment of interest for late filings.* In determining the mortgage note interest component of the initial claim amount, if the HFA fails to meet any of the requirements of this section within the specified time (including any granted extension of time), HUD shall curtail the accrual of mortgage note interest by the number of days by which the required action was late. 


(c) *Method of payment.* HUD shall pay the claim in cash.
