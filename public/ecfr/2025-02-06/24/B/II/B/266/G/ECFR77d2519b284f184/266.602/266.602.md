(a) *Initial premium.* For projects involving insured advances, on the date of the initial closing, the HFA shall pay to the Commissioner an initial premium equal to an amount established by the Commissioner under § 266.604.


(b) *Interim premium.* On each anniversary of the initial closing, the HFA shall pay an interim mortgage insurance premium in an amount established by the Commissioner under § 266.604. The HFA shall continue to pay the interim mortgage insurance premiums until the date of the first principal payment.


(c) *Premium payable with first payment of principal.* On the date of the first principal payment, the HFA shall pay a mortgage insurance premium in an amount established by the Commissioner under § 266.604.

The HFA shall remit the net adjusted mortgage premium to the Commissioner and refund the amount of the adjustment (overpayment) to the mortgagor.


(d) *Subsequent premiums.* Until one of the conditions is met under § 266.606(a), the HFA on each anniversary of the date of the first principal payment shall pay to the Commissioner an annual mortgage insurance premium in an amount established by the Commissioner under § 266.604, without taking into account delinquent payments, prepayments, or a partial claim payment under § 266.630, for the year following the date on which the premium becomes payable.
