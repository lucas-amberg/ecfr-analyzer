# ยง 290.35   Sale of HUD-held mortgages securing unsubsidized projects.

HUD's policy for selling HUD-held mortgages securing unsubsidized projects is as follows: 


(a) *Current mortgages* may be sold with or without FHA mortgage insurance. 


(b) *Delinquent mortgages* may be sold without FHA mortgage insurance. However, delinquent mortgages will not be sold if: 


(1) HUD believes that foreclosure is unavoidable; and 


(2) The project securing the mortgage is occupied by very low-income tenants who are not receiving housing assistance and would be likely to pay rent in excess of 30 percent of their adjusted monthly income if HUD sold the mortgage.
