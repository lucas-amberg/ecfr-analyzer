# § 291.100   General policy on HUD acquisition, ownership, and disposition of real estate assets.

For all sales, except as otherwise specifically indicated, those sales conducted in accordance with §§ 291.90(a) and 291.200 or with subpart D of this part, the following general policies apply:


(a) *Qualified purchaser.* (1) Anyone, including a purchaser from a transferor of a property pursuant to §§ 291.90(a) and 291.200, regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status, age, or disability may offer to buy a HUD-owned property, except that:


(i) No member of or delegate to Congress is eligible to buy or benefit from a purchase of a HUD-owned property; and


(ii) No nonoccupant mortgagor (whether an original mortgagor, assumptor, or a person who purchased “subject to”) of an insured mortgage who has defaulted, thereby causing HUD to pay an insurance claim on the mortgage, is eligible to repurchase the same property.


(2) Neither HUD nor any transferor pursuant to §§ 291.90(a) or 291.200 will offer former mortgagors in occupancy who have defaulted on the mortgage the right of first refusal to repurchase the same property.


(3) HUD will offer tenants accepted under the occupied conveyance procedures outlined in 24 CFR 203.670 through 203.685 the right of first refusal to purchase the property only if:


(i) The tenant has a recognized ability to acquire financing and a good rent-paying history, and has made a request to HUD to be offered the right of first refusal; or


(ii) State or local law requires that tenants be offered the right of first refusal.


(b) *List price.* The list price, or “asking price,” assigned to the property is based upon one or more evaluation tools (e.g., appraisal, Broker Price Opinion, Automated Valuation Model). An appraisal, when used, must be conducted by an independent real estate appraiser who meets all of the requirements of 24 CFR part 200, subpart G, and is in good standing on the appraiser roster established under that section. The appraiser must provide an opinion of the “as-is” market value using a valuation method that is commonly employed in the industry and that is consistent with FHA appraisal requirements.


(c) *Insurance.* When listing properties, HUD may elect to include information to indicate whether the property is eligible for FHA-insured financing under section 203(B) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(b)).


(d) *Financing.* (1) Subject to underwriting requirements, REO properties that have not been identified as uninsurable in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section can be purchased and financed with a mortgage insured under section 203(b) or 203(k) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(b), 1709(k)), if supported by an FHA appraisal, in one of the following ways:


(i) *Insured.* A property that meets the Minimum Property Standards (MPS), as defined in HUD Handbook 4905.1 or any successor handbook, as determined by the Secretary, for existing dwellings will be offered for sale in “as-is” condition with FHA mortgage insurance available as provided in part 203 of this chapter.


(ii) *Insured with repair escrow.* (A) A property that requires no more than $10,000 for repairs to meet the MPS, as defined in HUD Handbook 4905.1 or any successor handbook, as determined by the Secretary, will be offered for sale in “as-is” condition with FHA mortgage insurance available, as provided in part 203 of this chapter, provided the mortgagor establishes a cash escrow to ensure the completion of the required repairs.


(B) *Changes in repair escrow.* HUD may adjust the escrow balance required under this paragraph based on changes to the Consumer Price Index by publishing a _Federal Register_ notice that provides for a public comment period of 30 calendar days for the purpose of accepting comments on the amount of the change. After comments have been considered, HUD will publish a final notice announcing the revised escrow amounts.


(iii) *Insured with rehabilitation loan* in accordance with section 203(k) of the National Housing Act and pursuant to § 203.50 of this chapter.


(2) REO properties that have been identified as uninsurable in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section can be purchased and financed with a mortgage insured under section 203(k) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(k)), subject to underwriting requirements supported by an FHA-specified appraisal and in accordance with 24 CFR 203.50.


(3) HUD, in its sole discretion and subject to appropriations, may take back Purchase Money Mortgages (PMMs) on property purchased by governmental entities or private nonprofit organizations who buy property for ultimate resale to owner-occupant purchasers with incomes at or below 115 percent of the area median income. When offered by HUD, a PMM will be available in an amount determined by the Secretary to be appropriate, at market rate interest, for a period not to exceed 5 years. Mortgagors must meet FHA mortgage credit standards.


(i) For purposes of this section, the term “purchase money mortgage,” or PMM means a note secured by a mortgage or trust deed given by a buyer, as mortgagor, to the seller, as mortgagee, as part of the purchase price of the real estate.


(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the purchaser is entirely responsible for obtaining financing for purchasing a property.


(e) *Environmental requirements and standards.* Sales under this part are subject to the environmental requirements and standards described in 24 CFR part 50, as applicable.


(f) [Reserved]


(g) *Lead-based paint poisoning prevention.* Properties constructed before 1978 are subject to the requirements of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821-4846), the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 4851-4856), and implementing regulations at part 35, subparts A, B, F, and R, of this title.


(h) Any real estate broker who has agreed to comply with HUD requirements may be eligible to participate in the sales program. Purchasers participating in the competitive sales program, except government entities and nonprofit organizations, must submit bids through a participating broker. In accordance with section 204(g) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1710(g)), HUD will prescribe the terms and conditions for all methods of listing properties. HUD may dispose of properties using any method that the Secretary deems appropriate, including, but not limited to the following:


(1) *Open listings.* Properties may be sold on an open listing basis with participating real estate brokers.


(2) *Asset management and listing contracts.* (i) HUD may invite firms experienced in property management to compete for contracts that provide for an exclusive right to manage and list specified properties in a given area.


(ii) In areas where a broker has an exclusive right to list properties, a purchaser may use a broker of his or her choice. The purchaser's broker must submit the bid through HUD's designated electronic bid system.


(i) *Disciplinary actions against HUD-qualified real estate brokers*—(1) *In general.* Real estate brokers that are involved in Real Estate Owned (REO) sales will be removed from HUD's qualified selling broker list and will be prohibited from using HUD systems to participate in the sale of HUD-owned single family properties for good cause in accordance with the procedures of this paragraph. Nothing in this section prohibits HUD from taking such other action against a broker as provided in 24 CFR part 24 or from seeking any other available remedy.


(2) *Good cause.* Good cause includes, but is not limited to:


(i) Conviction under 18 U.S.C. 371 or 1010 of a broker or an agent supervised by that broker and acting within the scope of the agent's duties;


(ii) Any of the following actions by a broker or an agent supervised by that broker and acting within the scope of the agent's duties:


(A) Falsifying loan documents or aiding or abetting persons in the use of false or misleading information including, but not limited to, forged or fraudulent gift letters and owner occupant certifications;


(B) Acting in concert with an appraiser to arrive at an artificial appraised value;


(C) Engaging in fraudulent activities (with or without the assistance of an appraiser) that have led to default and payment of an insurance claim;


(D) Failing to comply with earnest money collection, management, and disbursement procedures as set forth in this part;


(E) Failing to maintain a current state license;


(F) Violating the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) (12 U.S.C. 2601 *et seq.*);


(G) Non-compliance with civil rights requirements regarding the sale of HUD-owned single family properties;


(H) Involvement in, or knowledge of, any fraudulent activity by any person involved in the REO sales transaction; and


(I) Any other actions or omissions that evidence a lack of business integrity or non-compliance with the laws, regulations, and rules applicable to housing, lending, or real estate sales.


(3) *Written notice.* Once HUD makes an initial finding that there is good cause to remove a broker, HUD will provide the broker with written notice of proposed removal from HUD's qualified selling broker list and deactivation of the broker's access to HUD systems to participate in the sale of HUD-owned properties. The notice will:


(i) State the reasons that HUD is taking the action;


(ii) Identify the violations or deficiencies involved;


(iii) Provide a citation to the relevant regulation, statute, or policy; and


(iv) State the effective date and duration of the removal and deactivation.


(4) *Effective date and duration of removal.* (i) The effective date of the broker's removal will be the 30th day after the date of the notice, unless the broker submits a written response or requests a conference in accordance with paragraph (i)(5) of this section;


(ii) HUD's determination of the duration of removal and deactivation will be based upon HUD's consideration of the number and seriousness of the broker's violations and deficiencies.


(5) *Response and conference.* Real estate brokers will be given 20 days after the date of the notice (or longer, if provided in the notice) to submit a written response to HUD opposing the proposed removal and to request a conference. A request for a conference must be in writing and must be submitted along with the written response. If a conference is requested, it will occur within 15 days after the date of receipt of the request. HUD may extend the 15-day period by providing written notice to the broker. HUD may request additional information at or following a conference and provide additional time to submit such information. If the information is not submitted by the time set by HUD, the conference is completed. If the information is timely submitted, the conference is not completed until HUD has considered the additional information.


(6) *Disposition*—(i) *No response from real estate broker.* If the real estate broker does not submit a written response within the time provided, the removal and deactivation take effect in accordance with the notice.


(ii) *Response from real estate broker.* If the real estate broker submits a written response within the time provided, the removal and deactivation are delayed until HUD considers the response and makes a final determination. HUD will consider the sufficiency of any corrective actions taken by a broker with respect to its procedures and, if relevant, its agents, in reaching its decision. Within 20 days after the date of receipt of the written response, or if a conference is requested, within 20 days after the date of completion of the conference, HUD will advise the real estate broker in writing of the decision to rescind, modify, or affirm the removal from HUD's qualified selling broker list and the deactivation of the broker's access to HUD systems to participate in the sale of HUD-owned properties. The written decision by HUD shall constitute final agency action.


(7) *Effect of removal proceeding on bids.* All bids submitted and commissions earned by the real estate broker prior to removal will be honored, unless HUD determines they were made under fraudulent circumstances.
