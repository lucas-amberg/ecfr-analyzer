# ยง 291.400   Purpose and scope.

(a) *Purpose.* HUD seeks to assist individuals and families who are homeless by providing them with transitional housing and appropriate supportive services with the goal of helping them move to independent living. Therefore, HUD will make available, to applicants approved by HUD, certain HUD-acquired single family properties for use by the homeless.


(b) *Applicant preapproval.* Before a field office may notify an applicant of eligible properties, the applicant must be preapproved by HUD, according to procedures available from the field office.


(c) *Property available for lease with option to purchase.* HUD will make available up to 10 percent of its total inventory of properties, before or after they are listed for sale to the public.


(d) *Property available under a McKinney Act Supportive Housing program lease-option agreement.* Eligible properties will be available under a lease-option to purchase agreement to Supportive Housing program applicants for acquisition grants under 24 CFR part 583.


(e) *Properties available for sale.* Eligible properties will be available for competitive sale or direct sale for fair market value, less a discount determined appropriate by the Secretary but not less than 10 percent.


(f) *Concentration of properties.* To the extent practicable and possible, HUD will avoid excessive concentration in a single neighborhood of properties leased or sold under this subpart.


(g) *Failure to comply with requirements.* Failure to comply with this subpart, or a lease issued under this subpart, may result in termination from the program.
