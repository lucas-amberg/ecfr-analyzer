# § 291.405   Definitions.

For purposes of this subpart E:


*Applicant* means a State, metropolitan city, urban county, governmental entity, tribe, or private nonprofit organization that submits a written expression of interest in eligible properties under this subpart E. Governmental entities include those that have general governmental powers (e.g., a city or county), as well as those with limited or special powers (e.g., public housing agencies or State housing finance agencies). In the case of applicants leasing properties while their applications for Supportive Housing assistance are pending, “applicant” is defined in 24 CFR part 583.


*Homeless* means:


(1) Individuals or families who lack the resources to obtain housing, whose annual income is not in excess of 50 percent of the median income for the area, as determined by HUD, and who:


(i) Have a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings;


(ii) Have a primary nighttime residence that is a supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living accommodations (including welfare hotels, congregate shelters, and transitional housing, but excluding prisons or other detention facilities); or


(iii) Are at imminent risk of homelessness because they face immediate eviction and have been unable to identify a subsequent residence, which would result in emergency shelter placement (except that persons facing eviction on the basis of criminal conduct such as drug trafficking and violations of handgun prohibitions shall not be considered homeless for purposes of this definition); or


(2) Persons with disabilities who are about to be released from an institution and are at risk of imminent homelessness because no subsequent residences have been identified and because they lack the resources and support networks necessary to obtain access to housing.


*Lessee* means the applicant, approved by HUD as financially responsible, that executes a lease agreement with HUD for an eligible property.
