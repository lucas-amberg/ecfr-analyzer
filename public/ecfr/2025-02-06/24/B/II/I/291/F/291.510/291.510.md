# § 291.510   Overview of the GNND Sales Program.

(a) *General.* The GNND Sales Program enables a full-time law enforcement officer, teacher, or firefighter/emergency medical technician to purchase a specifically designated HUD-acquired home located in a HUD-designated revitalization area:


(1) At a 50 percent discount from the list price; and


(2) With a downpayment of $100, but only if the law enforcement officer, teacher, or firefighter/emergency medical technician finances the home through a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured mortgage.


(b) *Eligible properties.* Under the GNND Sales Program, single-unit properties acquired by HUD located in HUD-designated revitalization areas (except occupied properties, those located in Asset Control Areas, or those that HUD has determined will be sold through an alternative sales method) will be made available to interested law enforcement officers, teachers, and firefighters/emergency medical technicians prior to listing the properties for sale to other purchasers.


(c) *Multiple bids.* In the event that several bids are received on a single property, HUD will randomly select a winning offer by lottery and will also randomly select two backup bids, to be utilized in the order selected, in the event the winning purchaser is unable to close on the property. If both of the backup purchasers are also unable to close on the property, the property will then be made available for sale to purchasers through other sales methods.


(d) *Real estate brokers.* Law enforcement officers, teachers, and firefighters/emergency medical technicians must submit bids through a participating real estate broker. Any real estate broker who has agreed to comply with HUD requirements may participate in the GNND Sales Program. Real estate brokers may submit unlimited numbers of bids on an individual property provided each bid is from a different prospective purchaser.


(e) *Cap on sales.* The number of HUD-acquired homes sold under the GNND Sales Program in a fiscal year shall not exceed 5 percent of the number of “Part A” mortgage insurance conveyance claims paid by HUD in the prior fiscal year. The cap shall apply on a national basis, but HUD reserves the right to geographically apportion the cap to address regional or local differences in the number of homes sold through the GNND Sales Program. Additionally, HUD may adjust the percentage of the cap for any fiscal year. Any HUD determination to geographically distribute the cap, change a current geographic distribution, or adjust the percentage of the cap will be announced by HUD through publication of a notice in the _Federal Register_ at least 30 days before the revision takes effect.
