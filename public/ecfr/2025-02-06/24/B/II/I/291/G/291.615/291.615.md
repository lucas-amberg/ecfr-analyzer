# ยง 291.615   Purchaser servicing requirements.

(a) *Purchaser post-sale servicing.* The Purchaser and its servicer, and any subsequent transferee of or servicer for the Single Family Loan, must comply with the terms of the CAA and the Sale Notice post-sale loss mitigation and outcome requirements. Post-sale requirements will include a requirement that any Single Family Loan that converts to real estate owned property via foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure be offered for sale through a first look program, providing an exclusive listing period for owner occupant, nonprofit organization, governmental entities, and other prospective buyers as permitted by HUD. Post-sale requirements will also include requirements that Purchasers offer borrowers loss mitigation options that are as or more generous than the FHA loss mitigation options, a prohibition on reselling real estate owned property through a contract for deed or similar financing mechanism, a requirement that the Purchaser obtain prior approval from HUD before entering into a lease-purchase agreement with a prospective purchaser, and a prohibition on releasing liens on particular categories of properties, including vacant properties. Purchasers must take all lawful steps to service the Single Family Loans and collect amounts due in accordance with requirements as set forth by the CAA and all state and Federal law requirements, including applicable CFPB requirements.


(b) *Purchaser reporting requirements.* Purchasers must report on the post-sale servicing actions and outcomes obtained for each Single Family Loan purchased as prescribed by the CAA. HUD will publish reports for the public on loan and property outcomes and will include a breakdown of outcomes in different geographies. HUD will prescribe the reporting period as a specified period after settlement in the CAA.


(c) *Remedy for performance failures.* HUD may pursue appropriate remedies, including, but not limited to, the ability to deny future participation in loan sales, for a Purchaser's failure to comply with Single Family Sale requirements, including CAA obligations.
