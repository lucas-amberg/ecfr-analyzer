# ยง 330.60   Removal procedure.

(a) A participant may be suspended from participation in the Multiclass Securities program upon written notice from the Association, which shall include the reasons for the suspension. The participant shall have the opportunity to submit a written presentation to the President of the Association, or designee, in support of its reinstatement, subject to such limitations as the Association in its discretion may impose as to length, time for submission, or otherwise. A determination by the President of the Association, or designee, shall exhaust the participant's administrative remedies. 


(b) If a participant is suspended from the Multiclass Securities program, the Association shall have no obligation to complete a pending transaction involving the participant. 


(c) After a participant has been removed from the Multiclass Securities program, the participant may request reinstatement. Approval of the reinstatement is at the sole discretion of the Association.
