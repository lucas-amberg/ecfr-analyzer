# ยง 401.410   Standards for determining comparable market rents.

(a) *When are comparable market rents required?* The Restructuring Plan must establish restructured rents for project-based assistance at comparable market rents unless the PAE finds that exception rents are necessary under ยง 401.411. 


(b) *Comparable market rents defined.* Comparable market rents are the rents charged for properties that the PAE determines to be comparable properties (as defined in section 512(1) of MAHRA, but also excluding section 202 or section 811 projects assisted under part 891 of this title). For purposes of section 512(1), other relevant characteristics include any applicable rent control and other characteristics determined by the PAE. The PAE may make appropriate adjustments when needed to ensure comparability of properties. 


(c) *Methodology for determining comparable market rents.* If the PAE is unable to identify at least three comparable properties within the local market, the PAE may: 


(1) Use non-comparable housing stock within that market from which adjustments can be made; or 


(2) If necessary to go outside the market, use comparable properties as far outside the local market as it finds reasonable, from which adjustments can be made. 


(d) *Using FMR as last resort.* If the PAE is unable to identify enough properties under paragraph (c) of this section, comparable market rents must be set at 90 percent of the Fair Market Rents for the relevant market area.
