# § 401.600   Will a section 8 contract be extended if it would expire while an owner's request for a Restructuring Plan is pending?

(a) If a section 8 contract for an eligible project would expire before a Restructuring Plan is implemented, the contract may be extended at rents not exceeding current rents:


(1) For up to the earlier of one year or closing on the Restructuring Plan under § 401.407; or


(2) For such period of time beyond one year as HUD may approve, up to the closing of the Restructuring Plan.


(b) Any extension of the contract beyond one year for a pending Restructuring Plan, other than an extension approved under this section, must be at comparable market rents or exception rents. An extension at comparable market rents will not affect a project's eligibility for the Mark-to-Market program once it has been established under this part.


(c) HUD may terminate the contract earlier if the PAE or HUD determines that an owner is not cooperative under § 401.402 or if the owner's request is rejected under § 401.403 or § 401.405.
