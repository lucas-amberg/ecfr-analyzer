# ยง 402.4   Contract renewals under section 524(a)(1) of MAHRA.

(a) *Initial renewal.* (1) HUD may renew any expiring section 8 project-based assistance contract at initial rents that do not exceed comparable market rents. 


(2) *Procedure for projects eligible for Restructuring Plan.* (i) If an owner requests renewal of a contract under this section for a project that is eligible for a Restructuring Plan under the Mark-to-Market program under part 401 and that has not been rejected under that part, HUD or a PAE will determine whether renewal under this section, instead of through a Restructuring Plan under part 401 of this chapter, would be sufficient. Renewal without a Restructuring Plan will be considered sufficient if the rents after renewal would be sufficient to maintain both adequate debt service coverage on the HUD-insured or HUD-held mortgage and necessary replacement reserves to ensure the long-term physical integrity of the project, taking into account any comments received under ยง 401.502(c) of this chapter.


(ii) If HUD or the PAE determines that renewal under this section would be sufficient, HUD will not require a Restructuring Plan.


(iii) If HUD or the PAE determines that renewal under this section would not be sufficient, HUD or the PAE may require a Restructuring Plan before the owner's request for contract renewal will be given further consideration. If the owner does not cooperate in the development of an acceptable Restructuring Plan, HUD will pursue whatever administrative actions it considers necessary.


(b) [Reserved]
