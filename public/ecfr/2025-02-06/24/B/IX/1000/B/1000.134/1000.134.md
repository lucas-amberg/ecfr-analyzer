# ยง 1000.134   When may a recipient (or entity funded by a recipient) demolish or dispose of current assisted stock?

(a) A recipient (or entity funded by a recipient) may undertake a planned demolition or disposal of current assisted stock owned by the recipient or an entity funded by the recipient when:


(1) A financial analysis demonstrates that it is more cost-effective or housing program-effective for the recipient to demolish or dispose of the unit than to continue to operate or own it; or


(2) The housing unit has been condemned by the government which has authority over the unit; or


(3) The housing unit is an imminent threat to the health and safety of housing residents; or


(4) Continued habitation of a housing unit is inadvisable due to cultural or historical considerations.


(b) No action to demolish or dispose of the property other than performing the analysis cited in paragraph (a) of this section can be taken until HUD has been notified in writing of the recipient's intent to demolish or dispose of the housing units consistent with section 102(c)(4)(H) of NAHASDA. The written notification must set out the analysis used to arrive at the decision to demolish or dispose of the property and may be set out in a recipient's IHP or in a separate submission to HUD.


(c) In any disposition sale of a housing unit, a sale process designed to maximize the sale price will be used. However, where the sale is to a low-income Indian family, the home may be disposed of without maximizing the sale price so long as such price is consistent with a recipient's IHP. The sale proceeds from the disposition of any housing unit are program income under NAHASDA and must be used in accordance with the requirements of NAHASDA and these regulations.
