(c) *Application.* For a self-insurance plan to be approved by HUD, an application and supporting materials must be submitted containing the information specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(9) of this section. Any material changes made to these documents after initial approval must be submitted to HUD. Adverse material changes may cause HUD to revoke its approval of a self-insurance entity.

(B) The management staff must have at least one senior manager who has a minimum of five years of insurance experience at the level of vice president of a property or casualty insurance entity; as a senior branch manager of a branch office with annual property or casualty premiums exceeding five million dollars; or as a senior manager of a public entity self-insurance risk pool;

(9) A plan's first successful application for approval under this section must also include an opinion from the plan's legal counsel that the plan is properly chartered, incorporated, or otherwise formed under applicable law.


(d) *HUD consideration of plan.* HUD will consider an application for approval of a self-insurance plan submitted under this section and approve or disapprove that application no later than 90 days from the date of receipt of a complete application. If an application is disapproved, HUD shall notify the applicant of the reasons for disapproval and may offer technical assistance to a recipient to help the recipient correct the deficiencies in the application. The recipient may then resubmit the application under this section.


(e) *Annual reporting.* An approved plan must undergo an audit and actuarial review annually. In addition, an evaluation of the plan's management must be performed by an insurance professional every three years. These audits, actuarial reviews, and management reviews must be submitted to HUD within 90 days after the end of the insuring entity's fiscal year and be prepared in accordance with the following standards:


(1) The annual financial statement must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and audited by an independent auditor in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. The independent auditor shall state in writing an opinion on whether the plan's financial statement is presented fairly, in accordance with GAAP;


(2) The actuarial review of the plan shall be done consistently with requirements established by the Association of Governmental Risk Pools and conducted by an independent property or casualty actuary who is a member of a recognized professional actuarial organization, such as the American Academy of Actuaries. The report issued and submitted to HUD must include the actuary's written opinion on any over- or under-reserving and the adequacy of the reserve maintained for open claims and for incurred but unreported claims;


(3) The management review must be prepared by an independent insurance consultant who has received the professional designation of a chartered property/casualty underwriter (CPCU), associate in risk management (ARM), or associate in claims (AIC), and must cover the following:


(i) The efficiency of the management or third-party administrator of the plan;


(ii) Timeliness of the claim payments and reserving practices; and


(iii) The adequacy of reinsurance or excess insurance coverage.


(f) *Revocation of approval.* HUD may revoke its approval of a plan under this section when the plan no longer meets the requirements of this section. The plan's management will be notified in writing of the proposed revocation of its approval and of the manner and time in which to request a hearing to challenge the determination, in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in this part for model housing activities (§ 1000.118).


(g) *Preemption.* In order that tribally owned Indian housing insurance entities that provide insurance for IHBG-assisted housing will not be subject to conflicting state laws and widely varying and costly requirements, any self-insurance plan under this section that meets the requirements of this section and that has been approved by HUD shall be governed by the regulations of this subpart in its provision of insurance for IHBG-assisted housing.
