# ยง 1000.216   What happens if the recipient does not submit the IHP to the Area ONAP by no later than 75 days before the beginning of the tribal program year?

If the IHP is not initially sent by at least 75 days before the beginning of the tribal program year, the recipient will not be eligible for IHBG funds for that fiscal year. Any funds not obligated because an IHP was not received before this deadline has passed shall be distributed by formula in the following year.
