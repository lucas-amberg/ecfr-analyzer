# ยง 1000.331   How will the impacts from adoption of a new data source be minimized as the new data source is implemented?

(a) To minimize the impact of funding changes based on the introduction of a new data source under ยง 1000.330, in fiscal year 2018 and each year thereafter, if, solely as a direct result of the introduction of a new data source, an Indian tribe's allocation under the need component of the formula is less than 90 percent of the amount it received under the need component in the immediate previous fiscal year, the Indian tribe's need allocation shall be adjusted up to an amount equal to 90 percent of the previous year's need allocation.


(b) Nothing in this section shall impact other adjustments under this part, including minimum funding, census challenges, formula area changes, or an increase in the total amount of funds available under the need component.


(c) In the event of a decrease in the total amount of funds available under the need component, an Indian tribe's adjusted allocation under paragraph (a) of this section shall be reduced by an amount proportionate to the reduced amount available for distribution under the need component of the formula.


(d) Adjustments under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section shall be made to a tribe's need allocation after adjusting that allocation under paragraph (a) of this section.
