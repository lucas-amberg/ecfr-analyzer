# ยง 1003.101   Area ONAP allocation of funds.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, funds will be allocated to the Area ONAPs responsible for the program on the following basis: 


(1) Each Area ONAP will be allocated $1,000,000 as a base amount, to which will be added a formula share of the balance of the ICDBG Program funds, as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. 


(2) The amount remaining after the base amount is allocated and any amount retained by the Headquarters ONAP to fund imminent threat grants pursuant to the provisions of ยง 1003.402 is subtracted, will be allocated to each Area ONAP based on the most recent data complied and published by the United States Bureau of the Census referable to the same point or period in time, as follows: 


(i) Forty percent (40%) of the funds will be allocated based upon each Area ONAP's share of the total eligible Indian population; 


(ii) Forty percent (40%) of the funds will be allocated based upon each Area ONAP's share of the total extent of poverty among the eligible Indian population; and 


(iii) Twenty percent (20%) of the funds will be allocated based upon each Area ONAP's share of the total extent of overcrowded housing among the eligible Indian population. 


(b) HUD will use other criteria to determine an allocation formula for distributing funds to the Area ONAPs if funds are set aside by statute for a specific purpose in any fiscal year if it is determined that the formula in paragraph (a) of this section is inappropriate to accomplish the purpose. HUD will use other criteria if it is determined that, based on a limited appropriation of funds, the use of the formula in paragraph (a) of this section is inappropriate to obtain an equitable allocation of funds. 


(c) Data used for the allocation of funds will be based upon the Indian population of those tribes and villages that are determined to be eligible ninety (90) days before the beginning of each fiscal year.
