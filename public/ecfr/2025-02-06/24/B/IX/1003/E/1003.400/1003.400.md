The following criteria apply to requests for assistance under this subpart:

Funds may only be used to deal with imminent threats that are not of a recurring nature and which represent a unique and unusual circumstance, and which impact on an entire service area. 


(b) Funds to alleviate imminent threats may be granted only if the applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of HUD that other tribal or Federal funding sources cannot be made available to alleviate the threat. 


(c) HUD will establish grant ceilings for imminent threat applications.
