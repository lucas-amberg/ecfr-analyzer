# § 1005.523   HUD pre-endorsement review.

(a) Direct Guarantee Lender shall submit to HUD within 60 days after the date of the closing of the Loan, or such additional time as permitted by HUD, the endorsement case binder.


(b) Upon submission by a Direct Guarantee Lender of the endorsement case binder containing those documents required by § 1005.503, HUD will review the documents to ensure that the Loan meets all statutory, regulatory, and administrative requirements, including but not limited to:


(1) There is no fee, late charge, or interest due to HUD;


(2) The Loan was not in default when submitted for the Loan Guarantee Certificate, unless otherwise approved by HUD, or if submitted for guarantee more than 60 days after the date of closing, the loan shows an acceptable payment history; and


(3) The loan was underwritten by an approved Direct Guarantee Lender.


(c) Upon review, if HUD determines the loan to meet program requirements, HUD will issue a Loan Guarantee Certificate. If HUD determines the loan is ineligible, HUD will provide the Direct Guarantee Lender with a written determination and specify any available corrective actions that may be available. If there is information indicating that any certification or required document is false, misleading, or constitutes fraud or misrepresentation on the part of any party, or that the loan fails to meet a statutory or regulatory requirement, HUD will conduct a complete audit of the endorsement case binder. Repeated submission of deficient endorsement case binders may subject the Direct Guarantee Lender to sanctions or civil money penalties pursuant to §§ 1005.905 and 1005.907.
