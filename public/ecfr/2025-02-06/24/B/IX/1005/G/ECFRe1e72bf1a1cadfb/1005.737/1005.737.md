# § 1005.737   Vacant or abandoned property procedures.

If the Servicer determines through an occupancy inspection or occupancy follow-up that the property is vacant or abandoned, or if the Servicer is notified by HUD that the Tribe or the TDHE determined the property is vacant or abandoned, the Servicer must send a letter, via certified mail or other method providing delivery confirmation, to all Borrowers at the property address, or other known address of Borrower, informing them of the Servicer's determination that the property is vacant or abandoned. This letter must include the Servicer's contact information.


(a) If occupancy is verified through the delivery confirmation, the Servicer shall continue pursuing collection efforts and loss mitigation as required by §§ 1005.729 and 1005.739 until the Servicer has the authority to proceed to First Legal Action in accordance with § 1005.763 or Tribal First Right of Refusal in accordance with § 1005.759.


(b) If the Servicer verifies through the delivery confirmation process that the property is vacant or abandoned; then the Servicer shall:


(1) Commence first-time vacant property inspection;


(2) Take appropriate property preservation and protection actions to secure and maintain the property;


(3) For properties on Trust Land:


(i) Notify the Tribe that the property is vacant or abandoned; and


(ii) Complete Tribal First Right of Refusal under § 1005.759;


(4) For fee simple Properties, complete First Legal Action within 30 days;


(5) Continue to perform vacant property inspections every 25-35 days until the default is cured, the property is disposed of, or the bankruptcy court has granted approval for the Servicer to contact the Borrower or to take any required property preservation actions; and


(6) Retain documentation in the servicing case binder providing evidence of activities required by HUD in this section or otherwise provided in Section 184 Program Guidance.


(c) *Alternative deadlines.* HUD may prescribe alternative extended deadlines to the time requirements of this section in Section 184 Program Guidance.
