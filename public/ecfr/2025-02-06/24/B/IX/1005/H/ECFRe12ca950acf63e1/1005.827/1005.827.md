# § 1005.827   Damage or neglect.

(a) If the property has been damaged by fire, flood, earthquake, or tornado, or if the property has suffered damage because of the Servicer 's failure to take action as required by § 1005.767 or for any other reason, the Servicer must submit a claim to the hazard insurance policy, as applicable and the damage must be repaired before conveyance of the property or assignment of the Section 184 Guaranteed Loan to HUD.


(b) If the property has been damaged as described in paragraph (a) of this section and the damage is not covered by a hazard insurance policy, the Servicer must provide notice of such damage to HUD. The property may not be conveyed or assigned until directed to do so by HUD. Upon receipt of such notice, HUD will either:


(1) Allow the Holder to convey the damaged property;


(2) Require the Holder to repair the damage before conveyance, and HUD will reimburse the Holder for reasonable payments, not in excess of HUD's estimate of the cost of repair, less any hazard insurance recovery; or


(3) Require the Holder to repair the damage before conveyance, at the Holder's own expense.


(c) In the event the damaged property is conveyed to HUD without prior notice or approval as provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, HUD may, after notice, reconvey the property and demand reimbursement to HUD for the expenses in accordance with §§ 1005.849 and 1005.851.
