(1) Provide for the monitoring of environmental reviews performed by the DHHL under this section; 


(2) At its discretion, facilitate training for the performance of such reviews by the DHHL; and, 


(3) At its discretion, provide for the suspension or termination of the assumption of responsibilities under this section based upon a finding of substantial failure of the DHHL to execute responsibilities under this section.
