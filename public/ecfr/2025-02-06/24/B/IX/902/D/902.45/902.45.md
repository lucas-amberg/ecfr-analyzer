# ยง 902.45   Management operations scoring and thresholds.

(a) *Scoring.* Under the management operations indicator, HUD will calculate a score for each project, as well as for the overall management operations of a PHA, that reflects weights based on the relative importance of the individual management subindicators.


(b) *Overall PHA management operations indicator score.* The overall management operations indicator score is a unit-weighted average of project scores. The sum of the weighted values is divided by the total number of units in the PHA's portfolio to derive the overall management operations indicator score.


(c) *Thresholds.* (1) The PHA's management operations score is based on a maximum of 25 points.


(2) In order to receive a passing score under the management operations indicator, a PHA must achieve a score of at least 15 points or 60 percent.


(3) A PHA that receives fewer than 15 points will be categorized as a substandard management operations agency.
