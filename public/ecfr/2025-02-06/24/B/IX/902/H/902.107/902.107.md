# ยง 902.107   Withholding, denying, and rescinding troubled designation.

(a) *Withholding designation.* In exceptional circumstances, even though a PHA has satisfied the requirements for high performer or non-troubled designations, HUD may conduct any review as it may determine necessary, and may deny or rescind incentives or high performer designation or non-troubled performer designation, in the case of a PHA that:


(1) Is operating under a special agreement with HUD (e.g., a civil rights Conciliation or Voluntary Compliance Agreement);


(2) Is involved in litigation that bears directly upon the physical performance of a PHA;


(3) Is operating under a court order;


(4) Demonstrates substantial evidence of fraud or misconduct, including evidence that the PHA's certifications, submitted in accordance with this part, are not supported by the facts, as evidenced by such sources as a HUD review, routine reports, an Office of Inspector General investigation/audit, an independent auditor's audit, or an investigation by any appropriate legal authority; or


(5) Demonstrates substantial noncompliance in one or more areas of a PHA's required compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including areas not assessed under the small rural assessment. Areas of substantial noncompliance include, but are not limited to, noncompliance with civil rights, nondiscrimination and fair housing laws and regulations, or the ACC. Substantial noncompliance casts doubt on the capacity of a PHA to preserve and protect its public housing projects and operate them consistent with Federal laws and regulations.


(b) *High performer and standard designations.* If a high performer designation is denied or rescinded, the PHA shall be designated either a non-troubled performer, or troubled performer, depending on the nature and seriousness of the matter or matters constituting the basis for HUD's action. If a non-troubled performer designation is denied or rescinded, the PHA shall be designated as a troubled performer.


(c) *Effect on score.* The denial or rescission of a designation of high performer or non-troubled performer shall not affect the PHA's numerical small rural assessment score, except where the denial or rescission is under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
