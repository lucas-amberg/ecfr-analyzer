# ยง 902.109   Right to petition and appeal troubled designation.

(a) *Appeal of troubled performer designation and petition for removal of troubled performer designation.* A PHA may take any of the following actions:


(1) Appeal its troubled performer designation;


(2) Petition for removal of troubled performer designation; and


(3) Appeal any refusal of a petition to remove troubled performer designation.


(b) *Appeal of small rural Assessment score.* (1) If a PHA believes that an objectively verifiable and material error(s) exists in its small rural assessment score, which, if corrected, will result in a significant change in the PHA's score and its designation, the PHA may appeal its score in accordance with the procedures of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section. A significant change in a score is a change that would cause the PHA's score to increase, resulting in a higher designation for the PHA (*i.e.,* from troubled performer to non-troubled performer, or from non-troubled to high performer).


(2) A PHA may not appeal its score or designation based on the subsequent correction of deficiencies identified as a result of a project's physical inspection.


(c) *Appeal and petition procedures.* (1) To appeal a troubled performer designation or petition for the removal of a troubled performer designation, a PHA must submit a request in writing to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Real Estate Assessment Center, which must be received by HUD no later than 30 days following the issuance of the score to the PHA.


(2) To appeal the denial of a petition to remove a troubled performer designation, a PHA must submit a written request to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Real Estate Assessment Center, which must be received by HUD no later than 30 days after HUD's decision to refuse to remove the PHA's troubled performer designation.


(3) An appeal of a troubled performer designation or an appeal of the denial of a petition for removal of a troubled performer designation must include the PHA's supporting documentation and reasons for the appeal or petition. An appeal of an assessment score must be accompanied by the PHA's evidence that a material error occurred. An appeal or petition submitted to HUD without supporting documentation will not be considered and will be returned to the PHA.


(d) *Denial, withholding, or rescission.* A PHA that disagrees with the basis for denial, withholding, or rescission of its designation under ยง 902.66 may make a written request for reinstatement within 30 days of notification by HUD of the denial or rescission of the designation to the Assistant Secretary, and the request shall include reasons for the reinstatement.


(e) *Consideration of petitions and appeals.* (1) Consideration of a petition or the appeal of a final overall assessment score, of a troubled performer designation, or of a petition to remove troubled performer designation. Upon receipt of such an appeal or a petition from a PHA, HUD will evaluate the appeal and its merits for purposes of determining whether a reassessment of the PHA is warranted. HUD will review the PHA's file and the evidence submitted by the PHA to determine whether an error occurred.


(2) Consideration of an appeal of refusal to remove a troubled performer designation. Upon receipt of an appeal of refusal to remove a troubled performer designation, HUD will evaluate the appeal and its merits for the purposes of determining whether a reassessment of the PHA is warranted. The HUD staff initially evaluating an appeal of refusal to remove a troubled performer designation will not be the same HUD staff who evaluated the PHA's petition to remove the troubled performer designation. The Assistant Secretary will render the final determination of such an appeal.


(f) *Notice and finality of decisions.* (1) If HUD determines that one or more objectively verifiable and material error has occurred, HUD will undertake a new inspection of the project, adjust the PHA's score, or perform another reexamination of information, as appropriate in light of the nature of the error that occurred. A new score will be issued and an appropriate performance designation made by HUD. HUD's decision on appeal of an assessment score, issuance of a troubled performer designation, or refusal to remove a troubled performer designation will be final agency action. No reconsideration will be given by HUD of such decisions.


(2) HUD will issue a written decision on all appeals and petitions made under this section.
