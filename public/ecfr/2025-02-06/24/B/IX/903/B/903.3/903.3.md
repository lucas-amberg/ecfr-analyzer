# § 903.3   What is the purpose of this subpart?

(a) This subpart specifies the requirements for PHA plans, required by section 5A of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437c-1) (the Act), as amended.


(b) The purpose of the plans is to provide a strategic planning framework for PHA management operations and capital planning:


(1) Local accountability; and


(2) An easily identifiable source by which public housing residents, participants in the tenant-based and project-based assistance program, and other members of the public may locate basic PHA policies, rules and requirements concerning the PHA's operations, programs and services.


(c) Title VII of the Housing and Economic Reform Act, Public Law 110-289, section 2702, amends 42 U.S.C. 1437c-1(b) to provide qualified PHAs an exemption from the requirement of section 5A of the Act to submit an annual PHA Plan. The term “qualified PHA” means a public housing agency that meets the following requirements:


(1) The sum of the number of public housing dwelling units administered by the agency, and the number of vouchers under section 8(o) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)) administered by the agency, is 550 or fewer; and


(2) The agency is not designated under section 42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(2) as a troubled public housing agency, and does not have a failing score under SEMAP during the prior 12 months.
