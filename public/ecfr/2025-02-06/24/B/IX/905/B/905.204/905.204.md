# ยง 905.204   Emergencies and natural disasters.

(a) *General.* PHAs are required by the CF ACC to carry various types of insurance to protect it from loss. In most cases, insurance coverage will be the primary source of funding to pay repair or replacement costs associated with emergencies and natural disasters. Where the Department's Annual Appropriations Act establishes a set-aside from the Capital Fund appropriation for emergencies and natural disasters, the procedures in this section apply.


(b) *Emergencies and natural disasters.* An emergency is an unforeseen or unpreventable event or occurrence that poses an immediate threat to the health and safety of the residents that must be corrected within one year of funding. A natural disaster for purposes of the Capital Fund reserve, is a non-presidentially declared disaster. In the event an emergency or natural disaster arises, HUD may require a PHA to use any other source that may legally be available, including unobligated Capital Funds, prior to providing emergency or natural disaster funds from the set-aside. The Department will review, on a case-by-case basis, requests for emergency and natural disaster funding from PHAs.


(c) *Procedure to request emergency or natural disaster funds.* To obtain emergency or natural disaster funds, a PHA shall submit a written request in the form and manner prescribed by HUD. In a natural disaster where the PHA requires immediate relief to preserve the property and safety of the residents, the PHA may submit a preliminary request outlined in paragraph (d) of this section. Subsequently, the PHA is required to complete and submit the remaining information outlined in paragraph (e) of this section, at a time prescribed by HUD. For emergency requests, PHAs are to follow the procedures outlined in paragraph (e) of this section.


(d) *Procedure to request preliminary natural disaster grant for immediate preservation.* A PHA may request a preliminary grant only for costs necessary for immediate preservation of the property and safety of the residents. The application should include the reasonable identification of damage and preservation costs as determined by the PHA. An independent assessment will be required when the PHA submits the final request or when the PHA reconciles the preliminary application grant with the actual amounts received from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), insurance carriers, and other natural disaster relief sources. Regardless of whether further funding from the set-aside is requested, at a time specified by HUD, the PHA will be expected to provide a reconciliation of all funds received, to ensure that the PHA does not receive duplicate funding.


(e) *Procedure for an emergency or a final request for natural disaster funds.* In the request the PHA shall:


(1) Identify the public housing project(s) with the emergency or natural disaster condition(s).


(2) Identify and provide the date of the conditions that present an unforeseen or unpreventable threat to the health, life, or safety of residents, in the case of emergency; or Natural disaster (e.g., hurricane, tornado, etc.).


(3) Describe the activities that will be undertaken to correct the emergency or the conditions caused by the natural disaster and the estimated cost.


(4) Provide an independent assessment of the extent of and the cost to correct the condition. The assessment must be specific as to the damage and costs associated with the emergency or natural disaster. An independent estimate of damage and repair cost is required as a part of the final natural disaster application. For natural disasters, the assessment must identify damage specifically caused by the natural disaster. The set-aside can be used only to pay costs to repair or replace a public housing project damaged as a result of the natural disaster, not for nonroutine maintenance or other improvements.


(5) Provide a copy of a currently effective DOT covering the property and an opinion of counsel that there are no preexisting liens or other encumbrances on the property.


(6) Demonstrate that without the requested funds from the set-aside, the PHA does not have adequate funds available to correct the emergency condition(s).


(7) Identify all other sources of available funds (e.g., insurance proceeds, FEMA).


(8) Any other material required by HUD.


(f) *HUD Action.* HUD shall review all requests for emergency or natural disaster funds. If HUD determines that a PHA's request meets the requirements of this section, HUD shall approve the request subject to the availability of funds in the set-aside, in the order in which requests are received and are determined approvable.


(g) *Submission of the CF ACC.* Upon being provided with a CF ACC Amendment from HUD, the PHA must sign and date the CF ACC Amendment and return it to HUD by the date established by HUD. HUD will execute the signed and dated CF ACC Amendment submitted by the PHA.
