# ยง 906.7   Physical requirements that a property offered for sale under this part must meet.

(a) *Property standards.* A property offered for sale under a homeownership program must meet local code requirements (or, if no local code exists, the housing quality standards established by HUD for the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program, 24 CFR part 982) and the relevant requirements of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821-4846), the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 4851-4856), and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 35, subparts A, B, L, and R of this title. When a prospective purchaser who has known disabilities, or who has a family member with known disabilities requires accessible features, the features must be added as a reasonable accommodation to the disability, in accordance with the requirements of ยง 8.29 of this title. Further, the property must be in good repair, with the major components having a remaining useful life that is sufficient to justify a reasonable expectation that homeownership will be affordable by the purchasers. These standards must be met as a condition for conveyance of a dwelling to an individual purchaser.
