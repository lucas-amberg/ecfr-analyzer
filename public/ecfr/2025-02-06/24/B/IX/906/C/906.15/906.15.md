# ยง 906.15   Requirements applicable to a family purchasing a property under a homeownership program.

(a) *Low-income requirement.* Except in the case of a PHA's offer of first refusal to a resident occupying the unit under ยง 906.13, a family purchasing a property under a PHA homeownership program must be a low-income family, as defined in section 3 of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437a), at the time the contract to purchase the property is executed. 


(b) *Principal residence requirement.* The dwelling unit sold to an eligible family must be used as the principal residence of the family. 


(c) *Financial capacity requirement.* Eligibility must be limited to families who are capable of assuming the financial obligations of homeownership, under minimum income standards for affordability, taking into account the unavailability of public housing operating subsidies and modernization funds after conveyance of the property by the PHA. A homeownership program may, however, take account of any available subsidy from other sources. Under this affordability standard, an applicant must meet the following requirements: 


(1) *Cost/income ratio.* On an average monthly estimate, the amount of the applicant's payments for mortgage principal and interest, plus insurance, real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance, and other regularly recurring homeownership costs (such as condominium, cooperative, or other homeownership association fees) will not exceed the sum of: 


(i) 35 percent of the applicant's adjusted income as defined in 24 CFR part 913; and 


(ii) Any subsidy that will be available for such payments; 


(2) *Down payment requirement.* Each family purchasing housing under a homeownership program must provide a down payment in connection with any loan for acquisition of the housing, in an amount determined by the PHA or PRE, in accordance with an approved homeownership program. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the PHA or PRE must permit the family to use grant amounts, gifts from relatives, contributions from private sources, and other similar amounts in making the down payment; 


(3) The family must use its own resources other than grants, gifts, contributions, or similar amounts, to contribute an amount of the down payment that is not less than one percent of the purchase price of the housing. The PHA or PRE must maintain records that are verifiable by HUD through audits regarding the source of this one percent contribution. 


(d) *Other requirements established by the PHA.* A PHA may establish requirements or limitations for families to purchase housing under a homeownership program, including but not limited to requirements or limitations regarding: 


(1) Employment or participation in employment counseling or training activities; 


(2) Criminal activity; 


(3) Participation in homeownership counseling programs; and 


(4) Evidence of regular income.
