# § 906.23   Protections available to non-purchasing public housing residents.

(a) If a public housing resident does not exercise the right of first refusal under § 906.13, and the PHA determines to move the tenant for the purpose of transferring possession of the unit, the PHA must provide the notice stated in this section 90 days before the date the resident is displaced, and may not displace the resident, except as stated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for the full 90-day period. The PHA: 


(1) Must notify the resident residing in the unit 90 days prior to the displacement date, except in cases of imminent threat to health or safety, that: 


(i) The public housing unit will be sold; 


(ii) The transfer of possession of the unit will not occur until the resident is relocated; and 


(iii) Each resident displaced by such action will be offered comparable housing (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section); 


(2) Must provide for the payment of the actual costs and reasonable relocation expenses of the resident to be displaced; 


(3) Must ensure that the resident is offered comparable housing under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section; 


(4) Must provide counseling for displaced residents regarding their rights to comparable housing, including their rights under the Fair Housing Act to choice of a unit on a nondiscriminatory basis, without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, disability, age, sex, or familial status; and

(b) For purposes of this section, the term “comparable housing” means housing: 


(1) That meets housing quality standards; 


(2) That is located in an area that is generally not less desirable than the displaced resident's original development; and 


(3) Which may include:
