# § 906.39   Contents of a homeownership program.

A homeownership program must include the following matters, as applicable to the particular factual situation: 


(a) *Method of Sale:* The PHA should indicate how units will be sold, including a description of the exact method of sale, such as, for example, fee simple conveyance, lease-purchase, or sale of a cooperative share. PHAs may sell units directly to a tenant or eligible family directly or via a *bona fide* lease-purchase arrangement. The PHA must indicate whether it, or a PRE will sell units to families directly or via such lease-purchase method. If the PHA or PRE will use a lease-purchase method the proposal should indicate the terms of the lease-purchase arrangement. The terms of the lease-purchase arrangement shall include, but are not limited to the periodic documentation to be provided to the family regarding the amount they have accrued toward the down payment, and the length of the lease period (with regard to PREs the sales must be completed within the statutory 5-year period.); 


(b) *Property description.* (1) If the program involves only financing assistance to the family purchasing the unit, the PHA need not specify property addresses, but it must describe the area(s) in which the assistance is to be used; 


(2) If the PHA is selling existing public housing, it must describe the property, including identification of the property by project number, or street address if there is no project number, and the specific dwellings to be sold, with bedroom distribution by size and type broken down by development; 


(3) If the PHA is acquiring units with 1937 Act funds to sell under the program, it must comply with the provisions of § 906.40 concerning this element of the program; 


(c) *Repair or rehabilitation.* If applicable, a plan for any repair or rehabilitation needed to meet the requirements of § 906.7, based on the assessment of the physical condition of the property that is included in the supporting documentation. The restriction in 906.5(c) of this part applies to such repair or rehabilitation; 


(d) *Purchaser eligibility and selection.* The standards and procedures to be used for homeownership applications and the eligibility and selection of purchasers, consistent with the requirements of § 906.15. If the homeownership program allows application for purchase of units by families who are not presently public housing or Section 8 residents and not already on the PHA's waiting lists for those programs, the program must include an affirmative fair housing marketing strategy for such families, including specific steps to inform them of their eligibility to apply, and to solicit applications from those in the housing market who are least likely to apply for the program without special outreach, including persons with disabilities; 


(e) *Sale and financing.* Terms and conditions of sale and financing, including any below-market financing under § 906.29; 


(f) *Consultation with residents and purchasers.* A description of resident input obtained during the resident consultation process required by the PHA Plan under part 903 of this title. If the PHA is one whose Plan does not require information regarding homeownership under § 903.11(b)(1) of this title, the PHA must consult with the Resident Advisory Board or Boards regarding the homeownership plan, and provide the information required in this paragraph; 


(g) *Counseling.* Counseling, training, and technical assistance to be provided to purchasers; 


(h) *Sale via PRE.* If the program contemplates sale to residents by an entity other than the PHA, a description of that entity's responsibilities and information demonstrating that the requirements of § 906.19 have been met or will be met in a timely fashion; 


(i) *Non-purchasing residents.* If applicable, a plan for non-purchasing residents, in accordance with § 906.23;
