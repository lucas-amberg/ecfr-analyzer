# ยง 943.118   What is a consortium?

A consortium consists of two or more PHAs that join together to perform planning, reporting, and other administrative or management functions for participating PHAs, as specified in a consortium agreement. A consortium also submits a joint PHA Plan. The lead agency collects the assistance funds from HUD that would be paid to the participating PHAs for the elements of their operations that are administered by the consortium and allocates them according to the consortium agreement. The participating PHAs must adopt the same fiscal year so that the applicable periods for submission and review of the joint PHA Plan are the same. Notwithstanding any other regulation, PHAs proposing to form consortia may request and HUD may approve changes in PHA fiscal years to make this possible.
