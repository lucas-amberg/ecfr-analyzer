(iv) A description of the activity completed; and


(v) A certification that the tenant's statement is true.


(3) If a PHA accepts self-certifications under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the PHA must validate a sample of such self-certifications using third-party certification described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.


(b) *PHA notice of noncompliance.* (1) If the PHA determines that there is a family member who is required to fulfill a service requirement, but who has violated this family obligation (noncompliant resident), the PHA must notify the tenant of this determination. 


(2) The PHA notice to the tenant must: 


(i) Briefly describe the noncompliance; 


(ii) State that the PHA will not renew the lease at the end of the twelve month lease term unless: 


(A) The tenant, and any other noncompliant resident, enter into a written agreement with the PHA, in the form and manner required by the PHA, to cure such noncompliance, and in fact cure such noncompliance in accordance with such agreement; or 


(B) The family provides written assurance satisfactory to the PHA that the tenant or other noncompliant resident no longer resides in the unit. 


(iii) State that the tenant may request a grievance hearing on the PHA determination, in accordance with part 966, subpart B of this chapter, and that the tenant may exercise any available judicial remedy to seek timely redress for the PHA's nonrenewal of the lease because of such determination. 


(c) *Tenant agreement to comply with service requirement.* If the tenant or another family member has violated the service requirement, the PHA may not renew the lease upon expiration of the term unless: 


(1) The tenant, and any other noncompliant resident, enter into a written agreement with the PHA, in the form and manner required by the PHA, to cure such noncompliance by completing the additional hours of community service or economic self-sufficiency activity needed to make up the total number of hours required over the twelve-month term of the new lease, and 


(2) All other members of the family who are subject to the service requirement are currently complying with the service requirement or are no longer residing in the unit.
