The Family Investment Centers Program provides families living in public housing with better access to educational and employment opportunities by: 


(a) Developing facilities in or near public housing for training and support services; 


(b) Mobilizing public and private resources to expand and improve the delivery of such services; 


(c) Providing funding for such essential training and support services that cannot otherwise be funded; and
