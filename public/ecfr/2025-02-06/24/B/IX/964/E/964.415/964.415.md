# § 964.415   Resident board members.

(a) *General.* Except as provided in §§ 964.405(b) and 964.425, the membership of the governing board of each public housing agency must contain not less than one eligible resident board member.


(b) *Resident board member no longer directly assisted.* (1) A resident board member who ceases to be directly assisted by the public housing agency is no longer an “eligible resident” as defined in § 964.410.


(2) Such a board member may be removed from the PHA board for that cause, where such action is permitted under State or local law.


(3) Alternatively, the board member may be allowed to complete his/her current term as a member of the governing board. However, the board member may not be re-appointed (or re-elected) to the governing board for purposes of serving as the statutorily required resident board member.


(c) *Minimum qualifications for board membership.* Any generally applicable qualifications for board membership also apply to residents, unless the application of the requirements would result in the governing board not containing at least one eligible resident as a member. Further, PHAs and localities may not establish eligibility requirements for board membership that are solely applicable to residents.
