# ยง 970.13   Environmental review requirements.

(a) Activities under this part (including de minimis demolition pursuant to ยง 970.27) are subject to HUD environmental regulations in 24 CFR part 58. However, HUD may make a finding in accordance with 24 CFR 58.11(d) of this title and may itself perform the environmental review under the provisions of 24 CFR part 50 if a PHA objects in writing to the responsible entity performing the review under 24 CFR part 58.

(1) Private, Federal, state, or local funding for the site reuse has been committed;


(2) A grant application involving the site has been filed with the Federal government or a state or local unit of government;


(3) The Federal government or a state or unit of local government has made a commitment to take an action, including a physical action, that will facilitate a particular reuse of the site; and


(4) Architectural, engineering, or design plans for the reuse exist that go beyond preliminary stages.


(c) In the case of a demolition or disposition made necessary by a disaster that the President has declared under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5121 *et seq.,* or a disaster that has been declared under state law by the officer or entity with legal authority to make such declaration, pursuant to 24 CFR 50.43 and 24 CFR 58.33, the provisions of 40 CFR 1506.11 will apply.
