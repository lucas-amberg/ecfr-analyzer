# § 971.1   Purpose.

Section 202 of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (Pub.L. 104-134, approved April 26, 1996) (“OCRA”) requires PHAs to identify certain distressed public housing developments that cost more than Section 8 rental assistance and cannot be reasonably revitalized. Households in occupancy that will be affected by the activities will be offered tenant-based or project-based assistance (that can include other public housing units) and will be relocated, to other decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing which is, to the maximum extent practicable, housing of their choice. After residents are relocated, the distressed developments (or affected buildings) for which no reasonable means of revitalization exists will be removed from the public housing inventory.
