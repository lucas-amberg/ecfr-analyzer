# § 972.130   Conversion plan components.

(a) With respect to any development that is identified under §§ 972.121 through 972.127, the PHA generally must develop a 5-year plan for removal of the affected public housing units from the inventory. The plan must consider relocation alternatives for households in occupancy, including other public housing and Section 8 tenant-based assistance, and must provide for relocation from the units as soon as possible. For planning purposes, the PHA must assume that HUD will be able to provide in a timely fashion any necessary Section 8 rental assistance. The plan must include:


(1) A listing of the public housing units to be removed from the inventory;


(2) Identification and obligation status of any previously approved modernization, reconstruction, or other capital funds for the distressed development and the PHA's recommendations concerning transfer of these funds to Section 8 or alternative public housing uses;


(3) A record indicating compliance with the statute's requirements for consultation with applicable public housing tenants of the affected development and the unit of local government where the public housing is located, as set forth in § 972.133;


(4) A description of the plans for demolition or disposition of the public housing units; and


(5) A relocation plan, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) *Relocation plan.* The relocation plan must incorporate all of the information identified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. In addition, if the required conversion is subject to the URA, the relocation plan must also contain the information identified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. The relocation plan must incorporate the following:


(1) The number of households to be relocated, by bedroom size, and by the number of accessible units.


(2) The relocation resources that will be necessary, including a request for any necessary Section 8 funding and a description of actual or potential public or other assisted housing vacancies that can be used as relocation housing and budget for carrying out relocation activities.


(3) A schedule for relocation and removal of units from the public housing inventory (including the schedule for providing actual and reasonable relocation expenses, as determined by the PHA, for families displaced by the conversion).


(4) Provide for issuance of a written notice to families residing in the development in accordance with the following requirements:


(i) *Timing of notice.* If the required conversion is not subject to the URA, the notice shall be provided to families at least 90 days before displacement. If the required conversion is subject to the URA the written notice shall be provided to families no later than the date the conversion plan is submitted to HUD. For purposes of a required conversion subject to the URA, this written notice shall constitute the General Information Notice (GIN) required by the URA.


(ii) *Contents of notice.* The written notice shall include all of the following:


(A) The development must be removed from the public housing inventory and that the family may be displaced as a result of the conversion;


(B) The family will be offered comparable housing, which may include tenant-based or project-based assistance, or occupancy in a unit operated or assisted by the PHA (if tenant-based assistance is used, the comparable housing requirement is fulfilled only upon the relocation of the family into such housing);


(C) Any necessary counseling with respect to the relocation will be provided, including any appropriate mobility counseling (the PHA may finance the mobility counseling using Operating Fund, Capital Fund, or Section 8 administrative fee funding);


(D) Such families will be relocated to other decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing that is, to the maximum extent possible, housing of their choice;


(E) If the development is used as housing after conversion, the PHA must ensure that each resident may choose to remain in the housing, using tenant-based assistance towards rent; and


(F) Where section 8 voucher assistance is being used for relocation, the family will be provided with the vouchers at least 90 days before displacement.


(5) If the required conversion is subject to the URA, the written notice described in paragraph (b)(4) must also provide that:


(i) The family will not be required to move without at least 90-days advance written notice of the earliest date by which the family may be required to move, and that the family will not be required to move permanently until the family is offered comparable housing, as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section;


(ii) Any person who is an alien not lawfully present in the United States is ineligible for relocation payments or assistance under the URA, unless such ineligibility would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying spouse, parent, or child, as provided in the URA regulations at 49 CFR 24.208;


(iii) The family has a right to appeal the PHA's determination as to the family's application for relocation assistance for which the family may be eligible under this subpart and URA;


(iv) Families residing in the development will be provided with the URA Notice of Relocation Eligibility or Notice of Non-displacement (as applicable) as of the date HUD approves the conversion plan (for purposes of this subpart, the date of HUD's approval of the conversion plan shall be the “date of initiation of negotiations” as that term is used in URA and the implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24); and


(v) Any family that moves into the development after submission of the conversion plan to HUD will also be eligible for relocation assistance, unless the PHA issues a written move-in notice to the family prior to leasing and occupancy of the unit advising the family of the development's possible conversion, the impact of the conversion on the family, and that the family will not be eligible for relocation assistance.


(c) The conversion plan may not be more than a 5-year plan, unless the PHA applies for and receives approval from HUD for a longer period of time. HUD may allow the PHA up to 10 years to remove the units from the inventory, in exceptional circumstances where HUD determines that this is clearly the most cost effective and beneficial means of providing housing assistance over that same period. For example, HUD may allow a longer period of time to remove the units from the public housing inventory, where more than one development is being converted, and a larger number of families require relocation than can easily be absorbed into the rental market at one time, provided the housing has a remaining useful life of longer than five years and the longer time frame will assist in relocation.
