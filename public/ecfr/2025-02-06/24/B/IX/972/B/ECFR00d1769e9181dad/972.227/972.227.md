# ยง 972.227   Public and resident consultation process for developing a conversion plan.

(a) A conversion plan must be developed in consultation with appropriate public officials and with significant participation by residents of the development.


(b) The requirement for consultation with public officials may be satisfied by obtaining a certification from the appropriate state or local officials that the conversion plan is consistent with that jurisdiction's Consolidated Plan. This may be the same certification as is required for the PHA Annual Plan that includes the conversion plan, so long as the certification specifically addresses the conversion plan.


(c) To satisfy the requirement for significant participation by residents of the development, in addition to the public participation requirements for the PHA Annual Plan, a PHA must:


(1) Hold at least one meeting with the residents of the affected sites (including the duly elected Resident Council, if any, that covers the development in question) at which the PHA must:


(i) Explain the requirements of section 22 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 and these regulations, especially as they apply to residents of affected developments; and


(ii) Provide draft copies of the conversion plan to them.


(2) Provide a reasonable comment period for residents; and


(3) Summarize the resident comments (as well as the PHA responses to the significant issues raised by the commenters) for HUD, and consider these comments in developing the final conversion plan.
