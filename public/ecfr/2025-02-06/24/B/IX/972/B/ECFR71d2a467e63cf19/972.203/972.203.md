# § 972.203   Definition of “conversion.”

For purposes of this subpart, the term “conversion” means the removal of public housing units from the inventory of a Public Housing Agency (PHA), and the provision of tenant-based, or project-based assistance for the residents of the public housing that is being removed. The term “conversion,” as used in this subpart, does not necessarily mean the physical removal of the public housing development from the site.
