# § 982.205   Waiting list: Different programs.

(a) *Merger and cross-listing*—(1) *Merged waiting list.* A PHA may merge the waiting list for tenant-based assistance with the PHA waiting list for admission to another assisted housing program, including a federal or local program. In admission from the merged waiting list, admission for each federal program is subject to federal regulations and requirements for the particular program. 


(2) *Non-merged waiting list: Cross-listing.* If the PHA decides not to merge the waiting list for tenant-based assistance with the waiting list for the PHA's public housing program, project-based voucher program or moderate rehabilitation program: 


(i) If the PHA's waiting list for tenant-based assistance is open when an applicant is placed on the waiting list for the PHA's public housing program, project-based voucher program or moderate rehabilitation program, the PHA must offer to place the applicant on its waiting list for tenant-based assistance. 


(ii) If the PHA's waiting list for its public housing program, project-based voucher program or moderate rehabilitation program is open when an applicant is placed on the waiting list for its tenant-based program, and if the other program includes units suitable for the applicant, the PHA must offer to place the applicant on its waiting list for the other program. 


(b) *Other housing assistance: Effect of application for, receipt or refusal.* (1) For purposes of this section, “other housing subsidy” means a housing subsidy other than assistance under the voucher program. Housing subsidy includes subsidy assistance under a federal housing program (including public housing), a State housing program, or a local housing program. 


(2) The PHA may not take any of the following actions because an applicant has applied for, received, or refused other housing assistance:


(i) Refuse to list the applicant on the PHA waiting list for tenant-based assistance;


(ii) Deny any admission preference for which the applicant is currently qualified;


(iii) Change the applicant's place on the waiting list based on preference, date and time of application, or other factors affecting selection under the PHA selection policy; or


(iv) Remove the applicant from the waiting list.
