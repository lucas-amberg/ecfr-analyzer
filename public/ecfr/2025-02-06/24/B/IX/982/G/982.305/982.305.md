# § 982.305   PHA approval of assisted tenancy.

(a) *Program requirements.* The PHA may not give approval for the family of the assisted tenancy, or execute a HAP contract, until the PHA has determined that:














(1) The unit is eligible;


(2) The unit has been inspected by the PHA and passes HQS;


(3) The lease includes the tenancy addendum;


(4) The rent to owner is reasonable; and


(5) At the time a family initially receives tenant-based assistance for occupancy of a dwelling unit, and where the gross rent of the unit exceeds the applicable payment standard for the family, the family share does not exceed 40 percent of the family's monthly adjusted income.


(b) *Actions before lease term.* (1) The following must be completed before the beginning of the initial term of the lease for a unit:










(i) The PHA has inspected the unit and has determined that the unit satisfies the HQS;


(ii) The landlord and the tenant have executed the lease (including the HUD-prescribed tenancy addendum, and the lead-based paint disclosure information as required in § 35.92(b) of this title); and


(iii) The PHA has approved leasing of the unit in accordance with program requirements.


(2) *The timeframes for inspection:* (i) The PHA must inspect the unit, determine whether the unit satisfies the HQS, and notify the family and owner of the determination:


(A) In the case of a PHA with up to 1250 budgeted units in its tenant-based program, within fifteen days after the family and the owner submit a request for approval of the tenancy.


(B) In the case of a PHA with more than 1250 budgeted units in its tenant-based program, within a reasonable time after the family submits a request for approval of the tenancy. To the extent practicable, such inspection and determination must be completed within fifteen days after the family and the owner submit a request for approval of the tenancy.




(ii) The 15-day clock (under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section) is suspended during any period when the unit is not available for inspection.


(3) If the PHA has implemented, and the unit is covered by, the alternative inspection option for initial inspections under § 982.406(e), the PHA is not subject to paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(1)(i), and (b)(2) of this section.




(4) In the case of a unit subject to a lease-purchase agreement, the PHA must provide written notice to the family of the environmental requirements that must be met before commencing homeownership assistance for the family (see § 982.626(c)). 


(c) *When HAP contract is executed.* (1) The PHA must use best efforts to execute the HAP contract before the beginning of the lease term. The HAP contract must be executed no later than 60 calendar days from the beginning of the lease term.


(2) The PHA may not pay any housing assistance payment to the owner until the HAP contract has been executed.


(3) If the HAP contract is executed during the period of 60 calendar days from the beginning of the lease term, the PHA will pay housing assistance payments after execution of the HAP contract (in accordance with the terms of the HAP contract), to cover the portion of the lease term before execution of the HAP contract (a maximum of 60 days).




(4) Any HAP contract executed after the 60-day period is void, and the PHA may not pay any housing assistance payment to the owner, unless there are extenuating circumstances that prevent or prevented the PHA from meeting the 60-day deadline, then the PHA may submit to the HUD field office a request for an extension. The request, which must be submitted no later than two weeks after the 60-day deadline, must include an explanation of the extenuating circumstances and any supporting documentation. HUD at its sole discretion will determine if the extension request is approved.




(d) *Notice to family and owner.* After receiving the family's request for approval of the assisted tenancy, the PHA must promptly notify the family and owner whether the assisted tenancy is approved.


(e) *Procedure after PHA approval.* If the PHA has given approval for the family of the assisted tenancy, the owner and the PHA execute the HAP contract.


(f) *Initial HQS inspection requirements.* (1) Unless the PHA has implemented, and determined that the unit is covered by, either of the two initial HQS inspection options in paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section, the unit must be inspected by the PHA and pass HQS before:


(i) The PHA may approve the assisted tenancy and execute the HAP contract, and


(ii) The beginning of the initial lease term.


(2) If the PHA has implemented, and determines that the unit is covered by, the non-life-threatening deficiencies option at § 982.405(j), the unit must be inspected by the PHA and must have no life-threatening deficiencies before:


(i) The PHA may approve the assisted tenancy and execute the HAP contract; and


(ii) The beginning of the initial lease term.


(3) If the PHA has implemented and determines that the unit is covered by the alternative inspection option at § 982.406(e), then the PHA must determine that the unit was inspected in the previous 24 months by an inspection that meets the requirements of § 982.406 before:


(i) The PHA may approve the assisted tenancy and execute the HAP contract; and


(ii) The beginning of the initial lease term.


(4) If the PHA has implemented and determines that the unit is covered by both the no life-threatening deficiencies option and the alternative inspection option, the unit is subject only to paragraph (f)(3) of this section, not paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
