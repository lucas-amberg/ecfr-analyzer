# ยง 982.315   Family break-up.

(a)(1) The PHA has discretion to determine which members of an assisted family continue to receive assistance in the program if the family breaks up. The PHA Administrative Plan must state PHA policies on how to decide who remains in the program if the family breaks up.


(2) If the family break-up results from an occurrence of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), the PHA must ensure that the victim retains assistance.


(b) The factors to be considered in making this decision under the PHA policy may include:


(1) Whether the assistance should remain with family members remaining in the original assisted unit.


(2) The interest of minor children or of ill, elderly, or disabled family members.


(3) Whether family members are forced to leave the unit as a result of actual or threatened domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.


(4) Whether any of the family members are receiving protection as victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, and whether the abuser is still in the household.


(5) Other factors specified by the PHA.


(c) If a court determines the disposition of property between members of the assisted family in a divorce or separation under a settlement or judicial decree, the PHA is bound by the court's determination of which family members continue to receive assistance in the program.
