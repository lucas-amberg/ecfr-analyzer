(7) A PHA determination that the unit is not in accordance with HQS because of the family size.


(8) A determination by the PHA to exercise or not to exercise any right or remedy against the owner under a HAP contract.

(2) *Discovery*—(i) *By family.* The family must be given the opportunity to examine before the PHA hearing any PHA documents that are directly relevant to the hearing. The family must be allowed to copy any such document at the family's expense.

A copy of the hearing decision shall be furnished promptly to the family.


(f) *Effect of decision.* The PHA is not bound by a hearing decision:
