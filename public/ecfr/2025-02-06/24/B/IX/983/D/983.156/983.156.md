# § 983.156   PHA acceptance of completed units.

(a) *Inspection of units.* After the PHA has received all required evidence of completion and the owner's certification that all work was completed in accordance with the applicable requirements, the PHA must inspect the completed units to determine whether they comply with HUD's HQS (see § 983.103(b)) and any additional design, architecture, or quality requirements specified by the PHA.


(b) *Execution or amendment of the HAP contract.* If the PHA determines that the development activity or substantial improvement was completed in accordance with the applicable requirements at § 983.155 and the completed units meet HUD's HQS and any additional design, architecture, or quality requirements specified by the PHA per paragraph (a) of this section, then the PHA must:


(1) For units developed pursuant to § 983.152(a)(1) which will not undergo development activity after HAP contract execution per § 983.157, submit the HAP contract for execution by the owner and execute the HAP contract;


(2) For rehabilitated housing projects for which development activity has commenced prior to HAP contract execution, but which will undergo development activity after HAP contract execution under § 983.157(b), submit the HAP contract for execution by the owner and execute the HAP contract;


(3) For development activity conducted after HAP contract execution, amend the HAP contract rider to designate the completed units as available for occupancy (§ 983.157(f)(1)(ii)) or, if the owner has completed all development activity as provided in the rider, amend the HAP contract to terminate the rider (§ 983.157(d)); or


(4) For units that underwent substantial improvement in order to be added to the HAP contract, amend the HAP contract to add the units to the HAP contract (§ 983.207(d)).


(c) *Staged completion of contract units.* Contract units developed pursuant to § 983.152(a)(1) which will not undergo development activity after HAP contract execution per § 983.157 may be placed under the HAP contract in stages commencing on different dates. In such a case, the PHA must determine separately for each stage whether the development activity was completed in accordance with the applicable requirements per § 983.155 and that the units meet HUD's HQS and any additional design, architecture, or quality requirements specified by the PHA per paragraph (a) of this section. If the first stage is determined compliant, then the PHA must submit the HAP contract for execution by the owner and must execute the HAP contract for PBV rehabilitated housing and newly constructed housing projects. As each subsequent stage is determined compliant, the PHA and owner must amend the HAP contract to add the units to the HAP contract (see § 983.207(g)).


(d) *PHA-owned units.* The independent entity must perform the inspection required in paragraph (a) of this section and make the determination(s) required in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section in the case of PHA-owned units (see § 983.57(b)(3)).
