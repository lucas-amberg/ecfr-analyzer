# § 983.251   How participants are selected.

(a) Who may receive PBV assistance? (1) The PHA may select families who are participants in the PHA's tenant-based voucher program and families who have applied for admission to the voucher program.


(2) Except for voucher participants (determined eligible at original admission to the voucher program), the PHA may only select families determined eligible for admission at commencement of PBV assistance, using information received and verified by the PHA within a period of 60 days before commencement of PBV assistance. For all families, the PHA must determine the total tenant payment for the family is less than the gross rent, such that the unit will be eligible for a monthly HAP.


(3) The protections for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, apply to admission to the project-based program.


(4) A PHA may not approve a tenancy if the owner (including a principal or other interested party) of a unit is the parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, sister, or brother of any member of the family, unless the PHA determines that approving the unit would provide reasonable accommodation under Section 504, the Fair Housing Act, or the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), for a household member who is a person with disabilities.


(b) *Protection of in-place families.* (1) To minimize displacement of in-place families, if an in-place family is determined to be eligible prior to placement of the family's unit on the HAP contract, the in-place family must be placed on the PBV waiting list (if the family is not already on the list) and given an absolute selection preference. If the PHA's waiting list for PBV assistance is not a project-specific waiting list, the PHA must refer the family to the applicable project owner for an appropriate-size PBV unit in the specific project.


(2) If the in-place family is a tenant-based voucher participant, program eligibility is not re-determined. However, the PHA must determine that the total tenant payment for the family is less than the gross rent for the unit, such that the unit will be eligible for a monthly HAP, and the PHA may deny or terminate assistance for the grounds specified in 24 CFR 982.552 and 982.553.


(3)(i) During the initial term of the lease under the tenant-based tenancy, an in-place tenant-based voucher family may agree, but is not required, to mutually terminate the lease with the owner and enter into a lease and tenancy under the PBV program. If the family chooses to continue the tenant-based assisted tenancy, the unit may not be added to the PBV HAP contract. The owner may not terminate the lease for other good cause during the initial term unless the owner is terminating the tenancy because of something the family did or failed to do in accordance with 24 CFR 982.310(d)(2). The owner is expressly prohibited from terminating the tenancy during the initial term of the lease based on the family's failure to accept the offer of a new lease or revision, or for a business or economic reason.


(ii) If, after the initial term, the owner chooses not to renew the lease or terminates the lease for other good cause (as defined in 24 CFR 982.310(d)) to end the tenant-based assisted tenancy, the family would be required to move with continued tenant-based assistance or relinquish the tenant-based voucher and enter into a new lease to receive PBV assistance in order to remain in the unit.


(4) Admission of in-place families is not subject to income-targeting under 24 CFR 982.201(b)(2)(i).


(c) *Selection from waiting list.* (1) Applicants who will occupy PBV units must be selected from the waiting list for the PBV program.


(2) The PHA must identify in the Administrative Plan which of the following options it will use to structure the waiting list for the PBV program:


(i) The PHA may use a separate, central, waiting list comprised of more than one, or all, PBV projects;


(ii) The PHA may use the same waiting list for both tenant-based assistance and some or all PBV projects; or


(iii) The PHA may use separate waiting lists for PBV units in individual projects or buildings (or for sets of such units). This option may be used in combination with the option in paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section. The PHA must specify the name of the PBV project in the Administrative Plan. The PHA may permit the owner to maintain such waiting lists (see paragraph (c)(7) of this section for more information).


(3) For any of the options under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the PHA may establish in its Administrative Plan any preferences for occupancy of particular units including the name of the project(s) and the specific preferences that are to be used by project. Criteria for occupancy of units (*e.g.,* elderly families) may also be established; however, selection of families must be done through an admissions preference.


(4) The PHA may merge the waiting list for PBV assistance with the PHA waiting list for admission to another assisted housing program.


(5) Where applicable, the PHA may place families referred by the PBV owner on its PBV waiting list.


(6) If the PHA chooses to use a separate waiting list for admission to PBV units under paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (iii) of this section, the PHA must offer to place applicants who are listed on the waiting list for tenant-based assistance on the waiting list for PBV assistance (including owner-maintained PBV waiting lists).


(7) PHAs using separate waiting lists for individual projects or buildings, as described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, may establish in their Administrative Plan that owners will maintain such waiting lists. PHAs may choose to use owner-maintained PBV waiting lists for specific owners or projects. PHAs may permit an owner to maintain a single waiting list across multiple projects owned by the owner. Under an owner-maintained waiting list, the owner is responsible for carrying out responsibilities including, but not limited to, processing changes in applicant information, removing an applicant's name from the waiting list, opening and closing the waiting list. PHAs must identify in their Administrative Plans the name of the project(s), the oversight procedures the PHA will use to ensure owner-maintained waiting lists are administered properly and in accordance with program requirements, and the approval process of an owner's waiting list policy (including any preferences). Where a PHA allows for owner-maintained waiting lists, all the following apply:


(i) The owner must develop and submit a written owner waiting list policy to the PHA for approval. The owner waiting list policy must include policies and procedures concerning waiting list management and selection of applicants from the project's waiting list, including any admission preferences, procedures for removing applicant names from the waiting list, and procedures for closing and reopening the waiting list. The owner must receive approval from the PHA of its owner waiting list policy in accordance with the process established in the PHA's Administrative Plan. The owner's waiting list policy must be incorporated in the PHA's Administrative Plan.


(ii) The owner must receive approval from the PHA for any preferences that will be applicable to the project. The PHA will approve such preferences as part of its approval of the owner's waiting list policy. Each project may have a different set of preferences. Preferences must be consistent with the PHA Plan and listed in the owner's waiting list policy.


(iii) The owner is responsible for opening and closing the waiting list, including providing public notice when the owner opens the waiting list in accordance with 24 CFR 982.206. If the owner-maintained waiting list is open and additional applicants are needed to fill vacant units, the owner must give public notice in accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR 982.206 and the owner waiting list policy.


(iv) The applicant may apply directly at the project, or the applicant may request that the PHA refer the applicant to the owner for placement on the project's waiting list. The PHA must disclose to the applicant all the PBV projects available to the applicant, including the projects' contact information and other basic information about the project.


(v) Applicants already on the PHA's waiting list must be permitted to place their names on the project's waiting lists.


(vi) At the discretion of the PHA, the owner may make preliminary eligibility determinations for purposes of placing the family on the waiting list, and preference eligibility determinations. The PHA may choose to make this determination rather than delegating it to the owner.


(vii) If the PHA delegated the preliminary eligibility and preference determinations to the owner, the owner is responsible for notifying the family of the owner's determination not to place the applicant on the waiting list and a determination that the family is not eligible for a preference. In such a case, the owner is responsible to provide the notice at 24 CFR 982.554(a) of this title. The PHA is then responsible for conducting the informal review.


(viii) Once an owner selects the family from the waiting list, the owner refers the family to the PHA who then determines the family's final program eligibility. The owner may not offer a unit to the family until the PHA determines that the family is eligible for the program.


(ix) All HCV waiting list administration requirements that apply to the PBV program (24 CFR part 982, subpart E, other than 24 CFR 982.201(e), 982.202(b)(2), and 982.204(d)) apply to owner-maintained waiting lists.


(x) The PHA is responsible for oversight of owner-maintained waiting lists to ensure that they are administered properly and in accordance with program requirements, including but not limited to nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements under the authorities cited at 24 CFR 5.105(a). The owner is responsible for maintaining complete and accurate records as described in 24 CFR 982.158. The owner must give the PHA, HUD, and the Comptroller General full and free access to its offices and records concerning waiting list management, as described in 24 CFR 982.158(c). HUD may undertake investigation to determine whether the PHA or owner is in violation of authorities and, if unable to reach a voluntary resolution to correct the violation, take an enforcement action against either the owner or the PHA, or both.


(8) Not less than 75 percent of the families admitted to a PHA's tenant-based and project-based voucher programs during the PHA fiscal year from the PHA waiting list shall be extremely low-income families. The income-targeting requirements at 24 CFR 982.201(b)(2) apply to the total of admissions to the PHA's project-based voucher program and tenant-based voucher program during the PHA fiscal year from the PHA waiting list (including owner-maintained PBV waiting lists) for such programs.


(9) Families who require particular accessibility features for persons with disabilities must be selected first to occupy PBV units with such accessibility features (see 24 CFR 8.26, 8.27, and 100.202). Also see § 983.260. The PHA shall have some mechanism for referring to accessible PBV units a family that includes a person with a mobility or sensory impairment.


(d) *Preference for services offered.* In selecting families, PHAs (or owners in the case of owner-maintained waiting lists) may give preference to families who qualify for voluntary services, including disability-specific services, offered at a particular project, consistent with the PHA Plan and Administrative Plan.


(1) The prohibition on granting preferences to persons with a specific disability at 24 CFR 982.207(b)(3) continues to apply.


(2) Families must not be required to accept the particular services offered at the project nor shall families be required to provide their own equivalent services if they decline the project's services.


(3) In advertising the project, the owner may advertise the project as offering services for a particular type of disability; however, the preference must be provided to all applicants who qualify for the voluntary services offered in conjunction with the assisted units.


(e) *Offer of PBV assistance or owner's rejection.* (1) If a family refuses the PHA's offer of PBV assistance or the owner rejects a family for admission to the owner's PBV units, the family's position on the PHA waiting list for tenant-based assistance is not affected regardless of the type of PBV waiting list used by the PHA.


(2) The impact (of a family's rejection of the offer or the owner's rejection of the family) on a family's position on the PBV waiting list will be determined as follows:


(i) If a central PBV waiting list is used, the PHA's Administrative Plan must address the number of offers a family may reject without good cause before the family is removed from the PBV waiting list and whether the owner's rejection will impact the family's place on the PBV waiting list.


(ii) If a project-specific PBV waiting list is used, the family's name is removed from the project's waiting list connected to the family's rejection of the offer without good cause or the owner's rejection of the family. The family's position on any other project-specific PBV waiting list is not affected.


(iii) The PHA must define “good cause” for purposes of paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section in its Administrative Plan. The PHA's definition of good cause must include, at minimum, that:


(A) The family determines the unit is not accessible to a household member with a disability or otherwise does not meet the member's disability-related needs;


(B) The unit has HQS deficiencies;


(C) The family is unable to accept the offer due to circumstances beyond the family's control (such as hospitalization, temporary economic hardship, or natural disaster); and


(D) The family determines the unit presents a health or safety risk to a household member who is or has been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in part 5, subpart L of this title.


(3) None of the following actions may be taken against an applicant solely because the applicant has applied for, received, or refused an offer of PBV assistance:


(i) Refuse to list the applicant on the PHA waiting list for tenant-based assistance or any other available PBV waiting list. However, the PHA (or owner in the case of owner-maintained waiting lists) is not required to open a closed waiting list to place the family on that waiting list.


(ii) Deny any admission preference for which the applicant is currently qualified.


(iii) Change the applicant's place on the waiting list based on preference, date, and time of application, or other factors affecting selection from the waiting list.


(iv) Remove the applicant from the waiting list for tenant-based voucher assistance.
