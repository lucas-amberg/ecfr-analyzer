# ยง 983.258   Continuation of housing assistance payments.

Housing assistance payments shall continue until the tenant rent equals the rent to owner. The cessation of housing assistance payments at such point will not affect the family's other rights under its lease, nor will such cessation preclude the resumption of payments as a result of later changes in income, rents, or other relevant circumstances if such changes occur within 180 days following the date of the last housing assistance payment by the PHA. After the 180-day period, the unit shall be removed from the HAP contract pursuant to ยง 983.211.
