(a) *Security deposit permitted.* The owner may collect a security deposit from the tenant.


(b) *Amount of security deposit.* The PHA must prohibit the owner from charging assisted tenants security deposits in excess of private market practice, or in excess of amounts charged by the owner to unassisted tenants.


(c) *Use of security deposit.* When the tenant moves out of the contract unit, the owner, subject to state and local law, may use the security deposit, including any interest on the deposit, in accordance with the lease, as reimbursement for any unpaid tenant rent, damages to the unit, or other amounts which the tenant owes under the lease.


(d) *Security deposit reimbursement to owner.* The owner must give the tenant a written list of all items charged against the security deposit and the amount of each item. After deducting the amount used to reimburse the owner, the owner must promptly refund the full amount of the balance to the tenant.


(e) *Insufficiency of security deposit.* If the security deposit is not sufficient to cover amounts the tenant owes under the lease, the owner may seek to collect the balance from the tenant.
