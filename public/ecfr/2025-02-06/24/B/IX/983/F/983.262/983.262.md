# § 983.262   Occupancy of units under the increased program cap and project cap excepted units.

(a) *General.* Pursuant to § 983.6(a), a PHA may commit project-based assistance to no more than 20 percent of its authorized voucher units at the time of commitment. There are certain units eligible for an increased program cap as described in § 983.6(d). Pursuant to § 983.54(a), the PHA may not select a proposal to provide PBV assistance or place units under an Agreement or a HAP contract in excess of the project cap. There are certain exceptions to the project cap as described in § 983.54(c). This section provides more detail on the occupancy requirements of both the excepted units from the project cap under § 983.54(c)(2) and units under the increased program cap under § 983.6(d).


(b) *Requirements applicable to both excepted units and units under an increased program cap.* (1) The unit must be occupied by a family who meets the applicable exception.


(2) The family must be selected from the waiting list for the PBV program through an admissions preference (see § 983.251).


(3) Once the family vacates the unit, the unit must be made available to and occupied by a family that meets the applicable exception.


(4) The PHA must specify in its Administrative Plan which of the options below the PHA will take if a unit is no longer qualified for its excepted status or the increased program cap:


(i) Substitute the unit for another unit if it is possible to do so in accordance with § 983.207(a), so that the overall number of excepted units or units under the increased program cap in the project is not reduced. A PHA may, in conjunction with such substitution, add the original unit to the HAP contract if it is possible to do so in accordance with § 983.207(b), including that such addition does not cause the PHA to exceed the program cap or become non-compliant with the project cap.


(ii) Remove the unit from the PBV HAP contract. In conjunction with the removal, the PHA may provide the family with tenant-based assistance, if the family is eligible for tenant-based assistance. The family and the owner may agree to use the tenant-based voucher in the unit; otherwise, the family must move from the unit with the tenant-based voucher. If the family later vacates the unit, the PHA may add the unit to the PBV HAP contract in accordance with § 983.207.


(iii) Change the unit's status under the project cap or program cap, as applicable, provided that the change does not cause the PHA to exceed the program cap or become non-compliant with the project cap.


(c) *Requirements for units under the increased program cap*—(1) *Homeless family.* A unit qualifies under the increased program cap at § 983.6(d)(1)(i) if the family meets the definition of homeless under Section 103 of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11302), included in 24 CFR 578.3, at the time the family first occupies the unit.


(2) *Veteran family.* A unit qualifies under the increased program cap at § 983.6(d)(1)(ii) if the family is comprised of or includes a veteran (a person who served in the active military, naval, air, or space service, and who was discharged or released therefrom) at the time the family first occupies the unit.


(3) *Supportive housing for persons with disabilities or elderly persons.* The following applies to the increased program cap category at § 983.6(d)(1)(iii):


(i) A disabled or elderly member of the family must be eligible for one or more of the supportive services at the time the family first occupies the unit. The member of the family may choose not to participate in the services.


(ii) The PHA must state in its Administrative Plan whether it will allow a family that initially qualified for supportive housing for persons with disabilities or elderly persons to continue to reside in a unit, where through circumstances beyond the control of the family (*e.g.,* death of the elderly family member or family member with a disability or long term or permanent hospitalization or nursing care), the elderly family member or family member with a disability no longer resides in the unit. In this case, the unit may continue to count under the increased program cap category for as long as the family resides in that unit. However, the requirements of § 983.260, concerning wrong-sized units, apply. If the PHA chooses not to exercise this discretion, the unit no longer counts under the increased program cap category and, if the family is not required to move from the unit as a result of § 983.260, the PHA may use one of the options described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.


(4) *Units for Family Unification Program (FUP) youth.* See paragraph (e) of this section for requirements relating to the increased program cap category at § 983.6(d)(2).


(d) *Requirements for project cap excepted units*—(1) *Elderly family.* A unit under the project cap exception category at § 983.54(c)(2)(i) must be occupied by an elderly family, as defined in 24 CFR 5.403. The PHA must state in its Administrative Plan whether it will allow a family that initially qualified for occupancy of an excepted unit based on elderly family status to continue to reside in a unit, where through circumstances beyond the control of the family (*e.g.,* death of the elderly family member or long term or permanent hospitalization or nursing care), the elderly family member no longer resides in the unit. In this case, the unit may continue to count as an excepted unit for as long as the family resides in that unit. However, the requirements of § 983.260, concerning wrong-sized units, apply. If the PHA chooses not to exercise this discretion, the unit is no longer considered excepted and, if the family is not required to move from the unit as a result of § 983.260, the PHA may use one of the options described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.


(2) *Disabled family.* The same provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section apply to units previously excepted based on disabled family status under a HAP contract in effect prior to April 18, 2017.


(3) *Supportive services.* The following applies under the project cap exception category at § 983.54(c)(2)(iii):


(i) A unit is excepted if any member of the family is eligible for one or more of the supportive services even if the family chooses not to participate in the services.


(ii) If any member of the family chooses to participate and successfully completes the supportive services, the unit continues to be excepted for as long as any member of the family resides in the unit, even if the members that continue to reside in the unit are ineligible during tenancy for all available supportive services.


(iii) The unit loses its excepted status only if the entire family becomes ineligible during the tenancy for all supportive services available to the family. This provision does not apply where any member of the family has successfully completed the supportive services under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.


(iv) A family cannot be terminated from the program or evicted from the unit because they become ineligible for all supportive services during the tenancy.


(4) *Units for FUP youth.* See paragraph (e) of this section for requirements relating to the increased project cap exception category at § 983.54(c)(2)(ii).


(e) *Requirements for units for FUP youth under the increased program cap and project cap exception.* The following applies under the project cap exception category at § 983.54(c)(2)(ii) and the increased program cap category at § 983.6(d)(2):


(1) A unit is excepted from the project cap or qualifies under the increased program cap, as applicable, if the unit is occupied by an eligible youth receiving FUP assistance.


(2) The youth must vacate the unit once the FUP assistance has expired. The unit loses its excepted status or no longer qualifies under the increased program cap, as applicable, if the youth does not move from the unit upon the expiration of the FUP assistance.
