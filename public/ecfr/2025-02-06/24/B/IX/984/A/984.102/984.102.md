# ยง 984.102   Program objectives.

The objective of the FSS program is to reduce the dependency of low-income families on welfare assistance and housing subsidies. Under the FSS program, HUD assisted families are provided opportunities for education, job training, counseling, and other forms of social service assistance, while living in assisted housing, so that they may obtain the education, employment, and business and social skills necessary to achieve self-sufficiency, as defined in ยง 984.103. The Department will evaluate the performance of a PHA's or owner's FSS program using a scoring system that measures criteria, such as graduation from the program, increased earned income, and program participation, as provided by HUD through a _Federal Register_ notice.
