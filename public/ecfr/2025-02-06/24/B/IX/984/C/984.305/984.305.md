# § 984.305   FSS escrow account.

(a) *Establishment of FSS escrow account*—(1) *General.* The PHA or owner shall deposit the FSS escrow account funds of all families participating in an FSS program into a single interest-bearing depository account. The PHA or owner must deposit the FSS escrow account funds in one or more of the HUD-approved investments. The depository account may be part of the PHA's or owner's overall accounts or a separate account, as long as it is in compliance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section. During the term of the CoP, the FSS escrow account credit amount shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section at each re-examination of income occurring after the effective date of the CoP. Such escrow credit amount must be deposited each month by the PHA or owner to each family's FSS escrow account within the PHA's or owner's depository account.


(2) *Accounting for FSS escrow account funds*—(i) *Accounting records.* The total of the combined FSS escrow account funds will be supported in the accounting records by a subsidiary ledger showing the balance applicable to each FSS family.


(ii) *Proration of investment income.* The investment income for funds in the FSS escrow account must be prorated and credited to each family's FSS escrow account based on the balance in each family's FSS escrow account at the end of the period for which the investment income is credited.


(iii) *Reduction of amounts due by FSS family.* If the FSS family has not paid the family contribution towards rent, or other amounts, if any, due under the public housing or Section 8-assisted lease, the balance in the family's FSS account shall be reduced by that amount (as determined by the owner or reported by the owner to the PHA in the Section 8(o) programs) at the time of final disbursement of FSS escrow funds in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. If the FSS family has been found to have under-reported income after the baseline annual earned income was set, the amount credited to the FSS escrow account will be based on the income amounts originally reported by the FSS family. If the FSS family is found to have under-reported income in the re-examination used to set the baseline, the escrow for the entire period of the CoP will be re-calculated using the correct income to set the baseline and then calculate subsequent escrow amounts.


(3) *Reporting on FSS escrow account.* Each PHA or owner will be required to make a report, at least once annually, to each FSS family on the status of the family's FSS escrow account. At a minimum, the report will include:


(i) The balance at the beginning of the reporting period;


(ii) The amount of the family's rent payment that was credited to the FSS escrow account, during the reporting period;


(iii) Any deductions made from the account at the time of final disbursement of FSS escrow funds (see paragraphs (a)(2)(iii) and (c) of this section) for amounts due the PHA or owner;


(iv) The amount of interest earned on the account during the year; and


(v) The total in the account at the end of the reporting period.


(b) *FSS credit*—(1) *Determining the family's baseline information.* When determining the family's baseline annual earned income and the baseline monthly rent amounts for purposes of computing the FSS escrow credit, the PHA or owner must use the amounts on the family's last income re-examination.


(2) *Computation of amount.* The FSS credit amount shall be the lower of:


(i) Thirty (30) percent of one-twelfth (
1/12) (*i.e.,* two and a half (2.5) percent) of the amount by which the family's current annual earned income exceeds the family's baseline annual earned income; or


(ii) The increase in the family's monthly rent. The increase in the family's monthly rent shall be the lower of:


(A) The amount by which the family's current monthly rent exceeds the family's baseline monthly rent;


(B) For HCV families, the difference between the baseline monthly rent and the current gross rent (*i.e.,* rent to owner plus any utility allowance) or the payment standard, whichever is lower; or


(C) For PBV, Mod Rehab, including Mod Rehab SRO, and PBRA families, the difference between the baseline monthly rent and the current gross rent (*i.e.,* rent to owner or contract rent, as applicable, plus any utility allowance).


(3) *Ineligibility for FSS credit.* FSS families who are not low-income families (*i.e.,* whose adjusted annual income exceeds eighty (80) percent of the area median income) shall not be entitled to any FSS credit.


(4) *Cessation of FSS credit.* The PHA or owner shall not make additional credits to the FSS family's FSS escrow account:


(i) When the FSS family has completed the CoP, as described in § 984.303(g);


(ii) When the CoP is terminated; or


(iii) During the time an HCV family is in the process of moving to a new unit, in accordance with HCV program requirements in part 982 of this title, and is not under a lease.


(c) *Disbursement of FSS escrow account funds*—(1) *General.* The amount in an FSS escrow account in excess of any amount owed to the PHA or owner by the FSS family, as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, shall be paid to the head of FSS family when the CoP has been completed as provided in § 984.303(g), and if, at the time of contract completion, the head of FSS family submits to the PHA or owner a certification, as defined in § 984.103, that to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, no member of the FSS family is a recipient of welfare assistance.


(2) *Disbursement before expiration of contract term.* (i) If the PHA or owner determines that the FSS family has fulfilled its obligations under the CoP before the expiration of the contract term, and the head of FSS family submits a certification that, to the best of his or her knowledge, no member of the FSS family is a recipient of welfare assistance, the amount in the family's FSS escrow account, in excess of any amount owed to the PHA or owner by the FSS family, as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, shall be paid to the head of FSS family.


(ii) If the PHA or owner determines that the FSS family has fulfilled certain interim goals established in the CoP and needs a portion of the FSS escrow account funds for purposes consistent with or in support of the CoP, such as completion of higher education (*i.e.,* college, graduate school), job training, or to meet start-up expenses involved in creation of a small business, the PHA or owner may, at the PHA's or owner's sole discretion, disburse a portion of the funds from the family's FSS escrow account to assist the family in paying those expenses. Unless the interim disbursement was made based on fraudulent information from the family, the family is not required to repay such interim disbursements if the family does not complete the CoP.


(3) *Disbursement in cases of termination of the CoP with disbursement of escrow.* The PHA or owner must disburse to the family its FSS escrow account funds in excess of any amount owed to the PHA or owner by the FSS family, as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, under circumstances in which HUD has determined good cause is warranted. HUD determines that there is good cause when a CoP is terminated in accordance with § 984.303(k). Therefore, if the CoP is terminated in accordance with § 984.303(k), the PHA or owner must disburse to the family its FSS escrow account funds in excess of any amount owed to the PHA or owner by the FSS family, as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, as of the effective date of the termination of the contract.


(4) *Verification of family certification.* Before disbursement of the FSS escrow account funds to the family, the PHA or owner may verify that the FSS family is no longer a recipient of welfare assistance by requesting copies of any documents which may indicate whether the family is receiving any welfare assistance and by contacting welfare agencies.


(d) *Succession of FSS escrow account.* If the head of FSS family ceases to reside with other family members in the public housing or the Section 8-assisted unit, the remaining members of the FSS family, after consultation with the PHA or owner, shall have the right to take over the CoP or designate another family member to receive the funds in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.


(e) *Use of FSS escrow account funds for homeownership.* An FSS family may use disbursed FSS escrow account funds, in accordance with § 984.305(c), after final disbursement for the purchase of a home, including the purchase of a home under one of HUD's homeownership programs, or other Federal, State, or local homeownership programs, unless such use is prohibited by the statute or regulations governing the particular homeownership program.


(f) *Forfeiture of FSS escrow account funds*—(1) *Conditions for forfeiture.* Amounts in the FSS escrow account shall be forfeited upon the occurrence of the following:


(i) The CoP is terminated, as provided in § 984.303(h); or,


(ii) The CoP is completed by the family, as provided in § 984.303(g), but the FSS family is receiving welfare assistance at the time the CoP term expires, including any extension thereof.


(2) *Treatment of forfeited FSS escrow account funds.* FSS escrow account funds forfeited by the FSS family must be used by the PHA or owner for the benefit of the FSS participants.


(i) Specifically, such funds may be used for the following eligible activities:


(A) Support for FSS participants in good standing, including, but not limited to, transportation, child care, training, testing fees, employment preparation costs, and other costs related to achieving obligations outlined in the CoP;
