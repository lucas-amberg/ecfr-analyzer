# ยง 985.1   Purpose and applicability.

(a) *Purpose.* The Section 8 Management Assessment Program (SEMAP) is designed to assess whether the Section 8 tenant-based assistance programs operate to help eligible families afford decent rental units at the correct subsidy cost. SEMAP also establishes a system for HUD to measure PHA performance in key Section 8 program areas and to assign performance ratings. SEMAP provides procedures for HUD to identify PHA management capabilities and deficiencies in order to target monitoring and program assistance more effectively. PHAs can use the SEMAP performance analysis to assess and improve their own program operations.






(b) *Applicability.* This rule applies to PHA administration of the tenant-based Section 8 rental program (part 982 of this chapter), the project-based voucher program (part 983 of this chapter) to the extent that PBV family and unit data are reported and measured under the stated HUD verification method, and enrollment levels and contributions to escrow accounts for Section 8 participants under the family self-sufficiency program (FSS) (part 984 of this chapter).


(c) *Small rural PHA assessments.* Subpart D of this part covers the HCV and PBV assessment for a small rural PHA as defined in ยง 902.101 of this chapter. Section 985.3 and subparts B and C of this part do not apply to small rural PHAs.
