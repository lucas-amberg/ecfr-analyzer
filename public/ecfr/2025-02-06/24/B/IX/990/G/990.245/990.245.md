(a) *Streamlined appeal.* This appeal would demonstrate that the application of a specific Operating Fund formula component has a blatant and objective flaw.


(b) *Appeal of formula income for economic hardship.* After a PHA's formula income has been frozen, the PHA can appeal to have its formula income adjusted to reflect a severe local economic hardship that is impacting the PHA's ability to maintain rental and other revenue.


(c) *Appeal for specific local conditions.* This appeal would be based on demonstrations that the model's predictions are not reliable because of specific local conditions. To be eligible, the affected PHA must demonstrate a variance of ten percent or greater in its PEL.


(d) *Appeal for changing market conditions.* A PHA may appeal to receive operating subsidy for vacant units due to changing market conditions, after a PHA has taken aggressive marketing and outreach measures to rent these units. For example, a PHA could appeal if it is located in an area experiencing population loss or economic dislocations that faces a lack of demand for housing in the foreseeable future.


(e) *Appeal to substitute actual project cost data.* A PHA may appeal its PEL if it can produce actual project cost data derived from actual asset management, as outlined in subpart H of this part, for a period of at least two years.
