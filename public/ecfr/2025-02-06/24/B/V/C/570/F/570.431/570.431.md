The plan must be completed and available before the application for assistance is submitted to HUD, and the applicant must certify that it is following the plan. The plan must set forth the applicant's policies and procedures for:


(1) Giving citizens timely notice of local meetings and reasonable and timely access to local meetings, information, and records relating to the grantee's proposed and actual use of CDBG funds including, but not limited to:


(i) The amount of CDBG funds expected to be made available for the coming year, including the grant and anticipated program income;


(ii) The range of activities that may be undertaken with those funds;


(iii) The estimated amount of those funds proposed to be used for activities that will benefit low- and moderate-income persons;


(iv) The proposed CDBG activities likely to result in displacement and the applicant's plans, consistent with the policies developed under ยง 570.606(b), for minimizing displacement of persons as a result of its proposed activities; and


(v) The types and levels of assistance the applicant plans to make available (or to require others to make available) to persons displaced by CDBG-funded activities, even if the applicant expects no displacement to occur;

The level and type of assistance to be provided is at the discretion of the applicant. The assistance need not include the provision of funds to the groups;


(3) Holding a minimum of two public hearings, for the purpose of obtaining citizens' views and formulating or responding to proposals and questions. Each public hearing must be conducted at a different stage of the CDBG program. Together, the hearings must address community development and housing needs, development of proposed activities and review of program performance. There must be reasonable notice of the hearings and the hearings must be held at times and accessible locations convenient to potential or actual beneficiaries, with reasonable accommodations including material in accessible formats for persons with disabilities. The applicant must specify in its plan how it will meet the requirement for hearings at times and locations convenient to potential or actual beneficiaries;


(4) Meeting the needs of non-English speaking residents in the case of public hearings where a significant number of non-English speaking residents can reasonably be expected to participate;
