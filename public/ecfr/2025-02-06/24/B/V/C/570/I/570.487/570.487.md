(a) *General.* Certain statutes are expressly made applicable to activities assisted under the Act by the Act itself, while other laws not referred to in the Act may be applicable to such activities by their own terms. Certain statutes or executive orders that may be applicable to activities assisted under the Act by their own terms are administered or enforced by governmental officials, departments or agencies other than HUD. Paragraphs (d) and (c) of this section contain two of the requirements expressly made applicable to CDBG activities by the Act itself.


(b) *Affirmatively furthering fair housing.* The Act requires the state to certify to HUD's satisfaction that it will affirmatively further fair housing pursuant to §§ 5.151 and 5.152 of this title. The Act also requires each unit of general local government to certify that it will affirmatively further fair housing.

(d) States shall comply with section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u) and the implementing regulations in 24 CFR part 75. Section 3 requires that employment and other economic opportunities arising in connection with housing rehabilitation, housing construction, or other public construction projects shall, to the greatest extent feasible, and consistent with existing Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, be given to low- and very low-income persons. 


(e) *Architectural Barriers Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act.* The Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157) requires certain Federal and Federally-funded buildings and other facilities to be designed, constructed, or altered in accordance with standards that ensure accessibility to, and use by, physically handicapped people. A building or facility designed, constructed, or altered with funds allocated or reallocated under this subpart after November 21, 1996 and that meets the definition of *residential structure* as defined in 24 CFR 40.2, or the definition of *building* as defined in 41 CFR 101-19.602(a), is subject to the requirements of the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 and shall comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards. For general type buildings, these standards are in appendix A to 41 CFR part 101-19.6. For residential structures, these standards are available from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, Disability Rights Division, Room 5240, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410; telephone (202) 708-2333 (voice) or (202) 708-1734 (TTY) (these are not toll-free numbers).
