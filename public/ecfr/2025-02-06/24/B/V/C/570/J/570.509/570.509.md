# § 570.509   Grant closeout procedures.

(a) *Criteria for closeout.* HUD may make grant closeout determinations for individual grants or multiple grants simultaneously. A grant will be closed out when HUD determines, in consultation with the recipient, that the following criteria have been met:


(1) All costs to be paid with CDBG funds from a given origin year's grant have been expended and drawn down, with the exception of closeout costs (e.g., audit costs) and costs resulting from contingent liabilities described in the closeout agreement pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. Contingent liabilities include, but are not limited to, third-party claims against the recipient, as well as related administrative costs.


(2) All activities for which funds were expended from the origin year grant are physically completed, are eligible, have met a national objective under § 570.208, and the grantee has reported on all accomplishments resulting from the activity.


(3) A final performance and expenditure report for completed activities has been submitted to HUD pursuant to 24 CFR 91.520, and HUD has determined the plan is satisfactory.


(4) All program income received by the grantee during the grantee program year associated with the origin year grant has been expended, or identified in a more recent program year's Action Plan, pursuant to 24 CFR 91.220(l).


(5) For origin year 2015 grants and subsequent grants, the grantee has expended no more than 20 percent of the origin year grant for planning and program administrative costs, under § 570.200(g)(1).


(6) Other responsibilities of the recipient under the grant agreement and applicable laws and regulations appear to have been carried out satisfactorily or there is no further Federal interest in keeping the grant agreement open for the purpose of securing performance.


(b) *Closeout actions.*

(1) Based on the information provided in the performance report and other relevant information, HUD, in consultation with the recipient, will prepare a closeout agreement in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.


(2) HUD will cancel any unused portion of the awarded grant, as shown in the signed grant closeout agreement. Any unused grant funds disbursed from the U.S. Treasury which are in the possession of the recipient shall be refunded to HUD. Any funds which have exceeded the statutory time limit on the use of funds will be recaptured by the U.S. Treasury pursuant to 24 CFR 570.200(k).


(3) Any costs paid with CDBG funds which were not audited previously shall be subject to coverage in the recipient's next single audit performed in accordance with HUD regulations implementing the Single Audit Act requirements at 2 CFR part 200. The recipient may be required to repay HUD any disallowed costs based on the results of the audit, or on additional HUD reviews provided for in the closeout agreement.


(c) *Closeout agreement.* Any obligations remaining as of the date of the closeout shall be covered by the terms of a closeout agreement. The agreement shall be prepared by the HUD field office in consultation with the recipient. The agreement shall identify the grant being closed out, and include provisions with respect to the following:


(1) Identification of any closeout costs or contingent liabilities subject to payment with CDBG funds after the closeout agreement is signed;


(2) Identification of any unused grant funds to be canceled by HUD;


(3) Description of the recipient's responsibility after closeout for:


(i) Compliance with all program requirements, certifications, and assurances in using any remaining CDBG funds available for closeout costs and contingent liabilities;


(ii) Use of real property assisted with CDBG funds in accordance with the principles described in §§ 570.503(b)(7) and 570.505;


(iii) Compliance with requirements governing future program income or receivables generated from activities funded from the origin year grant, as described in § 570.504(b)(4) and (5);


(iv) Ensuring that flood insurance coverage for affected property owners is maintained for the mandatory period; and


(4) Other provisions appropriate to any special circumstances of the grant closeout, in modification of or in addition to the obligations in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section. The agreement shall authorize monitoring by HUD, and shall provide that findings of noncompliance may be taken into account by HUD, as unsatisfactory performance of the recipient, in the consideration of any future grant award under this part.


(d) *Status of consolidated plan after closeout.* Unless otherwise provided in a closeout agreement, the Consolidated Plan will remain in effect after closeout until the expiration of the program year covered by the last approved consolidated plan.


(e) *Termination of grant for convenience.* Grant assistance provided under this part may be terminated for convenience in whole or in part before the completion of the assisted activities, in accordance with the provisions of 2 CFR 200.339. The recipient shall not incur new obligations for the terminated portions after the effective date, and shall cancel as many outstanding obligations as possible. HUD shall allow full credit to the recipient for those portions of obligations which could not be canceled and which had been properly incurred by the recipient in carrying out the activities before the termination. The closeout policies contained in this section shall apply in such cases, except where the approved grant is terminated in its entirety. Responsibility for the environmental review to be performed under 24 CFR part 50 or 24 CFR part 58, as applicable, shall be determined as part of the closeout process.


(f) *Termination for cause.* In cases in which the Secretary terminates the recipient's grant under the authority of subpart O of this part, or under the terms of the grant agreement, the closeout policies contained in this section shall apply, except where the approved grant is cancelled in its entirety. The provisions in 2 CFR 200.342) on the effects of termination shall also apply. HUD shall determine whether an environmental assessment or finding of inapplicability is required, and if such review is required, HUD shall perform it in accordance with 24 CFR part 50.
