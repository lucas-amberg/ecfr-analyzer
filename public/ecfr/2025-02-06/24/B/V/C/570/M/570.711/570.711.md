This section contains additional requirements and alternative application procedures for guarantees of debt obligations under section 108 of the Act pursuant to the additional authority provided in paragraph (a) of section 222 of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2009, Public Law 111-8; 123 Stat. 524 at 976 (Division I of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009) (“section 222” and the “2009 Appropriations Act”). If any other federal law or laws are enacted after March 11, 2009, the effect of which with respect to loan guarantee authority provided in an appropriations act is equivalent to the effect of section 222 with respect to the loan guarantee authority provided in the 2009 Appropriations Act, the additional requirements and alternative application procedures in this section shall also apply to guarantees of debt obligations under section 108 of the act, pursuant to the additional authority provided in such other federal law or laws.


(a) *Applications by States.* Notwithstanding § 570.702 and § 570.704, states that administer the CDBG program (under subpart I of this part) may apply for loan guarantee assistance under this subpart, and such application shall consist of the following:


(1) A copy of the State's CDBG method of distribution in the action plan most recently submitted or amended pursuant to 24 CFR part 91. In addition to the requirements of 24 CFR part 91, such method of distribution must note the approximate amount of section 108 guaranteed obligations issued by the State and all nonentitlement public entities that are outstanding at the time of such submission or amendment, identify the maximum amount of guaranteed loan funds for which the State will apply during the period covered by the action plan, describe the pledge of grants required under § 570.705(b)(2), and identify the nonentitlement public entities in the State that may be assisted with such guaranteed loan funds (to satisfy this requirement, the method of distribution may identify one or more specific nonentitlement public entities that may be assisted, or may indicate that all or a specified subset of the nonentitlement public entities in the State may be assisted and describe how applications will be selected for assistance).


(2) Either:


(i) A description of each activity to be carried out with the guaranteed loan funds, including the specific provision of § 570.703 under which the activity is eligible and how the activity meets one of the criteria in § 570.208; or


(ii) An indication of the type or types of activities to be assisted, the provisions of § 570.703 under which such activities are eligible, and the criteria in § 570.208 intended to be met, in which case HUD shall require that the description referred to in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section be submitted to and approved by HUD before the State disburses guaranteed loan funds to a public entity for the activity.


(3) A schedule for repayment of the loan which identifies the sources of repayment.


(b) *Distribution to Local Governments.* Proceeds payable to a State from the issuance of debt obligations under this subpart may be used only for:


(1) Loans and grants to the nonentitlement public entities identified in the State's approved application for activities eligible under § 570.703; and


(2) The uses specified in paragraphs (c), (g), and (k) of § 570.703.


(c) *Certification of need.* Prior to approving a nonentitlement public entity's application for assistance, the State shall obtain a certification from such public entity conforming to § 570.704(b)(4).


(d) *Local government citizen participation requirements.* The presubmission and citizen participation requirements in § 570.704(a) and the third sentence of § 570.704(c)(5) shall not apply with respect to nonentitlement public entities' applications to a State for assistance under this section. Nonentitlement public entities shall comply with the provisions of § 570.486(a) with respect to such applications and such assistance.


(e) *Environmental review; displacement, relocation, acquisition, and replacement of housing.* Nonentitlement public entities assisted by a State under this section shall comply with § 570.704(d) and (e).
