# § 570.904   Equal opportunity and fair housing review criteria.

(a) *General.* (1) Where the criteria in this section are met, the Department will presume that the recipient has carried out its CDBG-funded program in accordance with civil rights certifications and civil rights requirements of the Act relating to equal employment opportunity, equal opportunity in services, benefits and participation, and is affirmatively furthering fair housing unless:


(i) There is evidence which shows, or from which it is reasonable to infer, that the recipient, motivated by considerations of race, color, religion where applicable, sex, national origin, age or handicap, has treated some persons less favorably than others, or


(ii) There is evidence that a policy, practice, standard or method of administration, although neutral on its face, operates to deny or affect adversely in a significantly disparate way the provision of employment or services, benefits or participation to persons of a particular race, color, religion where applicable, sex, national origin, age or handicap, or fair housing to persons of a particular race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, or


(iii) Where the Secretary required a further assurance pursuant to § 570.304 in order to accept the recipient's prior civil rights certification, the recipient has failed to meet any such assurance. 


(2) In such instances, or where the review criteria in this section are not met, the recipient will be afforded an opportunity to present evidence that it has not failed to carry out the civil rights certifications and fair housing requirements of the Act. The Secretary's determination of whether there has been compliance with the applicable requirements will be made based on a review of the recipient's performance, evidence submitted by the recipient, and all other available evidence. The Department may also initiate separate compliance reviews under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or section 109 of the Act.


(b) *Review for equal opportunity.* Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d *et seq.*), and implementing regulations in 24 CFR part 1, together with section 109 of the Act (see § 570.602), prohibit discrimination in any program or activity funded in whole or in part with funds made available under this part. 


(1) *Review for equal employment opportunity.* The Department will presume that a recipient's hiring and employment practices have been carried out in compliance with its equal opportunity certifications and requirements of the Act. This presumption may be rebutted where, based on the totality of circumstances, there has been a deprivation of employment, promotion, or training opportunities by a recipient to any person within the meaning of section 109. The extent to which persons of a particular race, gender, or ethnic background are represented in the workforce may in certain circumstances be considered, together with complaints, performance reviews, and other information.


(2) *Review of equal opportunity in services, benefits and participation.* The Department will presume a recipient is carrying out its programs and activities in accordance with the civil rights certifications and requirements of the Act. This presumption may be rebutted where, based on the totality of circumstances, there has been a deprivation of services, benefits, or participation in any program or activity funded in whole or in part with block grant funds by a recipient to any person within the meaning of section 109. The extent to which persons of a particular race, gender, or ethnic background participate in a program or activity may in certain circumstances be considered, together with complaints, performance reviews, and other information. 


(c) *Review for fair housing*—(1) *General.* See the requirements in the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-20), as well as § 570.601(a).


(2) *Affirmatively furthering fair housing.* HUD will review a recipient's performance to determine if it has administered all programs and activities related to housing and urban development in accordance with § 570.601(a)(2), which sets forth the grantee's responsibility to affirmatively further fair housing.


(d) *Actions to use minority and women's business firms.* The Department will review a recipient's performance to determine if it has administered its activities funded with assistance under this part in a manner to encourage use of minority and women's business enterprises described in Executive Orders 11625, 12432 and 12138, and 2 CFR 200.321. In making this review, the Department will determine if the grantee has taken actions required under 2 CFR 200.321, and will review the effectiveness of those actions in accomplishing the objectives of 2 CFR 200.321 and the Executive Orders. No recipient is required by this part to attain or maintain any particular statistical level of participation in its contracting activities by race, ethnicity, or gender of the contractor's owners or managers.
