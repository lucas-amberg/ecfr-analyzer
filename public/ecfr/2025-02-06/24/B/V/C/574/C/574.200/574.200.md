# ยง 574.200   Amounts available for competitive grants.

(a) The Department will set aside 10 percent of the amounts appropriated under this program to fund on a competitive basis:


(1) Special projects of national significance; and


(2) Other projects submitted by States and localities that do not qualify for formula grants.


(b) Any competitively awarded funds that become available as a result of deobligations or the imposition of sanctions, as provided in ยง 574.540, will be added to the funds available for competitive grants in the next fiscal year.


(c) The competitive grants are awarded based on applications, as described in subpart C of this part, submitted in response to a Notice of Funding Availability published in the _Federal Register._ All States and units of general local government and nonprofit organizations are eligible to apply for competitive grants to fund projects of national significance. Only those States and units of general local government that do not qualify for formula allocations are eligible to apply for competitive grants to fund other projects. 


(d) If HUD makes a procedural error in a funding competition that, when corrected, would warrant funding of an otherwise eligible application, HUD will select that application for potential funding when sufficient funds become available.
