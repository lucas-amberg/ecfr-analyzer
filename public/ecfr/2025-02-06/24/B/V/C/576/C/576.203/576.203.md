# ยง 576.203   Obligation, expenditure, and payment requirements.

(a) *Obligation of funds.* (1) *Funds allocated to States.* (i) Within 60 days from the date that HUD signs the grant agreement with the State (or grant amendment for reallocated funds), the recipient must obligate the entire grant, except the amount for its administrative costs. This requirement is met by a subgrant agreement with, or a letter of award requiring payment from the grant to, a subrecipient.


(ii) Within 120 days after the date that the State obligates its funds to a unit of general purpose local government, the subrecipient must obligate all of those funds by a subgrant agreement with, or a letter of award requiring payment to, a private nonprofit organization; a procurement contract; or the written designation of a department within the government of the subrecipient to directly carry out an eligible activity.


(2) *Funds allocated to metropolitan cities, urban counties, and territories.* Within 180 days after the date that HUD signs the grant agreement (or a grant amendment for reallocation of funds) with the metropolitan city, urban county, or territory, the recipient must obligate all the grant amount, except the amount for its administrative costs. This requirement is met by an agreement with, or a letter of award requiring payment to, a subrecipient; a procurement contract; or a written designation of a department within the government of the recipient to directly carry out an eligible activity. If the recipient is an urban county, this requirement may also be met with an agreement with, or letter of award requiring payment to, a member government, which has designated a department to directly carry out an eligible activity.


(b) *Expenditures.* The recipient must draw down and expend funds from each year's grant not less than once during each quarter of the recipient's program year. All of the recipient's grant must be expended for eligible activity costs within 24 months after the date HUD signs the grant agreement with the recipient. For the purposes of this paragraph, expenditure means either an actual cash disbursement for a direct charge for a good or service or an indirect cost or the accrual of a direct charge for a good or service or an indirect cost.


(c) *Payments to subrecipients.* The recipient must pay each subrecipient for allowable costs within 30 days after receiving the subrecipient's complete payment request. This requirement also applies to each subrecipient that is a unit of general purpose local government.
