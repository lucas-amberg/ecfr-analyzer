# § 576.302   States.

Grant funds returned by a State will be reallocated as follows:


(a) *Eligible recipients.* HUD will make the funds available:


(1) To metropolitan cities and urban counties in the State that were not allocated funds under § 576.3 because the amount they would have been allocated did not meet the minimum requirement under § 576.3(b)(2);


(2) If funds remain, to county governments in the State other than urban counties;


(3) Then, if funds remain, to metropolitan cities and urban counties in the State that were allocated funds under § 576.3.


(b) *Notification of availability.* HUD will notify eligible recipients of the availability of the funds by a notification letter or _Federal Register_ notice, which will specify how the awards of funds will be made.


(c) *Application requirements.* Within 45 days after the date of notification, the eligible recipient must submit to HUD:


(1) A substantial amendment to its approved consolidated plan in accordance with 24 CFR part 91; or


(2) If the eligible recipient does not have an approved consolidated plan, an abbreviated consolidated plan that meets the requirements in the _Federal Register_ notice or notification letter from HUD.


(d) *Restrictions that apply to reallocated amounts.* The same requirements that apply to grant funds allocated under § 576.3 apply to grant funds reallocated under this section.
