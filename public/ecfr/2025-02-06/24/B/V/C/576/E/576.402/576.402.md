# ยง 576.402   Terminating assistance.

(a) *In general.* If a program participant violates program requirements, the recipient or subrecipient may terminate the assistance in accordance with a formal process established by the recipient or subrecipient that recognizes the rights of individuals affected. The recipient or subrecipient must exercise judgment and examine all extenuating circumstances in determining when violations warrant termination so that a program participant's assistance is terminated only in the most severe cases.


(b) *Program participants receiving rental assistance or housing relocation and stabilization services.* To terminate rental assistance or housing relocation and stabilization services to a program participant, the required formal process, at a minimum, must consist of:


(1) Written notice to the program participant containing a clear statement of the reasons for termination;


(2) A review of the decision, in which the program participant is given the opportunity to present written or oral objections before a person other than the person (or a subordinate of that person) who made or approved the termination decision; and


(3) Prompt written notice of the final decision to the program participant.


(c) *Ability to provide further assistance.* Termination under this section does not bar the recipient or subrecipient from providing further assistance at a later date to the same family or individual.
