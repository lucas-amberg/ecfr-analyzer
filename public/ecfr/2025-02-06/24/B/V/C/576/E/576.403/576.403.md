# § 576.403   Shelter and housing standards.

(a) *Lead-based paint remediation and disclosure.* The Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821-4846), the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 4851-4856), and implementing regulations in 24 CFR part 35, subparts A, B, H, J, K, M, and R apply to all shelters assisted under ESG program and all housing occupied by program participants.


(b) *Minimum standards for emergency shelters.* Any building for which Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) funds are used for conversion, major rehabilitation, or other renovation, must meet state or local government safety and sanitation standards, as applicable, and the following minimum safety, sanitation, and privacy standards. Any emergency shelter that receives assistance for shelter operations must also meet the following minimum safety, sanitation, and privacy standards. The recipient may also establish standards that exceed or add to these minimum standards.


(1) *Structure and materials.* The shelter building must be structurally sound to protect residents from the elements and not pose any threat to health and safety of the residents. Any renovation (including major rehabilitation and conversion) carried out with ESG assistance must use Energy Star and WaterSense products and appliances.


(2) *Access.* The shelter must be accessible in accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8; the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 *et seq.*) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 100; and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12131 *et seq.*) and 28 CFR part 35; where applicable.


(3) *Space and security.* Except where the shelter is intended for day use only, the shelter must provide each program participant in the shelter with an acceptable place to sleep and adequate space and security for themselves and their belongings.


(4) *Interior air quality.* Each room or space within the shelter must have a natural or mechanical means of ventilation. The interior air must be free of pollutants at a level that might threaten or harm the health of residents.


(5) *Water supply.* The shelter's water supply must be free of contamination.


(6) *Sanitary facilities.* Each program participant in the shelter must have access to sanitary facilities that are in proper operating condition, are private, and are adequate for personal cleanliness and the disposal of human waste.


(7) *Thermal environment.* The shelter must have any necessary heating/cooling facilities in proper operating condition.


(8) *Illumination and electricity.* The shelter must have adequate natural or artificial illumination to permit normal indoor activities and support health and safety. There must be sufficient electrical sources to permit the safe use of electrical appliances in the shelter.


(9) *Food preparation.* Food preparation areas, if any, must contain suitable space and equipment to store, prepare, and serve food in a safe and sanitary manner.


(10) *Sanitary conditions.* The shelter must be maintained in a sanitary condition.


(11) *Fire safety.* There must be at least one working smoke detector in each occupied unit of the shelter. Where possible, smoke detectors must be located near sleeping areas. The fire alarm system must be designed for hearing-impaired residents. All public areas of the shelter must have at least one working smoke detector. There must also be a second means of exiting the building in the event of fire or other emergency.


(c) *Minimum standards for permanent housing.* When ESG funds are used for permanent housing under 24 CFR 576.105 or 576.106, the minimum standards in 24 CFR 5.703 apply, except that:


(1) *Definition of HUD housing.* For the purposes of ESG, “HUD housing” in 24 CFR 5.703 means the program participant's unit, systems equipment that directly services those units, items and components within the primary and secondary means of egress from those units' doors to the public way, and common features related to the program participant's use of the building (e.g., the laundry room, community room, mail room).


(2) *Housing inspections.* For the first 30 days in which a program participant receives homelessness prevention assistance, the recipient or subrecipient may provide services under 24 CFR 576.105(b) to help the program participant remain in their unit without inspecting the unit to determine whether it meets the minimum standards identified in this paragraph (c), except that the recipient or subrecipient must still comply with the requirements under 24 CFR part 35. Before otherwise using ESG funds under 24 CFR 576.105 or 576.106 to help a program participant remain in or move into specific housing, however, the recipient or subrecipient must inspect that housing to confirm that it meets the requirements in this section. In addition, recipient or subrecipient must inspect the housing at least once every 12 months during the period of assistance to confirm the housing continues to meet the minimum standards in this paragraph (c).


(3) *Correction of deficiencies.* If an inspection reveals one or more deficiencies that prevent the housing from meeting the requirements in this section, ESG funds must not be used under 24 CFR 576.105 or 576.106 with respect to that housing unless the owner corrects the deficiencies within 30 days from the date of the initial inspection and the recipient or subrecipient verifies that all deficiencies have been corrected.


(4) *Rental arrears.* Housing for which rental arrears are paid is only subject to the requirements in this section, if a program participant is seeking to stay in that housing.


(5) *Additional standards.* The recipient may also add standards that exceed these minimum standards.


(6) *Other exemptions from 24 CFR part 5, subpart G.* The requirements in 24 CFR 5.703(b)(2) and (d)(6) and 5.705 through 5.713 do not apply.
