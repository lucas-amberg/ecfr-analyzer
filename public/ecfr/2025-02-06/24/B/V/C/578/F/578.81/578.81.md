# ยง 578.81   Term of commitment, repayment of grants, and prevention of undue benefits.

(a) *In general.* All recipients and subrecipients receiving grant funds for acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction must operate the housing or provide supportive services in accordance with this part, for at least 15 years from the date of initial occupancy or date of initial service provision. Recipient and subrecipients must execute and record a HUD-approved Declaration of Restrictive Covenants before receiving payment of grant funds.


(b) *Conversion.* Recipients and subrecipients carrying out a project that provides transitional or permanent housing or supportive services in a structure may submit a request to HUD to convert a project for the direct benefit of very low-income persons. The request must be made while the project is operating as homeless housing or supportive services for homeless individuals and families, must be in writing, and must include an explanation of why the project is no longer needed to provide transitional or permanent housing or supportive services. The primary factor in HUD's decision on the proposed conversion is the unmet need for transitional or permanent housing or supportive services in the Continuum of Care's geographic area.


(c) *Repayment of grant funds.* If a project is not operated as transitional or permanent housing for 10 years following the date of initial occupancy, HUD will require repayment of the entire amount of the grant used for acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction, unless conversion of the project has been authorized under paragraph (b) of this section. If the housing is used for such purposes for more than 10 years, the payment amount will be reduced by 20 percentage points for each year, beyond the 10-year period in which the project is used for transitional or permanent housing.


(d) *Prevention of undue benefits.* Except as provided under paragraph (e) of this section, upon any sale or other disposition of a project site that received grant funds for acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction, occurring before the 15-year period, the recipient must comply with such terms and conditions as HUD may prescribe to prevent the recipient or subrecipient from unduly benefiting from such sale or disposition.


(e) *Exception.* A recipient or subrecipient will not be required to comply with the terms and conditions prescribed under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section if:


(1) The sale or disposition of the property used for the project results in the use of the property for the direct benefit of very low-income persons;


(2) All the proceeds are used to provide transitional or permanent housing that meet the requirements of this part;


(3) Project-based rental assistance or operating cost assistance from any federal program or an equivalent State or local program is no longer made available and the project is meeting applicable performance standards, provided that the portion of the project that had benefitted from such assistance continues to meet the tenant income and rent restrictions for low-income units under section 42(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or


(4) There are no individuals and families in the Continuum of Care geographic area who are homeless, in which case the project may serve individuals and families at risk of homelessness.
