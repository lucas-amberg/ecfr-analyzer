(a) *General.* HUD will provide grants to pay (as described in ยง 583.130 of this part) for the actual costs of leasing a structure or structures, or portions thereof, used to provide supportive housing or supportive services for up to five years.


(b)(1) *Leasing structures.* Where grants are used to pay rent for all or part of structures, the rent paid must be reasonable in relation to rents being charged in the area for comparable space. In addition, the rent paid may not exceed rents currently being charged by the same owner for comparable space.


(2) *Leasing individual units.* Where grants are used to pay rent for individual housing units, the rent paid must be reasonable in relation to rents being charged for comparable units, taking into account the location, size, type, quality, amenities, facilities, and management services. In addition, the rents may not exceed rents currently being charged by the same owner for comparable unassisted units, and the portion of rents paid with grant funds may not exceed HUD-determined fair market rents. Recipients may use grant funds in an amount up to one month's rent to pay the non-recipient landlord for any damages to leased units by homeless participants.
