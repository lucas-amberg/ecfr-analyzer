# ยง 594.23   Approval and certification procedures.

(a) *Approval of application.* HUD's acceptance of an application for review does not imply a commitment to provide funding. HUD will provide notification of whether a project will be funded in accordance with the criteria and procedures set out in the applicable NOFA. 


(b) *Certifications.* In the absence of independent evidence that tends to challenge in a substantial manner the certifications made by the applicant pursuant to ยง 594.30, the required certifications will be accepted by HUD. 


However, if independent evidence is available that tends to challenge in a substantial manner an applicant's certification, HUD may require further information or assurances to be submitted in order to determine whether the applicant's certification is satisfactory.
