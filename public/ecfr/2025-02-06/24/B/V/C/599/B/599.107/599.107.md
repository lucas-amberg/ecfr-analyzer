# § 599.107   Required State and local commitments.

(a) *Commitment to a course of action*—(1) *Agreement of State and local governments.* The nominating State and local governments must agree in writing that, for any period during which the area is a Renewal Community, the governments will follow a specified course of action which meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section. If each nominating State and local government is a signatory to a course of action under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a separate written agreement is not necessary to meet the requirements of this paragraph. 


(2) *Course of action requirements*—(i) *In general.* A course of action is a written document, signed by the nominated area's State and/or local governments and community-based organizations which commits each signatory to undertake and achieve measurable goals and actions within the nominated area upon its designation as a Renewal Community. 


(ii) *Community-based organizations.* For purposes of the course of action, “community-based organizations” includes for-profit and non-profit private entities, businesses and business organizations, neighborhood organizations, and community groups. Community-based organizations are not required to be located in the nominated area as long as they commit to achieving the goals of the course of action in the Renewal Community. 


(iii) *Timetable.* The course of action must include a timetable that identifies the significant steps and target dates for implementing the goals and actions. 


(iv) *Performance measures.* The course of action must include a description of how the performance of the course of action will be measured and evaluated. 


(v) *Required goals and actions.* The course of action must include at least four of the following: 


(A) A reduction of tax rates or fees applying within the Renewal Community; 


(B) An increase in the level of efficiency of local services within the Renewal Community, such as services for residents funded through the Federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and related Federal programs including, for example, job support services, child care and after school care for children of working residents, employment training, transportation services and other services that help residents become economically self-sufficient; 


(C) Crime reduction strategies, such as crime prevention, including the provision of crime prevention services by nongovernmental entities; 


(D) Actions to reduce, remove, simplify, or streamline governmental requirements applying within the Renewal Community, such as: 


(*1*) *Density bonus.* Permission to develop or redevelop real property at a higher density level than otherwise permitted under the zoning ordinance, e.g., increased height or increased number of residential or business units; 


(*2*) *Incentive zoning.* Providing a density bonus or other real property-related incentive for the development, redevelopment, or preservation of a parcel in the designated area; 


(*3*) *Comprehensive or one-stop permit.* Streamlining construction or other development permitting processes, rather than requiring multiple applications for multiple permits, e.g., for demolition, site preparation, and construction, the developer or redeveloper submits a single application that is circulated for the necessary reviews by the various planning, engineering, and other departments in the county or municipality; 


(*4*) *Variance and exception policies.* Counties or municipalities may pass ordinancesthat permit variances to or exceptions from certain zoning or other land use limitations. Examples include a reduced building set-back requirement or a reduced requirement for the provision of parking. Thepolicy may be limited to a particular geographic area; 


(*5*) *Voluntary environmental compliance program.* A shared or limited environmental liability program, with limited liability from certain legal or administrative action in exchange for undertaking an approved program of environmental investigation, hazard control, and on-going risk reduction activities. Typically, the liability limitation is for future environmental cleanup (and not against lawsuit for damages). Risk of cleanup may be shared by the developer or property owner and the government; 


(E) Involvement in economic development activities by private entities, organizations, neighborhood organizations, and community groups, particularly those in the Renewal Community, including a commitment from such private entities to provide jobs and job training for, and technical, financial, or other assistance to, employers, employees, and residents from the Renewal Community; 


(F) The gift or sale at below fair market value of surplus real property held by State or local governments, such as land, homes, and commercial or industrial structures in the Renewal Community to neighborhood organizations, community development corporations, or private companies.


(3) *Certification requirement for crime incidence.* If preference points are being sought for the nominated area because it qualifies for preference points in accordance with § 599.303(c)(1), the course of action must contain a certification by each nominating State and local government of the 1999 Local Crime Index rate per 100,000 inhabitants (LCI) determined for the nominated area. The offenses used in determining the LCI are the violent crimes of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, and the property crimes of burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft.


(b) *Economic growth promotion requirements*—(1) *Required certification.* The State and local governments in which a nominated area is located must certify in writing that they have repealed or reduced, will not enforce, or will reduce within the nominated area at least four of the following: 


(i) Licensing requirements for occupations that do not ordinarily require a professional degree; 


(ii) Zoning restrictions on home-based businesses which do not create a public nuisance; 


(iii) Permit requirements for street vendors who do not create a public nuisance; 


(iv) Zoning or other restrictions that impede the formation of schools or child care centers; and 


(v) Franchises or other restrictions on competition for businesses providing public services, including taxicabs, jitneys, cable television, or trash hauling. 


(2) *Exception.* The requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section do not apply to the extent that a regulation of businesses and occupations is necessary for and well-tailored to the protection of health and safety. The certifications required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be limited to exclude or include specific businesses and occupations. 


(c) *Recognition of past efforts.* The course of action and economic growth requirements under paragraphs (a) and (b), respectively, of this section are not limited to future goals and actions. Past efforts within the previous eight years, either completed or on-going, of the nominating State or local governments to undertake any of the goals or actions listed in paragraph (a)(2)(v) or (b)(1) of this section qualify to meet these requirements. If past efforts are used, the nominating governments must identify which of the required goals and actions listed in paragraph (a)(2)(v) or (b)(1) of this section they address; the timetable for their continued implementation, if on-going; and the community-based organizations involved, if any.
