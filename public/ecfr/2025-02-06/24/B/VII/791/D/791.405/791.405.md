(a) The field office shall make every reasonable effort to use the budget authority made available for each allocation area within such area. If the Program Office Director determines that not all of the budget authority allocated for a particular allocation area is likely to be used during the fiscal year, the remaining authority may be allocated to other allocation areas where it is likely to be used during that fiscal year. 


(b) If the Assistant Secretary determines that not all of the budget authority allocated to a field office is likely to be used during the fiscal year, the remaining authority may be reallocated to another field office where it is likely to be used during that fiscal year. 


(c) Any reallocations of budget authority among allocation areas or field offices shall be consistent with the assignment of budget authority for the specific program type and established set-asides. 


(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, budget authority shall not be reallocated for use in another State unless the Program Office Director or the Assistant Secretary has determined that other allocation areas within the same State cannot use the available authority during the fiscal year.
