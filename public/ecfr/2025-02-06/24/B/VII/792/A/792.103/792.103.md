(1) That constitutes false statement, omission, or concealment of a substantive fact, made with intent to deceive or mislead; and 


(2) That results in payment of section 8 program funds in violation of section 8 program requirements. 


The terms *Public Housing Agency (PHA)* and *Indian Housing Authority (IHA)* are defined in 24 CFR part 5.


*Judgment.* Judgment means a provision for recovery of section 8 program funds obtained through fraud and abuse, by order of a court in litigation or by a settlement of a claim in litigation, whether or not stated in a court order. 


*Litigation.* A lawsuit brought by a PHA to recover section 8 program funds obtained as a result of fraud and abuse. 


*Principal party in initiating or sustaining an action to recover.* Principal party in initiating or sustaining an action to recover means the party that incurs more than half the costs incurred in: 


(1) Recertifying tenants who fraudulently obtained section 8 rental assistance; 


(2) Recomputing the correct amounts owed by tenants; and 


(3) Taking needed actions to recoup the excess benefits received, such as initiating litigation. 


Costs incurred to detect potential excessive benefits in the routine day-to-day operations of the program are excluded in determining the principal party in initiating or sustaining an action to recover.
