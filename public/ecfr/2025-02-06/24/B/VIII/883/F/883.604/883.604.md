# ยง 883.604   Maximum annual commitment and project account.

(a) *Maximum annual commitment.* The maximum annual contribution that may be contracted for in the ACC is the total of the contract rents and utility allowances for all assisted units in the project, plus the HUD-approved fees, if any, for State Agency administration of the Contract. (See ยง 883.606) 


(b) *Project Account.* (1) A project account will be established and maintained by HUD as a specifically identified and segregated account for each project. The account will be established out of the amounts by which the maximum annual commitment exceeds the amount actually paid out under the ACC each year. Payments will be made from this account for housing assistance payments (and fees for Agency admininstration, if appropriate) when needed to cover increases in contract rents or decreases in tenant rents and for other costs specifically approved by the Secretary. 


(2) Whenever a HUD-approved estimate of required payments under the ACC for a fiscal year exceeds the maximum annual commitment and would cause the amount in the project account to be less than 40 percent of the maximum, HUD will, within a reasonable period of time, take such additional steps authorized by Section 8(c)(6) of the 1937 Act, as may be necessary, to assure that payments under the ACC will be adequate to cover increases in contract rents and decreases in tenant rents.
