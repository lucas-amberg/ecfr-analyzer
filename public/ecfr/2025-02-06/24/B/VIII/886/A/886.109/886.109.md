# ยง 886.109   Housing assistance payments to owners.

(a) *General.* Housing Assistance Payments shall be paid to Owners for units under lease by eligible families, in accordance with the Contract and as provided in this section. These Housing Assistance Payments will cover the difference between the Contract Rent and the Tenant Rent. Where applicable, the Utility Reimbursement will be paid to the Family as an additional Housing Assistance Payment. The Contract will provide that the Owner will make this payment on behalf of HUD. Funds will be paid to the Owner in trust solely for the purpose of making this additional payment. If the Family and the utility company consent, the Owner may pay the Utility Reimbursement jointly to the Family and the utility company or directly to the utility company.


(b) No Section 8 assistance may be provided for any unit occupied by an Owner; cooperatives are considered rental housing. 


(c) If an Eligible Family vacates its unit (other than as a result of action by the Owner which is in violation of the Lease or the Contract or any applicable law), the Owner shall receive housing assistance payments in the amount of 80 percent of the Contract Rent for a vacancy period not exceeding 60 days: *Provided, however,* That if the Owner collects any of the Family's share of the rent for this period, or applies security deposits for unpaid rent, in amounts which when added to the 80 percent payments, results in more than the Contract Rent, such excess shall be payable to HUD or as HUD may direct. (See also ยง 886.116.) The Owner shall not be entitled to any payment under this paragraph unless he: 


(1) Immediately upon learning of the vacancy, has notified HUD of the vacancy or prospective vacancy and the reasons for the vacancy, and 


(2) Has taken and continues to take all feasible actions to fill the vacancy including, but not limited to, contacting applicants on his waiting list (if any), and advising them of the availability of the unit, and 


(3) Has not rejected any eligible applicant except for good cause.
