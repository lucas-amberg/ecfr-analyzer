# ยง 888.115   Fair market rents for existing housing: Manner of publication.

(a) *Publication of FMRs.* FMRs will be published at least annually by HUD on the World Wide Web, or in any other manner specified by the Secretary. HUD will publish a notice announcing the publication of the FMRs in the _Federal Register,_ to be effective October 1 of each year, and provide for a minimum of 30 days of public comments and requested for reevaluation of the FMRs in a jurisdiction. The FMRs will become effective no earlier than 30 days after the date the notice publishes in the _Federal Register_ (*e.g.*, if HUD fails to publish FMRs 30 days before October 1, the effective date will be 30 days after publication), except for areas where HUD receives comments during the minimum 30-day comment period requesting reevaluation of the FMRs in a jurisdiction. After HUD reviews a request for reevaluation, HUD will post on the World Wide Web the final FMRs for the areas that have been reevaluated and publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ announcing the publication and the effective date.


(b) *Changes in methodology.* HUD will publish for comment in the _Federal Register_ a document proposing material changes in the method for estimating FMRs and shall respond to public comment on the proposed material changes in the subsequent _Federal Register_ document announcing the availability of new FMRs based on the revised method for estimating FMRs.
