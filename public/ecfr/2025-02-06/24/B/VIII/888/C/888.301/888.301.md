# ยง 888.301   Purpose and scope.

(a) *Purpose.* This subpart describes the basic policies and procedures for the retroactive payment of Housing Assistance Payments to eligible project owners for the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991 and for one-time Contract Rent determinations for such eligible project owners. 


(b) *Applicability.* This subpart applies to all project-based Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Contracts under New Construction (Part 880); Substantial Rehabilitation (Part 881); State Finance Agencies (Part 883); and Section 515 Farmers Home Administration (Part 884). It also applies to those projects under Section 202 Elderly or Handicapped (Part 885) and Special Allocations (Part 886, Subparts A and C) whose Contract Rents are adjusted by use of the Annual Adjustment Factors (AAFs), as described in subpart B of this part. 


(c) *Eligible project owners.* Project owners may be eligible for retroactive payments if, during the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991: 


(1) The use of a comparability study by HUD (or the Contract Administrator), which was conducted as an independent limitation on the amount of rent adjustment that would have resulted from use of the applicable AAF, resulted in the reduction of the maximum monthly Contract Rents for units covered by a Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) contract or resulted in less than the maximum increase for those units than would otherwise be permitted by the AAF; or 


(2) The HAP contract required a project owner to request annual rent adjustments, and the project owner certifies that a request was not made because of an anticipated reduction of the maximum monthly Contract Rents resulting from a comparability study.
