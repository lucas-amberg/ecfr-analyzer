(a) *Restrictions.* Retroactive payments are subject to all regulations, procedures, or restrictions that apply to Housing Assistance Payments.


(b) *Review of initial rents.* Before calculating the amount of any retroactive payment, the PHA, if directed by HUD, will review whether rents were excessive when initially set.


(c) *Physical condition of projects.* If the most recent physical inspection report by the PHA shows significant deficiencies that have not been addressed to the satisfaction of the PHA by the date the retroactive payment is deposited into the project account, the payment will not be made available until the deficiencies are resolved or a plan for their resolution has been approved by the PHA.
