# § 891.310   Special project standards.

In addition to the applicable project standards in § 891.120, the following special standards apply to the Section 811 Program and to projects funded under §§ 891.655 through 891.790: 


(a) *Minimum group home standards.* Each group home must provide a minimum of 290 square feet of prorated space for each resident, including a minimum area of 80 square feet for each resident in a shared bedroom (with no more than two residents occupying a shared bedroom) and a minimum area of 100 square feet for a single occupant bedroom; at least one full bathroom for every four residents; space for recreation at indoor and outdoor locations on the project site; and sufficient storage for each resident in the bedroom and other storage space necessary for the operation of the home. If the project involves acquisition (with or without rehabilitation), the structure must at least be in compliance with applicable State requirements. In the absence of such requirements, the above standards shall apply. 


(b) *Additional accessibility requirements.* In addition to the accessibility requirements in § 891.120(b), the following requirements apply to the Section 811 Program and to projects funded under §§ 891.655 through 891.790: 


(1) All entrances, common areas, units to be occupied by resident staff, and amenities must be readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities. 


(2) In projects for chronically mentally ill individuals, a minimum of 10 percent of all dwelling units in an independent living facility (or 10 percent of all bedrooms and bathrooms in a group home, but at least one of each such space), must be designed to be accessible or adaptable for persons with disabilities. 


(3) In projects for developmentally disabled or physically disabled persons, all dwelling units in an independent living facility (or all bedrooms and bathrooms in a group home) must be designed to be accessible or adaptable for persons with physical disabilities. A project involving acquisition and/or rehabilitation may provide a lesser number if: 


(i) The cost of providing full accessibility makes the project financially infeasible; 


(ii) Fewer than one-half of the intended occupants have mobility impairments; and 


(iii) The project complies with the requirements of 24 CFR 8.23. 


(4) For the purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the following definitions apply:


(i) *Accessible* describes a site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards and that can be approached, entered, and used by physically disabled people;


(ii) *Adaptability* means the ability of certain building spaces and elements, such as kitchen counters, sinks, and grab bars, to be added or altered so as to accommodate the needs of either disabled or nondisabled persons, or to accommodate the needs of either disabled or nondisabled persons, or to accommodate the needs of persons with different types or degrees of disability.
