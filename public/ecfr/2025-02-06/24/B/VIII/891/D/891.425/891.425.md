This section shall apply to capital advances under the Section 202 Program and the Section 811 Program, as well as loans financed under subpart E of this part. 


(a) *Term of lease.* The term of the lease may not be less than one year. Unless the lease has been terminated by appropriate action, upon expiration of the lease term, the household and Owner (or family and Borrower, as applicable) may execute a new lease for a term not less than one year, or may take no action. If no action is taken, the lease will automatically be renewed for successive terms of one month. 


(b) *Termination by the household (or family, as applicable).* All leases may contain a provision that permits the household (or family) to terminate the lease upon 30 days advance notice. A lease for a term that exceeds one year must contain such provision. 


(c) *Form.* The Owner (or Borrower, as applicable) shall use the lease form prescribed by HUD. In addition to required provisions of the lease form, the Owner (or Borrower) may include a provision in the lease permitting the Owner (or Borrower) to enter the leased premises at any time without advance notice when there is reasonable cause to believe that an emergency exists or that health or safety of a family member is endangered.


(d) *Notification for nonpayment of rent.* The lease must contain a provision or addendum that tenants will receive notification at least 30 days before a formal judicial eviction is filed.
