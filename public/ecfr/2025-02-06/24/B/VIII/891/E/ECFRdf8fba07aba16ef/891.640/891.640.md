# § 891.640   Adjustment of rents.

(a) *Contract rents*—(1) *Adjustment based on approved budget.* If the HAP contract provides, or has been amended to provide, that contract rents will be adjusted based upon a HUD-approved budget, HUD will calculate contract rent adjustments based on the sum of the project's operating costs and debt service (as calculated by HUD), with adjustments for vacancies, the project's nonrental income, and other factors that HUD deems appropriate. The calculation will be made on the basis of information provided by the Borrower on a form acceptable to the Secretary. The automatic adjustment factor described in part 888 of this chapter is not used to adjust contract rents under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except to the extent that the amount of the replacement reserve deposit is adjusted under § 880.602 of this chapter. 


(2) *Annual and special adjustments.* If the HAP contract provides that contract rents will be adjusted based on the application of an automatic adjustment factor and by special additional adjustments: 


(i) Consistent with the HAP contract, contract rents may be adjusted in accordance with part 888 of this chapter; 


(ii) Special additional adjustments will be granted, to the extent determined necessary by HUD, to reflect increases in the actual and necessary expenses of owning and maintaining the assisted units that have resulted from substantial general increases in real property taxes, assessments, utility rates or similar costs (i.e., assessments and utilities not covered by regulated rates), and that are not adequately compensated for by an annual adjustment. The Borrower must submit to HUD required supporting data, financial statements, and certifications for the special additional adjustment. 


(b) *Rent for unassisted units.* The rent payable by families occupying units that are not assisted under the HAP contract shall be equal to the contract rent computed under paragraph (a) of this section.
