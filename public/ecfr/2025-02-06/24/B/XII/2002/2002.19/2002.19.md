# ยง 2002.19   Authority to deny requests for records and form of denial, exemptions, and exclusions.

(a) *Process for denying requests.* An Assistant Inspector General or the Counsel to the Inspector General, or their designees, may deny a request for a record. Any denial will:


(1) Be in writing;


(2) State simply the reasons for the denial;


(3) Provide an estimate of the volume of records or information withheld, when appropriate, in number of pages or in some other reasonable form of estimation. This estimate does not need to be provided if the volume is otherwise indicated through deletions on records disclosed in part, or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;


(4) Identify the person(s) responsible for the denial by name and title;


(5) Provide notice of the right of the requester to appeal to the Deputy Inspector General, within a period determined by the head of the agency that is not less than 90 days after the date of such adverse determination, consistent with ยง 2002.23; and


(6) Provide notice of the right of the requester to seek dispute resolution services from the FOIA Public Liaison of the agency or the Office of Government Information Services.


(b) *Denying requests generally.* The OIG shall withhold information only if the OIG reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption as provided in this section, or disclosure is prohibited by law. The OIG will consider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever the OIG determines that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible and will take reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information. Nothing in this section requires disclosure of information that is otherwise prohibited from disclosure by law or otherwise exempted from disclosure as provided in this section.


(c) *FOIA exemptions.* The FOIA contains nine exemptions (5 U.S.C. 552(b)) that authorize agencies to withhold various records from disclosure, and two exclusions to the statute that may be used by the OIG. With regard to the records normally requested, the OIG generally applies the exemptions and exclusions as follows:


(1) *Classified documents.* Exemption 1 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)) protects classified national defense and foreign relations information. The OIG seldom relies on this exception to withhold documents. However, where applicable, the OIG will refer a request for records classified under Executive Order 13526 and the pertinent records to the originating agency for processing. The OIG may refuse to confirm or deny the existence of the requested information if the originating agency determines that the fact of the existence of the information itself is classified.


(2) *Internal agency rules and practices.* Exemption 2 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(2)) protects records relating to internal personnel rules and practices.


(3) *Information prohibited from disclosure by another statute.* Exemption 3 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3)) protects information that is prohibited from disclosure by another Federal law. Some investigative records contain information that could reveal grand jury proceedings, which are protected from disclosure by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). Section 7 of the Inspector General Act of 1978 prohibits the OIG from disclosing the identity of employees who make protected disclosures. The OIG generally will not disclose competitive proposals prior to contract award, competitive proposals that are not set forth or incorporated by reference into the awarded contract, (see 41 U.S.C. 4702), or, during the selection process, any covered selection information regarding such selection, either directly or indirectly (see 42 U.S.C. 3537a).


(4) *Commercial or financial information.* Exemption 4 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)) protects trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person that is privileged and confidential. The OIG frequently obtains this information through its audits. The OIG will process the release of this category of information pursuant to Executive Order 12600 and give notice to the affected business and an opportunity for the business to present evidence of its confidentiality claim. If the OIG is sued by a requester under the FOIA for nondisclosure of confidential business information, the OIG expects the affected business to cooperate to the fullest extent possible in defending such a decision.


(5) *Certain interagency or intra-agency communications.* Exemption 5 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5)) protects interagency or intra-agency communications that are protected by legal privileges, such as the attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product privilege, or communications reflecting the agency's deliberative process. These communications may include communications with the Department of Justice and with HUD. The deliberative process privilege shall not apply to records created 25 years or more before the date on which the records were requested.


(6) *Personal privacy.* Exemption 6 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6)) protects information involving matters of personal privacy. This information may be found in personnel, medical, and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Names, addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses of persons identified in audits or complaints generally will not be disclosed. The OIG has learned through experience that some of its employees (*i.e.* Hotline employees) will be harassed if their identities are known, and the OIG will protect the identities of these employees. As a law enforcement agency, the OIG finds individuals generally have a heightened privacy interest for not having their identities associated with the OIG.


(7) *Law enforcement records.* Exemption 7 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)) protects certain records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes. This exemption protects records where the production could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings. The protection of this exemption also encompasses, but is not limited to, information in law enforcement files that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; the names of confidential informants; and techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations, or guidelines for law enforcement investigations if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law. It is the policy of the OIG in responding to all FOIA requests for investigative records pertaining to specifically named individuals to refuse to confirm or deny the existence of such records. Lacking the subject individuals consent, proof of death, an official acknowledgement of an investigation, or an overriding public interest, even to acknowledge the existence of such records could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.


(8) *Supervision of financial institutions.* Exemption 8 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8)) protects information relating to the supervision of financial institutions. It is unlikely that the OIG will have these documents.


(9) *Wells.* Exemption 9 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(9)) protects geological information on wells. It is unlikely that the OIG will have these documents.


(d) *FOIA exclusion.* Some law enforcement records are excluded from the FOIA. 5 U.S.C. 552(c)(1) permits a law enforcement agency to exclude a document from the FOIA if there is reason to believe that:


(1) The subject of the investigation or proceeding is not aware of its pendency; and


(2) Disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, in which case the agency may, during only such time as that circumstance continues, treat the records as not subject to the requirements of the FOIA. Section 552(c)(2) of FOIA allows the exclusion of informant records, unless the existence of the informant has been officially confirmed.
