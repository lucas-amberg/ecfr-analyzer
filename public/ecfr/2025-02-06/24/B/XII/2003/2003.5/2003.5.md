# ยง 2003.5   Initial denial of access to records.

(a) Access by an individual to a record about that individual which is contained in an OIG system of records will be denied only upon a determination by the Privacy Act Officer that: 


(1) The record was compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding; or the record is subject to a Privacy Act exemption under ยง 2003.8 or ยง 2003.9 of this part; and 


(2) The record is also subject to a FOIA exemption under ยง 2002.21(b) of this chapter. 


(b) If a request is partially denied, any portions of the responsive record that can be reasonably segregated will be provided to the individual after deletion of those portions determined to be exempt. 


(c) The provisions of 24 CFR 16.6(b) and 16.7, concerning notification of an initial denial of access and administrative review of the initial denial, apply to the OIG, except that: 


(1) The final determination of the Inspector General, as Privacy Appeals Officer for the OIG, will be in writing and will constitute final action of the Department on a request for access to a record in an OIG system of records; and 


(2) If the denial of the request is in whole or in part upheld, the final determination of the Inspector General will include notice of the right to judicial review.
