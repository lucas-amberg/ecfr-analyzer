# ยง 3280.207   Requirements for thermal insulating materials.

(a) *General.* Except for foam plastic materials and as provided in this section, exposed and concealed thermal insulating materials, including any facings, must be tested in accordance with NFPA 255-96, Standard Method of Test of Surface Burning Characteristics of Building Materials (incorporated by reference, see ยง 3280.4) and must have a flame spread index of 25 or less and a smoke developed index of 450 or less. The flame spread and smoke developed limitations do not apply to:


(1) Coverings and facings of insulation batts or blankets installed in concealed spaces when the facings are in substantial contact with the unexposed surface of wall, floor, or ceiling finish; or


(2) Cellulose loose-fill insulation that complies with paragraph (b) of this section.

(2) Other loose-fill insulation that cannot be mounted in the NFPA 255-96, test apparatus without a screen or other artificial support must be tested in accordance with CAN/ULC S102.2-M88, Standard Method of Test for Surface Burning Characteristics of Floor Coverings and Miscellaneous Materials and Assemblies (incorporated by reference, see ยง 3280.4), and must have a flame spread index of 25 or less and a smoke developed index of 450 or less.


(c) *Attic locations.* Exposed insulation installed on the floor or ceiling forming the lower boundary of the attic must be tested in accordance with NFPA 253-2000, Standard Method of Test for Critical Radiant Flux of Floor Covering Systems Using a Radiant Heat Energy Source (incorporated by reference, see ยง 3280.4) and must have a critical radiant flux of not less than 0.12 watt/cm
