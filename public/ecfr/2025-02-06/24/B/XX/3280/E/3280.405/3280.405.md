# ยง 3280.405   Standard for swinging exterior passage doors for use in manufactured homes.

(a) *Introduction.* This standard applies to all exterior passage door units, excluding sliding doors and doors used for access to utilities and compartments. This standard applies only to the door frame consisting of jambs, head and sill and the attached door or doors. 


(b) *Performance requirements.* The design and construction of exterior door units must meet all requirements of AAMA 1702.2-95, Voluntary Standard Swinging Exterior Passage Door for Utilization in Manufactured Housing.


(c) *Materials and methods.* Any material or method of construction shall conform to the performance requirements as outlined in paragraph (b) of this section. Plywood shall be exterior type and preservative treated in accordance with NWWDA I.S.4-81, Water Repellent Preservative Non-Pressure Treatment for Millwork.


(d) *Exterior doors.* All swinging exterior doors shall be installed in a manner which allows proper operation and provides protection against the elements (*see* ยง 3280.307). 


(e) *Certification.* All swinging exterior doors to be installed in manufactured homes must be certified as complying with AAMA 1702.2-95, Voluntary Standard Swinging Exterior Passage Door for Utilization in Manufactured Housing.


(1) All such doors must show evidence of certification by affixing a quality certification label to the product in accordance with ANSI Z34.1-1993, Third Party Certification Programs for Products, Processes, and Services.


(2) In determining certifiability of the products, an independent quality assurance agency must conduct a pre-production specimen test in accordance with AAMA 1702.2-95, Voluntary Standard Swinging Exterior Passage Door for Utilization in Manufactured Housing.


(f) *Protection of exterior doors in high wind areas.* For homes designed to be located in Wind Zones II and III, manufacturers shall design exterior walls surrounding the exterior door openings to allow for the installation of shutters or other protective covers, such as plywood, to cover these openings. Although not required, the Department encourages manufacturers to provide the shutters or protective covers and to install receiving devices, sleeves, or anchors for fasteners to be used to secure the shutters or protective covers to the exterior walls. If the manufacturer does not provide shutters or other protective covers to cover these openings, the manufacturer must provide to the homeowner instructions for at least one method of protecting exterior door openings. This method must be capable of resisting the design wind pressures specified in ยง 3280.305 without taking the home out of conformance with the standards in this part. These instructions must be included in the printed instructions that accompany each manufactured home. The instructions shall also indicate whether receiving devices, sleeves, or anchors, for fasteners to be used to secure the shutters or protective covers to the exterior walls, have been installed or provided by the manufacturer.
