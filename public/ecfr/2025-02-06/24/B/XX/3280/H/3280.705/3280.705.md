(3) *Valves.* A shutoff valve must be installed in the fuel piping at each appliance inside the manufactured home structure, upstream of the union or connector in addition to any valve on the appliance and so arranged to be accessible to permit servicing of the appliance and removal of its components. The shutoff valve must be located within 6 feet of any cooking appliance and within 3 feet of any other appliance. A shutoff valve may serve more than one appliance if located as required by this paragraph (3). The shutoff valve must be of the non-displaceable rotor type and conform to ANSI Z21.15-1997, Manually Operated Gas Valves.


(4) *Gas piping system openings.* All openings in the gas piping system shall be closed gas-tight with threaded pipe plugs or pipe caps.

Vertical gas piping in multi-story dwelling units must be supported at intervals of not more than 6 feet. Solid iron-pipe connection(s) must be rigidly anchored to a structural member within 6 inches of the supply connection(s).


(8) *Testing for leakage.* (i) Before appliances are connected, piping systems must stand a pressure of three ± 0.2 psi gauge for a period of not less than ten minutes without showing any drop in pressure. Pressure must be measured with a mercury manometer or slope gauge calibrated so as to be read in increments of not greater than one-tenth pound, or an equivalent device. The source of normal operating pressure must be isolated before the pressure tests are made. Before a test is begun, the temperature of the ambient air and of the piping must be approximately the same, and constant air temperature must be maintained throughout the test. 








(ii) After appliances are connected, the piping system shall be pressurized to not less than 10 inches nor more than 14 inches water column and the appliance connections tested for leakage with soapy water or bubble solution. 




(iii) Where gas piping between transportable sections must be made on site, the installation instructions must contain provisions for onsite testing for leakage consistent with the provisions in paragraph (l)(8)(i) of this section.
