# ยง 3280.707   Heat producing appliances.

(a) Heat-producing appliances and vents, roof jacks and chimneys necessary for their installation in manufactured homes shall be listed or certified by a nationally recognized testing agency for use in manufactured homes. 


(1) A manufactured home shall be provided with a comfort heating system. 


(i) When a manufactured home is manufactured to contain a heating appliance, the heating appliance shall be installed by the manufacturer of the manufactured home in compliance with applicable sections of this subpart.


(ii) When a manufactured home is manufactured for field application of an external heating or combination heating/cooling appliance, preparation of the manufactured home for this external application shall comply with the applicable sections of this part.


(2) Each gas and oil burning comfort heating appliance must have an Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency of not less than that specified in 10 CFR part 430, Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products: Test Procedures for Furnaces/Boilers, Vented Home Heating Equipment and Pool Heaters.


(b) Fuel-burning heat-producing appliances and refrigeration appliances, except ranges and ovens, shall be of the vented type and vented to the outside. 


(c) Fuel-burning appliances shall not be converted from one fuel to another fuel unless converted in accordance with the terms of their listing and the appliance manufacturer's instructions. 


(d) *Performance efficiency.* Each automatic storage water heater must comply with the efficiency requirements of 10 CFR part 430, Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products: Energy Conservation Standards for Water Heaters.


(1) All automatic electric storage water heaters installed in manufactured homes shall have a standby loss not exceeding 43 watts/meter
2 (4 watts/ft
2) of tank surface area. The method of test for standby loss shall be as described in section 4.3.1 of Household Automatic Electric Storage Type Water Heaters, ANSI C72.1-1972. 


(2) All gas and oil-fired automatic storage water heaters shall have a recovery efficiency, E, and a standby loss, S, as described below. The method of test of E and S shall be as described in section 2.7 of Gas Water heaters, Vol. I, Storage Water Heaters with Input/Ratings of 75,000 BTU per hour or less, ANSI Z21.10.1-1998 with addendums Z21.10.1a-2000, and Z21.10.1b-1992, except that for oil-fired units. CF = 1.0, Q = total gallons of oil consumed and H = total heating value of oil in BTU/gallon.


(e) Each space heating, cooling or combination heating and cooling system shall be provided with at least one readily adjustable automatic control for regulation of living space temperature. The control shall be placed a minimum of 3 feet from the vertical edge of the appliance compartment door. It shall not be located on an exterior wall or on a wall separating the appliance compartment from a habitable room.


(f) *Oil-fired heating equipment.* All oil-fired heating equipment must conform to Liquid Fuel-burning Heating Appliances for Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles, UL 307A-1995, with 1997 revisions, and be installed in accordance with Standard for the Installation of Oil Burning Equipment, NFPA 31-01 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 3280.4). Regardless of the requirements of the above-referenced standards, or any other standards referenced in this part, the following are not required:


(1) External switches or remote controls which shut off the burner or the flow of oil to the burner, or


(2) An emergency disconnect switch to interrupt electric power to the equipment under conditions of excessive temperature.
