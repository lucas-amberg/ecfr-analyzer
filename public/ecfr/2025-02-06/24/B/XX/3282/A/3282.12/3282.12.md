# § 3282.12   Excluded structures—modular homes.

(a) The purpose of this section is to provide the certification procedure authorized by section 604(h) of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act under which modular homes may be excluded from coverage of the Act if the manufacturer of the structure elects to have them excluded. If a manufacturer wishes to construct a structure that is both a manufactured home and a modular home, the manufacturer need not make the certification provided for by this section and may meet both the Federal manufactured home requirements and any modular housing requirements. When the certification is not made, all provisions of the Federal requirements shall be met. 


(b) Any structure that meets the definition of *manufactured home* at 24 CFR 3282.7(u) is excluded from the coverage of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act, 42 U.S.C. 5401 *et seq.,* if the manufacturer certifies as prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section that: 


(1) The structure is designed only for erection or installation on a site-built permanent foundation; 


(i) A structure meets this criterion if all written materials and communications relating to installation of the structure, including but not limited to designs, drawings, and installation or erection instructions, indicate that the structure is to be installed on a permanent foundation. 


(ii) A site-built permanent foundation is a system of supports, including piers, either partially or entirely below grade which is: 


(A) Capable of transferring all design loads imposed by or upon the structure into soil or bedrock without failure, 


(B) Placed at an adequate depth below grade to prevent frost damage, and


(C) Constructed of concrete, metal, treated lumber or wood, or grouted masonry; and


(2) The structure is not designed to be moved once erected or installed on a site-built permanent foundation; 


(i) A structure meets this criterion if all written materials and communications relating to erection or installation of the structure, including but not limited to designs, drawings, calculations, and installation or erection instructions, indicate that the structure is not intended to be moved after it is erected or installed and if the towing hitch or running gear, which includes axles, brakes, wheels and other parts of the chassis that operate only during transportation, are removable and designed to be removed prior to erection or installation on a site-built permanent foundation; and 


(3) The structure is designed and manufactured to comply with the currently effective version of one of the following: 


(i) One of the following nationally recognized building codes: 


(A) That published by Building Officials and Code Administrators (BOCA) and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and made up of the following: 


(*1*) BOCA Basic Building Code, 


(*2*) BOCA Basic Industrialized Dwelling Code, 


(*3*) BOCA Basic Plumbing Code, 


(*4*) BOCA Basic Mechanical Code, and 


(*5*) National Electrical Code, or 


(B) That published by the Southern Building Code Congress (SBCC) and the NFPA and made up of the following: 


(*1*) Standard Building Code, 


(*2*) Standard Gas Code, 


(*3*) Standard Mechanical Code, 


(*4*) Standard Plumbing Code, and 


(*5*) National Electrical Code, or 


(C) That published by the International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO), the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO), and the NFPA and made up of the following: 


(*1*) Uniform Building Code, 


(*2*) Uniform Mechanical Code, 


(*3*) Uniform Plumbing Code, and 


(*4*) National Electrical Code or 


(D) The codes included in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A), (B), or (C) in connection with the One- and Two-Family Dwelling Code, or 


(E) Any combination of the codes included in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A), (B), (C), and (D), that is approved by the Secretary, including combinations using the National Standard Plumbing Code published by the National Association of Plumbing, Heating and Cooling Contractors (PHCC), or


(F) Any other building code accepted by the Secretary as a nationally recognized model building code, or


(ii) Any local code or State or local modular building code accepted as generally equivalent to the codes included under paragraph (b)(3)(i), (the Secretary will consider the manufacturer's certification under paragraph (c) of this section to constitute a certification that the code to which the structure is built is generally equivalent to the referenced codes. This certification of equivalency is subject to the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section) or 


(iii) The minimum property standards adopted by the Secretary pursuant to title II of the National Housing Act; and 


(4) To the manufacturer's knowledge, the structure is not intended to be used other than on a site-built permanent foundation. 


(c) When a manufacturer makes a certification provided for under paragraph (b) of this section, the certification shall state as follows:


(d) This certification shall be affixed in a permanent manner near the electrical panel, on the inside of a kitchen cabinet door, or in any other readily accessible and visible location. 


(e) As part of this certification, the manufacturer shall identify each certified structure by a permanent serial number placed on the structure during the first stage of production. If the manufacturer also manufactures manufactured homes that are certified under §§ 3282.205 and 3282.362(c), the series of serial numbers for structures certified under this section shall be distinguishable on the structures and in the manufacturer's records from the series of serial numbers for the manufactured homes that are certified under §§ 3282.205 and 3282.362(c). 


(1) If a manufacturer wishes to certify a structure as a manufactured home under §§ 3282.205 and 3282.362(c) after having applied a serial number identifying it as exempted under this section, the manufacturer may do so only with the written consent of the Production Inspection Primary Inspection Agency (IPIA) after thorough inspection of the structure by the IPIA at at least one stage of production and such removal or equipment, components, or materials as the IPIA may require to perform inspections to assure that the structure conforms to the Federal manufactured home standards. The manufacturer shall remove the original serial number and add the serial number required by § 3280.6. 


(2) A manufacturer may not certify a structure under this section after having applied the manufactured home serial number under § 3280.6. 


(f) All certifications made under this section are subject to investigation by the Secretary to determine their accuracy. If a certification is false or inaccurate, the certification for purposes of this section is invalid and the structures that have been or may be the subject of the certification are not excluded from the coverage of the Act, the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards, or these Regulations. 


(1) If the Secretary has information that a certification may be false or inaccurate, the manufacturer will be given written notice of the nature of this information by certified mail and the procedure of this subparagraph will be followed. 


(i) The manufacturer must investigate this matter and report its findings in writing as to the validity of this information to the Secretary within 15 days from the receipt of the Secretary's notice. 


(ii) If a written report is received within the time prescribed in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, the Secretary will review this report before determining whether a certification is false or inaccurate. If a report is not received within 15 days from the receipt of the Secretary's notice, the Secretary will make the determination on the basis of the information presented. 


(iii) If the Secretary determines that a certification is false or inaccurate, the manufacturer will be given written notice and the reasons for this determination by certified mail. 


(2) The Secretary may seek civil and criminal penalties provided for in section 611 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 5410, if the party in question in the exercise of due care has reason to know that such certification is false or misleading as to any material fact.
