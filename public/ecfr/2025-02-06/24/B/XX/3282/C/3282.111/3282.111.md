# ยง 3282.111   Petitions for reconsideration of final rules.

(a) *Definition.* A petition for reconsideration of a final rule issued by the Secretary is a request in writing from any interested person which must be received not later than 60 days after publication of the rule in the _Federal Register._ The petition shall state that it is a petition for reconsideration of a final rule, and shall contain an explanation as to why compliance with the rule is not practicable, is unreasonable, or is not in the public interest. If the petitioner requests the consideration of additional facts, the petitioner shall state the reason they were not presented to be treated as petitions for rulemaking. 


(b) *Proceedings on petitions for reconsideration.* The Secretary may grant or deny, in whole or in part, any petition for reconsideration without further proceedings. The Secretary may issue a final decision on reconsideration without further proceeding, or may provide such opportunity to submit comments or information and data as the Secretary deems appropriate. 


(c) Unless the Secretary determines otherwise, the filing of a petition under this section does not stay the effectiveness of the rule in question. 


(d) Any party seeking to challenge any rule or regulation issued under the Act, except orders issued under section 604 42 U.S.C. 5403, if the challenge is brought before the expiration of the 60 day period set out in paragraph (a) of this section, shall file a timely petition for reconsideration under this section prior to seeking any other remedy.
