(2) Resolution of disputes where an SAA or manufacturer disagrees with a determination of a DAPIA under § 3282.361 that a manufactured home design does or does not conform to the standards or that a quality assurance manual is or is not adequate with a decision by an IPIA to red tag or not to red tag or to provide or not to provide a certification label for a manufactured home under § 3282.362 when the IPIA believes that the manufactured home does or does not conform to the standards. 


(c) The procedures set out in § 3282.152 shall also be followed whenever State Administrative Agencies hold Formal or Informal Presentations of Views under § 3282.309.
