(1) Construction drawings and/or specifications showing structural details and layouts of frames, floors, walls and roofs, and chassis; material specifications, framing details, door locations, etc., for each floor plan proposed to be manufactured, 


(2) Structural analysis and calculations, test data and/or other accepted engineering practices used by the manufacturer to validate the design, 


(3) Complete heat loss calculations for each significant variation of home design, 


(4) Floor plans showing room arrangement and sizes, window sizes, emergency exists and locations, locations of smoke alarms, fixed appliance range hoods, and other standards related aspects of the manufactured home that can be shown on the floor plans, 


(5) Diagrams of the fuel supply system, potable water system and drain, waste and vent systems. The diagrams shall specify the types of materials used, types of fittings and methods of installing required safety equipment, 


(6) Wiring diagrams, including circuit allocation of electrical load and branch circuit calculations, a table of the branch circuit protection provided, the type of wiring used, and wiring methods, 


(7) Details showing the design of air supply and return systems,

At a minimum, this information shall include the quality assurance manual for which approval is sought. That manual shall include the manufacturer's quality assurance program, an organizational chart showing the accountability, by position, of the manufacturer's quality control personnel, a description of production tests and test equipment required for compliance with the standards, a station-by-station description of the manufacturing process, a list of quality control inspections required by the manufacturer at each station, and identification by title of each person who will be held accountable for each quality control inspection. 


(d) Manufacturers may be required to furnish supplementary information to the DAPIA if the design information or the quality assurance manual is not complete or if any information is not in accordance with accepted engineering practice. 


(e) When a manufacturer wishes to make a change in an approved design or quality assurance manual, the manufacturer shall obtain the approval of the DAPIA which approved the design or manual prior to production for sale. The procedures for obtaining such approval are set out in § 3282.361. When applicable under § 3282.605, the IPIA must concur in the change before it can be approved by the DAPIA.

(g) Each manufacturer shall maintain a copy of the drawings, specifications, and sketches from each approved design received from a DAPIA under § 3282.361(b)(4) in each plant in which manufactured homes are being produced to the design. Each manufacturer shall also maintain in each manufacturing plant a copy of the approved quality assurance manual received from a DAPIA under § 3282.361(c)(3) that is being followed in the plant. These materials shall be kept current and shall be readily accessible for use by the Secretary or other parties acting under these regulations.
