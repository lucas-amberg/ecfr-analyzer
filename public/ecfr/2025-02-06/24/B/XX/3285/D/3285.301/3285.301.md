# § 3285.301   General.

(a) Foundations for manufactured home installations must be designed and constructed in accordance with this subpart and must be based on site conditions, home design features, and the loads the home was designed to withstand, as shown on the home's data plate.


(b) Foundation systems that are not pier and footing type configurations may be used when verified by engineering data and designed in accordance with § 3285.301(d), consistent with the design loads of the MHCSS. Pier and footing specifications that are different than those provided in this subpart, such as block size, metal piers, section width, loads, and spacing, may be used when verified by engineering data that comply with §§ 3285.301(c) and (d) and are capable of resisting all design loads of the MHCSS.


(c) All foundation details, plans, and test data must be designed and certified by a registered professional engineer or registered architect, and must not take the home out of compliance with the MHCSS. (See 3285.2)


(d) Alternative foundation systems or designs are permitted in accordance with either of the following:


(1) Systems or designs must be manufactured and installed in accordance with their listings by a nationally recognized testing agency, based on a nationally recognized testing protocol; or


(2) System designs must be prepared by a professional engineer or a registered architect or tested and certified by a professional engineer or registered architect in accordance with acceptable engineering practice and must be manufactured and installed so as not to take the home out of compliance with the Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards (part 3280 of this chapter).
