It is recommended that the installation instructions indicate that the LAHJ be informed before moving the manufactured home to the site. It is also recommended that the installation instructions indicate that the manufactured home is not to be moved to the site until the site is prepared in accordance with subpart C of this part and when the utilities are available as required by the LAHJ. Examples of related areas that might be addressed in the installation instructions for meeting this recommendation include:


(a) *Access for the transporter.* Before attempting to move a home, ensure that the transportation equipment and home can be routed to the installation site and that all special transportation permits required by the LAHJ have been obtained.


(b) *Drainage structures.* Ditches and culverts used to drain surface runoff meet the requirements of the LAHJ and are considered in the overall site preparation.
