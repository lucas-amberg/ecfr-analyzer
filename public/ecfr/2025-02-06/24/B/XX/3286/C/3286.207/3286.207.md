(a) *Where to apply.* An applicant for an initial or renewed installation license must provide the applicant's legal name, address, and telephone number to HUD. The application, with all required information, must be sent to: Administrator, Office of Manufactured Housing Programs, HUD, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Room 9164, Washington, DC 20410-8000, or to a fax number or e-mail address obtained by calling the Office of Manufactured Housing Programs.

(b) *Proof of experience.* Every applicant for an initial installation license must submit verification of the experience required in § 3286.205(a). This verification may be in the form of statements by past or present employers or a self-certification that the applicant meets those experience requirements, but HUD may contact the applicant for additional verification at any time. The applicant must also provide to HUD employment information relevant to the applicant's experience as an installer, including the dates and type of such employment. An installer who is certified or licensed to perform manufactured home installations in a state with a qualifying installation program may seek an exemption from the experience requirement by submitting proof of such certification or license.


(c) *Proof of training.* Every applicant for an initial installation license, or the renewal of an installation license, must submit verification of successful completion of the training required in § 3286.205(b). This verification must be in the form of a certificate of completion from a qualified trainer that the applicant has completed the requisite number of hours of a qualifying curriculum, as set out in § 3286.308 or § 3286.309.


(d) *Proof of surety bond or insurance.* Every applicant for an installation license must submit the name of the applicant's surety bond or insurance carrier and the number of the policy required in § 3286.205(d).


(e) *Other application submissions.* (1) Every applicant for an installation license must submit a list of all states in which the applicant holds a similar installation certification or license, and a list of all states in which the applicant has had such a certification or license revoked, suspended, or denied.


(2) When the examination is not administered by HUD, every applicant for an initial installation license must submit certification of a passing grade on the examination required by § 3286.205(c).


(f) *Issuance or denial of an installation license.* (1) When HUD confirms that an applicant has met the requirements in this subpart C, HUD will either:


(i) Provide an installation license to the applicant that, as long as the installation license remains in effect, establishes the applicant's qualification to install manufactured homes in a state subject to the HUD-administered installation program; or


(ii) Provide a written explanation of why HUD deems the applicant to not qualify for an installation license, including on grounds applicable under § 3286.209 for suspension or revocation of an installation license and any other specified evidence of inability to adequately meet the requirements of this part.


(2) An applicant who is denied an installation license under this subpart C, other than for failure to pass the installation license test, may request from HUD an opportunity for a presentation of views, in accordance with subpart D of part 3282 of this chapter, for the purpose of establishing the applicant's qualifications to obtain an installation license.


(g) *Assignment of license prohibited.* An installation license issued under this part may not be transferred, assigned, or pledged to another entity or individual.
