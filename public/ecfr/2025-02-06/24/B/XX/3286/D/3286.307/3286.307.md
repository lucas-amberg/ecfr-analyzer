(a) *Where to apply.* An applicant for qualification as a trainer must provide the applicant's legal name, address, and telephone number to HUD. The application, with all required information, must be sent to: Administrator, Office of Manufactured Housing Programs, HUD, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Room 9164, Washington DC 20410-8000, or to a fax number or e-mail address obtained by calling the Office of Manufactured Housing Programs. For convenience only, the URL of the Web site is *http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/mhs/mhshome.cfm,* and the toll-free telephone number to contact the Office of Manufactured Housing Programs is 1-800-927-2891, extension 57.


(b) *Proof of experience.* (1) Every individual applicant for initial qualification as a trainer must submit verification of the experience required in § 3286.305. This verification may be in the form of statements by past or present employers or a self-certification that the applicant meets those experience requirements, but HUD may contact the applicant for additional verification at any time. The applicant must also provide to HUD employment information relevant to the applicant's experience as a trainer, including the dates and type of such employment. A trainer who is licensed, or otherwise certified, to provide manufactured home installation training in a state with a qualifying installation program may seek an exemption from the experience requirement by submitting proof of such license or other certification. An individual who applies for renewal qualification as a trainer is not required to submit additional proof of experience.


(2) An entity that seeks to be designated as a qualified trainer must provide evidence and assurance that the entity's individual trainers meet the experience requirements in § 3286.305.


(c) *Other qualification information.* (1) An applicant for initial or renewal qualification as a trainer must submit to HUD a list of all states in which the applicant has had a similar training qualification revoked, suspended, or denied.


(2) An applicant also must submit to HUD a certification that training provided in accordance with this subpart D will meet the curriculum requirements established in § 3286.308 or § 3286.309, as applicable.


(d) *Confirmation or denial of qualification.* (1) When HUD confirms that an applicant has met the experience and curriculum requirements in this section, HUD will either:


(i) Provide to the applicant a written confirmation that the applicant is a qualified trainer under this part, and will add the applicant's name to a list maintained by HUD of qualified trainers; or


(ii) Provide a written explanation of why HUD deems the applicant to not qualify as a trainer, including on grounds applicable under § 3286.311 for suspension or revocation of a qualification and any other specified evidence of inability to meet the requirements of this part.


(2) An applicant whose qualification is denied by HUD may request an opportunity for a presentation of views, in accordance with subpart D of part 3282 of this chapter, for the purpose of establishing the applicant's qualifications to be a qualified trainer or the adequacy of any training curriculum that is challenged by HUD.


(e) *Assignment of qualification prohibited.* A qualification issued under this subpart D may not be transferred, assigned, or pledged to another entity or individual.
