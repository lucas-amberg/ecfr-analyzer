# ยง 3288.305   Consultation with the Manufactured Housing Consensus Committee.

HUD will seek input from the MHCC when revising the HUD Manufactured Home Dispute Resolution Program regulations in this part 3288. Before publication of a proposed rule to revise these regulations, HUD will provide the MHCC with an opportunity to comment on such revision. The MHCC may send to HUD any of the MHCC's own recommendations to adopt new dispute resolution program regulations or to modify or repeal any of the regulations in this part. Along with each recommendation, the MHCC must set forth pertinent data and arguments in support of the action sought. HUD will either: accept or modify the recommendation and publish it for public comment in accordance with section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), along with an explanation of the reasons for any such modification; or reject the recommendation entirely, and provide to the MHCC a written explanation of the reasons for the rejection. This section does not supersede section 605 of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5404).
