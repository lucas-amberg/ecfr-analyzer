# ยง 2.104   How will I know what decisions are appealable under this part?

(a) When an Indian Affairs official makes a decision that is subject to an appeal under this part, she or he will transmit the decision to interested parties by U.S. Mail or, upon request, by electronic mail. Unless the decision is immediately effective, and except for decisions that are subject to appeal to IBIA, the official will include the following notice of appeal rights at the end of the decision document:


(b) If a decision-maker issues a decision that does not include notice of appeal rights, the decision-maker will provide written notice of appeal rights and the decision may be appealed as follows:


(1) If the decision-maker discovers within 30 days of issuing the decision that the decision did not include notice of appeal rights, then the decision-maker will provide written notice of appeal rights to interested parties, and inform them that they may appeal the decision within 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice. If no appeal is filed by the new deadline, the interested parties will have failed to exhaust administrative remedies as required by this part and the decision will become effective.


(2) If the decision-maker does not discover within 30 days of issuing the decision that the decision did not include notice of appeal rights and no administrative appeal is filed within 30 days of the issuance of the decision, then the decision becomes effective 31 days after it was issued.


(3) If the decision-maker discovers, more than 30 days but less than 365 days, after the date of the decision that the decision did not include notice of appeal rights, then the decision-maker will immediately notify the interested parties that the decision was issued without the requisite notice of appeal rights. If the decision has not actually been implemented, the decision-maker shall stay the implementation of the decision and reissue the decision with the appeal rights notice as provided in this section. If the decision has been implemented, the decision maker shall notify the interested parties of that fact, and notify them that they may file a challenge to the decision in Federal court, or pursue the administrative appeal process set out in this section.
