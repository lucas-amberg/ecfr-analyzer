# ยง 2.207   Do I have to send the Notice of Appeal to anyone other than the reviewing official?

(a) Yes. You must provide copies of your Notice of Appeal to the decision-maker and all interested parties known to you. If you are an individual Indian and are not represented by an attorney, you may request that we make the copies for you and mail your appeal documents to all interested parties.


(b) If you are appealing to the IBIA, you must also send a copy of your Notice of Appeal to the AS-IA and to the Associate Solicitor for Indian Affairs at the same time you send the appeal to the IBIA.
