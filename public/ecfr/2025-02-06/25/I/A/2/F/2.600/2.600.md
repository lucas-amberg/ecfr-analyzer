# ยง 2.600   May I compel an agency official to take action?

(a) Yes. If a decision-maker fails to take action on a written request for action that you believe the decision-maker is required to take, you may make the decision-maker's inaction the subject of appeal.


(b) Before filing an appeal with the next official in the decision-maker's chain of command, you must:


(1) Send a written request to the decision-maker, asking that he or she take the action originally asked of him or her;


(2) Identify the statute, regulation, or other source of law that you believe requires the decision-maker to take the action being requested;


(3) Describe the interest adversely affected by the decision-maker's inaction, including a description of the loss, impairment or impediment of such interest caused by the inaction; and


(4) State that, unless the decision-maker either takes action on the written request within 15 days of receipt of your request, or establishes a date by which a decision will be made, you will appeal the decision-maker's inaction in accordance with this subpart.


(c) You must include a copy of your original request to the decision-maker, or other documentation establishing the date and nature of the original request.
