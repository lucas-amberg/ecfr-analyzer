# Appendix to Chapter Iâ€”Extension of the Trust or Restricted Status of Certain Indian Lands


This appendix contains citations of Executive orders and acts of Congress continuing the trust or restricted period of Indian land, which would have expired otherwise, within the several Indian reservations in the States named. The asterisk to the left of the name of a reservation indicates that the reservation is subject to the benefits of the Indian Reorganization Act of June 18, 1934 (48 Stat. 984; 25 U.S.C. 461-479), as amended, and as therein provided the trust or restricted period of the land is extended indefinitely. Where the name of a reservation is not preceded by an asterisk, such reservation is not subject to the Reorganization Act and is not subject to the benefits of such indefinite trust or restricted period extension, but such reservation is dependent upon acts of Congress or Executive orders for extension of the trust or restricted period of the land.


For the purpose of insuring the continuation of the trust or restricted status of Indian allotments within Indian reservations not subject to the Reorganization Act, Congress by the act of June 15, 1935 (49 Stat. 378) reimposed such restrictions as may have been expired between the dates of June 18, 1934, and December 31, 1936.


Pursuant to act of June 21, 1906 (34 Stat. 325) extending trust or other period of restriction contained in patents issued to Indians for land on the public domain, the following orders have been promulgated:


No further separate orders covering extension of trust periods on public domain allotments were issued subsequent to Executive Order 3365 of December 7, 1920. The trust or other periods of restriction contained in patents issued to Indians for land on the public domain have thereafter been extended by the terms of the general Executive orders.


Beginning with Executive Order 6498, issued December 15, 1933, regardless of the location of the allotments, all trust or restrictive periods on allotments expiring on a given date have been extended by one general Executive order issued annually.
