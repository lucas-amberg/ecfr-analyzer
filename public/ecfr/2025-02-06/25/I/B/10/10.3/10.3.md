# § 10.3   Who must follow these policies and standards?

You must follow these minimum policies, standards, and guides if you are part of the BIA or tribal detention or rehabilitation program receiving Federal funding. Self-governance tribes and tribes with limited jurisdiction are encouraged to follow the regulations in this part, and other BIA manuals and handbooks. Detention officers, guards, cooks and other staff conducting business in the facilities must meet minimum standards of law enforcement personnel as prescribed in 25 CFR part 12, subpart D, “Qualifications and Training Requirements.” Those tribal programs not receiving Federal funding under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (Public Law 93-638, as amended) who wish to be accredited are encouraged to use the policies and standards in that part since they have been modified and approved for Indian country.
