(a) If a minor has been adjudged a minor-in-need-of-care, the children's court may:


(1) Permit the minor to remain with his or her parents, guardian or custodian subject to such limitations and conditions as the court may prescribe; or, if reasonable efforts to have the minor return or remain in his or her own home are unsuccessful, the children's court may make whichever of the following dispositions is in the best interest of the minor;


(2) Place the minor with a relative within the boundaries of the reservation subject to such limitations and conditions as the court may prescribe;


(3) Place the minor in a foster home within the boundaries of the reservation which has been approved by the tribe subject to such limitations and conditions as the court may prescribe;


(4) Place the minor in shelter care facilities designated by the court;


(5) Place the minor in a foster home or a relative's home outside the boundaries of the reservation subject to such limitations and conditions as the court may prescribe; or


(6) Recommend that termination proceedings begin.


(b) Whenever a minor is placed in a home or facility located outside the boundaries of the reservation, the court may require the party receiving custody of the minor to sign an agreement that the minor will be returned to the court upon order of the court.


(c) The dispositional orders are to be in effect for the time limit set by the children's court, but no order may continue after the minor reaches 18 years of age, unless the dispositional order was made within six months of the minor's eighteenth birthday, in which case the disposition may not continue for more than six months.


(d) The dispositional orders are to be reviewed at the children's court discretion, but at least once every six months to determine the continuing need for and appropriateness of placement, to determine the extent of progress made, and to assess the probability of the minor's return to his or her home.


(e) A permanency planning hearing must be held within 18 months after the original placement and every six months thereafter to determine the future status of the minor except when the minor is returned to his or her home and court supervision ceases.
