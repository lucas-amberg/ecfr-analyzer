# ยง 12.53   Who investigates officer misconduct?

The Director, Office of Law Enforcement Services maintains an internal affairs program that investigates all allegations of misconduct by BIA officers, and any officer receiving funding and/or authority from the BIA. All allegations of misconduct must be thoroughly investigated and appropriate action taken when warranted. Any person having knowledge of officer misconduct must report that information to the officer's supervisor. The supervisor must immediately report allegations to the internal affairs unit. Depending upon the severity of the allegation, the matter may be dealt with locally or it will be investigated by the internal affairs unit. Failure of any BIA employee to report known allegations may be considered misconduct in itself. Citizens may report officer misconduct directly to the internal affairs unit if that is more practical.
