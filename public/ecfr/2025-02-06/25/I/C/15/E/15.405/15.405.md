# ยง 15.405   What happens if BIA identifies that property was incorrectly included in a decedent's inventory?

If, after issuance of a decision, BIA identifies certain trust or restricted property or an interest therein that was incorrectly included in a decedent's inventory, then BIA will submit a petition to OHA for an order notifying all heirs or devisees of the correction and addressing any changes in distribution of property resulting from the correction.


(a) The petition must identify the property that BIA removed from the estate and explain why the property should not have been included, and must include the following:


(1) A newly issued certified inventory describing the trust or restricted land remaining in decedent's estate, if applicable;


(2) A copy of the decision, or modification or distribution order and corresponding inventory issued in the probate case from which BIA discovered that the property was incorrectly included in the decedent's estate, if applicable;


(3) A statement identifying each property in the decedent's estate that decreased the total share of the ownership of the allotment to less than 5 percent as a result of the removal of property from the estate; and


(4) A certification that all interested parties have been associated to the case and their names and addresses are current.


(b) BIA may submit the petition at any time after issuance of the decision.


(c) BIA must send a copy of the petition and all supporting documentation to each interested party at the time of filing and include certification of service.
