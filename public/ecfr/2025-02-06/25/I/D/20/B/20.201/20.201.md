# ยง 20.201   How does the Bureau designate a service area and what information is required?

The Assistant Secretary can designate or modify service areas for a tribe. If you are a tribe requesting a service area designation, you must submit each of the following: 


(a) A tribal resolution that certifies that: 


(1) All eligible Indians residing within the service area will be served; and


(2) The proposed service area will not include counties or parts thereof that have reasonably available comparable services. 


(b) Additional documentation showing that: 


(1) The area is administratively feasible (that is, an adequate level of services can be provided to the eligible Indians residing in the area.); 


(2) No duplication of services exists; and


(3) A plan describing how services will be provided to all eligible Indians can be implemented. 


(c) Documentation should be sent to the Regional Director or Office of Self-Governance.


The Director or office will evaluate the information and make recommendations to the Assistant Secretary. The Assistant Secretary can make a determination to approve or disapprove and publish notice of the designation of service area and the Indians to be served in the _Federal Register._ Tribes currently providing services are not required to request designation for service areas unless they make a decision to modify their existing service areas.
