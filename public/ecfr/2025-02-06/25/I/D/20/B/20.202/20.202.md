# ยง 20.202   What is a tribal redesign plan?

If you are a tribe administering a general assistance program, you can develop and submit to us a tribal redesign plan to change the way that you administer the program. 


(a) A tribal redesign plan allows a tribe to: 


(1) Change eligibility for general assistance in the service area; or


(2) Change the amount of general assistance payments for individuals within the service area. 


(b) If you develop a tribal redesign plan it must: 


(1) Treat all persons in the same situation equally; and


(2) Will not result in additional expenses for the Bureau solely because of any increased level of payments.
