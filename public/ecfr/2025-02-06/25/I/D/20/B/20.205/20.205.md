# ยง 20.205   Can tribes change eligibility criteria or levels of payments for General Assistance?

Yes, if you have a redesign plan, you can change eligibility criteria or levels of payment for general assistance. 


(a) The funding level for your redesigned general assistance program will be the same funding received in the most recent fiscal or calendar year, whichever applies. 


(b) If you do not have a prior year level of funding, the Bureau or Office of Self-Governance will establish a tentative funding level based upon best estimates for caseload and expenditures. 


(c) A Bureau servicing office can administer a tribal redesign plan as requested by a tribal resolution.
