# ยง 23.52   Grant suspension.

(a) When a grantee has materially failed to comply and remains out of compliance with the terms and conditions of the grant, the grants officer may, after reasonable notice to the grantee and the provision of requested technical assistance, suspend the grant. The notice preceding the suspension shall include the effective date of the suspension, the corrective measures necessary for reinstatement of the grant and, if there is no immediate threat to safety, a reasonable timeframe for corrective action prior to actual suspension. 


(b) No obligation incurred by the grantee during the period of suspension shall be allowable under the suspended grant, except that the grants officer may at his/her discretion allow necessary and proper costs which the grantee could not reasonably avoid during the period of suspension if such costs would otherwise be allowable under the applicable cost principles. 


(c) Appropriate adjustments to the payments under the suspended grant will be made either by withholding the payments or by not allowing the grantee credit for disbursements which the grantee may make in liquidation of unauthorized obligations the grantee incurs during the period of suspension. 


(d) Suspension shall remain in effect until the grantee has taken corrective action to the satisfaction of the grants officer, or given assurances satisfactory to the grants officer that corrective action will be taken, or until the grants officer cancels the grant.
