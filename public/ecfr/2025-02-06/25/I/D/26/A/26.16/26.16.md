# ยง 26.16   If I am awarded financial assistance, how much will I receive?

(a) The amount of financial assistance you receive depends on your unmet needs. If applicable, you should apply for:


(1) A Pell Grant if your training institution offers this grant; and


(2) Other education grants or loans for which you may qualify.


(b) The Bureau or tribal service provider will award financial assistance up to the level of your unmet need to the extent resources are available. It is possible that the combination of available financial assistance will not equal your financial need.
