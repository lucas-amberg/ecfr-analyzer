(3) Identifies all financial resources and defines the employment or training objective and activities planned to reach the objective; and


(4) Outlines how the applicant will participate in job placement, where resources will allow.


(b) The employer's job information and offer should be attached to the ISP, which becomes a part of the application (and supporting documents).
