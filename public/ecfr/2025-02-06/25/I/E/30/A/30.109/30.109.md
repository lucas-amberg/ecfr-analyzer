# § 30.109   How will the Secretary include English learners in academic content assessments?

(a) *English learners.* English learners must be:


(1) Assessed in a valid and reliable manner; and


(2) Provided appropriate accommodations on assessments administered including, to the extent practicable, assessments in the language and form most likely to yield accurate data on what the students know and can do in academic content areas, until the students have achieved English language proficiency, consistent with standardized BIE-determined exit procedures.


(b) *Language or form of assessment.* Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2) of this section, BIE-funded schools must provide for assessments (using tests in English) of reading or language arts of any student who has attended school in the United States for three (3) or more consecutive school years, except that if the BIE-funded school determines, on a case-by-case individual basis, that academic assessments in another language or form would likely yield more accurate and reliable information on what the student knows and can do, the BIE-funded school may make a determination to assess the student in the appropriate language other than English for a period that does not exceed two (2) additional consecutive years, provided that the student has not yet reached a level of English language proficiency sufficient to yield valid and reliable information on what the student knows and can do on tests (written in English) of reading or language arts. This requirement does not permit either the BIE or BIE-funded schools to exempt English learners from participating in the BIE's assessment system.


(c) *BIE responsibilities.* The BIE must:


(1) Disseminate information and resources regarding English learners to, at a minimum, BIE-funded schools, and parents;


(2) Promote the use of accommodations for English learners to ensure that all English learners are able to participate in academic instruction and assessments; and


(3) Provide technical assistance when requested in writing.


(d) *Exception for recently arrived English learners.* With respect to recently arrived English learners who have been enrolled in a school in one of the 50 States in the United States or the District of Columbia for less than twelve (12) months, the BIE may choose to:


(1) Exclude:


(i) The English learner from one administration of the reading or language arts assessment required under § 30.105; and


(ii) The English learner's results on any of the assessments required under § 30.105(b)(5)(i) or § 30.110 for the first year of the English learner's enrollment in the school for the purposes of the BIE-determined accountability system under § 30.111; or


(2) Assess, and report the performance of:


(i) The English learner on the reading or language arts and mathematics assessments required under § 30.105(b)(5)(i) in each year of the student's enrollment in such a school; and


(ii) For the purposes of the BIE-determined accountability system:


(A) For the first year of the student's enrollment in the school, exclude the results on the assessments described in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section;


(B) Include a measure of student growth on the assessments described in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section in the second year of the student's enrollment in the school; and


(C) Include proficiency on the assessments in reading or language arts and mathematics described in this paragraph (d) in the third year of the student's enrollment in such a school, and each succeeding year of enrollment.


(e) *English learner subgroup.* With respect to a student previously identified as an English learner and for not more than four (4) years after the student ceases to be identified as an English learner, the BIE may include the results of the student's academic content assessments within the English learner subgroup of the subgroups of students as defined in § 30.101 for the purposes of the BIE-determined accountability system.
