# ยง 30.112   May a tribal governing body or school board waive the Secretary's requirements for standards, assessments, and an accountability system?

Yes. A tribal governing body or school board may waive the Secretary's requirements for standards, assessments, and an accountability system in part or in whole, and the tribal governing body or school board's alternative requirements will apply if they meet the requirements of section 1111, taking into account the unique circumstances and needs of the applicable school or schools and the students served by such school or schools, and are approved by the Secretary and the Secretary of Education. If the Secretary and the Secretary of Education do not approve the tribal governing body or school board's proposal for alternative requirements, the Secretary's requirements under this part continue to apply. Depending on the nature and content of such proposals for alternative requirements, and subject to the availability of appropriations, alternative requirements will generally be effective in the school year following the school year they are approved. Where a tribal governing body or school board proposes to use existing State requirements, approval of the use of such requirements is dependent upon the agreement of the applicable State.
