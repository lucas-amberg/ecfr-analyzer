# § 30.122   How will the Secretary implement requirements for targeted support and improvement activities?

(b) Each school that has been notified must develop and implement, in partnership with stakeholders (including principals and other school leaders, teachers, and parents), a school-level targeted support and improvement plan to improve student outcomes based on the BIE's indicators for each subgroup of students that was the subject of such notification that:


(1) Is informed by all indicators described in § 30.111(f), including performance against long-term goals described in § 30.111(d);


(2) Includes evidence-based interventions;


(3) Is approved by the BIE prior to implementation of such plan;


(4) Is monitored by the BIE, upon submission and implementation; and


(5) Results in additional action following unsuccessful implementation of such plan after a number of years determined by the BIE.
