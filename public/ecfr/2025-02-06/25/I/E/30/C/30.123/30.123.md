# ยง 30.123   How will the Secretary implement requirements to identify schools for additional targeted support?

(a) The BIE will identify for additional support and improvement each school with one (1) or more subgroups that is performing as poorly as the lowest-performing five (5) percent of all Title I schools identified for comprehensive support and improvement in the BIE system using the BIE's system of annual meaningful differentiation of schools described in ยง 30.111(g).


(b) Each school identified for additional targeted support and improvement must develop and implement a school-level targeted support and improvement plan and identify resource inequities (which may include a review of BIE-funded school level budgeting), to be addressed through implementation of the plan.
