# ยง 30.124   How will the Secretary implement continued support for Bureau-funded schools and school improvement?

(a) The Secretary will establish exit criteria for:


(1) Schools identified for comprehensive support and improvement, which, if not satisfied within a BIE-determined number of years (not to exceed four (4) years), will result in more rigorous BIE-determined action, such as implementation of interventions (which may include addressing school-level operations); and


(2) Schools identified for additional targeted support, which, if not satisfied within a BIE-determined number of years, will, in the case of schools receiving Title I funds, result in identification of the school by the BIE for comprehensive support and improvement.


(b) The Secretary will also periodically review resource allocation to support school improvement.
