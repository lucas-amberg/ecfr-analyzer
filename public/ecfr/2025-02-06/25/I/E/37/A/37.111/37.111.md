# ยง 37.111   What role does a tribe have in issues relating to school boundaries?

A tribal governing body may:


(a) Establish and revise geographical attendance boundaries for all but ORB schools;


(b) Authorize ISEP-eligible students, residing within the tribe's jurisdiction, to receive transportation funding to attend schools outside the geographic attendance area in which the student lives; and


(c) Authorize tribal member students who are ISEP-eligible and are not residing within the tribe's jurisdiction to receive transportation funding to attend schools outside the student's geographic attendance area.
