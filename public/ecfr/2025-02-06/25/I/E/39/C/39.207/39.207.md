# ยง 39.207   How does OIEP determine a school's funding for the school year?

To determine a school's funding for the school year, OIEP uses the following seven-step process:


(a) *Step 1.* Multiply the appropriate base academic and/or residential weight from ยง 39.103 by the number of students in each grade level category.


(b) *Step 2.* Multiply the number of students eligible for supplemental program funding under ยง 39.107 by the weights for the program.


(c) *Step 3.* Calculate the school-based supplemental weights under ยง 639.107.


(d) *Step 4.* Add together the sums obtained in steps 1 through 3 to obtain each school's total WSU.


(e) *Step 5.* Add together the total WSUs for all Bureau-funded schools.


(f) *Step 6.* Calculate the value of a WSU by dividing the current school year's funds by the average total WSUs as calculated under step 5 for the previous 3 years.


(g) *Step 7.* Multiply each school's WSU total by the base value of one WSU to determine funding for that school.
