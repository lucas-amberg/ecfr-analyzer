To calculate the total annual bus transportation miles for day students, a school must use the appropriate formula from this section. In the formulas, Tu = Miles driven on Tuesday of the transportation mileage count week, W = Miles driven on Wednesday of the transportation mileage count week, and Th = Miles driven on Thursday of the transportation mileage count week.


(a) For ISEP-eligible day students whose route is entirely over improved roads, calculate miles using the following formula: 


(b) For ISEP-eligible day students whose route is partly over unimproved roads, calculate miles using the following three steps.


(1) *Step 1.* Apply the following formula to miles driven over improved roads only: 


(2) *Step 2.* Apply the following formula to miles driven over unimproved roads only: 


(3) *Step 3.* Add together the sums from steps 1 and 2 to obtain the total annual transportation miles.
