To calculate the total annual transportation miles for residential students, a school must use the procedures in paragraph (b) of this section.


(a) The school can receive funds for the following trips:


(1) Transportation to the school at the start of the school year;


(2) Round trip home at Christmas; and


(3) Return trip to home at the end of the school year.


(b) To calculate the actual miles driven to transport students from home to school at the start of the school year, add together the miles driven for all buses used to transport students from their homes to the school. If a school transports students over unimproved roads, the school must separate the number of miles driven for each bus into improved miles and unimproved miles. The number of miles driven is the sum of:


(1) The number of miles driven on improved roads; and


(2) The number of miles driven on unimproved roads multiplied by 1.2.


(c) The annual miles driven for each school is the sum of the mileage from paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section multiplied by 4.
