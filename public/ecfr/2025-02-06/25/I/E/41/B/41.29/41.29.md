# ยง 41.29   How will a grant be awarded?

If the Director approves the Tribal college's or university's application, the BIE will send the Tribal college or university a grant agreement that incorporates the Tribal college's or university's application and the provisions required by ยง 41.25. The Tribal college or university grant will be for the fiscal year starting after the approval date of the application.


(a) The BIE will generally calculate the amount of the Tribal college or university grant using the following procedure:


(1) Begin with a base amount of $8,000 (adjusted annually for inflation);


(2) Multiply the base amount by the number of FTE Indian students in attendance during each academic term; and


(3) Divide the resulting sum by the number of academic terms in the academic year.


(b) All grants under this section are subject to availability of appropriations.


(c) If there are insufficient funds to pay the amount calculated under paragraph (a) of this section, BIE will reduce the grant amount awarded to each eligible Tribal college or university on a pro rata basis.
