# ยง 42.10   How must the school communicate individual student rights to students, parents or guardians, and staff?

Each school must:


(a) Develop a student handbook that includes local school policies, definitions of suspension, expulsion, zero tolerance, and other appropriate terms, and a copy of the regulations in this part;


(b) Provide all school staff a current and updated copy of student rights and responsibilities before the first day of each school year;


(c) Provide all students and their parents or guardians a current and updated copy of student rights and responsibilities every school year upon enrollment; and


(d) Require students, school staff, and to the extent possible, parents and guardians, to confirm in writing that they have received a copy and understand the student rights and responsibilities.
