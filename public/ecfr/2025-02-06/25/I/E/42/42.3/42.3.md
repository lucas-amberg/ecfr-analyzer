# ยง 42.3   How should a school address alleged violations of school policies?

(a) In addressing alleged violations of school policies, each school must consider, to the extent appropriate, the reintegration of the student into the school community. 


(b) The school may address a student violation using alternative dispute resolution (ADR) processes or the formal disciplinary process.


(1) When appropriate, the school should first attempt to use the ADR processes described in ยง 42.4 that may allow resolution of the alleged violation without recourse to punitive action.


(2) Where ADR processes do not resolve matters or cannot be used, the school must address the alleged violation through a formal disciplinary proceeding under ยง 42.7 consistent with the due process rights described in ยง 42.7.
