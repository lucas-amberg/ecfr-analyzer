# ยง 63.11   What is a determination of suitability for employment and efficiency of service?

(a) *Determinations of suitability measure the fitness or eligibility* of an applicant, volunteer, or employee for a particular position. Suitability for employment does not evaluate an applicant's education, skills, knowledge, experience, etc. Rather, it requires that the employer investigate the background of each applicant, volunteer, and employee to: 


(1) Determine the degree of risk the applicant, volunteer, or employee brings to the position; and 


(2) Certify that the applicant's, volunteer's, or employee's past conduct would not interfere with his/her performance of duties, nor would it create an immediate or long-term risk for any Indian child. 


(b) *Efficiency of service* is the employer's verification that the applicant or employee is able to perform the duties and responsibilities of the position, and his/her presence on the job will not inhibit other employees or the agency from performing their functions.
