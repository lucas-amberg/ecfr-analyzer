# ยง 103.4   What kinds of loans will BIA guarantee or insure?

In general, BIA may guarantee or insure any loan made by an eligible lender to an eligible borrower to conduct a lawful business organized for profit. There are several important exceptions: 


(a) The business must contribute to the economy of an Indian reservation or tribal service area recognized by BIA; 


(b) The borrower may not use the loan for relending purposes; 


(c) If any portion of the loan is used to refinance an existing loan, the borrower must be current on the existing loan; and 


(d) BIA may not guarantee or insure a loan if it believes the lender would be willing to extend the requested financing without a BIA guaranty or insurance coverage.
