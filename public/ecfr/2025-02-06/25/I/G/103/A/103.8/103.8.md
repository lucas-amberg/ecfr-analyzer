# ยง 103.8   Is there any cost for a BIA guaranty or insurance coverage?

BIA charges the lender a premium for a guaranty or insurance coverage. 


(a) The premium is: 


(1) Two percent of the portion of the original loan principal amount that BIA guarantees; or 


(2) One percent of the portion of the original loan principal amount that BIA insures, without considering the 15 percent aggregate outstanding principal limitation on the lender's insured loans. 


(b) Lenders may pass the cost of the premium on to the borrower, either by charging a one-time fee or by adding the cost to the principal amount of the borrower's loan. Adding the premium to the principal amount of the loan will not make any further premium due. BIA will guarantee or insure the additional principal to the same extent as the original approved principal amount.
