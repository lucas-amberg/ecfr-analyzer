# ยง 115.416   Will the United States post office forward mail regarding a minor's supervised account to a forwarding address left with the United States post office?

(a) Federal law does not allow the United States post office to forward checks that are issued by the federal government. Therefore, a check from a minor's supervised account will not be forwarded to an address left with the United States post office. The new address of record must be provided directly to BIA. 


(b) Where a forwarding address has been provided to the United States post office, the United States post office will forward a statement of performance and general correspondence regarding a minor's supervised account that is mailed to the minor's address of record for a limited time period. However, it is the responsibility of a custodial parent, legal guardian, or emancipated minor to give BIA the new address of record for the minor's supervised account.
