# ยง 115.425   What will we do if we find that a distribution plan has not been followed or an individual has acted improperly in regard to his or her duties involving a minor's trust funds?

If we find that a distribution plan has not been followed or that a custodial parent, a legal guardian, or the person who has been recognized by the BIA as having control and custody of the minor has failed to satisfactorily account for expenses or has not used the minor's funds for the primary benefit of the minor, we will: 


(a) Notify the individual; and 


(b) Take action to protect the interests of the minor, which may include: 


(1) Referring the matter for civil or criminal legal action; 


(2) Demanding repayment from the individual who has improperly expended trust funds or failed to account for the use of trust funds; 


(3) Liquidating a bond posted by the legal guardian, where applicable, to recover improperly expended trust funds up to the amount of the bond; or 


(4) Immediately modifying the distribution plan for up to sixty days, including suspending the authority of the individual to receive further disbursements.
