# ยง 115.609   Will you be allowed to present testimony and/or evidence at the hearing?

Yes, you or your guardian, as applicable, will be provided the opportunity to present testimony and/or evidence as to the reasons the BIA should not restrict your IIM account, including information showing how an encumbrance may create an undue financial hardship, if applicable. You may not challenge a court order or judgment in this proceeding. However, if you have appealed an order or judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction, you or your guardian, as applicable, may present evidence of your appeal and the BIA hearing will be postponed until there is a final order from the court. The restriction on your IIM account will remain in place until after the hearing is concluded.
