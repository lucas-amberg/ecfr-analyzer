(b) Encumber your IIM account. BIA will review your account balance and your future IIM income to develop a distribution plan that establishes the amount(s) to be paid and the dates payment(s) will be made to the specified party. Payments may need to be made over the course of one or more years if the amount owed to the specified party is greater than your current IIM account balance.
