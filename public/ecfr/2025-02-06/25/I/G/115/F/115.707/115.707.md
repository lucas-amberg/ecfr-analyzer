# ยง 115.707   Will the Secretary accept administrative fees for deposit into a trust account?

No. The Secretary will not accept administrative fees for deposit into a trust account because administrative fees are not trust funds. However, administrative fees may be deposited into a non-interest bearing, non-trust account with the BIA.
