# ยง 115.805   If a tribe is paid directly under a contract for the sale or use of trust assets, will we accept those trust funds for deposit into a tribal trust account?

If a contract for the sale or use of trust assets specifies that payments are to be made directly to a tribe, we will not accept these trust funds into a tribal trust account. Where a tribe under 25 U.S.C. 450f *et seq.* has contracted or compacted with the federal government to operate a federal program and the tribe, operating the federal program on behalf of the Secretary, receives trust funds for the sale or use of trust assets pursuant to a contract that specifies that payments are to be made to the Secretary on behalf of a tribe or an individual [the owner of the trust assets], the tribe must follow ยง 115.708 for the deposit of the trust funds into the trust account.
