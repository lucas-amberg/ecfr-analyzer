# ยง 115.808   Could trust fund investments made by OTFM lose money?

The value of trust fund investments made by OTFM will vary depending on the type of investment and, including but not limited to, the following: 


(a) Current interest rates; 


(b) Whether the security/investment is held to its maturity; and 


(c) Original purchase price. 


However, as long as the purchase price of the security/investment is made at or below face value and the security/investment is held until maturity or payoff, the security/investment will not lose principal invested funds.
