# ยง 115.813   Is there a limit to the amount of trust funds OTFM will disburse from a tribal trust account?

OTFM will only disburse the available balance of the trust funds in a tribal trust account in accordance with a use and distribution plan, if applicable, and will not overdraw a tribal trust account. If a tribe's trust funds are invested in securities that have not matured, OTFM will only sell the asset to make cash available to the tribe if: 


(a) There are no restrictions against the sale, and 


(b) A tribe provides OTFM with a tribal resolution stating that: 


(1) The security must be sold; 


(2) The tribe acknowledges that they may incur a penalty when the security is sold; and 


(3) The tribe acknowledges that the security may lose value if it is sold prior to maturity.
