# ยง 142.6   How are the rates and conditions for the Alaska Resupply Operation established?

The Manager must develop tariff rates using the best modeling techniques available to ensure the most economical service to the Alaska Natives, Indian or Native owned businesses, profit or nonprofit Alaska Native corporations, Native cooperatives or organizations, or such other groups or individuals as may be sponsored by any Native or Indian organization, without enhancing the Federal treasury. 


(a) The Area Director's approval of the tariff constitutes a final action for the Department for the purpose of establishing billing rates. 


(b) The Bureau must issue a supplemental bill to cover excess cost in the event that the actual cost of a specific freight substantially exceeds the tariff price. 


(c) If the income from the tariff substantially exceeds actual costs, a prorated payment will be issued to the shipper.
