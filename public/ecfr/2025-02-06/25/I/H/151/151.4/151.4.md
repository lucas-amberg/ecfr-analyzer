# § 151.4   How will the Secretary determine that statutory authority exists to acquire land in trust status?

When a Tribe's application relies on the first definition of “Indian” in the Indian Reorganization Act of June 18, 1934 (48 Stat. 984; 25 U.S.C. 5101 *et seq.*) (IRA) to establish statutory authority for the proposed acquisition, the Secretary will apply the following criteria to determine whether the Tribe was under Federal jurisdiction in 1934.


(a) In determining whether a Tribe was “under Federal jurisdiction” in 1934 within the meaning of section 19 of the IRA (48 Stat. 988; 25 U.S.C. 5129), the Secretary shall consider evidence of Federal jurisdiction in the manner provided in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.


(1) Conclusive evidence establishes in and of itself both that a Tribe was placed under Federal jurisdiction and that this jurisdiction remained intact in 1934. If such evidence exists, no further analysis under this section is needed. The following is conclusive evidence that a Tribe was under Federal jurisdiction in 1934:


(i) A vote under section 18 of the IRA (48 Stat. 988; 25 U.S.C. 5125) to accept or reject the IRA as recorded in *Ten Years of Tribal Government Under I.R.A.,* Theodore Haas, United States Indian Service (Jan. 1947) (Haas List) or other Federal government document;


(ii) Land held in trust by the United States for the Tribe in 1934.


(iii) Secretarial approval of a Tribal constitution under section 16 of the IRA as recorded in the Haas List or other Federal Government document;


(iv) Secretarial approval of a charter of incorporation issued to a Tribe under section 17 of the IRA as recorded in the Haas List or other Federal Government document;


(v) An Executive Order for a specific Tribe that was still in effect in 1934;


(vi) Treaties to which a Tribe is a party, ratified by the United States and still in effect as to that party in 1934;


(vii) Continuing existence in 1934 or later of treaty rights guaranteed by a treaty ratified by the United States; or


(viii) Other evidence that the Secretary determines is conclusive in a particular case.


(2) Presumptive evidence is indicative that a Tribe was placed under Federal jurisdiction in or before 1934 and may indicate that such jurisdiction remained intact in 1934. In the absence of evidence indicating that Federal jurisdiction did not exist or did not exist in 1934, presumptive evidence satisfies the analysis under this section. The following is presumptive evidence that a Tribe was under Federal jurisdiction in 1934:


(i) Evidence of treaty negotiations or evidence a Tribe signed a treaty with the United States whether or not such treaty was ratified by Congress;


(ii) Listing of a Tribe in the Department of the Interior's 1934 Indian Population Report;


(iii) Evidence that the United States took efforts to acquire lands on behalf of a Tribe in the years leading up to the passage of the IRA;


(iv) Inclusion in Volume V of Charles J. Kappler's *Indian Affairs, Laws and Treaties;*

(v) Federal legislation for a specific Tribe, including land claim settlements and termination legislation enacted after 1934, which acknowledges the existence of a government-to-government relationship with a Tribe in or before 1934; or


(vi) Satisfaction of the criterion for Federal acknowledgment now located at 25 CFR 83.11(a) and previously located at 25 CFR 83.7(a), requiring that a Tribe “has been identified as an American Indian entity on a substantially continuous basis,” through evidence that brought the Tribe under Federal jurisdiction in or before 1934; or


(vii) Other evidence that the Secretary determines is presumptive in a particular case.


(3) In the absence of evidence identified above as conclusive or presumptive evidence, the Secretary may find that a Tribe was under Federal jurisdiction in 1934 when the United States in 1934 or at some point in the Tribe's history prior to 1934, took an action or series of actions that, when viewed in concert through a course of dealings or other relevant acts on behalf of a Tribe, or in some instances Tribal members, establishes or generally reflects Federal obligations, or duties, responsibility for or authority over the Tribe, and that such jurisdictional status remained intact in 1934.


(i) Examples of Federal actions that exhibit probative evidence of Federal jurisdiction may include but are not limited to, the Department's acquisition of land for a Tribe in implementing the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, efforts by the Federal Government to conduct a vote under section 18 of the IRA to accept or reject the IRA where no vote was held, the attendance of Tribal members at Bureau of Indian Affairs operated schools, Federal decisions regarding whether to remove or not remove a Tribe from its homelands, the inclusion of a Tribe in Federal reports and surveys, the inclusion of a Tribe or Tribal members in Federal census records prepared by the Office of Indian Affairs, the approval of contracts between a Tribe and non-Indians; enforcement of the Trade and Intercourse Acts (Indian trader, liquor laws, and land transactions), and the provision of health and social services to a Tribe or Tribal members.


(ii) [Reserved]


(4) When a Tribe is recognized under the 25 CFR part 83 process, the Secretary may rely on any evidence within the part 83 record that the Tribe was under Federal jurisdiction in or before 1934, consistent with § 151.4(a)(2) and (3).


(5) Evidence of executive officials disavowing Federal jurisdiction over a Tribe in certain instances is not conclusive evidence of a Tribe's Federal jurisdictional status. This is because such disavowals cannot themselves revoke Federal jurisdiction over a Tribe.


(b) For some Tribes, Congress enacted legislation after 1934 making the IRA applicable to the Tribe. The existence of such legislation making the IRA and its trust acquisition provisions applicable to a Tribe eliminates the need to determine whether a Tribe was under Federal jurisdiction in 1934.


(c) In order to be eligible for trust acquisitions under section 5 of the IRA, no additional “under Federal jurisdiction” analysis is required under this part for Tribes for which the Department has previously issued an analysis finding the Tribe was under Federal jurisdiction.


(d) Land may be acquired in trust status for an individual Indian or a Tribe in the State of Oklahoma under section 5 of the IRA if the acquisition comes within the terms of this part. This authority is in addition to all other statutory authority for such an acquisition.


(e) The Secretary may also acquire land in trust status for an individual Indian or a Tribe under this part when specifically authorized by Federal law other than section 5 of the IRA, subject to any limitations contained in that Federal law.
