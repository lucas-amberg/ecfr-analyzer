# ยง 161.5   Can BIA waive the application of this part?

Yes. If a provision of this part conflicts with the objectives of the agricultural resource management plan provided for in ยง 161.200, or with a tribal law, BIA may waive the application of this part unless the waiver would either:


(a) Constitute a violation of a federal statute or judicial decision; or


(b) Conflict with BIA's general trust responsibility under federal law.
