Navajo Nation laws generally apply to land under the jurisdiction of the Navajo Nation, except to the extent that those Navajo Nation laws are inconsistent with this part or other applicable federal law. This part may be superseded or modified by Navajo Nation laws with Secretarial approval, however, so long as:


(a) The Navajo Nation laws are consistent with the enacting Navajo Nation's governing documents;


(b) The Navajo Nation has notified BIA of the superseding or modifying effect of the Navajo Nation laws;


(c) The superseding or modifying of the regulation would not violate a federal statute or judicial decision, or conflict with the Secretary's general trust responsibility under federal law; and


(d) The superseding or modifying of the regulation applies only to Navajo Partitioned Lands.
