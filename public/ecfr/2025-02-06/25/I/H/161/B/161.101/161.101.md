# ยง 161.101   How will tribal laws be enforced on the Navajo Partitioned Lands?

(a) Unless prohibited by federal law, BIA will recognize and comply with tribal laws regulating activities on the Navajo Partitioned Lands, including tribal laws relating to land use, environmental protection, and historic or cultural preservation.


(b) While the Navajo Nation is primarily responsible for enforcing tribal laws pertaining to the Navajo Partitioned Lands, BIA will:


(1) Assist in the enforcement of Navajo Nation laws;


(2) Provide notice of Navajo Nation laws to persons or entities undertaking activities on the Navajo Partitioned Lands; and


(3) Require appropriate federal officials to appear in tribal forums when requested by the tribe, so long as the appearance would not:


(i) Be inconsistent with the restrictions on employee testimony set forth at 43 CFR part 2, subpart E;


(ii) Constitute a waiver of the sovereign immunity of the United States; or


(iii) Authorize or result in a review of (BIA) actions by the tribal court.


(c) Where the provisions in this subpart are inconsistent with a Navajo Nation law, but the provisions cannot be superseded or modified by the Navajo Nation laws under ยง 161.5, BIA may waive the provisions under part 1 of 25 CFR, so long as the new waiver does not violate a federal statute or judicial decision or conflict with the Secretary's trust responsibility under federal law.
