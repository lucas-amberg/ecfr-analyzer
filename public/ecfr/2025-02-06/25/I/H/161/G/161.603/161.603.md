# ยง 161.603   Can mediation be used in the event of a permit violation or dispute?

A permit may provide for permit disputes or violations to be resolved with the District Grazing Committee through mediation.


(a) The District Grazing Committee will conduct the mediation before the Navajo Nation's appropriate hearing body, before BIA invokes any cancellation remedies.


(b) Conducting the mediation may substitute for permit cancellation. However, BIA retains the authority to cancel the permit under ยง 161.606.


(c) The Navajo Nation's appropriate hearing body decision will be final, unless it is appealed to the Navajo Nation Supreme Court on a question of law. BIA will defer to any ongoing proceedings, as appropriate, in deciding whether to exercise any of the remedies available to BIA under ยง 161.606.
