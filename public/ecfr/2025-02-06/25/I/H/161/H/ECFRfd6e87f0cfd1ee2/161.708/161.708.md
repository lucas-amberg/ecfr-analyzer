# ยง 161.708   How are trespassers notified of impoundments?

(a) If the trespass is not corrected in the time specified in the initial trespass notice, BIA will send written notice of its intent to impound unauthorized livestock or other property to:


(1) The unauthorized livestock or property owner or representative; and


(2) Any known lien holder of the unauthorized livestock or other property.


(b) If BIA determines that the owner of the unauthorized livestock or other property or the owner's representative is unknown or refuses delivery of the written notice, a public notice of intent to impound will be posted at the tribal community building, U.S. Post Office, and published in the local newspaper nearest to the Indian agricultural lands where the trespass is occurring.


(c) After BIA has given notice as described in ยง 161.707, unauthorized livestock or other property will be impounded without any further notice.
