# § 162.007   To what permits does this part apply?

(a) Permits for the use of Indian land do not require our approval; however, you must fulfill the following requirements:


(1) Ensure that permitted activities comply with all applicable environmental and cultural resource laws; and


(2) Submit all permits to the appropriate BIA office to allow us to maintain a copy of the permit in our records. If we determine within 10 days of submission that the document does not meet the definition of “permit” and grants a legal interest in Indian land, we will notify you that a lease is required.


(b) The following table provides examples of some common characteristics of permits versus leases.


(c) We will not administer or enforce permits on Indian land.


(d) We may grant permits for the use of Government land. The leasing regulations in this part will apply to such permits, as appropriate.
