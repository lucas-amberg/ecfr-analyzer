# ยง 162.020   May a lease combine tracts with different Indian landowners?

(a) We may approve a lease that combines multiple tracts of Indian land into a unit, if we determine that unitization is:


(1) In the Indian landowners' best interest; and


(2) Consistent with the efficient administration of the land.


(b) For a lease that covers multiple tracts, the minimum consent requirements apply to each tract separately.


(c) Unless the lease provides otherwise, the rent or other compensation will be prorated in proportion to the acreage each tract contributes to the entire lease. Once prorated per tract, the rent will be distributed to the owners of each tract based upon their respective percentage interest in that particular tract.
