(a) To support the Indian landowners in their negotiations, and to assist in our consideration of whether an agricultural lease is in the Indian landowners' best interest, we must determine the fair annual rental of the land prior to our grant or approval of the lease, unless the land may be leased at less than a fair annual rental under ยง 162.222(b) through (c) of this subpart. 


(b) A fair annual rental may be determined by competitive bidding, appraisal, or any other appropriate valuation method. Where an appraisal or other valuation is needed to determine the fair annual rental, the appraisal or valuation must be prepared in accordance with USPAP.
