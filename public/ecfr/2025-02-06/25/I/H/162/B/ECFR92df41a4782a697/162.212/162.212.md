# § 162.212   When will the BIA advertise Indian land for agricultural leases?

(a) We will generally advertise Indian land for agricultural leasing: 


(1) At the request of the Indian landowners; or 


(2) Before we grant a lease under § 162.209(b) of this subpart. 


(b) Advertisements will provide prospective tenants with notice of any superseding tribal laws and leasing policies that have been made applicable to the land under §§ 162.109 and 162.203 of this part, along with certain standard terms and conditions to be included in the lease. Advertisements will prohibit tenant preferences, and bidders at lease sales will not be afforded any preference, unless a preference in favor of individual Indians is required by a superseding tribal law or leasing policy. 


(c) Advertisements will require sealed bids, and they may also provide for further competitive bidding among the prospective tenants at the conclusion of the bid opening. Competitive bidding should be supported, at a minimum, by a market study or rent survey that is consistent with USPAP.
