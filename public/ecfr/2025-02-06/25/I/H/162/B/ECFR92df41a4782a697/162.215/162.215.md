# ยง 162.215   When will an agricultural lease be effective?

Unless otherwise provided in the lease, an agricultural lease will be effective on the date on which the lease is approved by us. An agricultural lease may be made effective on some past or future date, by agreement, but such a lease may not be approved more than one year prior to the date on which the lease term is to commence.
