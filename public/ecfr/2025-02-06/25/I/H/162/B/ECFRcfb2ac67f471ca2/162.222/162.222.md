(b) We will approve an agricultural lease of tribal land at a nominal rent, or at less than a fair annual rental, if such a rent is negotiated or established by the tribe. 


(c) We will approve an agricultural lease of individually-owned land at a nominal rent or at less than a fair annual rental, if: 


(1) The tenant is a member of the Indian landowner's immediate family, or a co-owner in the lease tract; or 


(2) The tenant is a cooperative or other legal entity in which the Indian landowners directly participate in the revenues or profits generated by the lease. 


(d) We will grant or approve a lease at less than a fair annual rental, as previously determined by an appraisal or some other appropriate valuation method, if the land is subsequently advertised and the tenant is the highest responsible bidder.
