# ยง 162.232   Can improvements be made under an agricultural lease?

An agricultural lease must generally describe the type and location of any improvements to be constructed by the lessee. Unless otherwise provided in the lease, any specific plans for the construction of those improvements will not require the consent of the Indian owners or our approval.
