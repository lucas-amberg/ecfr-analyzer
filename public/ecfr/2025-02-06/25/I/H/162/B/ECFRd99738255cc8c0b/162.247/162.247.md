# ยง 162.247   Will BIA notify a tenant when a rent payment is due under an agricultural lease?

We may issue bills or invoices to a tenant in advance of the dates on which rent payments are due under an agricultural lease, but the tenant's obligation to make such payments in a timely manner will not be excused if such bills or invoices are not delivered or received.
