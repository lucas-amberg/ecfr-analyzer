# ยง 162.321   How much rent must be paid under a residential lease of individually owned Indian land?

(a) A residential lease of individually owned Indian land must require payment of not less than fair market rental except that we may approve a lease of individually owned Indian land that provides for the payment of nominal rent, or less than a fair market rental, if:


(1) One hundred percent of the Indian landowners execute a written waiver of the right to receive fair market rental; or


(2) We waive the requirement under paragraph (c) of this section.


(b) We will require a valuation in accordance with ยง 162.322, unless:


(1) One hundred percent of the Indian landowners submit to us a written request to waive the valuation requirement; or


(2) We waive the requirement under paragraph (c) of this section.


(c) If the owners of the applicable percentage of interests under ยง 162.012 consent to a residential lease on behalf of all the Indian landowners of a fractionated tract, the lease must provide that the non-consenting Indian landowners (and those on whose behalf we have consented) receive fair market rental, as determined by a valuation, unless we waive the requirement because:


(1) The lessee is a co-owner who, as of January 4, 2013, has been residing on the tract for at least 7 years, and no other co-owner raises an objection to BIA by July 3, 2013 to the lessee's continued possession of the tract; or


(2) The tribe or lessee will construct infrastructure improvements on, or serving, the leased premises, and we determine it is in the best interest of all the landowners.
