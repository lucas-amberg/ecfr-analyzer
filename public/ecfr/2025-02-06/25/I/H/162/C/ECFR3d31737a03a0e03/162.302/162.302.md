# ยง 162.302   Is there a model residential lease form?

(a) We will make available one or more model lease forms that satisfy the formal requirements of this part, including, as appropriate, the model tribal lease form jointly developed by BIA, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and the Department of Agriculture. Use of a model lease form is not mandatory, provided all requirements of this part are met.


(b) If a model lease form prepared by us is not used by the parties to a residential lease, we will assist the Indian landowners, upon their request, in drafting lease provisions or in using tribal lease forms that conform to the requirements of this part.
