# ยง 162.315   How must a residential lease address ownership of permanent improvements?

(a) A residential lease must specify who will own any permanent improvements the lessee constructs during the lease term. In addition, the lease must indicate whether each specific permanent improvement the lessee constructs will:


(1) Remain on the leased premises upon expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease, in a condition satisfactory to the Indian landowners and become the property of the Indian landowners;


(2) Be removed within a time period specified in the lease, at the lessee's expense, with the leased premises to be restored as closely as possible to their condition before construction of the permanent improvements; or


(3) Be disposed of by other specified means.


(b) A lease that requires the lessee to remove the permanent improvements must also provide the Indian landowners with an option to take possession of and title to the permanent improvements if the improvements are not removed within the specified time period.
