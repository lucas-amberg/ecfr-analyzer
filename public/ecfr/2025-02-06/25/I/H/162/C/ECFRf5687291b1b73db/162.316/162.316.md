We may take appropriate enforcement action to ensure removal of the permanent improvements and restoration of the premises at the lessee's expense:


(a) In consultation with the tribe for tribal land or, where feasible, with Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land; and


(b) Before or after expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease.
