# ยง 162.512   How long may the term of a WEEL run?

(a) A WEEL must provide for a definite term, state if there is an option to renew and if so, provide for a definite term for the renewal period. WEELs are for project evaluation purposes, and therefore may have:


(1) An initial term that is no longer than 3 years; and


(2) One renewal period not to exceed 3 years.


(b) The exercise of the option to renew must be in writing and the WEEL must specify:


(1) The time and manner in which the option must be exercised or is automatically effective;


(2) That confirmation of the renewal will be submitted to us, unless the WEEL provides for automatic renewal; and


(3) Additional consideration, if any, that will be due upon the exercise of the option to renew or the start of the renewal term.
