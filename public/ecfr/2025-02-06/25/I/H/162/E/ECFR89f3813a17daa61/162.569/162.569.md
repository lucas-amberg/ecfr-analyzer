# ยง 162.569   Will BIA require an appeal bond for an appeal of a decision on a WSR lease document?

(a) If a party appeals our decision on a WSR lease, assignment, amendment, or sublease, then the official to whom the appeal is made may require the appellant to post an appeal bond in accordance with part 2 of this chapter. We will not require an appeal bond:


(1) For an appeal of a decision on a leasehold mortgage; or


(2) If the tribe is a party to the appeal and requests a waiver of the appeal bond.


(b) The appellant may not appeal the appeal bond decision. The appellant may, however, request that the official to whom the appeal is made reconsider the bond decision, based on extraordinary circumstances. Any reconsideration decision is final for the Department.
