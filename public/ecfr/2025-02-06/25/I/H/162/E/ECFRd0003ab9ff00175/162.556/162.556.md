# ยง 162.556   Will BIA notify a lessee when a payment is due under a WSR lease?

Upon request of the Indian landowners, we may issue invoices to a lessee in advance of the dates on which payments are due under a WSR lease. The lessee's obligation to make these payments in a timely manner will not be excused if invoices are not delivered or received.
