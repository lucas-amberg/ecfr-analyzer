# ยง 162.562   Must a lessee provide insurance for a WSR lease?

Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a lessee must provide insurance when necessary to protect the interests of Indian landowners and in the amount sufficient to protect all insurable permanent improvements on the leased premises.


(a) The insurance may include property, liability, and casualty insurance, depending on the Indian landowners' interests to be protected.


(b) Both the Indian landowners and the United States must be identified as additional insured parties.


(c) We may waive the requirement for insurance upon the request of the Indian landowner, if a waiver is in the best interest of the Indian landowner, including if the lease is for less than fair market rental or nominal compensation. For tribal land, we will defer, to the maximum extent possible, to the tribe's determination that a waiver is in its best interest.
