# ยง 162.503   Is there a model WEEL or WSR lease?

There is no model WEEL or WSR lease because of the need for flexibility in negotiating and writing WEELs and WSR leases; however, we may:


(a) Provide other guidance, such as checklists and sample lease provisions, to assist in the lease negotiation process; and


(b) Assist the Indian landowners, upon their request, in developing appropriate lease provisions or in using tribal lease forms that conform to the requirements of this part.
