# ยง 162.600   Crow Reservation.

(a) Notwithstanding the regulations in other sections of this part 162, Crow Indians classified as competent under the Act of June 4, 1920 (41 Stat. 751), as amended, may lease their trust lands and the trust lands of their minor children for farming or grazing purposes without the approval of the Secretary pursuant to the Act of May 26, 1926 (44 Stat. 658), as amended by the Act of March 15, 1948 (62 Stat. 80). However, at their election Crow Indians classified as competent may authorize the Secretary to lease, or assist in the leasing of such lands, and an appropriate notice of such action shall be made a matter of record. When this prerogative is exercised, the general regulations contained in this part 162 shall be applicable. Approval of the Secretary is required on leases signed by Crow Indians not classified as competent or made on inherited or devised trust lands owned by more than five competent devisees or heirs. 


(b) The Act of May 26, 1926 (44 Stat. 658), as amended by the Act of March 15, 1948 (62 Stat. 80), provides that no lease for farming or grazing purposes shall be made for a period longer than five years, except irrigable lands under the Big Horn Canal; which may be leased for periods of ten years. No such lease shall provide the lessee a preference right to future leases which, if exercised, would thereby extend the total period of encumbrance beyond the five or ten years authorized by law. 


(c) All leases entered into by Crow Indians classified as competent, under the above-cited special statutes, must be recorded at the Crow Agency. Such recording shall constitute notice to all persons. Under these special statutes, Crow Indians classified as competent are free to lease their property within certain limitations. The five-year (ten-year in the case of lands under the Big Horn Canal) limitation is intended to afford a protection to the Indians. The essence of this protection is the right to deal with the property free, clear, and unencumbered at intervals at least as frequent as those provided by law. If lessees are able to obtain new leases long before the termination of existing leases, they are in a position to set their own terms. In these circumstances lessees could perpetuate their leaseholds and the protection of the statutory limitations as to terms would be destroyed. Therefore, in implementation of the foregoing interpretation, any lease which, on its face, is in violation of statutory limitations or requirements, and any grazing lease executed more than 12 months, and any farming lease executed more than 18 months, prior to the commencement of the term thereof or any lease which purports to cancel an existing lease with the same lessee as of a future date and take effect upon such cancellation will not be recorded. Under a Crow tribal program, approved by the Department of the Interior, competent Crow Indians may, under certain circumstances, enter into agreements which require that, for a specified term, their leases be approved. Information concerning whether a competent Crow Indian has executed such an instrument is available at the office of the Superintendent of the Crow Agency, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Crow Agency, Montana. Any lease entered into with a competent Crow Indian during the time such instrument is in effect and which is not in accordance with such instrument will be returned without recordation. 


(d) Where any of the following conditions are found to exist, leases will be recorded but the lessee and lessor will be notified upon discovery of the condition: 


(1) The lease in single or counterpart form has not been executed by all owners of the land described in the lease; 


(2) There is, of record, a lease on the land for all or a part of the same term; 


(3) The lease does not contain stipulations requiring sound land utilization plans and conservation practices; or 


(4) There are other deficiencies such as, but not limited to, erroneous land descriptions, and alterations which are not clearly endorsed by the lessor. 


(e) Any adult Crow Indian classified as competent shall have the full responsibility for obtaining compliance with the terms of any lease made by him pursuant to this section. This shall not preclude action by the Secretary to assure conservation and protection of these trust lands. 


(f) Leases made by competent Crow Indians shall be subject to the right to issue permits and leases to prospect for, develop, and mine oil, gas, and other minerals, and to grant rights-of-way and easements, in accordance with applicable law and regulations. In the issuance or granting of such permits, leases, rights-of-way or easements due consideration will be given to the interests of lessees and to the adjustment of any damages to such interests. In the event of a dispute as to the amount of such damage, the matter will be referred to the Secretary whose determination will be final as to the amount of said damage.
