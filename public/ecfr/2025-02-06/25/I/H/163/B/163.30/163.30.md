# ยง 163.30   Revocable road use and construction permits for removal of commercial forest products.

(a) In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 415 as amended, the Secretary may request tribes and/or other beneficial owners to sign revocable permits designating the Secretary as agent for the landowner and empowering him or her to issue revocable road use and construction permits to users for the purpose of removing forest products. 


(b) When a majority of trust interest in a tract has consented, the Secretary may issue revocable road use and con- struction permits for removal of forest products over and across such land. In addition, the Secretary may act for individual owners when: 


(1) One or more of the individual owner(s) of the land or of an interest therein is a minor or a person non compos mentis, and the Secretary finds that such grant, in total or for an interest therein, will cause no substantial injury to the land or the owner, which cannot be adequately compensated for by monetary damages; 


(2) The whereabouts of the owner(s) of the land or those with an interest therein are unknown so long as the majority of owner(s) of interests whose whereabouts are known, consent to the grant; 


(3) The heirs or devisees of a deceased owner of the land or interest have not been determined, and the Secretary finds the grant will cause no substantial injury to the land or any land owner; or 


(4) The owners of interests in the land are so numerous that the Secretary finds it would be impractical to obtain the consent of the majority and finds that such grant in total or an interest therein will cause no substantial injury to the land or the owner(s), that cannot be adequately compensated for by monetary damages. 


(c) Nothing in this section shall preclude acquisition of rights-of-way over Indian lands, under 25 CFR part 169, or conflict with provisions of that part.
