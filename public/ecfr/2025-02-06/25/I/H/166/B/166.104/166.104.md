# ยง 166.104   What notifications are required that tribal laws apply to permits on Indian agricultural lands?

(a) Tribes must notify us of the content and effective dates of new tribal laws. 


(b) We will then notify affected Indian landowners and any persons or entities undertaking activities on Indian agricultural lands of the superseding or modifying effect of the tribal law. We will: 


(1) Provide individual written notice; or 


(2) Post public notice. This notice will be posted at the tribal community building, U.S. Post Office, and/or published in the local newspaper nearest to the Indian lands where activities are occurring.
