# ยง 166.206   What requirements apply to a permit on a fractionated tract?

We may grant a permit on behalf of all Indian landowners of a fractionated tract as long as the owners receive fair annual rental. Before granting such a permit, we may offer a preference right to any Indian landowner who: 


(a) Is in possession of the entire tract; 


(b) Submits a written offer to permit the land, subject to any required or negotiated terms and conditions, prior to our granting a permit to another party; and 


(c) Provides any supporting documents needed to demonstrate the ability to perform all of the obligations under the proposed permit.
