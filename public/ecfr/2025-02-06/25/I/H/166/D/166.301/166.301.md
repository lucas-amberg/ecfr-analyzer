# ยง 166.301   How is Indian land for grazing purposes described?

Indian land for grazing purposes should be described by legal description (e.g., aliquot parts, metes and bounds) or other acceptable description. Where there are undivided interests owned in fee status, the aggregate portion of trust and restricted interests should be identified in the description of the permitted land.
