# ยง 166.307   Will the grazing capacity be increased if I graze adjacent trust or non-trust rangelands not covered by the permit?

No. You will not receive an increase in grazing capacity in the permit if you graze trust or non-trust rangeland in common with the permitted land. Grazing capacity will be established only for Indian land covered by your permit.
