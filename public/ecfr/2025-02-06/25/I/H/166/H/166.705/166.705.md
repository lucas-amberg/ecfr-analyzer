# § 166.705   What will the BIA do if a permit violation is not cured within the required time period?

(a) If the permittee does not cure a violation within the required time period, we will consult with the Indian landowners, as appropriate, and determine whether: 


(1) The permit should be canceled by us under paragraph (c) of this section and §§ 166.706 through 166.707 of this subpart; 


(2) We should invoke any other remedies available to us under the permit, including collecting on any available bond; 


(3) The Indian landowners wish to invoke any remedies available to them under the permit; or 


(4) The permittee should be granted additional time in which to cure the violation. 


(b) If we decide to grant a permittee additional time in which to cure a violation, the permittee must proceed diligently to complete the necessary corrective actions within a reasonable or specified time period from the date on which the extension is granted. 


(c) If we decide to cancel the permit, we will send the permittee and its sureties a written notice of cancellation within five business days of that decision. We will also provide actual or constructive notice of a cancellation decision to the Indian landowners, as appropriate. The written notice of cancellation will: 


(1) Explain the grounds for cancellation; 


(2) Notify the permittee of the amount of any unpaid rent, interest charges, or late payment penalties due under the permit; 


(3) Notify the permittee of its right to appeal under Part 2 of this chapter, as modified by § 166.706 of this subpart, including the amount of any appeal bond that must be posted with an appeal of the cancellation decision; and 


(4) Order the permittee to vacate the property within 30 days of the date of receipt of the written notice of cancellation, if an appeal is not filed by that time.
