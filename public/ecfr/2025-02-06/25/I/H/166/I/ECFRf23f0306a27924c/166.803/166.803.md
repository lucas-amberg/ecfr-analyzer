# ยง 166.803   How are trespassers notified of a trespass determination?

(a) Unless otherwise provided under tribal law, when we have reason to believe that a trespass on Indian agricultural land has occurred, within five business days, we or the authorized tribal representative will provide written notice to the alleged trespasser, the possessor of trespass property, any known lien holder, and beneficial Indian landowner, as appropriate. The written notice will include the following: 


(1) The basis for the trespass determination; 


(2) A legal description of where the trespass occurred; 


(3) A verification of ownership of unauthorized property (*e.g.,* brands in the State Brand Book for cases of livestock trespass, if applicable); 


(4) Corrective actions that must be taken; 


(5) Time frames for taking the corrective actions; 


(6) Potential consequences and penalties for failure to take corrective action; and 


(7) A statement that unauthorized livestock or other property may not be removed or disposed of unless authorized by us. 


(b) If we determine that the alleged trespasser or possessor of trespass property is unknown or refuses delivery of the written notice, a public trespass notice will be posted at the tribal community building, U.S. Post Office, and published in the local newspaper nearest to the Indian agricultural lands where the trespass is occurring. 


(c) Trespass notices under this subpart are not subject to appeal under 25 CFR part 2.
