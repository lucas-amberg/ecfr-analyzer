Following the impoundment of unauthorized livestock or other property, we will provide notice that we will sell the impounded property as follows: 


(a) We will provide written notice of the sale to the owner, the owner's representative, and any known lien holder. The written notice must include the procedure by which the impounded property may be redeemed prior to the sale. 


(b) We will provide public notice of sale of impounded property by posting at the tribal community building, U.S. Post Office, and publishing in the local newspaper nearest to the Indian agricultural lands where the trespass is occurring. The public notice will include a description of the impounded property, and the date, time, and place of the public sale. The sale date must be at least five days after the publication and posting of notice.
