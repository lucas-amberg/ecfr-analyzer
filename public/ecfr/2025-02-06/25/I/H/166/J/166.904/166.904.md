# ยง 166.904   What is agriculture education outreach?

(a) We will establish and maintain an agriculture education outreach program for Indian and Alaska Native youth that will: 


(1) Encourage students to acquire academic skills needed to succeed in post-secondary mathematics and science courses; 


(2) Promote agriculture career awareness; 


(3) Involve students in projects and activities oriented to agriculture related professions early so students realize the need to complete required pre-college courses; and 


(4) Integrate Indian and Alaska Native agriculture program activities into the education of Indian and Alaska Native students. 


(b) We will develop and carry out the program in consultation with appropriate community education organizations, tribes, ANCSA Corporations, Alaska Native organizations, and other federal agencies providing agriculture services to Indians. 


(c) The education committee established under ยง 166.900(c) of this subpart will coordinate and implement the program nationally.
