# ยง 169.110   How much monetary compensation must be paid for a right-of-way over or across tribal land?

(a) A right-of-way over or across tribal land may allow for any payment amount negotiated by the tribe, and we will defer to the tribe and not require a valuation if the tribe submits a tribal authorization expressly stating that it:


(1) Has agreed upon compensation satisfactory to the tribe;


(2) Waives valuation; and


(3) Has determined that accepting such agreed-upon compensation and waiving valuation is in its best interest.


(b) The tribe may request, in writing, that we determine fair market value, in which case we will use a valuation in accordance with ยง 169.114. After providing the tribe with the fair market value, we will defer to a tribe's decision to allow for any compensation negotiated by the tribe.


(c) If the conditions in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section are not met, we will require that the grantee pay fair market value based on a valuation in accordance with ยง 169.114.
