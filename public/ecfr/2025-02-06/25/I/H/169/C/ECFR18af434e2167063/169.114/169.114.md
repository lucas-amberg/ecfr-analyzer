(a) We will use a market analysis, appraisal, or other appropriate valuation method to determine the fair market value before we grant a right-of-way over or across individually owned Indian land. We will also use a market analysis, appraisal, or other appropriate valuation method to determine, at the request of the tribe, the fair market value of tribal land.


(b) We will either:


(1) Prepare, or have prepared, a market analysis, appraisal, or other appropriate valuation method; or


(2) Approve use of a market analysis, appraisal, or other appropriate valuation method from the Indian landowners or grantee.


(c) We will use or approve use of a market analysis, appraisal, or other appropriate valuation method only if it:


(1) Has been prepared in accordance with USPAP or a valuation method developed by the Secretary under 25 U.S.C. 2214 and complies with Departmental policies regarding appraisals, including third-party appraisals; or


(2) Has been prepared by another Federal agency.
