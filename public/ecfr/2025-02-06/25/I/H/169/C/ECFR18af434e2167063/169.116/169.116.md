# ยง 169.116   Must a right-of-way specify who receives monetary compensation payments?

(a) A right-of-way grant must specify whether the grantee will make payments directly to the Indian landowners (direct pay) or to us on their behalf.


(b) The grantee may make payments directly to the tribe if the tribe so chooses. The grantee may make payments directly to the Indian landowners if:


(1) The Indian landowners' trust accounts are unencumbered accounts;


(2) There are 10 or fewer beneficial owners; and


(3) One hundred percent of the beneficial owners (including those on whose behalf we have consented) agree to receive payment directly from the grantee at the start of the right-of-way.


(c) If the right-of-way document provides that the grantee will directly pay the Indian landowners, then:


(1) The right-of-way document must include provisions for proof of payment upon our request.


(2) When we consent on behalf of an Indian landowner, the grantee must make payment to us on behalf of that landowner.


(3) The grantee must send direct payments to the parties and addresses specified in the right-of-way, unless the grantee receives notice of a change of ownership or address.


(4) Unless the right-of-way document provides otherwise, payments may not be made payable directly to anyone other than the Indian landowners.


(5) Direct payments must continue through the duration of the right-of-way, except that:


(i) The grantee must make all Indian landowners' payments to us if 100 percent of the Indian landowners agree to suspend direct pay and provide us with documentation of their agreement; and


(ii) The grantee must make an individual Indian landowner's payment to us if that individual Indian landowner dies, is declared non compos mentis, owes a debt resulting in an encumbered account, or his or her whereabouts become unknown.
