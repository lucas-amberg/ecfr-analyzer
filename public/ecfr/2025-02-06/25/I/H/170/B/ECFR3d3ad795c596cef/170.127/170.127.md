# ยง 170.127   What are the TTP Safety Funds?

(a) Funds, identified as TTP Safety (TTP-S) funds, are made available for a Tribe's highway safety activities through a TTP set-aside established in 23 U.S.C. 202(e). TTP-S funds are allocated based on identification and analysis of highway safety issues and opportunities on Tribal lands. A TTP-S call for projects will be made annually through a Notice of Funding Opportunity published in the _Federal Register_.


(b) Tribes may also use their TTP-S funds made available through 23 U.S.C. 202(b) for highway safety activities as well as seek grant and program funding from appropriate State and local agencies and private grant organizations.


(c) A project that uses TTP-S funding or TTP funds made available under 23 U.S.C. 202(b) must be identified on a FHWA-approved TTPTIP before any funds are expended.
