(2) Conducting engineering and traffic analysis to determine maximum speed limits, maximum vehicular size, and weight limits, and identify needed traffic control devices; and


(3) Erecting, maintaining, and enforcing compliance with signs and pavement markings.


(b) Consultation is not required whenever the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section involve immediate safety or life-threatening situations.


(c) A Tribal transportation facility owned by a Tribe or BIA may be permanently closed only when the Tribal government and the Secretary agree. Once this agreement is reached, BIA must remove the facility from the NTTFI and it will be ineligible for expenditure of any TTP funds.
