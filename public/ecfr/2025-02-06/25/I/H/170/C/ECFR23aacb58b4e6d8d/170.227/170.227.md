# ยง 170.227   Can Tribes use flexible financing for TTP projects?

Yes. Tribes may use flexible financing in the same manner as States to finance TTP transportation projects, unless otherwise prohibited by law.


(a) Tribes may issue bonds or enter into other debt-financing instruments under 23 U.S.C. 122 with the expectation of payment of TTP funds to satisfy the instruments.


(b) Under 23 U.S.C. 603, the Secretary of Transportation may enter into an agreement for secured loans or lines of credit for TTP projects meeting the requirements contained in 23 U.S.C. 602. The secured loans or lines of credit must be paid from tolls, user fees, payments owing to the obligor under a public-private partnership or other dedicated revenue sources.


(c) Tribes may use TTP funds as collateral for loans or bonds to finance TTP projects. Upon the request of a Tribe, a BIA region or FHWA will provide necessary documentation to banks and other financial institutions.
