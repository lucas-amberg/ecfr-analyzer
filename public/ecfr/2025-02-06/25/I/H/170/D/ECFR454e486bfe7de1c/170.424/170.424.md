# ยง 170.424   What is the TTP Transportation Improvement Program (TTPTIP)?

(a) Each year, FHWA will compile the approved TTIPs for all of the Tribes into one document called the TTPTIP. This document will identify all expected projects and activities over a four-year period and will be organized by fiscal year, State, and Tribe.


(b) FHWA and BIA will post the approved TTPTIP on their respective Web sites. A subset of the TTPTIP that identifies only design and construction activities will annually be provided to the pertinent FHWA Division office for further transmittal to each State Transportation Office/Department for inclusion in the STIP without further action per 23 U.S.C. 201(c)(4).
