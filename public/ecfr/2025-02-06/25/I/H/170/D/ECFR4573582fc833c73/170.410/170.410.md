# ยง 170.410   How does a long-range transportation plan relate to the NTTFI?

A LRTP is developed using a uniform process that identifies the transportation needs and priorities of a Tribe. The NTTFI (see ยง 170.442) is derived from transportation facilities identified through an LRTP. It is also a means for identifying projects and activities for the TTP.
