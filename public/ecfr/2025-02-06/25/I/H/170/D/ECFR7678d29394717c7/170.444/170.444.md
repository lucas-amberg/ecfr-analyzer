The submissions must include, at a minimum, all required minimum attachments (see ยง 170.446) and authorizing resolutions or similar official authorizations.


(3) The BIA Regional Office reviews each Tribe's submission. If any errors or omissions are identified, the BIA Regional Office will return the submittals along with a request for corrections to the Tribe no later than May 15. If no errors or omissions are found, the BIA Regional Office validates the data and forwards it to BIADOT for review and approval.
