# ยง 170.916   May Tribes impose taxes or fees on those performing TTP services?

Yes. Tribes, as sovereign nations, may impose taxes and fees for TTP activities. When a Tribe administers TTPs or projects under ISDEAA, its Tribal employment and contracting preference laws, including taxes and fees, apply.
