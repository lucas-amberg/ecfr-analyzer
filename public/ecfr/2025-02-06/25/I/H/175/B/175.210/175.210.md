# ยง 175.210   What is BIA's procedure for adjusting service fees?

If, based on our annual review, we determine our service fees need to be adjusted:


(a) We will notify you at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the adjustment; and


(b) We will publish a schedule of the adjusted service fees in a local newspaper(s) and post them in the local utility office serving you.
