Except for purchased power costs, if we determine electric power rates need to be adjusted, we will:


(a) Hold public meetings and notify you of their respective time, date, and location by newspaper notice and a notice posted in the utility office serving you;


(b) Provide you notice at least 15 days prior to the meeting;


(c) Provide you a description of the proposed rate adjustment;


(d) Provide you information on how, where, and when to submit comments on our proposed rate adjustment;


(e) Make a final determination on the proposed rate adjustment after all comments have been received, reviewed, and evaluated; and


(f) Publish the proposed rate adjustment and the final rate in the _Federal Register_ if we determine the rate adjustment is necessary.
