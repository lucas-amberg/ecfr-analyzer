# ยง 214.14   Use of surface lands.

(a) Lessees may use so much of the surface of the leased land as shall be reasonably necessary for the prospecting and mining operations and buildings required by the lease, and shall also have the right-of-way over and across such land to any point of prospecting or mining operations, but such use of the surface shall be permissible only under condition of least injury and inconvenience to the allottee or owner of the land. Lessees before commencing and during such operations shall pay all reasonable damages for the use of the surface land and to any growing crops thereon, or to improvements on said land, or any damage that during the life of the lease may be occasioned in any manner whatsoever by the use of the surface, to the allottee or his successor in interest or assignee, or to a lessee of the surface of said land or to an oil and gas lessee, damages to be apportioned among the parties interested in the surface, whether as owner, lessee, or otherwise, as the parties in interest may mutually agree or as their interests may appear. If the parties are unable to agree concerning damages the same shall be determined by arbitration.


(b) All agreements (or authenticated copies thereof) providing for the settlement of damages shall be filed in the Osage Agency if the surface owner is a restricted Indian, and all such amounts which may be due and payable to any such Indian shall be paid to the superintendent and by him immediately remitted to the Indian entitled thereto. All sums due as royalty or damages shall be a lien on all equipment on leased premises.
