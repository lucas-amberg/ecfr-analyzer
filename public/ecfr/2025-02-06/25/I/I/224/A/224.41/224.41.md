# ยง 224.41   When does the Secretary require agreement of more than one Tribe to approve a TERA?

When Tribal land held for the benefit of more than one Tribe is contemplated for inclusion in a TERA, each appropriate Tribal governing body must request a pre-application consultation meeting, and submit a resolution or formal act of the Tribal governing body approving the submission of any application. Each appropriate Tribal governing body must also sign the TERA, if it is approved.
