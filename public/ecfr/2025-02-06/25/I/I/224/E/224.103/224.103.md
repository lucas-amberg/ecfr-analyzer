# ยง 224.103   Must a Tribe establish other public participation processes?

No. Except for the environmental review process required by the Act and ยง 224.63(b)(1), a Tribe is not required to establish a process for public participation concerning non-environmental issues in a TERA or leases, business agreements or rights-of-way undertaken under a TERA. However, a Tribe may elect to establish procedures that permit the public to participate in public hearings or that expand the scope of matters about which the public may comment.
