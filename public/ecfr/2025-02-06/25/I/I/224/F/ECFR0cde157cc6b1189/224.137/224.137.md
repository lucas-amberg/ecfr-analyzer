# § 224.137   What must the Secretary do if a Tribe's noncompliance has resulted in harm or the potential for harm to a physical trust asset?

If, because of the Tribe's noncompliance with Federal law or the terms of a TERA, the Secretary determines that there is harm or the potential for harm to a physical trust asset that does not rise to the level of imminent jeopardy to a physical trust asset, the Secretary must:


(a) Document the issue in the written report of the review and evaluation;


(b) Report the issue in writing to the Tribal governing body;


(c) Report the issue in writing to the Assistant Secretary—Indian Affairs; and
