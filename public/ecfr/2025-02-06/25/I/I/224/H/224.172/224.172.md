# ยง 224.172   May a Tribe rescind only some of the activities subject to a TERA while retaining a portion of those activities?

No. A Tribe may only rescind a TERA in its entirety, including the authority to approve leases, business agreements and grant rights-of-way for specific energy resource development, not some of the authority or activities subject to the TERA.
