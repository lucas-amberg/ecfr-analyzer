(1) Number of fish required for spawning escapement and any other requirements reasonable and necessary for conservation;


(2) Fair and equitable sharing of the salmon resource with other user groups fishing in State waters under State law and within the State fisheries management system; and


(3) The federal purpose in the establishment and maintenance of the Metlakatla Indian Reservation.


(d) *Size, construction and closure of fish traps*—(1) *Size.* When any part of a trap is in a greater depth of water than 100 feet, the trap as measured from shore at mean high tide to the outer face of the pot shall not extend beyond 900 feet. 


(2) *Construction.* Poles shall be permanently secured to the webbing at each side of the mouth of the pot tunnel and shall extend from the tunnel floor to a height at least four feet above the water. A draw line shall be reeved through the lower end of both poles and the upper end of one. 


(3) *Method of closing.* The tunnel walls shall be overlapped as far as possible across the pot gap and the draw line shall be pulled tight and both secured so as to completely close the tunnel. In addition, 25 feet of the webbing of the heart on each side next to the pot shall be lifted or lowered in such manner as to permit the free passage of fish. 


(e) *Other forms of commercial fishing.* All commercial fishing, other than with traps, shall be in accordance with the season and gear restrictions established by rule or regulation by the Alaska Board of Fish and Game for Commercial Fishing in any part of the previously defined area; provided, however, that the Secretary or his duly authorized representative may, upon request by the Metlakatla Indian Community authorize such other commercial fishing at such times as he shall prescribe, which authorization shall be based upon the following criteria:


(1) Number of fish required for spawning escapement and any other requirements reasonable and necessary for conservation;


(2) Fair and equitable sharing of the fishery resource with other user groups fishing in State waters under State law and within the State fisheries management system; and
