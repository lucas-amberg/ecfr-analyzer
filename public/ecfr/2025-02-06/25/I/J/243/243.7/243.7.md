# ยง 243.7   How can a non-Native acquire live reindeer?

If you are a non-Native who wants to acquire live Alaskan reindeer, you must apply to us in writing. We will either grant the request and issue a written permit valid for 90 days or reject the request and give our reasons in writing. Any transfer that we authorize is subject to the following conditions:


(a) The transfer must meet the requirements of the Act and this part.


(b) Within 30 days of transfer, you must either butcher the reindeer in Alaska or ship them out of Alaska. If you ship the reindeer out alive:


(1) You must comply with all Federal and State animal health regulations governing transfers and shipments; and


(2) The reindeer and their descendants must never be brought back to Alaska alive.


(c) Within 30 days of the transfer, you must report to us the actual number of reindeer shipped out or slaughtered.
