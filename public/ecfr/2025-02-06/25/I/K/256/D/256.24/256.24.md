# ยง 256.24   How can I be sure that construction work meets minimum standards?

(a) At various stages of construction, a trained and qualified representative of your servicing housing office or a building inspector will review the work to ensure that it meets construction standards and building codes. Upon completion of each stage, further construction can begin only after the inspection occurs and approval is granted.


(b) Inspections of construction and renovation will occur, at a minimum, at the following stages:


(1) Upon completion of inspection footings and foundations;


(2) Upon completion of inspection rough-in, roughwiring, and plumbing; and


(3) At final completion.
