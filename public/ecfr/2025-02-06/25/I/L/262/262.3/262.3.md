# ยง 262.3   Consultation to determine need for a permit.

(a) Any person, except as provided in the uniform regulations at 43 CFR 7.5(b) through (d), who proposes to excavate or remove archaeological resources on Indian lands or on properties owned or administered by the BIA must first apply for and secure a permit under the Act. Procedures relating thereto are set forth in ยง 262.5 of this part. 


(b) No permit under the Act, nor any other Federally issued license or authorization, is required for archaeological investigations that do not involve the excavation or removal of archaeological resources on these lands, except for BIA consent on properties that it owns or administers. Notwithstanding, persons other than those covered under 43 CFR 7.5(b) through (d) shall, before engaging in such investigations: 


(1) Write to the head of each tribal government having jurisdiction over the lands where investigations are to be conducted and request that he or she provide, within 30 days, written information on any permit, license or other form of authorization the tribe might require for the work proposed; and 


(2) Provide the BIA Area Director with a copy of the tribe's written response (or a copy of the request to the tribe if 30 days have elapsed without any response) plus a brief but clear written description of the proposed work and obtain his or her written determination as to whether or not a permit under the Act is required. Area Directors shall provide determinations within 10 working days after receiving such documentation.
