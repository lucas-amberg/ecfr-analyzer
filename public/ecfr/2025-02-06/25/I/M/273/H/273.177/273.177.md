# ยง 273.177   Who will provide liability and motor vehicle insurance?

(a) States, school districts, and Indian corporations must obtain public liability insurance under contracts entered into with the Bureau, unless the Bureau approving official determines that the risk of death, personal injury or property damage under the contract is small and that the time and cost of procuring the insurance is great in relation to the risk.


(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, any contract which requires or authorizes, either expressly or by implication, the use of motor vehicles must contain a provision requiring the State, school district, or Indian corporation to provide liability insurance, regardless of how small the risk.


(c) If the public school authority is self-insured and can present evidence of that fact to the approving official, liability and motor vehicle insurance will not be required.
