# ยง 290.14   Who can share in a per capita payment?

(a) You must establish your own criteria for determining whether all members or identified groups of members are eligible for per capita payments.


(b) If the tribal revenue allocation plan calls for distributing per capita payments to an identified group of members rather than to all members, you must justify limiting this payment to the identified group of members. You must make sure that:


(1) The distinction between members eligible to receive payments and members ineligible to receive payments is reasonable and not arbitrary;


(2) The distinction does not discriminate or otherwise violate the Indian Civil Rights Act; and 


(3) The justification complies with applicable tribal law.
