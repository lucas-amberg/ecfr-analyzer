# § 293.26   May a compact or amendment include provisions addressing statewide remote wagering or internet gaming?

Yes. A compact or amendment consistent with §§ 293.16 and 293.22 may include provisions addressing statewide remote wagering or internet gaming that is directly related to the operation of gaming activity on Indian lands. A compact or compact amendment may not, however, alter otherwise applicable Federal law. A compact may specifically include, for regulatory purposes, provisions allocating State and Tribal jurisdiction within the State over remote wagering or internet gaming originating outside Indian lands where:


(a) State law and the compact or amendment deem the gaming to take place, for the purposes of State and Tribal law, on the Tribe's Indian lands where the server accepting the wagers is located;


(b) The Tribe regulates the gaming; and


(c) The player initiating the wager is not located on another Tribe's Indian lands within the State, unless that Tribe has lawfully consented.
