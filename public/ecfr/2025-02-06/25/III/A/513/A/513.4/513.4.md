(4) The debtor's opportunity to enter into a written agreement with the Commission to repay the debt;

(b) A debtor whose debt arises from a notice of violation and/or civil fine assessment that has become a final order and that was subject to the Commission's appeal procedures at 25 CFR parts 580 through 585 may not re-litigate matters that were the subject of the final order.
