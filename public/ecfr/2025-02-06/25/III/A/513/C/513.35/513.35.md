# ยง 513.35   What special review is available when the Commission is the creditor agency?

(a)(1) An employee subject to salary offset or a voluntary repayment agreement may, at any time, request a special review by the Commission of the amount of the salary offset or voluntary repayment, based on materially changed circumstances, including, but not limited to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability.


(2) The request for special review must include an alternative proposed offset or payment schedule and a detailed statement, with supporting documents, that shows why the current salary offset or payment results in extreme financial hardship to the employee, spouse, or dependents. The statement must indicate:


(i) Income from all sources;


(ii) Assets;


(iii) Liabilities;


(iv) Number of dependents;


(v) Expenses for food, housing, clothing, and transportation;


(vi) Medical expenses; and


(vii) Exceptional expenses, if any.


(b) The Commission will evaluate the statement and documentation and determine whether the current offset or repayment schedule imposes extreme financial hardship on the employee. The Commission will notify the employee in writing within 30 calendar days of its determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset or payment schedule. If the special review results in a revised offset or repayment schedule, the Commission will provide a new certification to the paying agency.
