# ยง 515.10   Fees.

The Commission shall charge fees for duplication of records under the Privacy Act in the same way in which it charges duplication fees under ยง 517.9 of this chapter. No search or review fee may be charged for any record. Additionally, when the Privacy Act Officer makes a copy of a record as a necessary part of reviewing the record or granting access to the record, the Commission shall not charge for the cost of making that copy. Otherwise, the Commission may charge a fee sufficient to cover the cost of duplicating a record.
