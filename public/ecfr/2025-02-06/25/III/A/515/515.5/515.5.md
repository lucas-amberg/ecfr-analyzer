# § 515.5   Responses to requests for access to records.

(a) *Acknowledgement of requests.* Upon receipt of a request, the Privacy Act Officer ordinarily shall, within 20 working days, send an acknowledgement letter which shall confirm the requester's agreement to pay fees under § 515.9 and provide an assigned request number.


(b) *Grants of requests for access.* Once the Privacy Act Officer makes a determination to grant a request for access in whole or in part, it shall notify the requester in writing. The notice shall inform the requester of any fee charged under § 515.9 of this part and the Privacy Act Officer shall disclose records to the requester promptly on payment of any applicable fee. If a request is made in person, the Privacy Act Officer will disclose the records to the requester directly, in a manner not unreasonably disruptive of its operations, on payment of any applicable fee and with a written record made of the grant of the request. If a requester is accompanied by another individual, the requester shall be required to authorize in writing any discussion of the records in the presence of the other person.


(c) *Adverse determinations of requests for access.* If the Privacy Act Officer makes any adverse determination denying a request for access in any respect, it shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. The notification letter shall be signed by the official making the determination and include:


(1) The name and title of the person responsible for the denial;


(2) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any Privacy Act exemption(s) applied to the denial;


(3) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 515.7 and a description of the requirements of § 515.7.
