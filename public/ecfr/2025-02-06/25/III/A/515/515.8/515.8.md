# ยง 515.8   Requests for an accounting of record disclosure.

(a) *How made and addressed.* Subject to the exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section, an individual may make a request for an accounting of the disclosures of any record about that individual that the Commission has made to another person, organization, or agency. The accounting contains the date, nature and purpose of each disclosure, as well as the name and address of the person, organization, or agency to which the disclosure was made. The request for an accounting should identify each particular record in question and should be made in writing to the Commission's Privacy Act Officer, following the procedures in ยง 515.3.


(b) *Where accountings are not required.* The Commission is not required to provide an accounting where they relate to:


(1) Disclosures for which accountings are not required to be kept, such as those that are made to employees of the Commission who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties and disclosures that are made under section 552 of title 5;


(2) Disclosures made to law enforcement agencies for authorized law enforcement activities in response to written requests from those law enforcement agencies specifying the law enforcement activities for which the disclosures are sought; or


(3) Disclosures made from law enforcement systems of records that have been exempted from accounting requirements.


(c) *Appeals.* A requester may appeal a denial of a request for an accounting in the same manner as a denial of a request for access as described in ยง 515.7 of this part and the same procedures will be followed.


(d) *Preservation of accountings.* All accountings made under this section will be retained for at least five years or the life of the record, whichever is longer, after the disclosure for which the accounting is made.
