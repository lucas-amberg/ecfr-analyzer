# ยง 543.12   What are the minimum internal control standards for gaming promotions and player tracking systems?

(a) *Supervision.* Supervision must be provided as needed for gaming promotions and player tracking by an agent(s) with authority equal to or greater than those being supervised.


(b) *Gaming promotions.* The rules of the gaming promotion must be displayed or made readily available to patron upon request. Gaming promotions rules require TGRA approval and must include the following:


(1) The rules of play;


(2) The nature and value of the associated prize(s) or cash award(s);


(3) Any restrictions or limitations on participant eligibility;


(4) The date(s), time(s), and location(s) for the associated promotional activity or activities;


(5) Any other restrictions or limitations, including any related to the claim of prizes or cash awards;


(6) The announcement date(s), time(s), and location(s) for the winning entry or entries; and


(7) Rules governing promotions offered across multiple gaming operations, third party sponsored promotions, and joint promotions involving third parties.


(c) *Player tracking systems and gaming promotions.* (1) Changes to the player tracking systems, promotion and external bonusing system parameters, which control features such as the awarding of bonuses, the issuance of cashable credits, non-cashable credits, coupons and vouchers, must be performed under the authority of supervisory agents, independent of the department initiating the change. Alternatively, the changes may be performed by supervisory agents of the department initiating the change if sufficient documentation is generated and the propriety of the changes are randomly verified by supervisory agents independent of the department initiating the change on a monthly basis.


(2) All other changes to the player tracking system must be appropriately documented.


(d) *Variances.* The operation must establish, as approved by the TGRA, the threshold level at which a variance must be reviewed to determine the cause. Any such review must be documented.
