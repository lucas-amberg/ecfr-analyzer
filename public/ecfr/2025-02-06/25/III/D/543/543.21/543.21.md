(a) *Supervision.* Supervision must be provided as needed for surveillance by an agent(s) with authority equal to or greater than those being supervised.


(b) *Surveillance equipment and control room(s).* Controls must be established and procedures implemented that include the following:


(1) For Tier A, the surveillance system must be maintained and operated from a secured location, such as a locked cabinet. For Tiers B and C, the surveillance system must be maintained and operated from a staffed surveillance operation room(s).


(2) The surveillance operation room(s) must be secured to prevent unauthorized entry.


(3) Access to the surveillance operation room(s) must be limited to surveillance agents and other authorized persons.


(4) Surveillance operation room(s) access logs must be maintained.


(5) Surveillance operation room equipment must have total override capability over all other satellite surveillance equipment.


(6) Power loss to the surveillance system:


(i) For Tier A, in the event of power loss to the surveillance system, alternative security procedures, such as additional supervisory or security agents, must be implemented immediately.


(ii) For Tier B and C, in the event of power loss to the surveillance system, an auxiliary or backup power source must be available and capable of providing immediate restoration of power to the surveillance system to ensure that surveillance agents can observe all areas covered by dedicated cameras.


(7) The surveillance system must record an accurate date and time stamp on recorded events. The displayed date and time must not significantly obstruct the recorded view.


(8) All surveillance agents must be trained in the use of the equipment, games, and house rules.


(9) Each camera required by the standards in this section must be installed in a manner that will prevent it from being readily obstructed, tampered with, or disabled.


(10) The surveillance system must:


(i) Have the capability to display all camera views on a monitor;


(ii) Include sufficient numbers of recording devices to record the views of all cameras required by this section;


(iii) Record all camera views; and


(iv) For Tier B and C only, include sufficient numbers of monitors to simultaneously display gaming and count room activities.


(11) A periodic inspection of the surveillance systems must be conducted. When a malfunction of the surveillance system is discovered, the malfunction and necessary repairs must be documented and repairs initiated within seventy-two (72) hours.


(i) If a dedicated camera malfunctions, alternative security procedures, such as additional supervisory or security agents, must be implemented immediately.


(ii) The TGRA must be notified of any surveillance system and/or camera(s) that have malfunctioned for more than twenty-four (24) hours and the alternative security measures being implemented.


(c) *Additional surveillance requirements.* With regard to the following functions, controls must also include:


(1) Surveillance of the progressive prize meters for Class II gaming systems at the following thresholds:


(i) Wide area progressives with a reset amount of $1 million; and


(ii) In-house progressives with a reset amount of $250,000.


(2) Manual bingo:


(i) For manual draws, the surveillance system must monitor the bingo ball drawing device or mechanical random number generator, which must be recorded during the course of the draw by a dedicated camera to identify the numbers or other designations drawn; and


(ii) The surveillance system must monitor and record the activities of the bingo game, including drawing, and entering the balls, numbers or other designations drawn.


(3) Card games:


(i) Except for card game tournaments, a dedicated camera(s) with sufficient clarity must be used to provide:


(A) An overview of the activities on each card table surface, including card faces and cash and/or cash equivalents;


(B) An overview of card game activities, including patrons and dealers; and


(C) An unobstructed view of all posted progressive pool amounts.


(ii) For card game tournaments, a dedicated camera(s) must be used to provide an overview of tournament activities, and any area where cash or cash equivalents are exchanged.


(4) Cage and vault:


(i) The surveillance system must monitor and record a general overview of activities occurring in each cage and vault area with sufficient clarity to identify individuals within the cage and patrons and staff members at the counter areas and to confirm the amount of each cash transaction;


(ii) Each cashier station must be equipped with one (1) dedicated overhead camera covering the transaction area; and


(iii) The cage or vault area in which exchange and transfer transactions occur must be monitored and recorded by a dedicated camera or motion activated dedicated camera that provides coverage with sufficient clarity to identify the chip values and the amounts on the exchange and transfer documentation. Controls provided by a computerized exchange and transfer system constitute an adequate alternative to viewing the amounts on the exchange and transfer documentation.


(5) Count rooms:


(i) The surveillance system must monitor and record with sufficient clarity a general overview of all areas where cash or cash equivalents may be stored or counted; and


(ii) The surveillance system must provide coverage of count equipment with sufficient clarity to view any attempted manipulation of the recorded data.


(6) Kiosks: The surveillance system must monitor and record a general overview of activities occurring at each kiosk with sufficient clarity to identify the activity and the individuals performing it, including maintenance, drops or fills, and redemption of wagering vouchers or credits.


(d) *Reporting requirements.* TGRA-approved procedures must be implemented for reporting suspected crimes and suspicious activity.


(e) *Recording retention.* Controls must be established and procedures implemented that include the following:


(1) All recordings required by this section must be retained for a minimum of seven days; and


(2) Suspected crimes, suspicious activity, or detentions by security agents discovered within the initial retention period must be copied and retained for a time period, not less than one year.


(f) *Logs.* Logs must be maintained and demonstrate the following:


(1) Compliance with the storage, identification, and retention standards required in this section;


(2) Each malfunction and repair of the surveillance system as defined in this section; and


(3) Activities performed by surveillance agents as required by the controls in this section.
