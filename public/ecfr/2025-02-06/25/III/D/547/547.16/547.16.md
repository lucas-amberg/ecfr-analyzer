(ii) Whether the value of a prize depends on the purchase or wager amount; and


(iii) The means of division of any pari-mutuel prizes; but


(iv) For Class II Gaming Systems, the prize schedule or other explanation need not state that subsets of winning patterns are not awarded as additional prizes (for example, five in a row does not also pay three in a row or four in a row), unless there are exceptions, which must be clearly stated.

(1) “Malfunctions void all prizes and plays” or equivalent; and


(2) “Actual Prizes Determined by Bingo (or other applicable Class II game) Play. Other Displays for Entertainment Only” or equivalent.
