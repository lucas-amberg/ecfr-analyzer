# § 700.279   Requests for access to records: Initial decision.

(a) *Decisions on requests.* A request made under this subpart for access to a record shall be granted promptly unless (1) the record was compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding or (2) the record is contained in a system of records which has been excepted from the access provisions of the Privacy Act by rulemaking.


(b) *Authority to deny requests.* A decision to deny a request for access under this subpart shall be made by the Privacy Act Officer.


(c) *Form of decision.* (1) No particular form is required for a decision granting access to a record. The decision shall, however, advise the individual requesting the record as to where and when the record is available for inspection or, as the case may be, where and when copies will be available. If fees are due under § 700.279(d), the individual requesting the record shall also be notified of the amount of fees due or, if the exact amount has not been determined, the approximate amount of fees due.


(2) A decision denying a request for access, in whole or part, shall be in writing and shall state the basis for denial of the request. The decision shall also contain a statement that the denial may be appealed to the Executive Director pursuant to § 700.281 by writing to Privacy Act Officer, Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation Commission, P.O. Box KK, Flagstaff, Arizona 86002, and that the appeal must be received by this official within twenty (20) days (Saturdays, Sundays and public legal holidays excepted) of the date of the decision.


(d) *Fees.* (1) No fees may be charged for the cost of searching for or reviewing a record in response to a request made under § 700.271.


(2) Fees for copying a record in response to a request made under § 700.271 shall be charged in accordance with the schedule of charges contained in the Commission's Management Manual, unless the official responsible for processing the request determines that, in his/her opinion, reduction or waiver of fees is appropriate.


(3) Where it is anticipated that fees chargeable in connection with a request will exceed the amount the person submitting the request has indicated he/she is willing to pay, the official processing the request shall notify the requester and shall not complete processing of the request until the requester has agreed, in writing, to pay fees as high as are anticipated.
