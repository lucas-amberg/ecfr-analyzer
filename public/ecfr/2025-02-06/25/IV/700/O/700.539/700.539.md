(a) An employee shall not solicit a contribution from another employee for a gift to an official superior, make a donation as a gift to an official superior or accept a gift from an employee receiving less pay than himself or herself. (5 U.S.C. 7351) However, this paragraph does not preclude a voluntary gift of nominal value made on a special occasion.


(b) If authorized by the supervisor, an employee may solicit contributions for charitable causes. He or she may also be permitted to collect small donations for gifts for fellow employees for special occasions during slack moments.
