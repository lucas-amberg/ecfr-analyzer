# ยง 700.545   Alcoholism and drug abuse.

An employee who habitually uses intoxicants to excess is subject to removal (5 U.S.C. 7352). The Relocation Commission recognizes alcoholism and drug abuse as serious and treatable illnesses. Excessive absence and poor work performance are two of the specific problems resulting from excessive use of alcohol and drugs. The Commission management will assist any employee who has such a problem to obtain professional help and will make reasonable allowance as permitted by work schedules to allow an employee approved leave for professional treatment. Anyone who seeks such assistance will be guaranteed confidential handling of his or her case. Disciplinary action will be considered if an employee rejects or ignores treatment or other appropriate assistance.
