# § 900.39   What is the difference between a standard and a system?

(a) Standards are the minimum baseline requirements for the performance of an activity. Standards establish the “what” that an activity should accomplish. 


(b) Systems are the procedural mechanisms and processes for the day-to-day conduct of an activity. Systems are “how” the activity will be accomplished.
