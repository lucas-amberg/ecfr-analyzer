# ยง 900.54   Should the property management system prescribe internal controls?

Yes. Effective internal controls should include procedures: 


(a) For the conduct of periodic inventories; 


(b) To prevent loss or damage to property; and 


(c) To ensure that property is used for an Indian tribe or tribal organization's self-determination contract(s) until the property is declared excess to the needs of the contract consistent with the Indian tribe or tribal organization's property management system.
