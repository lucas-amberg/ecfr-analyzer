# § 900.117   Do these “construction contract” regulations apply to planning services?

(a) These regulations apply to planning services contracts only as provided in this section. 


(1) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall submit to the Secretary for review and approval the POR documents produced as a part of a model contract under section 108 of the Act or under a construction contract under this subpart. 


(i) Within 60 days after receipt of the POR from the Indian tribe or tribal organization for a project that has achieved priority ranking or that is funded, the Secretary shall: 


(A) Approve the POR; 


(B) Notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of and make available any objections to the POR that the Secretary may have; or 


(C) Notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of the reasons why the Secretary will be unable either to approve the POR or to notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of any objections within 60 days, and state the time within which the notification will be made, provided that the extended time shall not exceed 60 additional days. 


(ii) Within a maximum of 180 days after receipt of a POR from an Indian tribe or tribal organization for a project that is not funded and is not described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the Secretary shall: 


(A) Approve the POR; or 


(B) Notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of and make available any objections to the POR; or 


(C) Notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of the reasons why the Secretary will be unable either to approve the POR or to notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of any objections within 180 days, and state the time within which the notification will be made, provided that the extended time shall not exceed 60 additional days. 


(2) Any failure of the Secretary to act on a POR within the applicable period required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be deemed a rejection of the POR and will authorize the commencement of any appeal as provided in section 110 of the Act, or, if a model agreement under section 108 of the Act is used, the disputes provision of that agreement. 


(3) If an Indian tribe or tribal organization elects to provide planning services as part of a construction contract rather than under a model agreement as set out in section 108 of the Act, the regulations in this subpart shall apply. 


(b) The parties to the contract are encouraged to consult during the development of the POR and following submission of the POR to the Secretary.
