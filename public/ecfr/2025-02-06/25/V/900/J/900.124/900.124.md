# ยง 900.124   May the Indian tribe or tribal organization elect to use a grant in lieu of a contract?

Yes. A grant agreement or a cooperative agreement may be used in lieu of a contract under sections 102 and 103 of the Act when agreed to by the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization. Under the grant concept, the grantee will assume full responsibility and accountability for design and construction performance within the funding limitations. The grantee will manage and administer the work with minimal involvement by the government. The grantee will be expected to have acceptable management systems for finance, procurement, and property. The Secretary may issue Federal construction guidelines and manuals applicable to its construction programs, and the government shall accept tribal proposals for alternatives which are consistent with or exceed Federal guidelines or manuals applicable to construction programs.
