# § 900.133   Does the declination process or the Contract Dispute Act apply to construction contract amendments proposed either by an Indian tribe or tribal organization or the Secretary?

The Contract Disputes Act generally applies to such amendments. However, the declination process and the procedures in §§ 900.122 and 900.123 apply to the proposal by an Indian tribe or tribal organization when the proposal is for a new project, a new phase or discreet stage of a phase of a project, or an expansion of a project resulting from an additional allocation of funds by the Secretary under § 900.120.
