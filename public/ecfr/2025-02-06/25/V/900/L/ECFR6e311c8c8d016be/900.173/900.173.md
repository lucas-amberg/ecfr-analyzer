# § 900.173   Is the recommended decision always final?

No. Any party to the appeal may file precise and specific written objections to the recommended decision, or any other comments, within 15 days of receiving the recommended decision. You shall serve a copy of your objections on the other party. The recommended decision will become final 15 days after the Indian tribe or tribal organization receives the ALJ's recommended decision, unless a written statement of objections is filed with the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the IBIA during the 15-day period. If no party files a written statement of objections within 15 days, the recommended decision will become final.
