The request of the Indian tribe or tribal organization shall be in writing, and shall give a reason for not filing its notice of appeal within the 30-day time period. If the Indian tribe or tribal organization has a valid reason for not filing its notice of appeal on time, it may receive an extension from the IBIA.
