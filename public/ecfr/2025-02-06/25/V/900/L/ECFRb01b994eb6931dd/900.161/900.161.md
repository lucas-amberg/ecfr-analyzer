# ยง 900.161   How is a hearing arranged?

(a) If a hearing is to be held, the IBIA will refer the Indian tribe or tribal organization's case to the Hearings Division of the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the U.S. Department of the Interior. The case will then be assigned to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3105. 


(b) Within 15 days of the date of the referral, the ALJ will hold a pre-hearing conference, by telephone or in person, to decide whether an evidentiary hearing is necessary, or whether it is possible to decide the appeal based on the written record. At the pre-hearing conference the ALJ will provide for: 


(1) A briefing and discovery schedule; 


(2) A schedule for the exchange of information, including, but not limited to witness and exhibit lists, if an evidentiary hearing is to be held; 


(3) The simplification or clarification of issues; 


(4) The limitation of the number of expert witnesses, or avoidance of similar cumulative evidence, if an evidentiary hearing is to be held; 


(5) The possibility of agreement disposing of all or any of the issues in dispute; and 


(6) Such other matters as may aid in the disposition of the appeal. 


(c) The ALJ shall order a written record to be made of any conference results that are not reflected in a transcript.
