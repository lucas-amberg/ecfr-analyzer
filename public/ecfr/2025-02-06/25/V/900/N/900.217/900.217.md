# ยง 900.217   Is filing a claim under the CDA our only option for resolving post-award contract disputes?

No. The Federal government attempts to resolve all contract disputes by agreement at the awarding official's level. These are alternatives to filing a claim under the CDA:


(a) Before issuing a decision on a claim, the awarding official should consider using informal discussions between the parties, assisted by individuals who have not substantially participated in the matter, to aid in resolving differences.


(b) In addition to filing a CDA claim, or instead of filing a CDA claim, the parties may choose to use an alternative dispute resolution mechanism, pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act, Public Law 101-552, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 581 *et seq.,* or the options listed in section 108(1)(b)(12) of the Indian Self-Determination Act, as applicable.
