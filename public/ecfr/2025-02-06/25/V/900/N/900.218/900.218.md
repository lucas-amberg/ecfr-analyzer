(a) A claim is a written demand by one of the contracting parties, asking for one or more of the following:


(1) Payment of a specific sum of money under the contract;


(2) Adjustment or interpretation of contract terms; or


(3) Any other claim relating to the contract.

(2) It is not acted upon in a reasonable time and written notice of the claim is given to the awarding official by the senior official designated in the contract.
