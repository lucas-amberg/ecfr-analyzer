# ยง 900.231   What is an organizational conflict of interest?

An organizational conflict of interest arises when there is a direct conflict between the financial interests of the contracting Indian tribe or tribal organization and: 


(a) The financial interests of beneficial owners of Indian trust resources; 


(b) The financial interests of the United States relating to trust resources, trust acquisitions, or lands conveyed or to be conveyed pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act 43 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq.;* or 


(c) An express statutory obligation of the United States to third parties. This section only applies if the conflict was not addressed when the contract was first negotiated. This section only applies where the financial interests of the Indian tribe or tribal organization are significant enough to impair the Indian tribe or tribal organization's objectivity in carrying out the contract, or a portion of the contract.
