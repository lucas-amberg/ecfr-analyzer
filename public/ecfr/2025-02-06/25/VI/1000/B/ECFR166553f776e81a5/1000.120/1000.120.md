# ยง 1000.120   How many additional Tribes/Consortia may participate in self-governance per year?

(a) The Secretary, acting through the Director of the OSG, may select not more than 50 new Indian Tribes per year from those Tribes eligible under 25 U.S.C. 5362(c) to participate in self-governance. A Consortium of Indian Tribes counts as one Tribe for purposes of calculating the 50 additional Tribes per year.


(b) The limitation of not more than 50 new Tribes per year does not preclude a signatory Tribe from negotiating a new or amended compact or funding agreement. Such new or amended compacts or funding agreements do not count against the limitation of not more than 50 new Tribes per year.
