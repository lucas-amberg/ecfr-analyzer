(2) Meets the eligibility criteria in §§ 1000.115 and 1000.125 but chooses to be a member of a Consortium and have a representative of the Consortium sign the compact and funding agreement on its behalf.


(b) A non-signatory Tribe under paragraph (a)(1) of this section:


(1) May not sign the compact and funding agreement. A representative of the Consortium must sign both documents on behalf of the Tribe.
