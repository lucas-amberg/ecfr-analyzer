# ยง 1000.170   Are there any time frames to negotiate an initial compact or funding agreement for a Tribe not presently participating in self-governance?

Yes.


(a) Once selected to participate in self-governance, the parties should begin negotiations at least 180 days before the proposed effective date of the initial funding agreement and compact (*e.g.,* October 1, January 1, or such other date as the parties agree in the initial funding agreement or compact).


(b) A Tribe/Consortium may be selected to participate during one year but negotiate a compact and funding agreement in a subsequent year. In this case, the Tribe/Consortium must, before the applicable period established in ยง 1000.160, submit to OSG documentation demonstrating continued eligibility under 25 U.S.C. 5362(c).
