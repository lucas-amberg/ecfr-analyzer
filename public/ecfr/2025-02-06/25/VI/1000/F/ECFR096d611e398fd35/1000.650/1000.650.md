# ยง 1000.650   How does the funding agreement specify the services provided, functions performed, and responsibilities assumed by the Tribe/Consortium and those retained by the Secretary?

(a) The funding agreement must specify in writing the services, functions, and responsibilities to be assumed by the Tribe/Consortium and the functions, services, and responsibilities to be retained by the Secretary.


(b) Any division of responsibilities between the Tribe/Consortium and BIA must be clearly stated in writing as part of the funding agreement. Similarly, when there is a relationship between the program and BIA's inherent Federal functions, the relationship must be explained in the funding agreement.
