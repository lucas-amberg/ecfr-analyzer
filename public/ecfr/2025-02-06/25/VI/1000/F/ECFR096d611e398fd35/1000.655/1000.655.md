# ยง 1000.655   May a Tribe/Consortium redesign or consolidate the programs that are included in a funding agreement and reallocate funds for such programs?

Except where a statute contains specific limitations on the use of funds, a Tribe/Consortium may redesign or consolidate programs included in a funding agreement and reallocate funds for such programs in any manner which it deems to be in the best interest of the Indian community being served, so long as the redesign or consolidation does not have the effect of denying eligibility for services to population groups otherwise eligible to be served under applicable Federal law; provided however, that a reduction in funds available for a program or service shall not be considered a denial of eligibility for services. However, redesign of construction project(s) included in a funding agreement must be done in accordance with subpart K of this part.
