# ยง 1000.750   Once a Tribe/Consortium establishes a stable base budget, are funding amounts renegotiated each year?

No, unless otherwise requested by the Tribe/Consortium, these amounts are not renegotiated each year. If a Tribe/Consortium renegotiates funding levels:


(a) It must negotiate all funding levels in the funding agreement using the process for determining funds for BIA to carry out inherent Federal functions on the same basis as other Tribes; and


(b) It is eligible for funding amounts of new programs or available programs not previously included in the funding agreement on the same basis as other Tribes.
