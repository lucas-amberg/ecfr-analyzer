# ยง 1000.740   Can funding amounts negotiated in a funding agreement be adjusted during the year it is in effect?

Yes, funding amounts negotiated in a funding agreement may be adjusted under the following circumstances:


(a) *Congressional action.* (1) Increases/decreases as a result of Congressional appropriations and/or a directive in the statement of managers accompanying a conference report on an appropriations bill or continuing resolution.


(2) General decreases due to Congressional action must be applied consistently to BIA, self-governance Tribes/Consortium, and Tribes/Consortium not participating in self-governance.


(3) General increases due to Congressional appropriations must be applied consistently, except where used to achieve equitable distribution among regions and Tribes.


(4) A Tribe/Consortium will be notified of any decrease and be provided an opportunity to reconcile.


(b) *Mistakes.* If the Tribe/Consortium or the Secretary can identify and document substantive errors in calculations, the parties will renegotiate the amounts and make every effort to correct such errors.


(c) *Mutual Agreement.* Both the Tribe/Consortium and the Secretary may agree to renegotiate amounts at any time.
