# § 1000.845   Are there any non-BIA programs that may not be included in a funding agreement?

(a) Inherently Federal functions in accordance with 25 U.S.C. 5361(6) and 5363(k).


(b) Programs where the statute establishing the existing program does not authorize the type of participation sought by the Tribe/Consortium. In determining whether a statute “does not authorize the type of participation sought by” the Tribe/Consortium within the meaning of 25 U.S.C. 5363(k), the Department shall take the following factors into consideration:


(1) Tribes need not be identified in an authorizing statute in order for a program, or element of a program, to be included in a funding agreement;


(2) The lack of specificity in a statute by itself does not create a blanket exclusion from inclusion of a program, or element of a program, in a funding agreement; and


(3) It is not an adequate ground to refuse to compact specific functions that are not inherently Federal in character, simply because an organic statute vests an agency with generic management authority over a broad category of land.


(c) The Secretary shall interpret each Federal law and regulation in a manner that facilitates:


(1) The inclusion of programs in funding agreements; and


(2) The implementation of funding agreements.
