# ยง 1000.885   What funds are included in a non-BIA funding agreement?

Non-BIA bureaus determine the amount of funding to be included in the funding agreement using the following principles:


(a) *403(b)(2) Programs (25 U.S.C. 5363(b)(2)).* In general, funds are provided in a funding agreement to the Tribe/Consortium in an amount equal to the amount that it is eligible to receive under section 106 of the Act, as amended.


(b) *403(c) Programs (25 U.S.C. 5363(c)).* (1) The funding agreement will include:


(i) Amounts equal to the direct program or project costs the bureau would have incurred were it to operate that program at the level of work mutually agreed to in the funding agreement; and:


(ii) Allowable indirect costs; and


(iii) Such amounts as the Tribe/Consortium and the Secretary may negotiate for pre-award, start-up and direct contract support costs.


(2) A bureau is not required to include management and support funds from the regional or central office level in a funding agreement, unless:


(i) The Tribe/Consortium will perform work previously performed at the regional or central office level;


(ii) The work is not compensated in the indirect cost rate; and


(iii) Including management and support costs in the funding agreement does not result in the Tribe/Consortium being paid twice for the same work when negotiated indirect cost rate is applied.
