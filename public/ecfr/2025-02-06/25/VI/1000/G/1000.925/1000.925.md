# ยง 1000.925   What happens if a funding agreement expires before the effective date of the successor Funding Agreement?

If the effective date of a successor funding agreement is not on or before the expiration of the current funding agreement, subject to terms mutually agreed upon by the Tribe/Consortium and the Secretary at the time the current funding agreement was negotiated or in a subsequent amendment, the Tribe/Consortium may continue to carry out the program authorized under the funding agreement to the extent resources permit. During this extension period, the current funding agreement shall remain in effect, including coverage of the Tribe/Consortium under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) 28 U.S.C. 2671-2680 (1994); and the Tribe/Consortium may use any funds remaining under the funding agreement, savings from other programs or Tribal funds to carry out the program. Nothing in this section authorizes a funding agreement to be continued beyond the completion of the program authorized under the funding agreement or the amended funding agreement. This section also does not entitle a Tribe/Consortium to receive, nor does it prevent a Tribe/Consortium from receiving, additional funding under any successor funding agreement. The successor funding agreement must provide funding to the Tribe/Consortium at a level necessary for the Tribe/Consortium to perform the PSFA, or portions thereof, for the full period they were or will be performed.
