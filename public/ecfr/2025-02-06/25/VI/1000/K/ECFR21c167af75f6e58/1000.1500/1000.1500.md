# ยง 1000.1500   When a Tribe withdraws from a Consortium, is the Secretary required to award to the withdrawing Tribe a portion of funds associated with a construction project if the withdrawing Tribe so requests?

Under ยง 1000.235, a Tribe may withdraw from a Consortium and request its portion of a construction project's funds. The Secretary may decide not to award these funds if the award will affect the Consortium's ability to complete a non-severable phase of the project within available funding. A non-severable phase of a project would include but is not limited to the construction of a single building serving a Consortium. A severable phase of a project would include but is not limited to the funding for a road in one village where the Consortium would be able to complete the roads in the other villages that were part of the project approved initially in the funding agreement. The Secretary's decision under this section may be appealed under subpart R of this part.
