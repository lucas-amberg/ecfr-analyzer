(1) Designating a certifying Tribal officer to represent the Indian Tribe and to assume the status of a responsible Federal official under those Acts, laws, or regulations; and


(2) Accepting the jurisdiction of the United States courts for the purpose of enforcing the responsibilities of the certifying Tribal officer assuming the status of a responsible Federal official under those Acts, laws, or regulations.


(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, nothing in this section authorizes the Secretary to include in any compact or funding agreement duties of the Secretary under NEPA, NHPA, and other related provisions of law that are inherent Federal functions.
