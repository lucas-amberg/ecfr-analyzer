# ยง 1000.1385   What is the typical environmental review process for construction projects?

(a) During the environmental review process, the following activities may occur:


(1) Consult with appropriate Tribal, Federal, state, local officials, and interested parties on potential environmental effects;


(2) Document assessment of reasonably foreseeable environmental effects;


(3) Perform necessary environmental surveys and inventories;


(4) Consult with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, acting through the SHPO or THPO, to ensure compliance with the NHPA;


(5) In applying a categorical exclusion under NEPA, evaluate whether extraordinary circumstances exist in which a normally excluded project may have a significant effect, and therefore require preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement;


(6) Identify methods to avoid or mitigate potential adverse effects; and


(7) Obtain environmental permits and approvals as required.
