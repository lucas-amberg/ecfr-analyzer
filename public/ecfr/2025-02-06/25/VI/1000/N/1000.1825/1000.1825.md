# ยง 1000.1825   How will retrocession affect the Tribe's/Consortium's existing and future funding agreements?

Retrocession does not affect other parts of the funding agreement or funding agreements with other bureaus. A Tribe/Consortium may request to negotiate for and include retroceded programs in future funding agreements or through a self-determination contract.
