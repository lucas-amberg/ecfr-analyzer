# ยง 1000.1950   Does the annual trust review evaluation include a review of the Secretary's inherent Federal and retained operation trust PSFAs?

(a) When the annual trust evaluation by the Secretary reveals a deficient performance of trust PSFAs by a Tribe/Consortium due in part to the action or inaction of a bureau, it will trigger an evaluation by the Department of the Secretary's inherent Federal functions and any retained trust PSFAs pertaining to the bureau's action or inaction.


(b) The appropriate Department officials will be notified in writing by the Secretary's representative of the need for corrective action. A copy of such written notice shall be sent by the Secretary's representative to the Tribe/Consortium. The review of the Secretary's trust PSFAs shall be based on the standards in Federal law.
