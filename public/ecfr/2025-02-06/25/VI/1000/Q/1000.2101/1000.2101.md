# § 1000.2101   How can a Tribe/Consortium hire a Federal employee to help implement a funding agreement?

If a Tribe/Consortium chooses to hire a Federal employee, it can use, in addition to any other available options, one of the arrangements listed in this section:


(a) The Tribe/Consortium can use its own personnel hiring procedures. Federal employees hired by the Tribe/Consortium are separated from Federal service.


(b) The Tribe/Consortium can “direct hire” a Federal employee as a Tribal/Consortium employee. The employee will be separated from Federal service and work for the Tribe/Consortium, but maintain a negotiated Federal benefit package that is paid for by the Tribe/Consortium out of funding agreement program funds; or


(c) The Tribe/Consortium can negotiate an agreement under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act, 5 U.S.C. 3371 through 3375, 25 U.S.C. 323, 25 U.S.C. 48, or other applicable Federal law. The employee will remain a Federal employee during the term of the agreement.
