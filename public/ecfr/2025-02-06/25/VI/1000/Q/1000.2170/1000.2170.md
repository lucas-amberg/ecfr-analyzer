# ยง 1000.2170   How can a person or group appeal a decision or contest an action related to a program operated by a Tribe/Consortium under a funding agreement?

(a) *BIA Programs.* A person or group who is aggrieved by an action of a Tribe/Consortium with respect to programs that are provided by the Tribe/Consortium under a funding agreement must follow Tribal administrative procedures.


(b) *Non-BIA Programs.* Procedures will vary depending on the program. Aggrieved parties should initially contact the local program administrator (the Indian program contact). Thereafter, appeals will follow the relevant bureau's appeal procedures.
