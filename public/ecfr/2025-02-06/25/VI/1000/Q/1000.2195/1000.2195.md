# ยง 1000.2195   Can a Tribe/Consortium use Federal supply sources in the performance of a funding agreement?

Yes. A Tribe/Consortium and its employees may use Federal supply sources (including lodging, airline, interagency motor pool vehicles, and other means of transportation) or other Federal resources (including supplies, services and resources available to the Secretary under any procurement contracts in which the Department is eligible to participate), to the same extent as if the Tribe/Consortium were a Federal agency. While implementation of this provision is the responsibility of the General Services Administration, the Department shall assist the Tribes/Consortia to resolve any barriers to full implementation that may arise to the fullest extent possible.
