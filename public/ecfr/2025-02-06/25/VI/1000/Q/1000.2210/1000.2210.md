# ยง 1000.2210   Is a Tribe/Consortium obligated to continue performance under a compact or funding agreement if the Secretary does not transfer sufficient funds?

A Tribe/Consortium shall not be obligated to continue performance that requires an expenditure of funds in excess of the amount of funds transferred under a compact or funding agreement. If at any time the Tribe/Consortium has reason to believe that the total amount provided for a specific activity under a compact or funding agreement is insufficient, the Tribe/Consortium shall provide reasonable notice of such insufficiency to the Secretary. If, after notice, the Secretary does not increase the amount of funds transferred under the funding agreement, the Tribe/Consortium may suspend performance of the activity until such time as additional funds are transferred. Nothing in 25 U.S.C. 5368(*l*) reduces any programs, services, or funds of, or provided to, another Tribe/Consortium.
