# ยง 1000.2305   How must disputes be handled?

(a) The Department encourages its bureaus to seek all means of dispute resolution before the Tribe/Consortium files a formal appeal(s).


(b) Disputes shall be addressed through government-to-government discourse. This discourse must be respectful of government-to-government relationships and relevant Federal-Tribal agreements, treaties, judicial decisions, and policies pertaining to Indian Tribes, including, but not limited to, such applicable principles described in subpart I.


(c) All disputes arising under this rule, including, but not limited to, disputes related to decisions described in ยง 1000.2345, may use non-binding informal alternative dispute resolution, such as an informal conference or assistance of the Department's Office of Collaborative Action and Dispute Resolution (CADR), at the option of the Tribe/Consortium. The Tribe/Consortium may ask for this alternative dispute resolution any time before the issuance of an initial decision of a formal appeal. The appeals timetable will be suspended while alternative dispute resolution is pending.
