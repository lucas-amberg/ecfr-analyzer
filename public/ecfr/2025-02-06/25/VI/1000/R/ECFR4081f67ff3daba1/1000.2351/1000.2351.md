# § 1000.2351   To Whom may a Tribe/Consortia appeal a decision under § 1000.2345?

(a) *Filing an appeal.* A Tribe/Consortium may elect to file a dispute under § 1000.2345 with either the bureau head/Assistant Secretary or IBIA in accordance with this subpart. However, the Tribe/Consortium may not avail itself to both paths for the same dispute.


(b) *Bureau head/Assistant Secretary appeal.* Unless the initial decision being appealed is one that was made by the bureau head (those appeals are forwarded to the appropriate Assistant Secretary—*see* § 1000.2360(c), of this subpart), the bureau head will decide initial appeals relating to these pre-award matters, that include but are not limited to disputes regarding:


(1) Eligibility to participate in self-governance;


(2) Decisions declining to provide requested information as addressed in subpart H;


(3) Allocations of program funds when a dispute arises between a Consortium and a withdrawing Tribe; and


(4) Inherently Federal functions and associated funding.


(c) *IBIA.* The Tribe/Consortium may choose to forego the administrative appeal through the bureau or the Assistant Secretary, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, and instead appeal directly to IBIA.
