For all purposes relating to these informal conference procedures, the parties are the designated representatives of the Tribe/Consortium and the bureau.


(a) The informal conference shall be held within 30 days of the date the request was received, unless the parties agree on another date.


(b) If possible, at the option of the Tribe/Consortium, the informal conference will be held at the Tribe's/Consortium's office. If the meeting cannot be held at the Tribe's/Consortium's office, the parties must agree on an alternative meeting place or forum, including but not limited to telephonic or virtual meeting forums. If the alternative meeting place is more than fifty miles from the Tribe's/Consortium's office, the Secretary must arrange to pay transportation costs and per diem for incidental expenses to allow for adequate representation of the Tribe/Consortium.


(c) The informal conference shall be conducted by a designated representative of the Secretary.


(d) Only the parties may make presentations at the informal conference.
