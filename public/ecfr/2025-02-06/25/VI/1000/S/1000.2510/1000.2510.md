# ยง 1000.2510   What must a Tribe/Consortium do if an organizational conflict of interest arises under a funding agreement?

This section only applies if the conflict was not addressed when the funding agreement was first negotiated. When a Tribe/Consortium becomes aware of an organizational conflict of interest, the Tribe/Consortium must immediately disclose the conflict to the Secretary.
