# ยง 1001.8   Selection criteria for tribes/consortia to receive a negotiation grant.

(a) Who may be selected to receive a negotiation grant? Any tribe/consortium that has been accepted into the applicant pool in accordance with ยง 1001.5 and has been selected to negotiate a self-governance annual funding agreement is eligible to apply for a negotiation grant. Each year, we will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ with all relevant details as to how tribes/consortia which have been selected can apply for negotiation grants.


(b) What must a tribe/consortium do to receive a negotiation grant?


(1) To receive a negotiation grant, a tribe/consortium must:


(i) Be selected from the applicant pool to negotiate an annual funding agreement;


(ii) Be identified as eligible to receive a negotiation grant; and


(iii) Not have received a negotiation grant within the 3 years preceding the date of the latest _Federal Register_ announcement described in ยง 1001.7. 


(2) The tribe/consortium must submit a letter affirming its readiness to negotiate and formally request a negotiation grant to prepare for and negotiate a self-governance agreement. These grants are not competitive.


(c) May a selected tribe negotiate without applying for a negotiation grant? Yes. In this case, the tribe should notify us in writing so that funds can be reallocated for other grants.
