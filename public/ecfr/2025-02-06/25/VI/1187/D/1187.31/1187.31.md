# ยง 1187.31   May OIED award a grant that is duplicative of Federal funding from another source?

OIED may not award a grant under the IBIP that is duplicative of existing Federal funding from another source. Duplicative funding means any funding from other Federal grants that would overlap with the IBIP grant for the same activities described in the applicant's IBIP proposal.
