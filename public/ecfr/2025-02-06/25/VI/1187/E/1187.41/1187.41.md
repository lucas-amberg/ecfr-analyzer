# ยง 1187.41   May OIED renew a grant award?

(a) OIED may renew a grant award under the IBIP for one additional three-year term. In determining whether to renew a grant award, OIED will consider for the awardee:


(1) The results of the annual evaluation of the awardee conducted under ยง 1187.50;


(2) The performance of the awardee's business incubator, as compared to the performance of other business incubators receiving grants under the IBIP;


(3) Whether the awardee continues to be eligible for the IBIP; and


(4) The evaluation consideration for initial awards under ยง 1187.20.


(b) Awardees that receive a grant renewal must provide non-Federal contributions in an amount not less than 33 percent of the total amount of the grant. Failure to provide the non-Federal contribution will result in noncompliance and OIED withholding of funds, unless OIED waives the requirement under ยง 1187.43.
