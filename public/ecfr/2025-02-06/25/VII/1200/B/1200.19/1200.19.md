# ยง 1200.19   How can the plan be revised?

Once a tribe has withdrawn its funds, the tribe may revise its plan without our approval. All revisions should conform to the procedures outlined in the approved management plan. The tribe should inform its members of all revisions to a plan through normal tribal procedures before the revisions are implemented.
