# ยง 1200.20   How can a tribe withdraw additional funds?

(a) If a tribe has withdrawn funds under an approved tribal management plan and wishes to withdraw additional funds that will be managed under the same plan, it need not submit a complete new application. The tribe must:


(1) Notify us of the additional amount it intends to withdraw and whether the funds to be withdrawn are in kind or cash. (Written notification should be provided to our address in ยง 1200.13);


(2) Send us a tribal resolution approving the new withdrawal and certifying that the funds are being withdrawn subject to the same conditions and that they will be managed under the plan in the original approved application;


(3) Send us a copy of the most recent compliance audit or investment report.


(b) After we finish our review we will release the additional funds, unless the compliance audit or investment report indicates that the tribe is not complying with its management plan. In this case, we will not release the additional funds until the tribe demonstrates that it is complying with the management plan.
