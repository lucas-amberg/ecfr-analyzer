# § 1.50A-4   Exceptions to the application of § 1.50A-3.

(a) *In general.* Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of § 1.50A-3, a termination of employment shall not be deemed to occur if paragraph (b) (relating to voluntary termination of employment), paragraph (c) (relating to termination of employment due to disability), paragraph (d) (relating to termination of employment due to misconduct), paragraph (f) (relating to transactions to which section 381(a) applies), or paragraph (g) (relating to mere change in form of conducting a trade or business) applies. 


(b) *Voluntary termination of employment.* A termination of employment shall not be deemed to occur for purposes of paragraph (a) of § 1.50A-3 if the employee voluntarily leaves the employment of the taxpayer. If the taxpayer makes the working conditions of the employee so untenable that the employee is, in effect, compelled by the taxpayer to quit, or if the employee is coerced into quitting, the employee will not be deemed to have voluntarily left the employment of the taxpayer. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a substantial reduction in the benefits of employment of an employee (such as a substantial decrease in the hours of the employee's working week) shall constitute untenable working conditions. An employee has voluntarily left the employment of the taxpayer if he leaves for any reason external to his employment, such as sickness or death in the employee's family which the employee feels necessitates his quitting work with the taxpayer to remain at home. Any employee who participates in an authorized strike (as finally determined by a court, labor relations administrative body, or arbiter) will not be deemed to have voluntarily left the employment of the taxpayer. 


(c) *Termination of employment due to death or disability.* A termination of employment shall not be deemed to occur for purposes of paragraph (a) of § 1.50A-3 if, after the initial date of employment (as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of § 1.50A-3) and before the close of the period referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.50A-3, the employee becomes disabled, by reason of illness or injury (including a disability relating to the employment), to perform the services required by such employment, unless, before the close of such period: 


(1) Such disability is removed, 


(2) The employer knows of the removal of the disability, and 


(3) The employer fails to offer reemployment to such employee. 


(d) *Termination of employment due to misconduct.* A termination of employment shall not be deemed to occur for purposes of paragraph (a) of § 1.50A-3 if it is determined by the appropriate State administrative agency or State court that under the applicable State unemployment compensation law such termination was due to the misconduct of the WIN employee. If the WIN employee is not covered by the applicable State unemployment compensation law (or if the employee did not work for the minimum period required to qualify for unemployment compensation or if the employee did not apply for unemployment compensation), a termination of employment shall not be deemed to occur for purposes of paragraph (a) of § 1.50A-3 if the taxpayer demonstrates by convincing evidence that, were such employee covered by the applicable State unemployment compensation law (or if the employee had worked for such minimum period or if the employee had applied for unemployment compensation), he could reasonably have been found by such administrative agency or court to have been terminated for misconduct. 


(e) *Recordkeeping requirement.* A taxpayer who is claiming that a termination of employment falls within the provisions of paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section shall maintain sufficient records to support his claim until the expiration of the pertinent period of limitations. 


(f) *Transactions to which section 381(a) applies*—(1) *General rule.* The employment relationship between the taxpayer and a WIN employee (as defined in paragraph (h) of § 1.50B-1) shall not be deemed terminated for purposes of paragraph (a) of § 1.50A-3 in the case of a transaction to which section 381(a) (relating to carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions) applies. If there is a termination of employment (within the meaning of paragraph (a) of § 1.50A-3 and this section) by the acquiring corporation with respect to the WIN employee described in the preceding sentence, or if the acquiring corporation fails to pay comparable wages to such employee (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.50A-3), then paragraph (a)(3) of § 1.50A-3 shall apply to the acquiring corporation with respect to the credit allowed the acquired corporation as well as the credit allowed the acquiring corporation with respect to such employee. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the initial date of employment (as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of § 1.50A-3) of such employee with respect to the acquired corporation shall be deemed to be the initial date of employment of such employee with respect to the acquiring corporation and employment by the acquired corporation shall be deemed employment by the acquiring corporation. 


(2) *Examples.* This paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples: 


(g) *Mere change in form of conducting a trade or business*—(1) *General rule.* (i) The employment relationship between the taxpayer and a WIN employee (as defined in paragraph (h) of § 1.50B-1) shall not be deemed terminated for purposes of paragraph (a) of § 1.50A-3 in the case of a mere change in the form of conducting the trade or business in which such employment occurs, provided that the conditions set forth in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph are satisfied. 


(ii) The conditions referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph are as follows: 


(*a*) The WIN employee described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is retained in the same trade or business, 


(*b*) The taxpayer retains a substantial ownership interest in such trade or business, 


(*c*) Substantially all the assets necessary to operate such trade or business are transferred to the transferee who continues the employment of the WIN employee described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, and 


(*d*) The basis of the assets described in (*c*) of this subdivision in the hands of the transferee is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of such assets in the hands of the transferor. 


(2) *Substantial interest.* For purposes of this paragraph, the taxpayer shall be considered as having retained a substantial ownership interest in the trade or business only if, after the change in form, the ownership interest in such trade or business by such taxpayer— 


(i) Is substantial in relation to the total ownership interests of all persons, or 


(ii) Is equal to or greater than the ownership interest prior to the change in form. 


(3) *Termination of employment.* (i) If employment of a WIN employee described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph is terminated by the transferee, the employment of such employee shall be deemed terminated by the taxpayer for purposes of paragraph (a) of § 1.50A-3. For purposes of determining the period described in paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.50A-3 with respect to such taxpayer employment by the transferee shall be deemed employment by the transferor. 


(ii) If in any taxable year the taxpayer does not retain a substantial ownership interest in the trade or business directly or indirectly (through ownership in other entities provided that such other entities' bases in such interest are determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of such interest in the hands of the taxpayer) then, for purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.50A-3, there shall be deemed to be a termination of employment of the WIN employees described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph on the first date on which such taxpayer does not retain a substantial interest in the trade or business. For purposes of determining the period described in paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.50A-3, employment by the transferee shall be deemed employment by the transferor. Any taxpayer who seeks to establish his interest in a trade or business under the rule of this subdivision shall maintain adequate records to demonstrate his indirect interest in such trade or business after any such transfer or transfers. 


(iii) Notwithstanding subparagraph (1) of this paragraph and subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph in the case of a mere change in the form of a trade or business, if the interest of a taxpayer in the trade or business is reduced but such taxpayer has retained a substantial interest in such trade or business, paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.50A-5 (relating to electing small business corporations), paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.50A-6 (relating to estates or trusts), or paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of § 1.50A-7 (relating to partnerships) shall apply, as the case may be. 


(4) *Failure to pay comparable wages.* If the transferee fails to pay comparable wages (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.50A-3) to the WIN employee within the period described in paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.50A-3, then such failure shall be deemed to be a failure of the transferor (or in a case where the transferor is a partnership, estate, trust, or electing small business corporation, the partners, beneficiaries, or shareholders), and a recapture determination shall be made with respect to such WIN employee as provided in § 1.50A-3. For purposes of determining the period described in paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.50A-3 with respect to such transferor (or such partners, beneficiaries, or shareholders), employment by the transferee shall be deemed employment by such transferor. For special rules in the case of an electing small business corporation (as defined in section 1371(b)), an estate or trust, or a partnership, see respectively, § 1.50A-5, § 1.50A-6, or § 1.50A-7. 


(5) *Examples.* This paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples in each of which it is assumed that the transfer satisfies the conditions of subparagraphs (1)(ii) (*a*), (*c*) and (*d*) of this paragraph.
