# § 1.50A-6   Estates and trusts.

(a) *In general*—(1) *Termination of employment by an estate or trust.* If an estate or trust terminates (in a termination subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) of § 1.50A-3) the employment of any employee with respect to whom WIN expenses have been paid or incurred, a recapture determination shall be made under § 1.50A-3 with respect to the estate or trust, and each beneficiary who is treated, under paragraph (a) of § 1.50B-3 as a taxpayer who paid or incurred such expenses. For purposes of each such recapture determination the period of employment of such employees shall be the period beginning with the initial date of employment (as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of § 1.50A-3) with respect to the estate or trust and ending with the date of such employee or employees' termination (as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of § 1.50A-3). For definition of “recapture determination” see paragraph (a)(3) of § 1.50A-3. 


(2) *Disposition of interest.* (i) If— 


(*a*) WIN expenses are apportioned to an estate or trust, or to a beneficiary of an estate or trust who takes such expenses into account in computing his WIN expenses, and 


(*b*) After the end of the estate's, trust's, or beneficiary's taxable year in which such apportionment was taken into account and before the close of the period to which paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.50A-3 applies with respect to the employees to which such WIN expenses relate, such estate's, trust's, or such beneficiary's proportionate interest in the income of the estate or trust is reduced (for example, by a sale, or by the terms of the estate or trust instrument) below the percentage specified in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, 


(ii) The percentage referred to in subdivision (i)(*b*) of this subparagraph is 66
2/3 percent of the estate's, trust's, or beneficiary's proportionate interest in the income of the estate or trust for the taxable year of the apportionment under paragraph (a) of § 1.50B-3. However, once employment of an employee has been treated under this subparagraph as having terminated with respect to the estate, trust, or beneficiary to any extent, the percentage referred to shall be 33
1/3 percent of the estate's, trust's, or beneficiary's proportionate interest in the income of the estate or trust for the taxable year of the apportionment under paragraph (a) of § 1.50B-3. 


(iii) In determining a beneficiary's proportionate interest in the income of an estate or trust for purposes of this subparagraph, the beneficiary shall be considered to own any interest in such an estate or trust which he owns directly or indirectly (through ownership in other entities provided such other entities' bases in such interests are determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of such interest in the hands of the beneficiary). For example, if A, whose proportionate interest in the income of trust X is 30 percent, transfers all of such interest to corporation Y in exchange for all of the stock of Y in a transaction to which section 351 applies, then, for purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, A shall be considered to own a 30-percent interest in trust X. Any taxpayer who seeks to establish his interest in an estate or trust under the rule of this subdivision shall maintain adequate records to demonstrate his indirect interest in the estate or trust after any such transfer or transfers. 


(b) *Computation of the first 12 months of employment.* The period described in paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.50A-3 shall not be affected by a change in the beneficiaries of an estate or trust and shall not be affected by a reduction or a termination of a beneficiary's interest in the income of such estate or trust. Thus, the period described in paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.50A-3 for any WIN employee shall be the same with respect to a trust or estate and any beneficiary of such trust or estate which is allowed a credit under section 40 for salaries and wages paid or incurred for services rendered by such employee. Also, such period with respect to any WIN employee shall not be deemed to begin again as the result of the acquisition of the interest by another. 


(c) *Examples.* Paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:
