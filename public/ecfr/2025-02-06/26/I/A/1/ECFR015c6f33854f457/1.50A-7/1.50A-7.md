# § 1.50A-7   Partnerships.

(a) *In general*—(1) *Termination of employment by a partnership.* If a partnership terminates (in a termination subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) of § 1.50A-3) the employment of any WIN employee with respect to whom WIN expenses have been paid or incurred, a recapture determination shall be made under § 1.50A-3 with respect to each partner who is treated, under paragraph (a) of § 1.50B-4, as a taxpayer with respect to such expenses. Each such recapture determination shall be made with respect to the share of the WIN expenses with respect to such employee which were taken into account by such partner under paragraph (a) of § 1.50B-4. For purposes of each such recapture determination the period of employment of any such employee shall be the period beginning with the initial date of employment (as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of § 1.50A-3) with respect to the partnership and ending with the date of such employee's termination (as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of § 1.50A-3). For the definition of “recapture determination” see paragraph (a)(3) of § 1.50A-3. 


(2) *Disposition of partner's interest.* (i) If— 


(*a*) WIN expenses are allocated to a partner of a partnership who takes such expenses into account in computing his WIN expenses, and 


(*b*) After the end of the partner's taxable year in which such allocation was taken into account and before the close of the period to which paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.50A-3 applies with respect to the employee to which such WIN expenses relate, such partner's proportionate interest in the general profits of the partnership (or in the particular expenses) is reduced (for example, by a sale, by a change in the partnership agreement, or by the admission of a new partner) below the percentage specified in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, 


(ii) The percentage referred to in subdivision (i)(*b*) of this subparagraph is 66
2/3 percent of the partner's proportionate interest in the general profits (or in the WIN expenses) of the partnership for the year of the apportionment under § 1.50B-4(a). However, once employment of an employee has been treated under this subparagraph as having terminated with respect to the partner to any extent, the percentage referred to shall be 33
1/3 percent of the partner's proportionate interest in the general profits (or in the WIN expenses) of the partnership for the taxable year of the apportionment under paragraph (a) of § 1.50B-4. 


(iii) In determining a partner's proportionate interest in the general profits (or in the WIN expenses) of a partnership for purposes of this subparagraph, the partner shall be considered to own any interest in such a partnership which he owns directly or indirectly (through ownership in other entities provided the other entities' bases in such interests are determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of such interest in the hands of the partner). For example, if A, whose proportionate interest in the general profits of partnership X is 20 percent, transfers all of such interest to Corporation Y in exchange for all of the stock of Y in a transaction to which section 351 applies then, for purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, A shall be considered to own a 20 percent interest in partnership X. Any taxpayer who seeks to establish his interest in a partnership under the rule of this subdivision shall maintain adequate records to demonstrate his indirect interest in the partnership after any such transfer or transfers. 


(3) *Computation of the first 12 months of employment.* The period described in paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.50A-3 shall not be affected by a change in the partners of such partnership and shall not be affected by a change in the ratio in which the partners divide the general profits (or the WIN expenses) of the partnership. Thus, such period for any WIN employee shall be the same with respect to any partner claiming a credit under section 40 for salaries and wages paid or incurred for services rendered by such employee. 


(b) *Examples.* Paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:
