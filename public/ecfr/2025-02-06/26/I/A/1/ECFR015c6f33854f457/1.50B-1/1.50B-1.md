(i) Having been placed in employment by the taxpayer (or if the taxpayer is a partner of a partnership, beneficiary of an estate or trust, or a shareholder of an electing small business corporation, by such partnership, estate, trust, or electing small business corporation) under a work incentive (WIN) program established under section 432(b)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 632(b)(1)), and 


(ii) Not having displaced any individual from employment. 


(2) *Examples.* The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples: 


(b) *Salaries and wages.* For purposes of this section, the term “salaries and wages” means only cash remuneration including a check. Amounts deducted and withheld from the employee's pay (for example, taxes and contributions to health and retirement plans) shall be deemed to be cash remuneration even though not actually paid directly to the employee. 


(c) *Trade or business expenses.* The term “WIN expenses” includes only salaries and wages which are paid or incurred in a trade or business of the taxpayer and which are deductible in computing taxable income.

(2) *Example.* Subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example: 


(f) *Maximum period of training or instruction.* The term “WIN expenses” does not include salaries and wages paid or incurred for services rendered by a WIN employee after the end of the 24-month period beginning with the date of initial employment (as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of § 1.50A-3) of the WIN employee.
