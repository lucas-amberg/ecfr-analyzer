# ยง 1.501(c)(9)-7   Voluntary employees' beneficiary associations; section 3(4) of ERISA.

The term *voluntary employees' beneficiary association* in section 501(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code is not necessarily coextensive with the term *employees' beneficiary association* as used in section 3(4) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. 1002(4), and the requirements which an organization must meet to be an *employees' beneficiary association* within the meaning of section 3(4) of ERISA are not necessarily identical to the requirements that an organization must meet in order to be a *voluntary employees' beneficiary association* within the meaning of section 501(c)(9) of the Code.
