# § 1.503(a)-1   Denial of exemption to certain organizations engaged in prohibited transactions.

(a)(1) Prior to January 1, 1970, section 503 applies to those organizations described in sections 501(c)(3), 501(c)(17), and section 401(a) except:


(i) A religious organization (other than a trust);


(ii) An educational organization which normally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled body of pupils or students in attendance at the place where its educational activities are regularly carried on;


(iii) An organization which normally receives a substantial part of its support (exclusive or income received in the exercise or performance by such organization of its charitable, educational, or other purpose or function constituting the basis for its exemption under section 501(a)) from the United States or any State or political subdivision thereof or from direct of indirect contributions from the general public,


(iv) An organization which is operated, supervised, controlled or principally supported by a religious organization (other than a trust) which is itself not subject to the provisions of this section; and


(v) An organization the principal purposes or functions of which are the providing of medical or hospital care or medical education or medical research or agricultural research.


(2) Effective January 1, 1907, and prior to January 1, 1975, section 503 shall apply only to organizations described in section 501(c) (17) or (18) or section 401(a).


(3) Effective January 1, 1975, section 503 shall apply only to organization described in section 501(c) (17) or (18) or described in section 401(a) and referred to in section 4975(g) (2) or (3).


(b) The prohibited transactions enumerated in section 503(b) are in addition to and not in limitation of the restrictions contained in section 501(c) (3), (17), or (18) or section 401(a). Even though an organization has not engaged in any of the prohibited transactions referred to in section 503(b), it still may not qualify for tax exemptions in view of the general provisions of section 501(c) (3), (17), or (18) or section 401(a). Thus, if a trustee or other fiduciary of the organization (whether or not he is also a creater or such organization) enters into a transaction with the organization, such transaction will be closely scrutinized in the light of the fiduciary principle requiring undivided loyalty to ascertain whether the organization is in fact being operated for the stated exempt purpose.


(c) An organization—


(1) Described in section 501(c)(3) which after July 1, 1950, but before January 1, 1970, has engaged in any prohibited transaction as defined in section 503(b), unless it is excepted by the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section;


(2) Described in section 401(a) and referred to in section 4975(g) (2) or (3) which after March 1, 1954, has engaged in any prohibited transaction as defined in section 503(b);


(3) Described in section 401(a) and not referred to in section 4975(g) (2) or (3) which after March 1, 1954, but before January 1, 1975, has engaged in any prohibited transaction as defined in section 503(b) or which after December 31, 1962, but before January 1, 1975, has engaged in any prohibited transaction as defined in section 503(g) prior to its repeal by section 2003(b)(5) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 978);


(4) Described in section 501(c)(17) which after December 31, 1959, has engaged in any prohibited transaction as defined in section 503(b); or


(5) Described in section 501(c)(18) which after December 31, 1969, has engaged in any prohibited transaction described in section 503(b)


(d) The application of section 503(b) may be illustrated by the following examples:
