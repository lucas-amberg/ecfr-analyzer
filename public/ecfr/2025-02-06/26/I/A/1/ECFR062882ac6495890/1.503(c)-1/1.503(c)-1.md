# § 1.503(c)-1   Future status of organizations denied exemption.

(a) Any organization described in section 501(c) (3), (17), or (18), or an employees' trust described in section 401(a), which is denied exemption under section 501(a) by reason of the provisions of section 503(a), may file, in any taxable year following the taxable year in which notice of denial was issued, a claim for exemption. In the case of organizations described in section 501(c) (3), (17), or (18), the appropriate exemption application shall be used for this purpose, and shall be filed with the district director. In the case of an enmployees' trust described in section 401(a), the information described in § 1.404(a)-2 shall be submitted with a letter claiming exemption. All employees' trust described in section 401(a) shall submit this information to the district director with whom a request for a determination as to its qualification under section 401 and exemption under section 501 may be submitted under paragraph (s) of § 601.201 of this chapter (Statement of Procedural Rules). A claim for exemption must contain or have attached to it, in addition to the information generally required of such an organization claiming exemption as an organization described in section 501(c) (17), or (18), or section 401(a) (or section 501(c)(3) prior to January 1, 1970), a written declaration made under the penalities of perjury by principal officer of such organization authorized to make such declaration that the organization will not knowingly again engage in a prohibited transaction, (as defined in section 503(b) (or 4975(c) if such section applies to such organization)). In the case of section 501(c)(3) organizations which have lost their exemption after December 31, 1969, pursuant to section 503, a claim for exemption must contain or have attached to it a written agreement made under penalities of perjury by a principal officer of such organization authorized to make such agreement that the organization will not violate the provisions of chapter 42. In addition, such organization must comply with the rules for governing instruments as prescribed in § 1.508-3. See § 1.501(a)-1 for proof of exemption requirements in general.


(b) If the Commissioner is satisfied that such organization will not knowingly again engage in a prohibited transaction (as defined under section 503(b) or 4975(c), as applicable to such organization) or in the case of a section 501(c)(3) organization, will not violate the provisions of chapter 42, and the organization also satisfied all the other requirements under section 501(c) (3), (17), or (18), or section 401(a), the organization will be so notified in writing. In such case the organization will be exempt (subject to the provisions of section 501(c)(3), or sections 501(c) (17), (18) or 401(a), and 503, and 504 when applicable) with respect to the taxable years subsequent to the taxable year in which the claim described in section 503(c) is filed. Section 503 contemplates that an organization denied exemption because of the terms of such section will be subject to taxation for at least one full taxable year. For the purpose of this section, the term *taxable year* means the established annual accounting period of the organization; or, if the organization has no such established annual accounting period, the *taxable year* of the organization means the calendar year.


(c) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, the denial of an exemption pursuant to this section, for a taxable year prior to January 1, 1970, of an organization described in section 501(c)(3) shall not cause such organization to cease to be described in section 501(c)(3) for purposes of part II of subchapter F, chapter 1 and for purposes of the application of chapter 42 taxes.


(d) In the case of an organization described in section 501(c)(3), which has lost its exemption pursuant to section 503, and which has not notified the Commissioner that it is applying for recognition of its exempt status under section 508(a) and this section, no gift or contribution made after December 31, 1969, which would otherwise be deductible under section 170, 642(c), or 545(b)(2) shall be allowed as a deduction.
