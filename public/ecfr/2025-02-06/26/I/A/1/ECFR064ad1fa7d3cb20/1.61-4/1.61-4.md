# § 1.61-4   Gross income of farmers.

(a) *Farmers using the cash method of accounting.* A farmer using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting shall include in his gross income for the taxable year—


(1) The amount of cash and the value of merchandise or other property received during the taxable year from the sale of livestock and produce which he raised,


(2) The profits from the sale of any livestock or other items which were purchased,


(3) All amounts received from breeding fees, fees from rent of teams, machinery, or land, and other incidental farm income,


(4) All subsidy and conservation payments received which must be considered as income, and


(5) Gross income from all other sources.


(b) *Farmers using an accrual method of accounting.* A farmer using an accrual method of accounting must use inventories to determine his gross income. His gross income on an accrual method is determined by adding the total of the items described in subparagraphs (1) through (5) of this paragraph and subtracting therefrom the total of the items described in subparagraphs (6) and (7) of this paragraph. These items are as follows:


(1) The sales price of all livestock and other products held for sale and sold during the year;


(2) The inventory value of livestock and products on hand and not sold at the end of the year;


(3) All miscellaneous items of income, such as breeding fees, fees from the rent of teams, machinery, or land, or other incidental farm income;


(4) Any subsidy or conservation payments which must be considered as income;


(5) Gross income from all other sources;


(6) The inventory value of the livestock and products on hand and not sold at the beginning of the year; and


(7) The cost of any livestock or products purchased during the year (except livestock held for draft, dairy, or breeding purposes, unless included in inventory).


(c) *Special rules for certain receipts.* In the case of the sale of machinery, farm equipment, or any other property (except stock in trade of the taxpayer, or property of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year, or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business), any excess of the proceeds of the sale over the adjusted basis of such property shall be included in the taxpayer's gross income for the taxable year in which such sale is made. See, however, section 453 and the regulations thereunder for special rules relating to certain installment sales. If farm produce is exchanged for merchandise, groceries, or the like, the market value of the article received in exchange is to be included in gross income. Proceeds of insurance, such as hail or fire insurance on growing crops, should be included in gross income to the extent of the amount received in cash or its equivalent for the crop injured or destroyed. See section 451(d) for special rule relating to election to include crop insurance proceeds in income for taxable year following taxable year of destruction. For taxable years beginning after July 12, 1972, where a farmer is engaged in producing crops and the process of gathering and disposing of such crops is not completed within the taxable year in which such crops are planted, the income therefrom may, with the consent of the Commissioner (see section 446 and the regulations thereunder), be computed upon the crop method. For taxable years beginning on or before July 12, 1972, where a farmer is engaged in producing crops which take more than a year from the time of planting to the time of gathering and disposing, the income therefrom may, with the consent of the Commissioner (see section 446 and the regulations thereunder), be computed upon the crop method. In any case in which the crop method is used, the entire cost of producing the crop must be taken as a deduction for the year in which the gross income from the crop is realized, and not earlier.


(d) *Definition of “farm”.* As used in this section, the term “farm” embraces the farm in the ordinarily accepted sense, and includes stock, dairy, poultry, fruit, and truck farms; also plantations, ranches, and all land used for farming operations. All individuals, partnerships, or corporations that cultivate, operate, or manage farms for gain or profit, either as owners or tenants, are designated as farmers. For more detailed rules with respect to the determination of whether or not an individual is engaged in farming, see § 1.175-3. For rules applicable to persons cultivating or operating a farm for recreation or pleasure, see sections 162 and 165, and the regulations thereunder.


(e) *Cross references.* (1) For election to include Commodity Credit Corporation loans as income, see section 77 and regulations thereunder.


(2) For definition of gross income derived from farming for purposes of limiting deductibility of soil and water conservation expenditures, see section 175 and regulations thereunder.


(3) For definition of gross income from farming in connection with declarations of estimated income tax, see section 6073 and regulations thereunder.
