# § 1.67-1T   2-percent floor on miscellaneous itemized deductions (temporary).

(a) *Type of expenses subject to the floor*—(1) *In general.* With respect to individuals, section 67 disallows deductions for miscellaneous itemized deductions (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) in computing taxable income (*i.e.,* so-called “below-the-line” deductions) to the extent that such otherwise allowable deductions do not exceed 2 percent of the individual's adjusted gross income (as defined in section 62 and the regulations thereunder). Examples of expenses that, if otherwise deductible, are subject to the 2-percent floor include but are not limited to—


(i) Unreimbursed employee expenses, such as expenses for transportation, travel fares and lodging while away from home, business meals and entertainment, continuing education courses, subscriptions to professional journals, union or professional dues, professional uniforms, job hunting, and the business use of the employee's home.


(ii) Expenses for the production or collection of income for which a deduction is otherwise allowable under section 212 (1) and (2), such as investment advisory fees, subscriptions to investment advisory publications, certain attorneys' fees, and the cost of safe deposit boxes,


(iii) Expenses for the determination of any tax for which a deduction is otherwise allowable under section 212(3), such as tax counsel fees and appraisal fees, and


(iv) Expenses for an activity for which a deduction is otherwise allowable under section 183.


(2) *Other limitations.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section, to the extent that any limitation or restriction is placed on the amount of a miscellaneous itemized deduction, that limitation shall apply prior to the application of the 2-percent floor. For example, in the case of an expense for food or beverages, only 80 percent of which is allowable as a deduction because of the limitations provided in section 274(n), the otherwise deductible 80 percent of the expense is treated as a miscellaneous itemized deduction and is subject to the 2-percent limitation of section 67.


(b) *Definition of miscellaneous itemized deductions.* For purposes of this section, the term “miscellaneous itemized deductions” means the deductions allowable from adjusted gross income in determining taxable income, as defined in section 63, other than—


(1) The standard deduction as defined in section 63(c),


(2) Any deduction allowable for impairment-related work expenses as defined in section 67(d),


(3) The deduction under section 72(b)(3) (relating to deductions if annuity payments cease before the investment is recovered),


(4) The deductions allowable under section 151 for personal exemptions,


(5) The deduction under section 163 (relating to interest),


(6) The deduction under section 164 (relating to taxes),


(7) The deduction under section 165(a) for losses described in subsection (c)(3) or (d) of section 165,


(8) The deduction under section 170 (relating to charitable contributions and gifts),


(9) The deduction under section 171 (relating to deductions for amortizable bond premiums),


(10) The deduction under section 213 (relating to medical and dental expenses),


(11) The deduction under section 216 (relating to deductions in connection with cooperative housing corporations),


(12) The deduction under section 217 (relating to moving expenses),


(13) The deduction under section 691(c) (relating to the deduction for estate taxes in the case of income in respect of the decedent),


(14) The deduction under 1341 (relating to the computation of tax if a taxpayer restores a substantial amount held under claim of right), and


(15) Any deduction allowable in connection with personal property used in a short sale.


(c) *Allocation of expenses.* If a taxpayer incurs expenses that relate to both a trade or business activity (within the meaning of section 162) and a production of income or tax preparation activity (within the meaning of section 212), the taxpayer shall allocate such expenses between the activities on a reasonable basis.


(d) *Members of Congress*—(1) *In general.* With respect to the deduction for living expenses of Members of Congress referred to in section 162(a), the 2-percent floor described in section 67 and paragraph (a) of this section shall be applied to the deduction before the application of the $3,000 limitation on deductions for living expenses referred to in section 162(a). (For purposes of this paragraph (d), the term “Member(s) of Congress” includes any Delegate or Resident Commissioner.) The amount of miscellaneous itemized deductions of a Member of Congress that is disallowed pursuant to section 67 and paragraph (a) of this section shall be allocated between deductions for living expenses (within the meaning of section 162(a)) and other miscellaneous itemized deductions. The amount of deductions for living expenses of a Member of Congress that is disallowed pursuant to section 67 and paragraph (a) of this section is determined by multiplying the aggregate amount of such living expenses (determined without regard to the $3,000 limitation of section 162(a) but with regard to any other limitations) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate amount disallowed pursuant to section 67 and paragraph (a) of this section with respect to miscellaneous itemized deductions of the Member of Congress and the denominator of which is the amount of miscellaneous itemized deductions (including deductions for living expenses) of the Member of Congress (determined without regard to the $3,000 limitation of section 162(a) but without regard to any other limitations). The amount of deductions for miscellaneous itemized deductions (other than deductions for living expenses) of a Member of Congress that are disallowed pursuant to section 67 and paragraph (a) of this section is determined by multiplying the amount of miscellaneous itemized deductions (other than deductions for living expenses) of the Member of Congress (determined with regard to any limitations) by the fraction described in the preceding sentence.


(2) *Example.* The provisions of this paragraph (d) may be illustrated by the following example:


(e) *State legislators.* See § 1.62-1T(e)(4) with respect to rules regarding state legislator's expenses.
