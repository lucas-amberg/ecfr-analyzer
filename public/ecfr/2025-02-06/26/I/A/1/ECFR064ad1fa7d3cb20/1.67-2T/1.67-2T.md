# § 1.67-2T   Treatment of pass-through entities (temporary).

(a) *Application of section 67.* This section provides rules for the application of section 67 to partners, shareholders, beneficiaries, participants, and others with respect to their interests in pass-through entities (as defined in paragraph (g) of this section). In general, an affected investor (as defined in paragraph (h) of this section) in a pass-through entity shall separately take into account as an item of income and as an item of expense an amount equal to his or her allocable share of the affected expenses (as defined in paragraph (i) of this section) of the pass-through entity for purposes of determining his or her taxable income. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the expenses so taken into account shall be treated as paid or incurred by the affected investor in the same manner as paid or incurred by the pass-through entity. For rules regarding the application of section 67 to affected investors in—


(1) Partnerships, S corporations, and grantor trusts, see paragraph (b) of this section,


(2) Real estate mortgage investment conduits, see paragraph (c) of this section,


(3) Common trust funds, see paragraph (d) of this section,


(4) Nonpublicly offered regulated investment companies, see paragraph (e) of this section, and


(5) Publicly offered regulated investment companies, see paragraph (p) of this section.


(b) *Partnerships, S corporations, and grantor trusts*—(1) *In general.* Pursuant to section 702(a) and 1366(a) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, each partner of a partnership or shareholder of an S corporation shall take into account separately his or her distributive or pro rata share of any items of deduction of such partnership or corporation that are defined as miscellaneous itemized deductions pursuant to section 67(b). The 2-percent limitation described in section 67 does not apply to the partnership or corporation with respect to such deductions, but such deductions shall be included in the deductions of the partner or shareholder to which that limitation applies. Similarly, the limitation applies to the grantor or other person treated as the owner of a grantor trust with respect to items that are paid or incurred by a grantor trust and are treated as miscellaneous itemized deductions of the grantor or other person pursuant to Subpart E, Part 1, Subchapter J, Chapter 1 of the Code, but not to the trust itself. The 2-percent limitation applies to amounts otherwise deductible in taxable years of partners, shareholders, or grantors beginning after December 31, 1986, regardless of the taxable year of the partnership, corporation, or trust.

(2) *Example.* The provisions of this paragraph (d) may be illustrated by the following example:


(e) *Nonpublicly offered regulated investment companies*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of determining the taxable income of an affected investor that is a shareholder of a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company (as defined in paragraph (g)(3) of this section) during a calendar year—


(i) The current earnings and profits of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company shall be computed without taking into account any affected RIC expenses that are allocated among affected investors, and


(ii) The affected investor shall be treated—


(A) As having received or accrued a dividend in an amount equal to the affected investor's allocable share of the affected RIC expenses of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company for the calendar year, and


(B) As having paid or incurred an expense described in section 212 (or section 162 in the case of an affected investor that is a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company) in an amount equal to the affected investor's allocable share of the affected RIC expenses of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company for the calendar year


(2) *Shareholders that are not affected investors.* A shareholder of a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company that is not an affected investor shall not take into account in computing its taxable income any amount of income or expense with respect to its allocable share of affected RIC expenses.

The nonpublicly offered regulated investment company shall make the election by attaching to its income tax return for the taxable year that includes the last day of the first calendar year for which the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company makes the election a statement that it is making an election under paragraph (j)(2) of this section. An election made pursuant to this paragraph (j)(2) shall remain in effect for all subsequent calendar years unless revoked with the consent of the Commissioner.

(See paragraph (m) of this section for rules regarding estimates with respect to the amount of an affected investor's share of affected RIC expenses upon which certain persons can rely for certain purposes.) A nonpublicly offered regulated investment company may use any reasonable method to make the allocation. A method of allocation shall not be reasonable if—


(i) The method can be expected to have the effect, if applied to all affected RIC expenses and all shareholders (whether or not affected investors), of allocating to the shareholders an amount of affected RIC expenses that is less than the affected RIC expenses of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company for the calendar year,


(ii) The method can be expected to have the effect of allocating a disproportionately high share of the affected RIC expenses of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company to shareholders that are not affected investors or affected investors, the amount of whose miscellaneous itemized deductions (including their allocable share of affected RIC expenses) exceeds the 2-percent floor described in section 67, or


(iii) A principal purpose of the method of allocation is to avoid allocating affected RIC expenses to persons described in paragraph (h)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section whose miscellaneous itemized deductions (inclusive of their allocable share of affected RIC expenses) may not exceed the 2-percent floor described in section 67.


(2) *Reasonable allocation method described*—(i) *In general.* The allocation method described in this paragraph (k)(2) shall be treated as a reasonable allocation method. Under the method described in this paragraph, an affected investor's allocable share of the affected RIC expenses of a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company is the amount that bears the same ratio to the amount of affected RIC expenses of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company for the calendar year as—

(iii) *Dividends paid.* For purposes of this paragraph (k)(2)—

(B) The term “dividends paid” does not include capital gain dividends (as defined in section 852(b)(3)(C)), exempt-interest dividends (as defined in section 852(b)(5)(A)), or any amount to which section 302(a) applies.


(C) The dividends paid during a calendar year is determined without regard to section 855(a).


(3) *Reasonable allocation made by District Director.* If a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company does not make a reasonable allocation of affected RIC expenses to its affected investors as required by paragraph (k)(1) of this section, a reasonable allocation shall be made by the District Director of the internal revenue district in which the principal place of business or principal office or agency of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company is located.

(m) *Reliance by nominees and pass-through investors on notices*—(1) *General rule.* Persons described in paragraph (m)(3) of this section may, for the purposes described in that paragraph (m)(3), treat an affected investor's allocable share of the affected RIC expenses of a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company as being equal to an amount determined by the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company on the basis of a reasonable estimate (e.g., of allocable expenses as a percentage of dividend distributions or allocable expenses per share) that is (i) reported in writing by the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company to the person or (ii) reported in a newspaper or financial publication having a nationwide circulation (e.g., the *Wall Street Journal* or *Standard and Poor's Weekly Dividend Record*).


(2) *Estimates must be reasonable.* In general, for purposes of paragraph (m)(1) of this section, estimates of affected RIC expenses of a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company will be treated as reasonable only if the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company makes a reasonable effort to offset material understatements (or overstatements) of affected RIC expenses for a period by increasing (or decreasing) estimates of affected RIC expenses for a subsequent period. Understatements or overstatements of affected RIC expenses that are not material may be corrected by making offsetting adjustments in future periods, provided that understatements and overstatements are treated consistently.


(3) *Application.* Paragraph (m)(1) of this section shall apply to the following persons for the following purposes:


(i) A nominee who, pursuant to section 6042(a)(1)(B) and paragraph (n)(2) of this section, is required to report dividends paid by a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company to the Internal Revenue Service and to the person to whom the payment is made, for purposes of reporting to the Internal Revenue Service and the person to whom the payment is made the amount of affected RIC expenses allocated to such person.
