(b) *Treatment of allocable investment expenses.* [Reserved]


(c) *Computation of proportionate share.* [Reserved]


(d) *Example.* [Reserved]


(e) *Allocable investment expenses not subject to backup withholding.* [Reserved]

(i) If, pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, notice is provided for a calendar quarter, the aggregate amount of expenses paid or accrued during the calendar quarter for which the REMIC is allowed a deduction under section 212;


(ii) If, pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, notice is provided to a regular interest holder for a calendar year, the aggregate amount of expenses paid or accrued during each calendar quarter that the regular interest holder held the regular interest in the calendar year and for which the REMIC is allowed a deduction under section 212; and


(iii) The proportionate share of these expenses allocated to that pass-through interest holder, as determined under § 1.67-3T(c).


(2) *Statement to be furnished*—(i) *To residual interest holder.* For each calendar quarter, a REMIC must provide to each pass-through interest holder who holds a residual interest during the calendar quarter the notice required under paragraph (f)(1) of this section on Schedule Q (Form 1066), as required in § 1.860F-4(e).


(ii) *To regular interest holder.* For each calendar year, a single-class REMIC (as described in § 1.67-3T(a)(2)(ii)(B)) must provide to each pass-through interest holder who held a regular interest during the calendar year the notice required under paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Quarterly reporting is not required. The information required to be included in the notice may be separately stated on the statement described in § 1.6049-7(f) instead of on a separate statement provided in a separate mailing. See § 1.6049-7(f)(4). The separate statement provided in a separate mailing must be furnished to each pass-through interest holder no later than the last day of the month following the close of the calendar year.


(3) *Returns to the Internal Revenue Service*—(i) *With respect to residual interest holders.* Any REMIC required under paragraphs (f)(1) and (2)(i) of this section to furnish information to any pass-through interest holder who holds a residual interest must also furnish such information to the Internal Revenue Service as required in § 1.860F-4(e)(4).


(ii) *With respect to regular interest holders.* A single-class REMIC (as described in § 1.67-3T(a)(2)(ii)(B)) must make an information return on Form 1099 for each calendar year, with respect to each pass-through interest holder who holds a regular interest to which an allocation of allocable investment expenses is required to be made pursuant to § 1.67-3T(a)(1) and (2)(ii). The preceding sentence applies with respect to a holder for a calendar year only if the REMIC is required to make an information return to the Internal Revenue Service with respect to that holder for that year pursuant to section 6049 and § 1.6049-7(b)(2)(i) (or would be required to make an information return but for the $10 threshold described in section 6049(a)(1) and § 1.6049-7(b)(2)(i)). The REMIC must state on the information return—


(A) The sum of—


(*1*) The aggregate amounts includible in gross income as interest (as defined in § 1.6049-7(a)(1)(i) and (ii)), for the calendar year; and


(*2*) The sum of the amount of allocable investment expenses required to be allocated to the pass-through interest holder for each calendar quarter during the calendar year pursuant to § 1.67-3T(a); and


(B) Any other information specified by the form or its instructions.


(4) *Interest held by nominees and other specified persons*—(i) *Pass-through interest holder's interest held by a nominee.* If a pass-through interest holder's interest in a REMIC is held in the name of a nominee, the REMIC may make the information return described in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section with respect to the nominee in lieu of the pass-through interest holder and may provide the written statement described in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section to that nominee in lieu of the pass-through interest holder.


(ii) *Regular interests in a single-class REMIC held by certain persons.* If a person specified in § 1.6049-7(e)(4) holds a regular interest in a single-class REMIC (as described in § 1.67-3T(a)(2)(ii)(B)), then the single-class REMIC must provide the information described in paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section to that person with the information specified in § 1.6049-7(e)(2) as required in § 1.6049-7(e).


(5) *Nominee reporting*—(i) *In general.* In any case in which a REMIC provides information pursuant to paragraph (f)(4) of this section to a nominee of a pass-through interest holder for a calendar quarter or, as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, for a calendar year—


(A) The nominee must furnish each pass-through interest holder with a written statement described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, whichever is applicable, showing the information described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section; and


(B) The nominee must make an information return on Form 1099 for each calendar year, with respect to the pass-through interest holder and state on this information return the information described in paragraphs (f)(3)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section, if—


(*1*) The nominee is a nominee for a pass-through interest holder who holds a regular interest in a single-class REMIC (as described in § 1.67-3T(a)(2)(ii)(B)); and


(*2*) The nominee is required to make an information return pursuant to section 6049 and § 1.6049-7 (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii)(B) (or would be required to make an information return but for the $10 threshold described in section 6049(a)(2) and § 1.6049-7(b)(2)(i)) with respect to the pass-through interest holder.


(ii) *Time for furnishing statement.* The statement required by paragraph (f)(5)(i)(A) of this section to be furnished by a nominee to a pass-through interest holder for a calendar quarter or calendar year must be furnished to this holder no later than 30 days after receiving the written statement described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section from the REMIC. If, however, pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, the information is separately stated on the statement described in § 1.6049-7(f), then the information must be furnished to the pass-through interest holder in the time specified in § 1.6049-7(f)(5).


(6) *Special rules*—(i) *Time and place for furnishing returns.* The returns required by paragraphs (f)(3)(ii) and (f)(5)(i)(B) of this section for any calendar year must be filed at the time and place that a return required under section 6049 and § 1.6049-7(b)(2) is required to be filed. See § 1.6049-4(g) and § 1.6049-7(b)(2)(iv).


(ii) *Duplicative returns not required.* The requirements of paragraphs (f)(3)(ii) and (f)(5)(i)(B) of this section for the making of an information return are satisfied by the timely filing of an information return pursuant to section 6049 and § 1.6049-7(b)(2) that contains the information required by paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section.
