# § 1.67-3T   Allocation of expenses by real estate mortgage investment conduits (temporary).

(a) *Allocation of allocable investment expenses*—(1) *In general.* A real estate mortgage investment conduit or REMIC (as defined in section 860D) shall allocate to each of its pass-through interest holders that holds an interest at any time during the calendar quarter the holder's proportionate share (as determined under paragraph (c) of this section) of the aggregate amount of allocable investment expenses of the REMIC for the calendar quarter.


(2) *Pass-through interest holder*—(i) *In general*—(A) *Meaning of term.* Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the term “pass-through interest holder” means any holder of a REMIC residual interest (as definition in section 860G(a)(2)) that is—

(c) *Computation of proportionate share*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a REMIC shall compute a pass-through interest holder's proportionate share of the REMIC's allocable investment expenses by—


(i) Determining the daily amount of the allocable investment expenses for the calendar quarter by dividing the total amount of such expenses by the number of days in that calendar quarter.


(ii) Allocating the daily amount of the allocable investment expenses to the pass-through interest holder in proportion to its respective holdings on that day, and

(2) *Other holders taken into account.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, a pass-through interest holder's proportionate share of the daily amount of the allocable investment expenses is determined by taking into account all holders of residual interests in the REMIC, whether or not pass-through interest holders.


(3) *Single-class REMIC*—(i) *Daily allocation.* In lieu of the allocation specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, a single-class REMIC (as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) shall allocate the daily amount of the allocable investment expenses to each pass-through interest holder in proportion to the amount of income accruing to the holder with respect to its interest in the REMIC on that day.


(ii) *Other holders taken into account.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the amount of the allocable investment expenses that is allocated on any day to each pass-through interest holder shall be determined by multiplying the daily amount of allocable investment expenses (determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section) by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the amount of income that accrues (but not less than zero) to the pass-through interest holder on that day and the denominator of which is the total amount of income (as determined under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section) that accrues to all regular and residual interest holders, whether or not pass-through interest holders, on that day.


(iii) *Total income accruing.* The total amount of income that accrues to all regular and residual interest holders is the sum of—


(A) The amount includible under section 860B in the gross income (but not less than zero) of the regular interest holders, and


(B) The amount of REMIC taxable income (but not less than zero) taken into account under section 860C by the residual interest holders.


(4) *Dates of purchase and disposition.* For purposes of this section, a pass-through interest holder holds an interest on the date of its purchase but not on the date of its disposition.


(d) *Example.* The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following example:


(e) *Allocable investment expenses not subject to backup withholding.* The amount of allocable investment expenses required to be allocated to a pass-through interest holder pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section is not subject to backup withholding under section 3406.


(f) *Notice to pass-through interest holders*—(1) *Information required.* A REMIC must provide to each pass-through interest holder to which an allocation of allocable investment expense is required to be made under paragraph (a)(1) of this section notice of the following—

(ii) If, pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, notice is provided to a regular interest holder for a calendar year, the aggregate amount of expenses paid or accrued during each calendar quarter that the regular interest holder held the regular interest in the calendar year and for which the REMIC is allowed a deduction under section 212; and


(iii) The proportionate share of these expenses allocated to that pass-through interest holder, as determined under paragraph (c) of this section.


(2) *Statement to be furnished*—(i) *To residual interest holder.* For each calendar quarter, a REMIC shall provide to each pass-through interest holder who holds a residual interest during the calendar quarter the notice required under paragraph (f)(1) of this section on Schedule Q (Form 1066), as required in § 1.860F-4(e).


(ii) *To regular interest holder*—(A) *In general.* For each calendar year, a single-class REMIC (as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) must provide to each pass-through interest holder who held a regular interest during the calendar year the notice required under paragraph (f)(1) of this section.

The preceding sentence applies with respect to a holder for a calendar year only if the REMIC is required to make an information return to the Internal Revenue Service with respect to that holder for that year pursuant to section 6049 and § 1.6049-7(b)(2)(i) (or would be required to make an information return but for the $10 threshold described in section 6049(a)(1) and § 1.6049-7(b)(2)(i)). The REMIC shall state on the information return—


(A) The sum of—

(5) *Nominee reporting*—(i) *In general.* In any case in which a REMIC provides information pursuant to paragraph (f)(4) of this section to a nominee of a pass-through interest holder for a calendar quarter or, as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, for a calendar year—


(A) The nominee shall furnish each pass-through interest holder with a written statement described in paragraph (f)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section, whichever is applicable, showing the information described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and

If, however, pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, the information is separately stated on the statement described in § 1.6049-7(f), then the information must be furnished to the pass-through interest holder in the time specified in § 1.6049-7(f)(5).


(6) *Special rules*—(i) *Time and place for furnishing returns.* The returns required by paragraphs (f)(3)(ii) and (f)(5)(i)(B) of this section for any calendar year shall be filed at the time and place that a return required under section 6049 and § 1.6049-7(b)(2) is required to be filed.
