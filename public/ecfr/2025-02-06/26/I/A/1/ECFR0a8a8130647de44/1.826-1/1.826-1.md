# § 1.826-1   Election by reciprocal underwriters and interinsurers.

(a) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in section 826(c), any mutual insurance company which is an interinsurer or reciprocal underwriter taxable under section 821(a) may elect under section 826(a) to limit its deductions for amounts paid or incurred to its attorney-in-fact to the deductions of its attorney-in-fact which are allocable to income received by the attorney-in-fact from the reciprocal during the taxable year. See § 1.826-4 for rules relating to allocation of expenses. In no case may such an election increase the amount deductible by the reciprocal for amounts paid or due its attorney-in-fact for the taxable year. The election allowed by section 826(a) and this section in effect increases the income of the reciprocal by the net income of the attorney-in-fact attributable to its business with the reciprocal. A reciprocal making the election is allowed a credit for the amount of tax paid by the attorney-in-fact for the taxable year which is attributable to income received by the attorney-in-fact from the reciprocal. See section 826(e) and § 1.826-5.


(b) *Companies eligible to elect under section 826(a).* Any mutual insurance company which is a reciprocal underwriter or interinsurer subject to the tax imposed by section 821(a) may elect (in the manner prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section) to be subject to the limitation provided by section 826(b) and paragraph (a) of this section provided the attorney-in-fact of the electing reciprocal:


(1) Is subject to the taxes imposed by section 11 (b) and (c) and the regulations thereunder;


(2) Consents (in the manner provided by paragraph (a) of § 1.826-3) to provide the information required under paragraph (b) of § 1.826-3 during the period in which the election made under section 826(a) and this section is in effect;


(3) Reports the income received from the reciprocal and the deductions allocable thereto under the same method of accounting used by the reciprocal in reporting its deductions for amounts paid or due its attorney-in-fact; and


(4) Files its income tax return on a calendar year basis.


(c) *Manner of making election.* The election provided by section 826(a) and this section shall be made in a statement attached to the taxpayer's income tax return for the first taxable year for which such election is to apply. The statement shall include the name and address of the taxpayer, shall be signed by the taxpayer (or its duly authorized representative), and shall be filed not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the income tax return (including extensions thereof) for the first taxable year for which such election is to apply. For information required of an electing reciprocal, see paragraph (e) of this section.


(d) *Scope of election.* The election allowed by section 826(a) is binding for the taxable year for which made and all succeeding taxable years unless the Commissioner consents to a revocation of such election. Whether revocation will be permitted will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case.


(e) *Information required of an electing company.* Every reciprocal underwriter or interinsurer making the election provided by section 826(a) and this section shall, in the manner provided by paragraph (f) of this section, furnish the following information for each taxable year during which such election is in effect:


(1) The name and address of the attorney-in-fact with respect to which the election allowed by section 826(a) and this section is in effect; the district in which such attorney-in-fact filed its return for the taxable year; and a copy of the consent required by section 826 and § 1.826-3 and the date and district in which such consent was filed;


(2) The deductible amount paid or due to such attorney-in-fact from the reciprocal computed without regard to the limitation provided by section 826(b);


(3) The total amount claimed as a deduction by the reciprocal for amounts paid to its attorney-in-fact after giving effect to the limitation provided by section 826(b);


(4) The amount of the increase (if any) in underwriting gain (as defined in section 824(a)) attributable to the election allowed by section 826(a);


(5) The amount of the increase (if any) in the deduction allowed by section 824(a) (relating to deduction to provide protection against losses) attributable to the election allowed by section 826(a);


(6) The amount of any increase or decrease in the statutory underwriting income or loss for the taxable year (as computed under section 823) attributable to the election allowed by section 826(a);


(7) The amount of any increase or decrease in the mutual insurance company taxable income or unused loss for the taxable year attributable to the election allowed by section 826(a);


(8) The amount of the increase (if any) in the tax liability of the reciprocal for the taxable year attributable to the election allowed by section 826(a) before taking into account the credit provided by section 826(e);


(9) The amount of tax attributable to income received by the attorney-in-fact from the reciprocal during the taxable year (as determined under § 1.826-5) claimed (under section 826(e) and paragraph (a) of this section) by the reciprocal as a credit for the taxable year; and


(10) The information which the attorney-in-fact is required to submit to the reciprocal under paragraphs (b) and (c) of § 1.826-3.


(f) *Manner in which information is to be provided.* The information required by paragraph (e) of this section shall be set forth in a statement attached to the taxpayer's income tax return for each taxable year for which such information is required. Such statement shall include the name and address of the taxpayer; and shall be filed not later than the date prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the income tax return for the taxable year with respect to which such information is being provided.
