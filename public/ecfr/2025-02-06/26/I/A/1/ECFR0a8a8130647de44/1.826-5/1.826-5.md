# ยง 1.826-5   Attribution of tax.

(a) *In general.* Section 826(e) provides that a reciprocal making the election allowed by section 826(a) shall be credited with so much of the tax paid by the attorney-in-fact as is attributable to the income received by the attorney-in-fact from the reciprocal in such taxable year.


(b) *Computation.* For purposes of section 826(e) and paragraph (a) of this section, the amount of tax attributable to income received by the attorney-in-fact from the reciprocal in the taxable year shall be computed in the following manner:


(1) First, compute the taxable income (if any) from each source of gross income set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of ยง 1.826-3 by deducting from each such amount the expenses allocable thereto under ยง 1.826-4;


(2) Second, compute the normal tax on each amount of taxable income computed in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph at the rate provided by section 11(b) of the Code;


(3) Third, deduct from each amount determined in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph an amount which bears the same proportion to the surtax exemption provided by section 11(c) of the Code as each amount computed under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph bears to the total of the amounts computed under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph;


(4) Fourth, compute the surtax on each remainder computed in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph at the rate provided by section 11(c) of the Code; 


(5) Fifth, add the normal tax computed under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph to the surtax computed under subparagraph (4) of this paragraph for each amount computed under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph;


(6) Sixth, deduct from each amount of tax computed under subparagraph (5) of this paragraph any tax credits (other than those arising from payments made with respect to the tax liability for the taxable year or other taxable years) allocable (in the same manner as provided for expenses under ยง 1.826-4) to such amount;


(7) Seventh, compute that amount which bears the same proportion to the tax actually paid with respect to the taxable year as each individual amount computed under subparagraph (6) of this paragraph bears to the total of the amounts computed under subparagraph (6) of this paragraph. The amount so determined with respect to each amount computed under subparagraph (6) of this paragraph is the tax paid which is attributable to the amount computed under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.


(c) *Taxes of attorney-in-fact unaffected.* Nothing in section 826 or the regulations thereunder shall increase or decrease the taxes imposed on the income of the attorney-in-fact.
