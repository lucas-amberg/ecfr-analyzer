# § 1.545-3   Special adjustment to taxable income.

(a) *In general.* In computing undistributed personal holding company income for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, section 545(c) (1) provides that, except as otherwise provided in section 545(c), there shall be allowed as a deduction amounts used or amounts irrevocably set aside (to the extent reasonable with reference to the size and terms of the indebtedness) during such year to pay or retire qualified indebtedness (as defined in section 545(c)(3) and paragraph (d) of this section). The reasonableness of amounts irrevocably set aside shall be determined under the rules of paragraph (g)(4) of § 1.545-2.


(b) *Amounts used or irrevocably set aside*—(1) *In general.* The deduction is allowable, in any taxable year, only for amounts used or irrevocably set aside in that year to extinguish or discharge qualified indebtedness. If amounts are set aside in 1 year, no deduction is allowable for a later year in which such amounts are actually paid. As long as all other conditions are satisfied, the aggregate amount allowable as a deduction for any taxable year includes all amounts (from whatever source) used and all amounts (from whatever source) irrevocably set aside, irrespective of whether in cash or other medium. The same item shall not be deducted more than once.


(2) *Refunding, etc., of qualified indebtedness.* (i) A refunding, renewal or mere change in the form of a qualified indebtedness which does not involve a substantial change in the economic terms of the indebtedness will not result in an allowable deduction whether or not funds are obtained from such refunding, renewal, or change in form, and whether or not such funds are applied on the prior obligation, and will not constitute a reduction in the amount of such qualified indebtedness. For purposes of this section, if, in connection with a refunding, renewal, or other change in the form of an indebtedness, the rate of interest or principal amount of such debt, or the date when payment is due with respect to such debt or significantly changed, or if, after the refunding, renewal, or other change in the form of such debt, the creditor to whom such debt is owed is neither the creditor to whom such debt was owed before such refunding, renewal, or other change, nor a person standing in a relationship to such creditor described in section 267(b), then a substantial change in the economic terms of such indebtedness will normally have occurred.


(ii) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(c) *Corporations to which applicable.* Section 545(c)(2) describes the corporations to which section 545(c) applies. In order to qualify under section 545(c)(2), the corporation must be one:


(1) Which for at least one of its two most recent taxable years ending before February 26, 1964, was not a personal holding company under section 542, but which would have been a personal holding company under section 542 for such taxable year if the law applicable for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, had been applicable to such taxable year; or


(2) Which is an acquiring corporation treated as a corporation described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph by reason of section 381(c)(15) (relating to the carryover of certain indebtedness in corporate acquisitions), but only to the extent of the qualified indebtedness to which it has succeeded under section 381(c)(15) and the indebtedness referred to in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section incurred to replace qualified indebtedness to which it has succeeded under section 381(c)(15)


(d) *Qualified indebtedness*—(1) *General definition.* Except as provided in subparagraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this paragraph the term *qualified indebtedness* means:


(i) The outstanding indebtedness (as defined in subparagraph (6) of this paragraph) incurred after December 31, 1933, and before January 1, 1964, by the taxpayer (or to which the taxpayer succeeded in a transaction to which section 381(c)(15) applies), and


(ii) The outstanding indebtedness (as defined in subparagraph (6) of this paragraph) incurred after December 31, 1963, by the taxpayer (or to which the taxpayer succeeded in a transaction to which section 381(c)(15) applies) for the purpose of making a payment or set-aside referred to in paragraph (a) of this section in the same taxable year of the debtor in which such indebtedness was incurred. An indebtedness shall be deemed not to have been incurred for the purpose of making a payment or set-aside referred to in paragraph (a) of this section when such indebtedness is a consequence of a refunding, renewal or mere change in the form of a qualified indebtedness which does not involve a substantial change in the economic terms of the qualified indebtedness. (See paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the meaning of *substantial change in the economic terms of the indebtedness.*) In the case of such a payment or set-aside which is made on or after the first day of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, such indebtedness incurred after December 31, 1963, is treated as qualified indebtedness only to the extent that the deduction from taxable income otherwise allowed by section 545(c)(1) with respect to such payment or set-aside is treated as non-deductible by reason of the election referred to in paragraph (e) of this section.


(2) *Exception for indebtedness owed to certain shareholders.* For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, qualified indebtedness does not include any amounts which were, at any time after December 31, 1963, and before the payment or set-aside to which this section applies, owed directly or indirectly to a person who at such time owned more than 10 percent in value of the taxpayer's outstanding stock. The rules of section 318(a) and the regulations thereunder apply for the purpose of determining ownership under this subparagraph. Amounts which cease to be qualified indebtedness by reason of this subparagraph may not subsequently become qualified indebtedness as a result of any change in the facts (for example, a subsequent sale of stock by the person to whom the amounts are directly or indirectly owed).


(3) *Reduction for amounts irrevocably set aside.* For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, qualified indebtedness with respect to a particular contract is reduced when and to the extent that amounts are irrevocably set aside to pay or retire such indebtedness. An amount is not considered to be irrevocably set aside if any person could use such amount for any purpose other than the retirement of the qualified indebtedness with respect to which it was set aside. No deduction is allowed under section 545(c)(1) and this section for payments out of amounts previously set aside. Thus, for example, if a corporation, which is a June 30 fiscal year taxpayer, incurs indebtedness of $1 million on February 1, 1962, and, in accordance with its contract of indebtedness, irrevocably sets aside $50,000 in a sinking fund on February 1, of each of the years 1963, 1964, and 1965, then its qualified indebtedness on January 1, 1964, is $950,000 ($1 million less one set-aside of $50,000 in 1963). The corporation is not allowed a deduction under section 545(c)(1) for the set-aside of $50,000 made during its taxable year ending on June 30, 1964, since section 545(c) is applicable only to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, but the qualified indebtedness is nevertheless reduced by such amount. The corporation is allowed a deduction of $50,000 for its taxable year ending June 30, 1965, as a result of the set-aside made during such taxable year, and qualified indebtedness on July 1, 1965, is $850,000. No deduction is allowed to the corporation for a payment in any subsequent taxable year from the amounts so set aside.


(4) *Reduction on disposition of certain property.* (i) Section 545(c)(6) provides that the total amount of the taxpayer's qualified indebtedness (as determined under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) shall be reduced if property of a character subject to the allowance for exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, amortization, or depletion is disposed of after December 31, 1963. The reduction is made pro rata (in accordance with subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph) for the taxable year of such disposition and is equal in total amount to the excess, if any, of:


(*a*) The adjusted basis of the property disposed of (determined under section 1011 and the regulations thereunder) immediately before such disposition; over


(*b*) The amount of qualified indebtedness which ceased to be qualified indebtedness with respect to the taxpayer by reason of the assumption of indebtedness by the transferee of the property disposed of (whether or not such indebtedness was incurred by the taxpayer in connection with the property disposed of).


(ii) The indebtedness reduced under the rule of this subparagraph is the qualified indebtedness which is outstanding with respect to the taxpayer immediately after the disposition referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.


(iii) The reduction with respect to any particular contract of indebtedness under the rules of this subparagraph shall be determined by multiplying the total reduction (determined under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph) by the ratio which the amount of the qualified indebtedness owed with respect to such contract by the taxpayer on the date referred to in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph bears to the aggregate qualified indebtedness owed by the taxpayer with respect to all contracts on such date.


(5) *Total debt consisting of both qualified and nonqualified indebtedness.* In any case where, with respect to a particular contract of indebtedness, a part of the total indebtedness owed with respect to such contract is qualified indebtedness and the other part is indebtedness which is not qualified indebtedness, then, any amount paid or irrevocably set aside with respect to such contract shall be allocated between both such parts pro rata unless the taxpayer clearly indicates in its return the part of the payment or set-aside which shall be allocated to the qualified indebtedness.


(6) *Outstanding indebtedness.* For purposes of determining qualified indebtedness, the term *indebtedness* has the same meaning that it has under section 545(b)(7) and paragraph (g)(2) of § 1.545-2. Indebtedness ceases to be outstanding when the taxpayer no longer has an obligation absolute and not contingent with respect to the payment of such debt. An indebtedness evidenced by bonds, notes, or other obligations issued by a corporation is ordinarily incurred as of the date such obligations are issued, and the amount of such indebtedness is the amount represented by the face value of the obligations. However, a refunding, renewal, or mere change in the form of an indebtedness which does not involve a substantial change in the economic terms of the indebtedness will not have the effect of changing the date the indebtedness was incurred. (See paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the meaning of *substantial change in the economic terms of the indebtedness.*) For purposes of this section, the outstanding indebtedness of a taxpayer includes a mortgage or other security interest on real estate of which such taxpayer is the legal or equitable owner (even though the taxpayer is not directly liable on the underlying evidence of indebtedness secured by such mortgage or security interest) provided such taxpayer shows to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that under all of the facts and circumstances it bears the burden of discharging such indebtedness. Thus, for example, if X acquires from Y property which is subject to a mortgage (X not assuming the indebtedness underlying such mortgage) and if X actually bears the burden of discharging the indebtedness, then, after the date of acquisition, such underlying indebtedness is outstanding indebtedness with respect to X, and, since Y's obligation to pay is in fact contingent upon X failing to discharge the indebtedness, such indebtedness is not outstanding indebtedness with respect to Y.


(7) *Examples.* The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(e) *Election not to deduct*—(1) *In general.* Section 545(c)(4) provides that a taxpayer may elect to treat as nondeductible amounts otherwise deductible under section 545(c)(1) for the taxable year. The election shall be in the form of a statement of election filed on or before the 15th day of the third month following the close of the taxable year with respect to which the election applies. The election shall be irrevocable after such date.


(2) *Statement of election.* The statement of election referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be attached to the taxpayer's Schedule PH (Form 1120) for the year with respect to which such election applies, if such schedule is filed on or before the date referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. If the taxpayer's Schedule PH (Form 1120) is not filed on or before such date, then the statement of election shall clearly set forth the taxpayer's name, address, and employer identification number, shall be signed by an officer of the taxpayer who is authorized to sign a return of the taxpayer with respect to income, and shall be filed with the district director for the internal revenue district in which the taxpayer's income tax return (for the year with respect to which the election is applicable) would be filed. The following information shall be included in the statement of election:


(i) A statement that the taxpayer wishes to elect in accordance with section 545(c)(4);


(ii) The amounts paid or set aside which are to be treated as nondeductible under section 545(c)(4) and this section;


(iii) All information necessary to identify the qualified indebtedness with respect to which such amounts were paid or set aside;


(iv) The date on which such payments or set-asides were made; and


(v) All information necessary to identify the indebtedness (referred to in section 545(c)(3)(A)(ii) and paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section) incurred for the purpose of making the payments or set-asides which the taxpayer elects to treat as nondeductible, including:


(*a*) The date on which such indebtedness was incurred;


(*b*) The amount of such indebtedness;


(*c*) The person or persons to whom such indebtedness is owed; and


(*d*) A statement that such person or persons do not own more than 10 percent in value of the taxpayer's outstanding stock.


(f) *Limitation on deduction*—(1) *In general.* Section 545(c)(5) provides certain limitations on the deduction otherwise allowed by section 545(c)(1). Such deduction is reduced by the sum of the following amounts:


(i) The amount, if any, by which:


(*a*) The deductions allowed for the taxable year and all preceding taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, for exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, amortization, or depletion (other than such deductions which are disallowed in computing undistributed personal holding company income under the rule of paragraph (h) of § 1.545-2), exceed


(*b*) Any reduction, by reason of section 545(c)(5)(A) and this subdivision (i), of the deductions otherwise allowed by section 545(c)(1) for such preceding years; and


(ii) The amount, if any, by which:


(*a*) The deductions allowed under section 545(b)(5) (relating to long-term capital gain deduction) in computing undistributed personal holding company income for the taxable year and all preceding taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, exceed


(*b*) Any reduction, by reason of section 545(c)(5)(B) and this subdivision (ii), of the deductions otherwise allowed by section 545(c)(1) for such preceding years.


(2) *Allocation of reduction.* If the total reduction required by subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is greater than the amount of the payment or set-aside made in respect of qualified indebtedness in a taxable year, then the portion of the reduction which is attributable to either section 545(c)(5)(A) or section 545(c)(5)(B), as the case may be, is that portion which bears the same ratio to the total reduction as the total reduction available under either section 545(c)(5)(A) or section 545(c)(5)(B), respectively, bears to the total reduction available under both such sections.


(3) *Example.* The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:


(g) *Burden of proof.* The burden of proof rests upon the taxpayer to sustain the deduction claimed under this section. In addition to any information required by this section, the taxpayer must furnish the information required by the return, and such other information as the district director may require in substantiation of the deduction claimed.


(h) *Application of section 381(c)(15).* Under section 381(c)(15), if an acquiring corporation assumes liability for qualified indebtedness in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, then the acquiring corporation is considered to be the distributor or transferor corporation for purposes of section 545(c). Paragraph (c)(2) of this section reflects the application of section 381(c)(15) by including an acquiring corporation within the definition of corporation to which this section applies. Thus, the acquiring corporation is not required to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) or paragraph (d)(1) of this section with respect to such acquired qualified indebtedness to which section 381(c)(15) is applicable. All the other provisions of this section apply in full to the acquiring corporation with respect to such acquired indebtedness.
