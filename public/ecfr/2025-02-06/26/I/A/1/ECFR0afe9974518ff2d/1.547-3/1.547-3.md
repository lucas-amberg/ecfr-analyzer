# § 1.547-3   Claim for credit or refund.

(a) If a deficiency in personal holding company tax is asserted for any taxable year, and the corporation has paid any portion of such asserted deficiency, it is entitled to a credit or refund of such payment to the extent that such payment constitutes an overpayment as the result of a deduction for a deficiency dividend as provided in section 547 and §§ 1.547-1 through 1.547-7. It should be noted that a *determination* under section 547(c) and paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.547-2, of taxpayer's liability for personal holding company tax may take place subsequent to the time the deficiency was paid. To secure credit or refund of such overpayment, the taxpayer must file a claim on Form 843 in addition to the claim for the deduction for deficiency dividends required under section 547(e) and paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.547-2.


(b) No interest shall be allowed on such credit or refund.


(c) Such credit or refund will be allowed as if, on the date of the determination under section 547(c) and paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.547-2, two years remained before the expiration of the period of limitation on the filing of claim for refund for the taxable year to which the overpayment relates.
