# ยง 1.381(c)(17)-1   Deficiency dividend of personal holding company.

(a) *Carryover requirement.* If a determination (as defined in section 547(c)) establishes that a distributor or transferor corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies is liable for personal holding company tax imposed by section 541 (or by a corresponding provision of prior income tax law) for any taxable year ending on or before the date of distribution or transfer, then in computing such tax the deduction described in section 547 shall be allowed pursuant to section 381(c)(17) to such corporation for the amount of deficiency dividends paid by the acquiring corporation with respect to the distributor or transferor corporation. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of section 547 and the regulations thereunder apply with respect to a deficiency dividend deduction allowable pursuant to section 381(c)(17). 


(b) *Deficiency dividends paid by the acquiring corporation with respect to the distributor or transferor corporation.* A deficiency dividend paid by the acquiring corporation with respect to the distributor or transferor corporation is a distribution that would satisfy the definition of a deficiency dividend under section 547(d)(1) if paid by the distributor or transferor corporation to its own shareholders except that it shall be paid by the acquiring corporation to its own shareholders and shall be paid after the date of distribution or transfer and on, or within 90 days after, the date of the determination but before the acquiring corporation files claim under paragraph (c) of this section. 


(c) *Claim for deduction.* A claim for a deduction under this section shall be made by the acquiring corporation on Form 976, and shall be filed within 120 days after the date of the determination. The form shall contain, or be accompanied by, the information required under paragraph (b)(2) of ยง 1.547-2 in sufficient detail to properly identify the facts with the distributor or transferor corporation and the acquiring corporation. The statement required with respect to the shareholders on the date of payment of the deficiency dividend shall relate to the shareholders of the acquiring corporation, and the required certified copy of the resolution authorizing the payment of the dividend shall be that of the board of directors, or other authority, of the acquiring corporation. Necessary changes may be made in Form 976 in order to carry out the provisions of this paragraph. The claim shall be filed with the district director for the internal revenue district in which the return of the distributor or transferor corporation to which such claim relates was filed. 


(d) *Effect on dividends paid deduction.* A deficiency dividend paid by the acquiring corporation, which is allowable as a deduction to a distributor or transferor corporation pursuant to section 381(c)(17), shall not become a part of the dividends paid deduction of the acquiring corporation under section 561 for any taxable year. 


(e) *Successive transactions to which section 381(a) applies.* The provisions of this section shall apply in the case of successive transactions to which section 381(a) applies. Thus, if X Corporation transfers its assets to Y Corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies and if Y Corporation transfers its assets to Z Corporation in a subsequent transaction to which section 381(a) applies, then, subject to the provisions of this section, X Corporation may take a deficiency dividend deduction for the amount of deficiency dividends paid by Z Corporation with respect to X Corporation. 


(f) *Example.* The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following example:
