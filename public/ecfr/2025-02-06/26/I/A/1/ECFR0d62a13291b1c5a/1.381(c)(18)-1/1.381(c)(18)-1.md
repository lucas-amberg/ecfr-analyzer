# ยง 1.381(c)(18)-1   Depletion on extraction of ores or minerals from the waste or residue of prior mining.

(a) *Carryover requirement.* Section 381(c)(18) provides that the acquiring corporation in a transaction described in section 381(a) shall be considered as though it were the distributor or transferor corporation after the date of distribution or transfer for the purpose of determining the applicability of section 613(c)(3) (relating to extraction of ores or minerals from the ground). Thus, an acquiring corporation which has acquired the waste or residue of prior mining from a distributor or transferor corporation in a transaction described in section 381(a) shall be entitled, after the date of distribution or transfer, to an allowance for depletion under section 611 in respect of ores or minerals extracted from such waste or residue if the distributor or transferor corporation would have been entitled to such an allowance for depletion in the absence of the distribution or transfer. See paragraph (f) of ยง 1.613-4 to determine whether a distributor or transferor corporation is entitled to an allowance for depletion with respect to the waste or residue of prior mining. 


(b) *Application of section 614 to waste or residue of prior mining.* If, in a transaction described in section 381(a), the acquiring corporation acquires waste or residue of prior mining from a distributor or transferor corporation, then the acquiring corporation shall be considered as though it were the distributor or transferor corporation for the purpose of applying section 614 and the regulations thereunder to the waste or residue so acquired. Thus, if the distributor or transferor corporation was required under paragraph (c) of ยง 1.614-1 to treat the waste or residue as part of the mineral deposit from which it was extracted and if the acquiring corporation acquires both the waste or residue and the mineral deposit from which it was extracted in a transaction described in section 381(a), then such waste or residue shall be treated as a part of such mineral deposit in the hands of the acquiring corporation. On the other hand, if the waste or residue was required to be treated as a separate mineral deposit in the hands of the distributor or transferor corporation, such waste or residue shall be treated as a separate mineral deposit in the hands of the acquiring corporation.
