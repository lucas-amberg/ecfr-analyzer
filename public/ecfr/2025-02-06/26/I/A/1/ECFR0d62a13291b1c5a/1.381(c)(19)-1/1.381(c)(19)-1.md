# § 1.381(c)(19)-1   Charitable contribution carryovers in certain acquisitions.

(a) *Carryover requirement.* Section 381(c)(19) provides that, in computing taxable income for its taxable years which begin after the date of distribution or transfer to which section 381(a) applies, the acquiring corporation shall take into account any charitable contributions made by a distributor or transferor corporation during the taxable year ending on the date of distribution or transfer, and in certain immediately preceding taxable years, which are in excess of the maximum amount deductible for those taxable years under section 170(b)(2) in the following manner: 


(1) If the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending on the date of distribution or transfer begins before January 1, 1962, the acquiring corporation shall, in computing taxable income for its first 2 taxable years which begin after the date of such distribution or transfer, take into account the excess contributions made by the distributor or transferor corporation in the taxable year ending on the date of distribution or transfer and in the immediately preceding taxable year; 


(2) If the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending on the date of distribution or transfer begins after December 31, 1961, the acquiring corporation shall, in computing taxable income for certain taxable years which begin after the date of distribution or transfer, take into account the excess contributions made by the distributor or transferor corporation in the taxable year ending on such date of distribution or transfer and in any of the four taxable years immediately preceding such taxable year but excluding any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1962 (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending on the date of distribution or transfer begins after December 31, 1961, and before January 1, 1963, the acquiring corporation shall, in computing taxable income for its first taxable year which begins after the date of distribution or transfer, also take into account the excess contributions made by the distributor or transferor corporation in the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending on the date of distribution or transfer (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section). 


(b) *Manner of computing excess charitable contribution carryovers.* (1) The amount of any charitable contribution made by a distributor or transferor corporation in any taxable year ending on or before the date of distribution or transfer, or made by the acquiring corporation in any taxable year before its taxable year beginning after the date of distribution or transfer, in excess of the amount allowable as a deduction to such corporation for such taxable year under section 170(b)(2) shall be determined by taking into account the taxable income of, and the contributions made by, that corporation only. 


(2) An acquiring corporation which, in a distribution or transfer to which section 381(a) applies, acquires the assets of a distributor or transferor corporation which previously acquired the assets of another corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, shall succeed to and take into account, subject to the conditions and limitations of sections 170 and 381, the charitable contribution carryovers available to the first acquiring corporation under sections 170 and 381, including those derived by such first acquiring corporation from its distributor or transferor corporation. 


(3) The excess charitable contributions made by a distributor or transferor corporation in its taxable year ending on the date of distribution or transfer and in certain immediately preceding taxable years (see paragraph (c) of this section) which are not deductible by the distributor or transferor corporation because of the 5-percent limitation of section 170(b)(2) shall be available to the acquiring corporation without diminution by reason of the fact that the acquiring corporation does not acquire 100 percent of the assets of the distributor or transferor corporation. Thus, if a parent corporation owning 80 percent of all classes of stock of its subsidiary corporation were to acquire its share of the assets of the subsidiary corporation upon a complete liquidation described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of § 1.381(a)-1, then, subject to the conditions and limitations of this section, 100 percent of the excess contributions made by the subsidiary corporation would be available to the acquiring corporation. 


(c) *Taxable years to which carryovers apply and amount deductible*—(1) *Taxable years beginning before January 1, 1962.* If the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending on the date of distribution or transfer begins before January 1, 1962: 


(i) The excess charitable contributions made by a distributor or transferor corporation in its taxable year immediately preceding that ending on the date of distribution or transfer, to the extent not deductible by it because of the limitations of section 170(b)(2) in its taxable year ending on that date, shall be deductible by the acquiring corporation to the extent prescribed by section 170(b)(2) in its first taxable year beginning after the date of distribution or transfer. Any portion of such excess which is not deductible under this section by the acquiring corporation in such first taxable year shall not be deducted by that corporation in any other taxable year. 


(ii) The excess charitable contributions made by a distributor or transferor corporation in its taxable year ending on the date of distribution or transfer shall first be deductible by the acquiring corporation to the extent prescribed by section 170(b)(2) and this section in its first taxable year beginning after that date and then, to the extent prescribed by section 170(b)(2) and this section, in its second taxable year beginning after that date. Any portion of such excess which is not deductible under this section by the acquiring corporation in such first and second taxable years shall not be deducted by that corporation in any other taxable year. 


(2) *Taxable years beginning in 1962.* If the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending on the date of distribution or transfer begins after December 31, 1961, and before January 1, 1963: 


(i) The excess charitable contributions made by a distributor or transferor corporation in its taxable year immediately preceding that ending on the date of distribution or transfer, to the extent not deductible by it because of the limitations of section 170(b)(2) in its taxable year ending on that date, shall be deductible by the acquiring corporation to the extent prescribed by section 170(b)(2) in its first taxable year beginning after the date of distribution or transfer. Any portion of such excess which is not deductible under this section by the acquiring corporation in such first year shall not be deducted by that corporation in any other taxable year. 


(ii) The excess charitable contributions made by a distributor or transferor corporation in its taxable year ending on the date of distribution or transfer and beginning after December 31, 1961, and before January 1, 1963, shall first be deductible by the acquiring corporation to the extent prescribed by section 170(b)(2) and this section in its first taxable year beginning after that date and then, to the extent prescribed by section 170(b)(2) and this section, in its second, third, fourth, and fifth taxable year, in order of time, beginning after that date. Any portion of such excess which is not deductible under this section by the acquiring corporation in such 5 taxable years shall not be deducted by that corporation in any other taxable year. 


(3) *Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962.* (i) If the taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation ending on the date of distribution or transfer begins after December 31, 1962, the excess charitable contributions made by a distributor or transferor corporation in its taxable year ending on the date of distribution or transfer and in each of its four immediately preceding taxable years (excluding any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1962), to the extent not deductible by it because of the limitations of section 170(b)(2) in its taxable year ending on the date of distribution or transfer or its prior taxable years, shall be deductible by the acquiring corporation to the extent prescribed by section 170(b)(2) (or, if applicable, section 170(d)(2)) and subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, in its taxable years which begin after the date of distribution or transfer. However, any portion of the excess charitable contributions made by a distributor or transferor corporation in a particular taxable year, to which this subparagraph is applicable, which is not deductible under this section within the 5 taxable years immediately following the taxable year in which the contribution was paid by the distributor or transferor corporation shall not be deductible by the acquiring corporation in any other taxable year. 


(ii) For purposes of determining the 5 taxable years in which the excess contributions may be deducted, all taxable years of the distributor or transferor corporation subsequent to the taxable year in which the excess contribution was made, including the taxable year ending on the date of distribution or transfer shall be treated as taxable years of the acquiring corporation. 


(iii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example: 


(4) *General rules.* No excess charitable contributions made by a distributor or transferor corporation shall be deductible by the acquiring corporation in its taxable year which includes the date of distribution or transfer. In addition, an excess charitable contribution made by a distributor or transferor corporation in a taxable year prior to the taxable year of the transfer is only deductible by the distributor or transferor corporation, subject to the limitations of section 170(b)(2) (or, if applicable, section 170(d)(2)), in its subsequent taxable years which begin on or before the date of distribution or transfer, and by the acquiring corporation in its taxable year or years beginning after the date of distribution or transfer. 


(d) *Rules governing amounts deductible by acquiring corporations.* (1) In applying the provisions of section 170(b)(2) (or, if applicable, section 170(d)(2)) for the purpose of determining the amount of excess charitable contributions which are deductible by the acquiring corporation in its taxable years beginning after the date of distribution or transfer, all taxable years of the distributor or transferor and acquiring corporations which, with respect to a particular taxable year beginning after the date of distribution or transfer, constitute the same numbered preceding taxable year shall together be considered as a 1 taxable year even though the taxable years involved may not end on the same date. Thus, for example, all taxable years of the distributor or transferor and acquiring corporations which, with respect to the first taxable year of the acquiring corporation beginning after the date of distribution or transfer, constitutes the second preceding taxable year shall together be considered as 1 taxable year even though the taxable years involved may not end on the same date. Any excess charitable contributions carried over from preceding taxable years which are considered as 1 taxable year shall be taken into account by the acquiring corporation as one amount, without regard to the extent to which the contributions were made by a distributor or transferor corporation or the acquiring corporation. 


(2) For purposes of this paragraph, each taxable year of the distributor or transferor corporation beginning on or before the date of distribution or transfer shall be treated as a preceding taxable year with reference to the acquiring corporation's taxable years beginning after such date. For example, the taxable year of a distributor or transferor corporation which ends on the date of distribution or transfer shall be considered a first preceding taxable year with reference to the acquiring corporation's first taxable year beginning after that date, a second preceding taxable year with reference to the acquiring corporation's second taxable year beginning after that date, and so forth with respect to succeeding taxable years of the acquiring corporation. Also, for example, the taxable year of a distributor or transferor corporation which immediately precedes its taxable year ending on the date of distribution or transfer shall be considered a second preceding taxable year with reference to the acquiring corporation's first taxable year beginning after that date.
