# § 1.381(c)(9)-1   Amortization of bond discount or premium.

(a) *Carryover requirement.* If, in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, the acquiring corporation assumes liability for the payment of bonds of a distributor or transferor corporation which were issued at a discount or premium, then under the provisions of section 381(c)(9) the acquiring corporation is to be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation after the date of distribution or transfer for purposes of determining the amount of amortization allowable, or includible, with respect to such discount or premium in computing taxable income. Thus, if subsequent to February 28, 1913, a distributor or transferor corporation issues bonds at a premium and the liability for them is assumed by the acquiring corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, then the net amount of the premium is income which should be prorated or amortized over the life of the bonds, including the period during which the acquiring corporation is liable upon the obligations assumed. On the other hand, if a distributor or transferor corporation issues bonds at a discount and the liability for them is assumed by the acquiring corporation in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, then the net amount of the discount is deductible in computing taxable income but should be prorated or amortized over the life of the bonds, including the period during which the acquiring corporation is liable upon the obligations assumed. 


(b) *Expense incurred upon issuance of bonds.* If, in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, the acquiring corporation assumes liability for bonds of a distributor or transferor corporation which were issued at a discount or premium, the acquiring corporation shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation after the date of distribution or transfer with respect to the expense incurred upon the issuance of such bonds. 


(c) *Purchase of bonds.* If, in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, the acquiring corporation assumes liability for bonds of a distributor or transferor corporation which were issued at a discount or premium and if the acquiring corporation subsequently purchases such bonds, then the acquiring corporation shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation for the purpose of determining the amount of any income or deduction resulting from the purchase. See paragraph (c) of § 1.61-12. For rules relating to the exchange or substitution of bonds issued by the acquiring corporation for bonds of a distributor or transferor corporation, see paragraph (d) of this section. 


(d) *Exchange of new for old bonds.* Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if— 


(1) In a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, bonds of the acquiring corporation are exchanged or substituted for bonds of a distributor or transferor corporation which were issued at a discount or premium, or 


(2) Bonds of the acquiring corporation are exchanged or substituted for bonds of a distributor or transferor corporation which were issued at a discount or premium and in respect of which the acquiring corporation has assumed the liability in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies, 


(e) *Bonds of a distributor or transferor corporation.* For purposes of applying section 381(c)(9), the term *bonds of a distributor or transferor corporation* includes not only bonds issued by the distributor or transferor corporation but also bonds for which the distributor or transferor corporation has assumed liability. Thus, if the distributor or transferor corporation has assumed liability for bonds in a transaction in which any unamortized discount or premium attributable to such bonds carried over to such corporation, then the acquiring corporation assuming liability for the bonds shall be treated as the distributor or transferor corporation after the date of distribution or transfer for purposes of determining the amount of amortization allowable, or includible, with respect to such discount or premium. On the other hand, if the distributor or transferor corporation has assumed liability for bonds in a transaction in which any unamortized discount or premium attributable to such bonds did not carry over to such corporation, then there can be no carryover to the acquiring corporation under this section.
