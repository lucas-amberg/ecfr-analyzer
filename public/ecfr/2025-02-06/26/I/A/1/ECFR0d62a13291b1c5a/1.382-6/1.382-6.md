# § 1.382-6   Allocation of income and loss to periods before and after the change date for purposes of section 382.

(a) *General rule*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, a loss corporation must allocate its net operating loss or taxable income (see section 382(k)(4)), and its net capital loss (see section 1222(10)) or modified capital gain net income (as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section), for the change year between the pre-change period and the post-change period by ratably allocating an equal portion to each day in the year. 


(2) *Allocation of business interest expense*—(i) *Scope.* Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, this paragraph (a)(2) applies if a loss corporation has business interest expense (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(3)) in the change year. The rules of this paragraph (a)(2) apply to determine the amount of current-year business interest expense (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(9)) that is deducted in the change year. These rules also apply to determine the amount of any current-year business interest expense that is characterized as disallowed business interest expense (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(10)) allocable to the pre-change period and the post-change period, and to allocate disallowed business interest expense carryforwards (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(11)) to the change year for deduction in the pre-change period and the post-change period.


(ii) *Deductibility of business interest expense.* The rules of this paragraph (a)(2)(ii) apply in the following order.


(A) First, the loss corporation calculates its section 163(j) limitation (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(36)) for the change year.


(B) Second, the loss corporation calculates its deductible current-year BIE and deducts this amount in determining its taxable income or net operating loss for the change year. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(2)(ii), the term *deductible current-year BIE* means the loss corporation's current-year business interest expense (including its floor plan financing interest expense, as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(19)), to the extent of its section 163(j) limitation.


(C) Third, if the loss corporation has disallowed business interest expense paid or accrued (without regard to section 163(j)) in the change year that is carried forward to post-change years, it allocates an equal portion of that disallowed business interest expense to each day in the change year. Any amount of disallowed business interest expense that is allocated to the pre-change period pursuant to this paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(C) is carried forward subject to section 382(d)(3). Any amount of disallowed business interest expense that is allocated to the post-change period pursuant to this paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(C) is carried forward and is not subject to section 382(d)(3).


(D) Fourth, if the loss corporation has excess section 163(j) limitation, then the loss corporation calculates its deductible disallowed business interest expense carryforward and allocates an equal portion to each day in the change year. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(2)(ii), the term *excess section 163(j) limitation* means the excess, if any, of the loss corporation's section 163(j) limitation over its deductible current-year BIE, and the term *deductible disallowed business interest expense carryforward* means the loss corporation's disallowed business interest expense carryforward to the extent of its excess section 163(j) limitation.


(E) Fifth, the loss corporation deducts its deductible disallowed business interest expense carryforward that was allocated to the pre-change period under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(D) of this section. Subject to the application of sections 382(b)(3)(B) and 382(d)(3), the loss corporation deducts its deductible disallowed business interest expense carryforward that was allocated to the post-change period under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(D) of this section. Any amount of disallowed business interest expense carryforward that is not deducted pursuant to this paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(E) is carried forward subject to section 382(d)(3).


(b) *Closing-of-the-books election*—(1) *In general.* Subject to paragraphs (b)(3)(ii), (b)(4), and (d) of this section, a loss corporation may elect to allocate its net operating loss or taxable income and its net capital loss or modified capital gain net income for the change year between the pre-change period and the post-change period as if the loss corporation's books were closed on the change date. An election under this paragraph (b)(1) does not terminate the loss corporation's taxable year as of the change date (e.g., the change year is a single tax year for purposes of section 172). 


(2) *Making the closing-of-the-books election*—(i) *Time and manner.* A loss corporation makes the closing-of-the-books election by including the following statement on the information statement required by § 1.382-11(a) for the change year: “THE CLOSING-OF-THE-BOOKS ELECTION UNDER § 1.382-6(b) IS HEREBY MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE OWNERSHIP CHANGE OCCURRING ON [INSERT DATE].” The election must be made on or before the due date (including extensions) of the loss corporation's income tax return for the change year. 


(ii) *Election irrevocable.* An election under this paragraph (b) is irrevocable. 


(3) *Special rules relating to consolidated and controlled groups*—(i) *Consolidated groups.* If an election under this paragraph (b) is made with respect to an ownership change occurring in a consolidated return year, all allocations under this section with respect to that ownership change must be consistent with the election. 


(ii) *Controlled groups.* If paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section does not apply, and if, as part of the same plan or arrangement, two or more members of a controlled group (as defined in section 1563(a), determined by substituting “50 percent” for “80 percent” each place that it appears, and without regard to section 1563(a)(4)), have ownership changes and continue to be members of the controlled group (or become members of the same other controlled group), a closing-of-the-books election applies only if the election is made by all members having the ownership changes. 


(4) *Allocation of business interest expense*—(i) *Scope.* This paragraph (b)(4) applies if a loss corporation makes a closing-of-the-books election pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section and has business interest expense in the change year. The rules of this paragraph (b)(4) apply to determine the amount of deductible current-year business interest expense that is allocable to the pre-change period and the post-change period for purposes of the allocations referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. These rules also apply to determine the amount of any current-year business interest expense that is characterized as disallowed business interest expense allocable to the pre-change period and the post-change period, and to allocate disallowed business interest expense carryforwards to the change year between the pre-change period and the post-change period for deduction.


(ii) *Deductibility of business interest expense.* The rules of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii) apply in the order provided.


(A) The loss corporation calculates its ATI limit, which is the product of its ATI (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(1)) for the change year and 30 percent. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii), the terms *pre-change ATI limit* and *post-change ATI limit* mean the amount of ATI limit allocated to the pre-change period or the post-change period, respectively, computed by allocating an equal portion of the ATI limit to each day in the change year.


(B) Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the loss corporation allocates its current-year business interest expense (including its floor plan financing interest expense) and its business interest income (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(4)) to the pre-change and post-change periods as if the loss corporation's books were closed on the change date. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii), the terms *pre-change BIE* and *post-change BIE* mean the amount of the loss corporation's current-year business interest expense that is allocated to the pre-change period or the post-change period, respectively, under this paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B).


(C) The loss corporation deducts its pre-change BIE to the extent of its pre-change section 163(j) limit, and the loss corporation deducts its post-change BIE to the extent of its post-change section 163(j) limit. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii), the term *pre-change section 163(j) limit* means the sum of the pre-change ATI and the amount of business interest income and floor plan financing interest expense allocated to the pre-change period; the term *post-change section 163(j) limit* means the sum of the post-change ATI limit and the amount of business interest income and floor plan financing interest expense allocated to the post-change period.


(D) If any pre-change BIE or post-change BIE has not been deducted under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, the loss corporation deducts either any pre-change BIE that has not been deducted to the extent of its surplus post-change section 163(j) limit or any post-change BIE that has not been deducted to the extent of its surplus pre-change section 163(j) limit. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii), the term *surplus pre-change section 163(j) limit* means the amount by which the pre-change section 163(j) limit exceeds the amount of pre-change BIE deducted pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section; the term *surplus post-change section 163(j) limit* means the amount by which the post-change section 163(j) limit exceeds the amount of post-change BIE deducted pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section.


(E) If the loss corporation has any excess pre-change section 163(j) limit or excess post-change section 163(j) limit, the loss corporation allocates its disallowed business interest expense carryforward, if any, ratably between the pre-change and post-change periods based upon the relative amounts of excess pre-change section 163(j) limit and excess post-change section 163(j) limit. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii), the term *excess pre-change section 163(j) limit* means the amount by which the surplus pre-change section 163(j) limit exceeds the amount of post-change BIE deducted pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(D) of this section; the term *excess post-change section 163(j) limit* means the amount by which the surplus post-change section 163(j) limit exceeds the amount of pre-change BIE deducted pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(D) of this section.


(F) The loss corporation deducts its disallowed business interest expense carryforward that was allocated to the pre-change period under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(E) of this section to the extent of its excess pre-change section 163(j) limit. Subject to the application of sections 382(b)(3)(B) and 382(d)(3), the loss corporation deducts its disallowed business interest expense carryforward that was allocated to the post-change period under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(E) of this section to the extent of its excess post-change section 163(j) limit. Any amount of disallowed business interest expense carryforward that is not deducted pursuant to this paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(F) is subject to section 382(d)(3) irrespective of the period to which it was allocated pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(E) of this section.


(iii) *Example 1*—(A) *Facts.* X is a calendar-year domestic C corporation that is not a member of a consolidated group. As of January 1, 2021, X has no disallowed business interest expense carryforwards. On October 19, 2021, X experiences an ownership change under section 382(g). For calendar year 2021, X's ATI is $500. For the period beginning on January 1, 2021 and ending on October 19, 2021, X pays or accrues $250 of current-year business interest expense that is deductible but for the potential application of section 163(j), including $50 of floor plan financing interest expense, and X has $60 of business interest income. For the period beginning on October 20, 2021 and ending on December 31, 2021, X pays or accrues $100 of current-year business interest expense that is deductible but for the potential application of section 163(j), including $40 of floor plan financing interest expense, and X has $70 of business interest income. X makes a closing-of-the-books election pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.


(B) *Analysis*—(*1*) *Calculation and allocation of ATI limit.* For purposes of allocating its net operating loss or taxable income for the change year between the pre-change period and the post-change period under § 1.382-6, X applies paragraph (b)(4) of this section to allocate items related to section 163(j). X's ATI for calendar year 2021 is $500x. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, X's ATI limit is $150 ($500 × 30 percent). Additionally, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, X's pre-change ATI limit is $120 ($150 × (292 days/365 days)), and X's post-change ATI limit is $30 ($150 × (73 days/365 days)).


(*2*) *Determination of pre-change BIE and post-change BIE.* Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, X's pre-change BIE and post-change BIE are $250 and $100, respectively.


(*3*) *Determination of pre-change section 163(j) limit and post-change section 163(j) limit.* Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, X's pre-change section 163(j) limit is $230 ($120 (X's pre-change ATI limit) + $60 (X's business interest income allocated to the pre-change period) + $50 (X's floor plan financing interest expense allocated to the pre-change period)). Additionally, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, X's post-change section 163(j) limit is $140 ($30 (X's post-change ATI limit) + $70 (X's business interest income allocated to the post-change period) + $40 (X's floor plan financing interest expense allocated to the post-change period)).


(*4*) *Initial deduction of BIE.* Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, X deducts $230 (its pre-change section 163(j) limit) of its $250 pre-change BIE and all $100 (less than its $140 post-change section 163(j) limit) of its post-change BIE.


(*5*) *Deduction of BIE due to surplus post-change section 163(j) limit.* After applying paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, X has $20 of pre-change BIE that has not been deducted ($250−$230) and a surplus post-change section 163(j) limit of $40 ($140−$100). As a result, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(D) of this section, X deducts its remaining $20 of pre-change BIE. (If, after applying paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, X instead had $20 of post-change BIE that had not yet been deducted and a $40 surplus pre-change section 163(j) limit, then X would deduct its remaining $20 of post-change BIE pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(D) of this section.)


(iv) *Example 2*—*Potential deduction of disallowed business interest expense carryforwards.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, except that, as of January 1, 2021, X has $90 of disallowed business interest expense carryforwards and $150 (rather than $250) of pre-change BIE. X's pre-change section 163(j) limit and post-change section 163(j) limit are the same as in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B)(*3*) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, X deducts all $150 of its pre-change BIE and all $100 of its post-change BIE. X has no remaining pre-change BIE or post-change BIE to deduct under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(D) of this section. Paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(E) of this section applies because X has $80 of excess pre-change section 163(j) limit ($230−$150) and $40 of excess post-change section 163(j) limit ($140−$100). Under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(E) of this section, X allocates $60 of its disallowed business interest expense carryforwards to the pre-change period ($90 × ($80/($80 + $40))) and $30 of its disallowed business interest expense carryforwards to the post-change period ($90 × ($40/($80 + $40))). As provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(F) of this section, X deducts all $60 of its disallowed business interest expense carryforwards that are allocated to the pre-change period; subject to the application of section 382, X deducts all $30 of its disallowed business interest expense carryforwards that are allocated to the post-change period.


(c) *Operating rules for determining net operating loss, taxable income, net capital loss, modified capital gain net income, and special allocations.* For purposes of this section, for the change year—


(1) *In general*—(i) Net operating loss or taxable income is determined without regard to gains or losses on the sale or exchange of capital assets; and 


(ii) Net operating loss or taxable income and net capital loss or modified capital gain net income are determined without regard to the section 382 limitation and do not include the following items, which are allocated entirely to the post-change period—


(A) Any income, gain, loss, or deduction to which section 382(h)(5)(A) applies; and 


(B) Any income or gain recognized on the disposition of assets transferred to the loss corporation during the post-change period for a principal purpose of ameliorating the section 382 limitation. 


(2) *Adjustment to net operating loss*—(i) *Determination of remaining capital gain.* The amount of modified capital gain net income (defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) allocated to each period is offset by capital losses to which section 382(h)(5)(A) applies and capital loss carryovers, subject to the section 382 limitation (in the case of modified capital gain net income allocated to the post-change period). 


(ii) *Reduction of net operating loss by remaining capital gain.* The amount of net operating loss allocated to each period is reduced (but not below zero) without regard to the section 382 limitation, first by the modified capital gain net income remaining in the same period, and then by the modified capital gain net income remaining in the other period. 


(d) *Coordination with rules relating to the allocation of income under § 1.1502-76(b).* If § 1.1502-76 applies (relating to the taxable year of members of a consolidated group), an allocation of items under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section is determined after applying § 1.1502-76. Thus, if a short taxable year under § 1.1502-76 is a change year for which an allocation under this section is to be made, the allocation under this section applies only to the items allocated to that short taxable year under § 1.1502-76. 


(e) *Allocation of certain credits.* The principles of this section apply for purposes of allocating, under section 383, excess foreign taxes under section 904(c), current year business credits under section 38, and the minimum tax credit under section 53. The loss corporation must use the same method of allocation (ratable allocation or closing-of-the-books) for purposes of sections 382 and 383. 


(f) *Examples.* The rules of this section are illustrated by the following examples: 


(g) *Definitions and nomenclature.* The terms and nomenclature used in this section and not otherwise defined herein have the same meanings as in sections 382 and 383 and the regulations thereunder. For purposes of this section: 


(1) *Change year.* A loss corporation's taxable year that includes the change date is its *change year.*

(2) *Pre-change period.* The *pre-change period* is the portion of the change year ending on the close of the change date. 


(3) *Post-change period.* The *post-change period* is the portion of the change year beginning with the day after the change date. 


(4) *Modified capital gain net income.* A loss corporation's *modified capital gain net income* is the excess of the gains from sales or exchanges of capital assets over the losses from such sales or exchanges for the change year, determined by excluding any short-term capital losses under section 1212. 


(h) *Applicability date*—(1) *In general.* This section applies to ownership changes occurring on or after June 22, 1994.


(2) *Ownership changes.* Paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) and (4) of this section apply with respect to an ownership change occurring during a taxable year beginning on or after November 13, 2020. For ownership changes occurring during a taxable year beginning before November 13, 2020, see § 1.382-6 as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2019. However, taxpayers and their related parties, within the meaning of sections 267(b) and 707(b)(1), may choose to apply the rules of this section to testing dates occurring during a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, so long as the taxpayers and their related parties consistently apply the rules of this section, the section 163(j) regulations (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(37)), §§ 1.382-1, 1.382-2, 1.382-5, 1.383-0, and 1.383-1, and, if applicable, §§ 1.263A-9, 1.263A-15, 1.381(c)(20)-1, 1.469-9, 1.469-11, 1.704-1, 1.882-5, 1.1362-3, 1.1368-1, 1.1377-1, 1.1502-13, 1.1502-21, 1.1502-36, 1.1502-79, 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-99 (to the extent they effectuate the rules of §§ 1.382-2, 1.382-5, 1.382-6, 1.382-7, and 1.383-1), and 1.1504-4, to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.
