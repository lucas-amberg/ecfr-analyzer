# § 1.382-8   Controlled groups.

(a) *Introduction.* This section provides rules to adjust the value of a loss corporation that is a member of a controlled group of corporations on a change date so that the same value is not included more than once in computing the limitations under section 382 for the loss corporations that are members of the controlled group. In general, the adjustment is made under paragraph (c) of this section by reducing the value of the loss corporation by the value of the stock of each component member of the controlled group that the loss corporation owns immediately after the ownership change. The loss corporation's value may, however, be increased under paragraph (c) of this section by any amount of value that the other member elects to restore to the loss corporation. 


(b)(1) *Controlled group loss and controlled group with respect to a controlled group loss*—(1) *In general.* A controlled group loss is a pre-change loss (or a net unrealized built-in loss) of a loss corporation that is attributable to a taxable year of the corporation with respect to which the corporation is a component member of a controlled group (as defined by paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section). The controlled group with respect to each controlled group loss is composed of the loss corporation and each other corporation that is a component member of a controlled group that includes the loss corporation both— 


(1)(i) With respect to the taxable year to which the controlled group loss is attributable; and 


(1)(ii) On the date the loss corporation has an ownership change. 


(2) *Presumption regarding net unrealized built-in loss.* For purposes of determining whether a net unrealized built-in loss of a loss corporation is attributable to a taxable year (the determination year) with respect to which the corporation is a component member of a controlled group, the built-in loss in a prior change date asset is deemed to be attributable to a period ending before the determination year. A prior change date asset is any asset held by the loss corporation at all times during the period beginning on the change date of its most recent ownership change after 1986 (the first change date), and ending on the first day of the determination year. The built-in loss in a prior change date asset is the amount by which the adjusted basis of the asset on the first change date exceeds the fair market value of the asset on that date. The principles of this paragraph (b)(2) also apply to items described in section 382(h)(6)(B).


(c) *Computation of value.* For purposes of computing the limitation under section 382 with respect to each controlled group loss, the value of the stock of each component member of the controlled group with respect to that loss is determined immediately before the ownership change, and is adjusted by applying the following rules: 


(1) *Reduction in value.* The value of the stock of each component member is reduced by the value (immediately before the ownership change and without regard to any restoration of value or other adjustment under this section) of the stock of any other component member directly owned by the component member immediately after the ownership change. 


(2) *Restoration of value.* After the value of the stock of each component member is reduced pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the value of the stock of each component member is increased by the amount of value, if any, restored to the component member by another component member (the electing member) pursuant to this paragraph (c)(2). The electing member may elect (or may be deemed to elect under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section in the case of a foreign component member) to restore value to another component member in an amount that does not exceed the lesser of—


(i) The sum of—


(A) The value, determined immediately before the ownership change, of the electing member's stock (after adjustment under paragraph (c)(1) of this section and before any restoration of value under this paragraph (c)(2)); plus


(B) Any amount of value restored to the electing member by another component member under this paragraph (c)(2); or


(ii) The value, determined immediately before any ownership change, of the electing member's stock (without regard to any adjustment under this section) that is directly owned by the other component member immediately after the ownership change.


(3) *Reduction in value by the amount restored.* The value of the stock of the electing member is reduced by any amount of value that the electing member elects to restore under paragraph (c)(2) of this section to another component member. 


(4) *Appropriate adjustments.* Appropriate additional adjustments consistent with paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this section must be made to prevent any duplication of value. Thus, for example, adjustments must be made to reflect— 


(i) Any indirect ownership interest in another component member; 


(ii) Any cross ownership of stock by component members of the controlled group with respect to the controlled group loss; and 


(iii) Any value used to determine a limitation under section 382 with respect to controlled group losses from the same period. 


(5) *Certain reductions in the value of members of a controlled group.* A loss corporation that has an ownership change is required to make adjustments consistent with this paragraph (c) with respect to its stock if the stock of another corporation in which it had a direct or indirect ownership interest was disposed of before the ownership change, and; 


(i) Both corporations were component members of a controlled group— 


(A) With respect to a taxable year to which a controlled group loss of the loss corporation is attributable; and 


(B) At any time during the 2 year period before the ownership change; and 


(ii) Both corporations are component members of a controlled group at any time during the 2 year period following the ownership change. 


(d) *No double reduction.* To the extent consistent with the purposes of this section, section 382 and this section shall not be applied to duplicate a reduction in the value of a loss corporation. Thus, for example, if the value of a loss corporation is reduced under section 382(l)(1) to reflect a capital contribution of stock of a component member, it is not again reduced by such amount under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If this paragraph (d) applies to prevent a reduction in value from being duplicated, the application of the other rules of this section, such as those relating to the restoration of value, is correspondingly limited in a manner consistent with the principles of this section. 


(e) *Definitions and nomenclature*—(1) *Definitions in section 382 and the regulations thereunder.* Except as otherwise provided, the definitions and nomenclature contained in section 382 and the regulations thereunder apply to this section. 


(2) *Controlled group.* Controlled group has the same meaning as in section 1563(a), determined by substituting “50 percent” for “80 percent” each place that it appears, and without regard to section 1563(a)(4). 


(3) *Component member.* Component member has the same meaning as in section 1563(b), determined by substituting “December 31 (or the change date, if earlier)” for “December 31” each place it appears, and without regard to section 1563 (b)(2), (b)(3)(C), and (b)(4). 


(4) *Foreign component member*—(i) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, foreign component member means a component member that is a foreign corporation.


(ii) *Exception.* A foreign component member shall not include a foreign corporation that has items treated as connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States that it takes into account in determining its value pursuant to section 382(e)(3).


(5) *Predecessor and successor corporation.* As the context may require, a reference to a corporation, or component member includes a reference to a predecessor or successor corporation. 


(f) *Coordination between consolidated groups and controlled groups.* Some or all of the component members of a controlled group may also be members of a consolidated group, and a controlled group loss may be subject to a consolidated section 382 limitation or subgroup section 382 limitation determined under § 1.1502-93. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (f) and §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-99, § 1.1502-93 applies instead of this section when both sections, by their terms, are otherwise applicable. This section is applicable and may require an adjustment to value if a member of a consolidated group, a loss group, or loss subgroup (as those terms are defined in §§ 1.1502-1(h) and 1.1502-91) is also a component member of a controlled group with respect to a controlled group loss. Solely for purposes of applying this section, a consolidated group, loss group, or loss subgroup is treated as a single corporation. Thus to determine the limitation with respect to any portion of the pre-change consolidated attributes or pre-change subgroup attributes of the loss group or loss subgroup that is a controlled group loss, the consolidated section 382 limitation or subgroup section 382 limitation is computed by treating the loss group or the loss subgroup as a single corporation, and adjusting value in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. See paragraph (g) *Example 4* of this section. 


(g) *Examples.* For purposes of the examples in this section, unless otherwise stated, the nomenclature and assumptions of the examples in § 1.382-2T(b) apply, all corporations file separate income tax returns on a calendar year basis, the only 5-percent shareholder of a corporation is a public group, and the facts set forth the only owner shifts with respect to the corporations during the testing period. 


(h) *Time and manner of filing election to restore*—(1) *Statements required*—(i) *Filing by loss corporation.* The election to restore value described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section must be in the form set forth in this paragraph (h)(1)(i). It must be filed by the loss corporation by including a statement on or with its income tax return for the taxable year in which the ownership change occurs (or with an amended return for that year filed on or before the due date (including extensions) of the income tax return of any component member with respect to the taxable year in which the ownership change occurs). The common parent of a consolidated group must make the election on behalf of the group. The election is made in the form of a statement entitled, “STATEMENT PURSUANT TO § 1.382-8(h)(1) TO ELECT TO RESTORE ALL OR PART OF THE VALUE OF [INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (IF ANY) OF THE ELECTING MEMBER] TO [INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (IF ANY) OF THE CORPORATION TO WHICH VALUE IS RESTORED].” The statement must include the amount of the value being restored and must also indicate that an agreement signed and dated by both parties, as described in paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section, has been entered into. Each such party must retain either the original or a copy of this agreement as part of its records. See § 1.6001-1(e).


(ii) *Filing by electing member.* An electing member must include a statement identical to the one described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section on or with its income tax return (or with an amended return for that year filed on or before the due date (including extensions) of the income tax return of any component member with respect to the taxable year in which the ownership change occurs) (if any) for the taxable year which includes the change date in connection with which the election described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is made. If the electing member is a controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 957), each United States shareholder (within the meaning of section 951(b)) with respect thereto must include this statement on or with its return. It is not necessary for the electing member (or the United States shareholder, as the case may be) to include this statement on or with its return if the loss corporation includes an identical statement on or with the same return for the same election.


(iii) *Agreement.* Both the electing member and the corporation to which value is restored must sign and date an agreement. The agreement must—


(A) Identify the change date for the loss corporation in connection with which the election is made;


(B) State the value of the electing member's stock (without regard to any adjustment under paragraph (c) of this section) immediately before the ownership change;


(C) State the amount of any reduction required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to stock of the electing member that is owned directly or indirectly by the corporation to which value is restored;


(D) State the amount of value that the electing member elects to restore to the corporation; and


(E) State whether the value of either component member's stock was adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section.


(2) *Special rule for foreign component members*—(i) *Deemed election to restore full value.* Unless the election described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section is made for a foreign component member, each foreign component member of the controlled group is deemed to have elected to restore to each other component member the maximum value allowable under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, taking into account the limitations of this section.


(ii) *Election not to restore full value.* (A) A loss corporation may elect to reduce the amount of value restored from a foreign component member (the electing foreign component member) to another component member under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section in the form set forth in this paragraph (h)(2)(ii). It must be filed by the loss corporation by including a statement on or with its income tax return for the taxable year in which the ownership change occurs (or with an amended return for that year filed on or before the due date (including extensions) of the income tax return of any component member with respect to the taxable year in which the ownership change occurs). The common parent of a consolidated group must make the election on behalf of the group. The election is made in the form of a statement entitled, “STATEMENT PURSUANT TO § 1.382-8(h)(2)(ii) TO ELECT NOT TO RESTORE FULL VALUE OF [INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (IF ANY) OF ELECTING FOREIGN COMPONENT MEMBER] TO [INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (IF ANY) OF THE CORPORATION TO WHICH SUCH VALUE IS NOT TO BE RESTORED].” The statement must include the amount of the value not being restored and must also indicate that an agreement signed and dated by both parties, as described in paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section, has been entered into. Each such party must retain either the original or a copy of the agreement as part of its records. See § 1.6001-1(e).


(B) An electing foreign component member must include a statement identical to the one described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section on or with its income tax return (or with an amended return for that year filed on or before the due date (including extensions) of the income tax return of any component member with respect to the taxable year in which the ownership change occurs) (if any) for the taxable year which includes the change date in connection with which the election described in paragraph (h)(2)(ii)(A) of this section is made. If the electing foreign component member is a controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 957), each United States shareholder (within the meaning of section 951(b)) with respect thereto must include this statement on or with its return. It is not necessary for the electing foreign component member (or United States shareholder, as the case may be) to include this statement on or with its return if the loss corporation includes an identical statement on or with the same return for the same election.


(iii) *Agreement.* Both the electing foreign component member and the corporation to which full value is not restored must sign and date an agreement. The agreement must—


(A) Identify the change date for the loss corporation in connection with which the election is made;


(B) State the value of the electing foreign component member's stock (without regard to any adjustment under paragraph (c) of this section) immediately before the ownership change;


(C) State the amount of any reduction required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to stock of the electing foreign component member that is owned directly or indirectly by the corporation to which value is not restored;


(D) State the amount of value that the electing foreign component member elects not to restore to the corporation; and


(E) State whether the value of either component member's stock was adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section.


(3) *Revocation of election.* An election (other than the deemed election described in paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section) made under this section is revocable only with the consent of the Commissioner.


(i) [Reserved]


(j) *Effective date*—(1) *In general.* This section applies to a loss corporation that has an ownership change with respect to a controlled group loss on or after January 1, 1997. 


(2) *Transition rule*—(i) *In general.* The members of a controlled group on January 1, 1997, that have had an ownership change with respect to a controlled group loss before January 1, 1997, must determine the limitations under section 382 for any post-change year with respect to controlled group losses by using a reasonable method to preclude the value of stock of a component member that was owned directly or indirectly by another member immediately after an ownership change from being taken into account more than once in determining the limitations under section 382 with respect to controlled group losses. If such a reasonable method was not used for a post-change year, subject to the exception in paragraph (j)(3) of this section, the members of the controlled group described in the preceding sentence must reduce their limitations under section 382 for post-change years for which the income tax return is filed after January 1, 1997, to recapture, as quickly as possible, any limitation that members took into account in excess of the amount that would be allowable under this section. 


(ii) *Special transition rule for controlled groups that had ownership changes before January 29, 1991.* For purposes of this section, in the case of an ownership change occurring before January 29, 1991, the controlled group with respect to a controlled group loss does not include a corporation that is not a component member of the controlled group on January 29, 1991. Thus, in the case of an ownership change occurring before January 29, 1991, paragraph (c) of this section does not require that a loss corporation that is a component member of a controlled group to disregard the value of stock of another corporation directly owned immediately after the ownership change in determining the value of its own stock unless the other corporation is a component member of the controlled group on January 29, 1991. 


(3) *Amended returns.* A taxpayer that has had an ownership change before January 1, 1997, may file an amended return for any taxable year to modify the amount of a limitation under section 382 with respect to a controlled group loss only if— 


(i) The modification complies with the rules contained in this section for computing a limitation under section 382; 


(ii) Any other component member of the controlled group with respect to the controlled group loss who elects to restore value and whose taxable income is affected by the election to restore value also files amended returns that comply with such rules; and 


(iii) Corresponding adjustments are made in amended returns for all taxable years ending after December 31, 1986. 


(4) *Effective/applicability date.* Paragraphs (c)(2), (e)(4) and (h) of this section apply to any taxable year beginning on or after May 30, 2006. However, taxpayers may apply paragraphs (c)(2), (e)(4) and (h) of this section to any original Federal income tax return (including any amended return filed on or before the due date (including extensions) of such original return) timely filed on or after May 30, 2006. For taxable years beginning before May 30, 2006, see § 1.382-8 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on April 1, 2006.
