# § 1.385-3   Certain distributions of debt instruments and similar transactions.

(a) *Scope.* This section sets forth factors that control the determination of whether an interest is treated as stock or indebtedness. Specifically, this section addresses the issuance of a covered debt instrument to a related person as part of a transaction or series of transactions that does not result in new investment in the operations of the issuer. Paragraph (b) of this section sets forth rules for determining when these factors are present, such that a covered debt instrument is treated as stock under this section. Paragraph (c) of this section provides exceptions to the application of paragraph (b) of this section. Paragraph (d) of this section provides operating rules. Paragraph (e) of this section reserves on the affirmative use of this section. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules for the aggregate treatment of controlled partnerships. Paragraph (g) of this section provides definitions. Paragraph (h) of this section provides examples illustrating the application of the rules of this section. Paragraph (j) of this section provides dates of applicability. For rules regarding the application of this section to members of a consolidated group, see generally § 1.385-4.


(b) *Covered debt instrument treated as stock*—(1) *Effect of characterization as stock.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this section, to the extent a covered debt instrument is treated as stock under paragraphs (b)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, it is treated as stock for all federal tax purposes.


(2) *General rule.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section, a covered debt instrument is treated as stock to the extent the covered debt instrument is issued by a covered member to a member of the covered member's expanded group in one or more of the following transactions:


(i) In a distribution;


(ii) In exchange for expanded group stock, other than in an exempt exchange; or


(iii) In exchange for property in an asset reorganization, but only to the extent that, pursuant to the plan of reorganization, a shareholder in the transferor corporation that is a member of the issuer's expanded group immediately before the reorganization receives the covered debt instrument with respect to its stock in the transferor corporation.


(3) *Funding rule*—(i) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section, a covered debt instrument that is not a qualified short-term debt instrument (as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this section) is treated as stock to the extent that it is both issued by a covered member to a member of the covered member's expanded group in exchange for property and, pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii) or (b)(3)(iv) of this section, treated as funding a distribution or acquisition described in one or more of paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section. A covered member that makes a distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) is referred to as a “funded member,” regardless of when it issues a covered debt instrument in exchange for property.


(A) A distribution of property by the funded member to a member of the funded member's expanded group, other than in an exempt distribution;


(B) An acquisition of expanded group stock, other than an exempt exchange, by the funded member from a member of the funded member's expanded group in exchange for property other than expanded group stock; or


(C) An acquisition of property by the funded member in an asset reorganization but only to the extent that, pursuant to the plan of reorganization, a shareholder in the transferor corporation that is a member of the funded member's expanded group immediately before the reorganization receives other property or money within the meaning of section 356 with respect to its stock in the transferor corporation.


(ii) *Transactions described in more than one paragraph.* For purposes of this section, to the extent that a distribution or acquisition by a funded member is described in more than one of paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section, the funded member is treated as making only a single distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. In the case of an asset reorganization, to the extent an acquisition by the transferee corporation is described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(C) of this section, a distribution or acquisition by the transferor corporation is not also described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(ii), whether a distribution or acquisition is described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section is determined without regard to paragraph (c) of this section.


(iii) *Per se funding rule*—(A) *In general.* A covered debt instrument is treated as funding a distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section if the covered debt instrument is issued by a funded member during the period beginning 36 months before the date of the distribution or acquisition, and ending 36 months after the date of the distribution or acquisition (*per se period*).


(B) *Multiple interests.* If, pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, two or more covered debt instruments may be treated as stock by reason of this paragraph (b)(3), the covered debt instruments are tested under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section based on the order in which they are issued, with the earliest issued covered debt instrument tested first. See paragraph (h)(3) of this section, *Example 6,* for an illustration of this rule.


(C) *Multiple distributions or acquisitions.* If, pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, a covered debt instrument may be treated as funding more than one distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section, the covered debt instrument is treated as funding one or more distributions or acquisitions based on the order in which the distributions or acquisitions occur, with the earliest distribution or acquisition treated as the first distribution or acquisition that is funded. See paragraph (h)(3) of this section, *Example 9,* for an illustration of this rule.


(D) *Transactions that straddle different expanded groups*—(*1*) *In general.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, a covered debt instrument is not treated as issued by a funded member during the per se period with respect to a distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section if all of the conditions described in paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(D)(*1*)(*i*) through (*iii*) of this section are satisfied.


(*i*) The distribution or acquisition occurs prior to the issuance of the covered debt instrument by the funded member or, if the funded member is treated as making the distribution or acquisition of a predecessor or a successor, the predecessor or successor is not a member of the expanded group of which the funded member is a member on the date on which the distribution or the acquisition occurs.


(*ii*) The distribution or acquisition is made by the funded member when the funded member is a member of an expanded group that does not have an expanded group parent that is the funded member's expanded group parent when the covered debt instrument is issued. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a reference to an expanded group parent includes a reference to a predecessor or successor of the expanded group parent.


(*iii*) On the date of the issuance of the covered debt instrument, the recipient member (as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(D)(*2*) of this section) is neither a member nor a controlled partnership of an expanded group of which the funded member is a member.


(*2*) *Recipient member.* For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(D), the term *recipient member* means, with respect to a distribution or acquisition by a funded member described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section, the expanded group member that receives a distribution of property, property in exchange for expanded group stock, or other property or money within the meaning of section 356 with respect to its stock in the transferor corporation. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(D), a reference to the recipient member includes a predecessor or successor of the recipient member or one or more other entities that, in the aggregate, acquire substantially all of the property of the recipient member.


(E) *Modifications of a covered debt instrument*—(*1*) *In general.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, if a covered debt instrument is treated as exchanged for a modified covered debt instrument pursuant to § 1.1001-3(b), the modified covered debt instrument is treated as issued on the original issue date of the covered debt instrument.


(*2*) *Effect of certain modifications.* Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(E)(1) of this section, if a covered debt instrument is treated as exchanged for a modified covered debt instrument pursuant to § 1.1001-3(b) and the modification, or one of the modifications, that results in the deemed exchange includes the substitution of an obligor on the covered debt instrument, the addition or deletion of a co-obligor on the covered debt instrument, or the material deferral of scheduled payments due under the covered debt instrument, then the modified covered debt instrument is treated as issued on the date of the deemed exchange for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section.


(*3*) *Additional principal amount.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, if the principal amount of a covered debt instrument is increased, the portion of the covered debt instrument attributable to such increase is treated as issued on the date of such increase.


(iv) *Principal purpose rule.* For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), a covered debt instrument that is not issued by a funded member during the per se period with respect to a distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section is treated as funding the distribution or acquisition to the extent that it is issued by a funded member with a principal purpose of funding a distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section. Whether a covered debt instrument is issued with a principal purpose of funding a distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section is determined based on all the facts and circumstances. A covered debt instrument may be treated as issued with a principal purpose of funding a distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section regardless of whether it is issued before or after the distribution or acquisition.


(v) *Predecessors and successors*—(A) *In general.* Subject to the limitations in paragraph (b)(3)(v)(B) of this section, for purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), references to a funded member include references to any predecessor or successor of such member. See paragraph (h)(3) of this section, *Examples 9* and *10,* for illustrations of this rule.


(B) *Limitations to the application of the per se funding rule.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, a covered debt instrument issued by a funded member that satisfies the condition described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) with respect to a distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section made by a predecessor or successor of the funded member is not treated as issued during the per se period with respect to the distribution or acquisition unless the conditions described in paragraphs (b)(3)(v)(B)(*1*) and (*2*) of this section are satisfied:


(*1*) The covered debt instrument is issued by the funded member during the period beginning 36 months before the date of the transaction in which the predecessor or successor becomes a predecessor or successor and ending 36 months after the date of the transaction.


(*2*) The distribution or acquisition is made by the predecessor or successor during the period beginning 36 months before the date of the transaction in which the predecessor or successor becomes a predecessor or successor of the funded member and ending 36 months after the date of the transaction.


(vi) *Treatment of funded transactions.* When a covered debt instrument is treated as stock pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section that is treated as funded by such covered debt instrument is not recharacterized as a result of the treatment of the covered debt instrument as stock.


(vii) *Qualified short-term debt instrument.* The term qualified short-term debt instrument means a covered debt instrument that is described in paragraphs (b)(3)(vii)(A) though (D) of this section.


(A) *Short-term funding arrangement.* A covered debt instrument is described in this paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(A) if the requirements of the specified current assets test described in paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(A)(*1*) of this section or the 270-day test described in paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(A)(*2*) of this section (the alternative tests) are satisfied, provided that an issuer may only claim the benefit of one of the alternative tests with respect to covered debt instruments issued by the issuer in the same taxable year.


(*1*) *Specified current assets test*—(*i*) *In general.* The requirements of this paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(A)(*1*) are satisfied with respect to a covered debt instrument if the requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(A)(*1*)(*ii*) of this section is satisfied, but only to the extent the requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(A)(*1*)(*iii*) of this section is satisfied.


(*ii*) *Maximum interest rate.* The rate of interest charged with respect to the covered debt instrument does not exceed an arm's length interest rate, as determined under section 482 and §§ 1.482-1 through 1.482-9, that would be charged with respect to a comparable debt instrument of the issuer with a term that does not exceed the longer of 90 days and the issuer's normal operating cycle.


(*iii*) *Maximum outstanding balance.* The amount owed by the issuer under covered debt instruments issued to members of the issuer's expanded group that satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(A)(*1*)(*ii*), (b)(3)(vii)(A)(*2*) (if the covered debt instrument was issued in a prior taxable year), or (b)(3)(vii)(B) or (C) of this section immediately after the covered debt instrument is issued does not exceed the maximum of the amounts of specified current assets reasonably expected to be reflected, under applicable accounting principles, on the issuer's balance sheet as a result of transactions in the ordinary course of business during the subsequent 90-day period or the issuer's normal operating cycle, whichever is longer. For purposes of the preceding sentence, in the case of an issuer that is a qualified cash pool header, the amount owed by the issuer shall not take into account deposits described in paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(D) of this section. Additionally, the amount owed by any issuer shall be reduced by the amount of the issuer's deposits with a qualified cash pool header, but only to the extent of amounts borrowed from the same qualified cash pool header that satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(A)(*2*) (if the covered debt instrument was issued in a prior taxable year) or (b)(3)(vii)(A)(*1*)(*ii*) of this section.


(*iv*) *Specified current assets.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(A)(*1*)(*iii*) of this section, the term *specified current assets* means assets that are reasonably expected to be realized in cash or sold (including by being incorporated into inventory that is sold) during the normal operating cycle of the issuer, other than cash, cash equivalents, and assets that are reflected on the books and records of a qualified cash pool header.


(*v*) *Normal operating cycle.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(A)(*1*) of this section, the term *normal operating cycle* means the issuer's normal operating cycle as determined under applicable accounting principles, except that if the issuer has no single clearly defined normal operating cycle, then the normal operating cycle is determined based on a reasonable analysis of the length of the operating cycles of the multiple businesses and their sizes relative to the overall size of the issuer.


(*vi*) *Applicable accounting principles.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(A)(*1*) of this section, the term *applicable accounting principles* means the financial accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or an international financial accounting standard, that is applicable to the issuer in preparing its financial statements, computed on a consistent basis.


(*2*) *270-day test*—(*i*) *In general.* A covered debt instrument is described in this paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(A)(*2*) if the requirements of paragraphs (b)(3)(vii)(A)(*2*)(*ii*) through (*iv*) of this section are satisfied.


(*ii*) *Maximum term and interest rate.* The covered debt instrument must have a term of 270 days or less or be an advance under a revolving credit agreement or similar arrangement and must bear a rate of interest that does not exceed an arm's length interest rate, as determined under section 482 and §§ 1.482-1 through 1.482-9, that would be charged with respect to a comparable debt instrument of the issuer with a term that does not exceed 270 days.


(*iii*) *Lender-specific indebtedness limit.* The issuer is a net borrower from the lender for no more than 270 days during the taxable year of the issuer, and in the case of a covered debt instrument outstanding during consecutive tax years, the issuer is a net borrower from the lender for no more than 270 consecutive days, in both cases taking into account only covered debt instruments that satisfy the requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(A)(*2*)(*ii*) of this section other than covered debt instruments described in paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(B) or (C) of this section.


(*iv*) *Overall indebtedness limit.* The issuer is a net borrower under all covered debt instruments issued to members of the issuer's expanded group that satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b)(3)(vii)(A)(*2*)(*ii*) and (*iii*) of this section, other than covered debt instruments described in paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(B) or (C) of this section, for no more than 270 days during the taxable year of the issuer, determined without regard to the identity of the lender under such covered debt instruments.


(*v*) *Inadvertent error.* An issuer's failure to satisfy the 270-day test will be disregarded if the failure is reasonable in light of all the facts and circumstances and the failure is promptly cured upon discovery. A failure to satisfy the 270-day test will be considered reasonable if the taxpayer maintains due diligence procedures to prevent such failures, as evidenced by having written policies and operational procedures in place to monitor compliance with the 270-day test and management-level employees of the expanded group having undertaken reasonable efforts to establish, follow, and enforce such policies and procedures.


(B) *Ordinary course loans.* A covered debt instrument is described in this paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(B) if the covered debt instrument is issued as consideration for the acquisition of property other than money in the ordinary course of the issuer's trade or business, provided that the obligation is reasonably expected to be repaid within 120 days of issuance.


(C) *Interest-free loans.* A covered debt instrument is described in this paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(C) if the instrument does not provide for stated interest or no interest is charged on the instrument, the instrument does not have original issue discount (as defined in section 1273 and §§ 1.1273-1 and 1.1273-2), interest is not imputed under section 483 or section 7872 and §§ 1.483-1 through 1.483-4 or §§ 1.7872-1 through 1.7872-16, respectively, and interest is not required to be charged under section 482 and §§ 1.482-1 through 1.482-9.


(D) *Deposits with a qualified cash pool header*—(*1*) *In general.* A covered debt instrument is described in this paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(D) if it is a demand deposit received by a qualified cash pool header described in paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(D)(*2*) of this section pursuant to a cash-management arrangement described in paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(D)(*3*) of this section. This paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(D) does not apply if a purpose for making the demand deposit is to facilitate the avoidance of the purposes of this section with respect to a qualified business unit (as defined in section 989(a) and § 1.989(a)-1) (QBU) that is not a qualified cash pool header.


(*2*) *Qualified cash pool header.* The term *qualified cash pool header* means an expanded group member, controlled partnership, or QBU described in § 1.989(a)-1(b)(2)(ii), that has as its principal purpose managing a cash-management arrangement for participating expanded group members, provided that the excess (if any) of funds on deposit with such expanded group member, controlled partnership, or QBU (header) over the outstanding balance of loans made by the header is maintained on the books and records of the header in the form of cash or cash equivalents, or invested through deposits with, or the acquisition of obligations or portfolio securities of, persons that do not have a relationship to the header (or, in the case of a header that is a QBU described in § 1.989(a)-1(b)(2)(ii), its owner) described in section 267(b) or section 707(b).


(*3*) *Cash-management arrangement.* The term cash-management arrangement means an arrangement the principal purpose of which is to manage cash for participating expanded group members. For purposes of the preceding sentence, managing cash means borrowing excess funds from participating expanded group members and lending funds to participating expanded group members, and may also include foreign exchange management, clearing payments, investing excess cash with an unrelated person, depositing excess cash with another qualified cash pool header, and settling intercompany accounts, for example through netting centers and pay-on-behalf-of programs.


(viii) *Distributions or acquisitions occurring before April 5, 2016.* A distribution or acquisition that occurs before April 5, 2016, is not taken into account for purposes of applying this paragraph (b)(3).


(4) *Anti-abuse rule.* If a member of an expanded group enters into a transaction with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of this section or § 1.385-3, an interest issued or held by that member or another member of the member's expanded group may, depending on the relevant facts and circumstances, be treated as stock. Paragraphs (b)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section include a non-exhaustive list of transactions that could result in an interest being treated as stock under this paragraph (b)(4).


(i) *Interests.* An interest is treated as stock if it is issued with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of this section or § 1.385-3. Interests subject to this paragraph (b)(4)(i) may include:


(A) An interest that is not a covered debt instrument for purposes of this section (for example, a contract to which section 483 applies that is not otherwise a covered debt instrument or a non-periodic swap payment that is not otherwise a covered debt instrument).


(B) A covered debt instrument issued to a person that is not a member of the issuer's expanded group, if the covered debt instrument is later acquired by a member of the issuer's expanded group or such person later becomes a member of the issuer's expanded group.


(C) A covered debt instrument issued to an entity that is not taxable as a corporation for federal tax purposes.


(D) A covered debt instrument issued in connection with a reorganization or similar transaction.


(E) A covered debt instrument issued as part of a plan or a series of transactions to expand the applicability of the transition rules described in § 1.385-3(j)(2) or § 1.385-3(k)(2).


(ii) *Other transactions.* A covered debt instrument is treated as stock if the funded member or any member of the expanded group engages in a transaction (including a distribution or acquisition) with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of this section or § 1.385-3. Transactions subject to this paragraph (b)(4)(ii) may include:


(A) A member of the issuer's expanded group is substituted as a new obligor or added as a co-obligor on an existing covered debt instrument.


(B) A covered debt instrument is transferred in connection with a reorganization or similar transaction.


(C) A covered debt instrument funds a distribution or acquisition where the distribution or acquisition is made by a member other than the funded member and the funded member acquires the assets of the other member in a transaction that does not make the other member a predecessor to the funded member.


(D) Members of a consolidated group engage in transactions as part of a plan or a series of transactions through the use of the consolidated group rules set forth in § 1.385-4, including through the use of the departing member rules.


(5) *Coordination between general rule and funding rule.* For purposes of this section, a distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is not also described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. In the case of an asset reorganization, an acquisition described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section by the transferee corporation is not also a distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section by the transferor corporation. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5), whether a distribution or acquisition is described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section is determined without regard to paragraph (c) of this section.


(6) *Non-duplication.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, to the extent a distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section is treated as funded by a covered debt instrument under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the distribution or acquisition is not treated as funded by another covered debt instrument and the covered debt instrument is not treated as funding another distribution or acquisition for purposes of paragraph (b)(3).


(c) *Exceptions*—(1) *In general.* This paragraph (c) provides exceptions for purposes of applying paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section to a covered member. These exceptions are applied in the following order: First, paragraph (c)(2) of this section; second, paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and, third, paragraph (c)(4) of this section. The exceptions under § 1.385-3(c)(2) and (c)(3) apply to distributions and acquisitions that are otherwise described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section after applying paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (b)(5) of this section. Except as otherwise provided, the exceptions are applied by taking into account the aggregate treatment of controlled partnerships described in § 1.385-3(f).


(2) *Exclusions for transactions otherwise described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section*—(i) *Exclusion for certain acquisitions of subsidiary stock*—(A) *In general.* An acquisition of expanded group stock (including by issuance) is not treated as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section if, immediately after the acquisition, the covered member that acquires the expanded group stock (acquirer) controls the member of the expanded group from which the expanded group stock is acquired (seller), and the acquirer does not relinquish control of the seller pursuant to a plan that existed on the date of the acquisition, other than in a transaction in which the seller ceases to be a member of the expanded group of which the acquirer is a member. For purposes of the preceding sentence, an acquirer and seller do not cease to be members of the same expanded group by reason of a complete liquidation described in section 331.


(B) *Control.* For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(i) and paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) of this section, control of a corporation means the direct or indirect ownership of more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the corporation entitled to vote and more than 50 percent of the total value of the stock of the corporation. For purposes of the preceding sentence, indirect ownership is determined by applying the principles of section 958(a) without regard to whether an intermediate entity is foreign or domestic.


(C) *Rebuttable presumption.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the acquirer is presumed to have a plan to relinquish control of the seller on the date of the acquisition if the acquirer relinquishes control of the seller within the 36-month period following the date of the acquisition. The presumption created by the previous sentence may be rebutted by facts and circumstances clearly establishing that the loss of control was not contemplated on the date of the acquisition and that the avoidance of the purposes of this section or § 1.385-3 was not a principal purpose for the subsequent loss of control.


(ii) *Exclusion for compensatory stock acquisitions.* An acquisition of expanded group stock is not treated as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section if the expanded group stock is delivered to individuals that are employees, directors, or independent contractors in consideration for services rendered by such individuals to a member of the expanded group or a controlled partnership in which a member of the expanded group is an expanded group partner.


(iii) *Exclusion for distributions or acquisitions resulting from transfer pricing adjustments.* A distribution or acquisition deemed to occur under § 1.482-1(g) (including adjustments made pursuant to Revenue Procedure 99-32, 1999-2 C.B. 296) is not treated as described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) or (B) of this section.


(iv) *Exclusion for acquisitions of expanded group stock by a dealer in securities.* An acquisition of expanded group stock by a dealer in securities (within the meaning of section 475(c)(1)), or by an expanded group partner treated as acquiring expanded group stock pursuant to § 1.385-3(f)(2) if the relevant controlled partnership is a dealer in securities, is not treated as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section to the extent the expanded group stock is acquired in the ordinary course of the dealer's business of dealing in securities. The preceding sentence applies solely to the extent that—


(A) The dealer accounts for the stock as securities held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business;


(B) The dealer disposes of the stock within a period of time that is consistent with the holding of the stock for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, taking into account the terms of the stock and the conditions and practices prevailing in the markets for similar stock during the period in which it is held; and


(C) The dealer does not sell or otherwise transfer the stock to a person in the same expanded group, other than in a sale to a dealer that in turn satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.


(v) *Exclusion for certain acquisitions of expanded group stock resulting from application of this section.* The following deemed acquisitions are not treated as acquisitions of expanded group stock described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section, provided that they are not part of a plan or arrangement to prevent the application of paragraph (b)(3)(i) to a covered debt instrument:


(A) An acquisition of a covered debt instrument that is treated as stock by means of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.


(B) An acquisition of stock of a regarded owner that is deemed to be issued under § 1.385-3(d)(4).


(C) An acquisition of deemed partner stock pursuant to a deemed transfer or a specified event described in § 1.385-3(f)(4) or (5).


(3) *Reductions for transactions described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section*—(i) *Reduction for expanded group earnings*—(A) *In general.* The aggregate amount of any distributions or acquisitions by a covered member described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section in a taxable year during the covered member's expanded group period is reduced by the covered member's expanded group earnings account (as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section) for the expanded group period as of the close of the taxable year. The reduction described in this paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) applies to one or more distributions or acquisitions based on the order in which the distributions or acquisitions occur, regardless of whether any distribution or acquisition would be treated as funded by a covered debt instrument without regard to this paragraph (c)(3).


(B) *Expanded group earnings account.* The term *expanded group earnings account* means, with respect to a covered member and an expanded group period (as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(E) of this section) of the covered member, the excess, if any, of the covered member's expanded group earnings (as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C) of this section) for the expanded group period over the covered member's expanded group reductions (as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(D) of this section) for the expanded group period.


(C) *Expanded group earnings*—(*1*) *In general.* The term expanded group earnings means, with respect to a covered member and an expanded group period of the covered member, the earnings and profits accumulated by the covered member during the expanded group period, computed as of the close of the taxable year of the covered member, without diminution by reason of any distributions or acquisitions by the covered member described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3)(i) of this section. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the expanded group earnings of a covered member do not include earnings and profits accumulated by the covered member in any taxable year ending before April 5, 2016.


(*2*) *Special rule for change in expanded group within a taxable year.* For purposes of calculating a covered member's expanded group earnings for a taxable year that is not wholly included in an expanded group period, the covered member's expanded group earnings are ratably allocated among the portion of the taxable year included in the expanded group period and the portion of the taxable year not included in the expanded group period. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the expanded group period is determined by excluding the day on which the covered member becomes a member of an expanded group with the same expanded group parent and including the day on which the covered member ceases to be a member of an expanded group with the same expanded group parent.


(*3*) *Look-through rule for dividends*—(*i*) *In general.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C)(*1*) of this section, a dividend from a member of the same expanded group (*distributing member*) is not taken into account for purposes of calculating a covered member's expanded group earnings, except to the extent the dividend is attributable to earnings and profits accumulated by the distributing member in a taxable year ending after April 4, 2016, during its expanded group period (*qualified earnings and profits*). For purposes of the preceding sentence, a dividend received from a member (*intermediate distributing member*) is not taken into account for purposes of calculating the qualified earnings and profits of a distributing member (or another intermediate distributing member), except to the extent the dividend is attributable to qualified earnings and profits of the intermediate distributing member. A dividend from a distributing member or an intermediate distributing member is considered to be attributable to qualified earnings and profits to the extent thereof. If the distributing member or the intermediate distributing member is not a covered member, the expanded group period of the member is determined under the principles of paragraph (c)(3)(i)(E) of this section. If a controlled partnership receives a dividend from a distributing member and a portion of the dividend is allocated (including through one or more partnerships) to a covered member, then, for purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C)(*3*), the covered member is treated as receiving the dividend from the distributing member.


(*ii*) *Dividend.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C)(*3*)(*i*) of this section, the term dividend has the meaning specified in section 316, including the portion of gain recognized under section 1248 that is treated as a dividend and deemed dividends under section 367(b) and the regulations thereunder. In addition, the term dividend includes inclusions with respect to stock (for example, inclusions under sections 951(a) and 1293).


(*4*) *Effect of interest deductions.* For purposes of calculating the expanded group earnings of a covered member for a taxable year, expanded group earnings are calculated without regard to the application of this section during the taxable year to a covered debt instrument issued by the covered member that was not treated as stock under paragraph (b) of this section as of the close of the preceding taxable year, or, if the covered member is an expanded group partner in a controlled partnership that is the issuer of a debt instrument, without regard to the application of § 1.385-3(f)(4)(i) during the taxable year with respect to the covered member's share of the debt instrument. To the extent that the application of this paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C)(*4*) reduces the expanded group earnings of the covered member for the taxable year, the expanded group earnings of the covered member are increased as of the beginning of the succeeding taxable year during the expanded group period.


(D) *Expanded group reductions.* The term expanded group reductions means, with respect to a covered member and an expanded group period of the covered member, the amounts by which acquisitions or distributions described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section were reduced by reason of paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section during the portion of the expanded group period preceding the taxable year.


(E) *Expanded group period*—(*1*) *In general.* For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(i) and paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the term expanded group period means, with respect to a covered member, the period during which a covered member is a member of an expanded group with the same expanded group parent.


(*2*) *Mere change.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i)(E)(*1*) of this section, an expanded group parent that is a resulting corporation (within the meaning of § 1.368-2(m)(1)) in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(F) is treated as the same expanded group parent as an expanded group parent that is a transferor corporation (within the meaning of § 1.368-2(m)(1)) in the same reorganization, provided that either—


(*i*) The transferor corporation is not a covered member; or


(*ii*) Both the transferor corporation and the resulting corporation are covered members.


(F) *Special rules for certain corporate transactions*—(*1*) *Reduction for expanded group earnings in an asset reorganization.* For purposes of applying paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, a distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section that occurs pursuant to a reorganization described in section 381(a)(2) is reduced solely by the expanded group earnings account of the acquiring member after taking into account the adjustment to its expanded group earnings account provided in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(F)(*2*)(*ii*) of this section.


(*2*) *Effect of certain corporate transactions on the calculation of expanded group earnings account*—(*i*) *In general.* Section 381 and § 1.312-10 are not taken into account for purposes of calculating a covered member's expanded group earnings account for an expanded group period. The expanded group earnings account that a covered member succeeds to under paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(F)(*2*)(*ii*) through (*iv*) of this section is attributed to the covered member's expanded group period as of the close of the date of the distribution or transfer.


(*ii*) *Section 381 transactions.* If a covered member (*acquiring member*) acquires the assets of another covered member (*acquired member*) in a transaction described in section 381(a), and, immediately before the transaction, both corporations are members of the same expanded group, then the acquiring member succeeds to the expanded group earnings account of the acquired member, if any, determined after application of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section with respect to the final taxable year of the acquired member.


(*iii*) *Section 1.312-10(a) transactions.* If a covered member (*transferor member*) transfers property to another covered member (*transferee member*) in a transaction described in § 1.312-10(a), the expanded group earnings account of the transferor member is allocated between the transferor member and the transferee member in the same proportion as the earnings and profits of the transferor member are allocated between the transferor member and the transferee member under § 1.312-10(a).


(*iv*) *Section 1.312-10(b) transactions.* If a covered member (*distributing member*) distributes the stock of another covered member (*controlled member*) in a transaction described in § 1.312-10(b), the expanded group earnings account of the distributing member is decreased by the amount that the expanded group earnings account of the distributing member would have been decreased under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(F)(*2*)(*iii*) of this section if the distributing member had transferred the stock of the controlled member to a newly formed corporation in a transaction described in § 1.312-10(a). If the amount of the decrease described in the preceding sentence exceeds the expanded group earnings account of the controlled member immediately before the transaction described in § 1.312-10(b), then the expanded group earnings account of the controlled member after the transaction is equal to the amount of the decrease.


(G) *Overlapping expanded groups.* A covered member that is a member of two expanded groups at the same time has a single expanded group earnings account with respect to a single expanded group period. In this case, the expanded group period is determined by reference to the shorter of the two periods during which the covered member is a member of an expanded group with the same expanded group parent.


(ii) *Reduction for qualified contributions*—(A) *In general.* The amount of a distribution or acquisition by a covered member described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section is reduced by the aggregate fair market value of the stock issued by the covered member in one or more qualified contributions (as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section) during the qualified period (as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C) of this section), but only to the extent the qualified contribution or qualified contributions have not reduced another distribution or acquisition. The reduction described in this paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) applies to one or more distributions or acquisitions based on the order in which the distributions or acquisitions occur, regardless of whether any distribution or acquisition would be treated as funded by a covered debt instrument without regard to this paragraph (c)(3).


(B) *Qualified contribution.* The term *qualified contribution* means, with respect to a covered member, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) of this section, a contribution of property, other than excluded property (defined in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(D) of this section), to the covered member by a member of the covered member's expanded group (or by a controlled partnership of the expanded group) in exchange for stock.


(C) *Qualified period.* The term *qualified period* means, with respect to a covered member, a qualified contribution, and a distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section, the period beginning on the later of the beginning of the periods described in paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(C)(*1*) and (*2*) of this section, and ending on the earlier of the ending of the periods described in paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(C)(*1*) and (*2*) of this section or the date described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C)(*3*) of this section.


(*1*) The period beginning 36 months before the date of the distribution or acquisition, and ending 36 months after the date of the distribution or acquisition.


(*2*) The covered member's expanded group period (as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(E) of this section) that includes the distribution or acquisition.


(*3*) The last day of the first taxable year that a covered debt instrument issued by the covered member would, absent the application of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) with respect to the distribution or acquisition, be treated, in whole or in part, as stock under paragraph (b) of this section or, in the case of a covered debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership in which the covered member is an expanded group partner, the covered debt instrument would be treated, in whole or in part, as a specified portion.


(D) *Excluded property.* The term *excluded property* means—


(*1*) Expanded group stock;


(*2*) Property acquired by the covered member in an asset reorganization from a member of the expanded group of which the covered member is a member;


(*3*) A covered debt instrument of any member of the same expanded group, including a covered debt instrument issued by the covered member;


(*4*) Property acquired by the covered member in exchange for a covered debt instrument issued by the covered member that is recharacterized under paragraph (b)(3) of this section;


(*5*) A debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership of the expanded group of which the covered member is a member, including the portion of such a debt instrument that is a deemed transferred receivable or a retained receivable; and


(*6*) Any other property acquired by the covered member with a principal purpose to avoid the purposes of this section or § 1.385-3, including a transaction involving an indirect transfer of property described in paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(D)(*1*) through (*5*) of this section.


(E) *Excluded contributions*—(*1*) *Upstream contributions from certain subsidiaries.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, a contribution of property from a corporation (*controlled member*) that the covered member controls, within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section, is not a qualified contribution.


(*2*) *Contributions to a predecessor or successor.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, a contribution of property to a covered member from a corporation of which the covered member is a predecessor or successor, or from a corporation controlled by that corporation within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section, is not a qualified contribution.


(*3*) *Contributions that do not increase fair market value.* A contribution of property to a covered member that is not described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E)(*1*) or (*2*) of this section is not a qualified contribution to the extent that the contribution does not increase the aggregate fair market value of the outstanding stock of the covered member immediately after the transaction and taking into account all related transactions, other than distributions and acquisitions described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3)(i) of this section.


(*4*) *Contributions that become excluded contributions after the date of the contribution.* If a contribution of property described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E)(*1*) or (*2*) of this section occurs before the covered member acquires control of the controlled member described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E)(*1*) or before the transaction in which the corporation described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E)(*2*) becomes a predecessor or successor to the covered member, the contribution of property ceases to be a qualified contribution on the date that the covered member acquires control of the controlled member or on the date of the transaction in which the corporation becomes a predecessor or successor to the covered member (*transaction date*). If the contribution of property occurs within 36 months before the transaction date, the covered member is treated as making a distribution described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section on the transaction date equal to the amount by which any distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section was reduced under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section because the contribution of property was treated as a qualified contribution.


(F) *Special rules for certain corporate transactions*—(*1*) *Reduction for qualified contributions in an asset reorganization.* For purposes of applying paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, a distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section that occurs pursuant to a reorganization described in section 381(a)(2) is reduced solely by the qualified contributions of the acquiring member after taking into account the adjustment to its qualified contributions provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(F)(*2*) of this section.


(*2*) *Effect of certain corporate transactions on the calculation of qualified contributions*—(*i*) *In general.* This paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(F)(*2*) provides rules for allocating or reducing the qualified contributions of a covered member as a result of certain corporation transactions. For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C)(*1*) of this section, a qualified contribution that a covered member succeeds to under paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(F)(*2*)(*ii*) and (*iii*) of this section is treated as made to the covered member on the date on which the qualified contribution was made to the covered member that received the qualified contribution. For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C)(*2*) of this section, a qualified contribution that a covered member succeeds to under paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(F)(*2*)(*ii*) and (*iii*) of this section is attributed to the covered member's expanded group period as of the close of the date of the distribution or transfer. For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C)(*3*) of this section, a qualified contribution a covered member succeeds to under paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(F)(*2*)(*ii*) and (*iii*) of this section is treated as made to the covered member as of the close of the date of the distribution or transfer.


(*ii*) *Section 381 transactions.* If a covered member (acquiring member) acquires the assets of another covered member (acquired member) in a transaction described in section 381(a), and, immediately before the transaction, both corporations are members of the same expanded group, the acquiring member succeeds to the qualified contributions of the acquired member, if any, adjusted for the application of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E)(*4*) of this section.


(*iii*) *Section 1.312-10(a) transactions.* If a covered member (transferor member) transfers property to another covered member (transferee member) in a transaction described in § 1.312-10(a), each qualified contribution of the transferor member is allocated between the transferor member and the transferee member in the same proportion as the earnings and profits of the transferor member are allocated between the transferor member and the transferee member under § 1.312-10(a).


(*iv*) *Section 1.312-10(b) transactions.* If a covered member (distributing member) distributes the stock of another covered member (controlled member) in a transaction described in § 1.312-10(b), each qualified contribution of the distributing member is decreased by the amount that each qualified contribution of the distributing member would have been decreased under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(F)(*2*)(*iii*) of this section if the distributing member had transferred the stock of the controlled member to a newly formed corporation in a transaction described in § 1.312-10(a). No amount of the qualified contributions of the distributing member is allocated to the controlled member.


(iii) *Predecessors and successors.* For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), references to a covered member do not include references to any corporation of which the covered member is a predecessor or successor. Accordingly, a distribution or acquisition by a covered member described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) is reduced solely by the expanded group earnings account of the covered member (taking into account the application of paragraph (c)(3)(i)(F)(*2*) of this section) and the qualified contributions of the covered member (taking into account the application of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(F)(*2*) of this section), notwithstanding that the distribution or acquisition is treated as made by a funded member of which the covered member is a predecessor or successor.


(iv) *Ordering rule.* The exceptions described in this paragraph (c)(3) are applied in the following order: First, paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section; and, second, paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.


(4) *Threshold exception.* A covered debt instrument is not treated as stock under this section if, immediately after the covered debt instrument would be treated as stock under this section but for the application of this paragraph (c)(4), the aggregate adjusted issue price of covered debt instruments held by members of the issuer's expanded group that would be treated as stock under this section but for the application of this paragraph (c)(4) does not exceed $50 million. To the extent a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership would be treated as a specified portion (as defined in paragraph (g)(23) of this section) but for the application of this paragraph (c)(4), the debt instrument is treated as a covered debt instrument described in the preceding sentence for purposes of this paragraph (c)(4). To the extent that, immediately after a covered debt instrument would be treated as stock under this section but for the application of this paragraph (c)(4), the aggregate adjusted issue price of covered debt instruments held by members of the issuer's expanded group that would be treated as stock under this section but for the application of this paragraph (c)(4) exceeds $50 million, only the amount of the covered debt instrument in excess of $50 million is treated as stock under this section. For purposes of this rule, any covered debt instrument that is not denominated in U.S. dollars is translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate (as defined in § 1.988-1(d)) on the date that the covered debt instrument is issued.


(d) *Operating rules*—(1) *Timing.* This paragraph (d)(1) provides rules for determining when a covered debt instrument is treated as stock under paragraph (b) of this section. For special rules regarding the treatment of a deemed exchange of a covered debt instrument that occurs pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1)(ii), (d)(1)(iii), or (d)(1)(iv) of this section, see § 1.385-1(d).


(i) *General timing rule.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(1), when paragraph (b) of this section applies to treat a covered debt instrument as stock, the covered debt instrument is treated as stock when the covered debt instrument is issued. When paragraph (b)(3) of this section applies to treat a covered debt instrument as stock when the covered debt instrument is issued, see also paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section.


(ii) *Exception when a covered debt instrument is treated as funding a distribution or acquisition that occurs after the issuance of the covered debt instrument.* When paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section applies to treat a covered debt instrument as funding a distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section that occurs after the covered debt instrument is issued, the covered debt instrument is deemed to be exchanged for stock on the date that the distribution or acquisition occurs. See paragraph (h)(3) of this section, *Examples 4* and *9,* for an illustration of this rule.


(iii) *Exception for certain predecessor and successor transactions.* To the extent that a covered debt instrument would not be treated as stock but for the fact that a funded member is treated as the predecessor or successor of another expanded group member under paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section, the covered debt instrument is deemed to be exchanged for stock on the later of the date that the funded member completes the transaction causing it to become a predecessor or successor of the other expanded group member or the date that the covered debt instrument would be treated as stock under paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.


(iv) *Exception when a covered debt instrument is re-tested under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.* When paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section applies to treat a covered debt instrument as funding a distribution or acquisition described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section as a result of a re-testing described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section that occurs in a taxable year subsequent to the taxable year in which the covered debt instrument is issued, the covered debt instrument is deemed to be exchanged for stock on the later of the date of the re-testing or the date that the covered debt instrument would be treated as stock under paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section. See paragraph (h)(3) of this section, *Example 7,* for an illustration of this rule.


(2) *Covered debt instrument treated as stock that leaves the expanded group*—(i) *Events that cause a covered debt instrument to cease to be treated as stock.* Subject to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, this paragraph (d)(2)(i) applies with respect to a covered debt instrument that is treated as stock under this section when the holder and issuer of a covered debt instrument cease to be members of the same expanded group, either because the covered debt instrument is transferred to a person that is not a member of the expanded group that includes the issuer or because the holder or the issuer ceases to be a member of the same expanded group, or in the case of a holder that is a controlled partnership, when the holder ceases to be a controlled partnership with respect to the expanded group of which the issuer is a member, either because the partnership ceases to be a controlled partnership or because the issuer ceases to be a member of the same expanded group with respect to which the holder is a controlled partnership. In such a case, the covered debt instrument ceases to be treated as stock under this section. For this purpose, immediately before the transaction that causes the holder and issuer of the covered debt instrument to cease to be members of the same expanded group, or, if the holder is a controlled partnership, that causes the holder to cease to be a controlled partnership with respect to the expanded group of which the issuer is a member, the issuer is deemed to issue a new covered debt instrument to the holder in exchange for the covered debt instrument that was treated as stock in a transaction that is disregarded for purposes of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.


(ii) *Re-testing of covered debt instruments and certain distributions and acquisitions*—(A) *General rule.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, when paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section or § 1.385-4(c)(2) causes a covered debt instrument that previously was treated as stock pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section to cease to be treated as stock, all other covered debt instruments of the issuer that are not treated as stock on the date that the transaction occurs that causes paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section to apply are re-tested to determine whether those other covered debt instruments are treated as funding the distribution or acquisition that previously was treated as funded by the covered debt instrument that ceases to be treated as stock pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. In addition, a covered debt instrument that is issued after an application of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section and within the per se period may also be treated as funding that distribution or acquisition. See paragraph (h)(3) of this section, *Example 7,* for an illustration of this rule.


(B) *Re-testing upon a specified event with respect to a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership.* If, with respect to a covered member that is an expanded group partner and a debt instrument issued by the controlled partnership, there is reduction in the covered member's specified portion under § 1.385-3(f)(5)(i) by reason of a specified event, the covered member must re-test its debt instruments as described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.


(3) *Inapplicability of section 385(c)(1).* Section 385(c)(1) does not apply with respect to a covered debt instrument to the extent that it is treated as stock under this section.


(4) *Treatment of disregarded entities.* This paragraph (d)(4) applies to the extent that a covered debt instrument issued by a disregarded entity, the regarded owner of which is a covered member, would, absent the application of this paragraph (d)(4), be treated as stock under this section. In this case, rather than the covered debt instrument being treated as stock to such extent (applicable portion), the covered member that is the regarded owner of the disregarded entity is deemed to issue its stock in the manner described in this paragraph (d)(4). If the applicable portion otherwise would have been treated as stock under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, then the covered member is deemed to issue its stock to the expanded group member to which the covered debt instrument was, in form, issued (or transferred) in the transaction described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If the applicable portion otherwise would have been treated as stock under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, then the covered member is deemed to issue its stock to the holder of the covered debt instrument in exchange for a portion of the covered debt instrument equal to the applicable portion. In each case, the covered member that is the regarded owner of the disregarded entity is treated as the holder of the applicable portion of the debt instrument issued by the disregarded entity, and the actual holder is treated as the holder of the remaining portion of the covered debt instrument and the stock deemed to be issued by the regarded owner. Under Federal tax principles, the applicable portion of the debt instrument issued by the disregarded entity generally is disregarded. This paragraph (d)(4) must be applied in a manner that is consistent with the principles of paragraph (f)(4) of this section. Thus, for example, stock deemed issued is deemed to have the same terms as the covered debt instrument issued by the disregarded entity, other than the identity of the issuer, and payments on the stock are determined by reference to payments made on the covered debt instrument issued by the disregarded entity. See § 1.385-4(b)(3) for additional rules that apply if the regarded owner of the disregarded entity is a member of a consolidated group. If the regarded owner of a disregarded entity is a controlled partnership, then paragraph (f) of this section applies as though the controlled partnership were the issuer in form of the debt instrument.


(5) *Payments with respect to partially recharacterized covered debt instruments*—(i) *General rule.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section, a payment with respect to an instrument that is partially recharacterized as stock is treated as made pro rata to the portion treated as stock and to the portion treated as indebtedness.


(ii) *Special rule for payments not required pursuant to the terms of the instrument.* A payment with respect to an instrument that is partially recharacterized as stock and that is a payment that is not required to be made pursuant to the terms of the instrument (for example, a prepayment of principal) may be designated by the issuer and the holder as with respect to the portion treated as stock or to the portion treated as indebtedness, in whole or in part. In the absence of such designation, see paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section.


(6) *Treatment of a general rule transaction to which an exception applies.* To the extent a covered member would, absent the application of paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, be treated as making a distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, then, solely for purposes of applying paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the covered member is treated as issuing the covered debt instrument issued in the distribution or acquisition to a member of the covered member's expanded group in exchange for property.


(7) *Treatment for purposes of section 1504(a)*—(i) *Debt instruments treated as stock.* A covered debt instrument that is treated as stock under paragraph (b)(2), (3), or (4) of this section and that is not described in section 1504(a)(4) is not treated as stock for purposes of determining whether the issuer is a member of an affiliated group (within the meaning of section 1504(a)).


(ii) *Deemed partner stock and stock deemed issued by a regarded owner.* If deemed partner stock or stock that is deemed issued by a regarded owner under § 1.385-3(d)(4) is not described in section 1504(a)(4), then that stock is not treated as stock for purposes of determining whether the issuer of the stock is a member of an affiliated group (within the meaning of section 1504(a)).


(e) *No affirmative use.* [Reserved]


(f) *Treatment of controlled partnerships*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of this section and § 1.385-4, a controlled partnership is treated as an aggregate of its partners in the manner described in this paragraph (f). Paragraph (f)(2) of this section sets forth rules concerning the aggregate treatment when a controlled partnership acquires property from a member of the expanded group. Paragraph (f)(3) of this section sets forth rules concerning the aggregate treatment when a controlled partnership issues a debt instrument. Paragraph (f)(4) of this section deems a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership to be held by an expanded group partner rather than the holder-in-form in certain cases. Paragraph (f)(5) of this section sets forth the rules concerning events that cause the deemed results described in paragraph (f)(4) of this section to cease. Paragraph (f)(6) of this section exempts certain issuances of a controlled partnership's debt to a partner and a partner's debt to a controlled partnership from the application of this section. For definitions applicable for this section, see paragraph (g) of this section. For examples illustrating the application of this section, see paragraph (h) of this section.


(2) *Acquisitions of property by a controlled partnership*—(i) *Acquisitions of property when a member of the expanded group is a partner on the date of the acquisition*—(A) *Aggregate treatment.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (f)(2)(i)(C) and (f)(6) of this section, if a controlled partnership, with respect to an expanded group, acquires property from a member of the expanded group (transferor member), then, for purposes of this section, a member of the expanded group that is an expanded group partner on the date of the acquisition is treated as acquiring its share (as determined under paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section) of the property. The expanded group partner is treated as acquiring its share of the property from the transferor member in the manner (for example, in a distribution, in an exchange for property, or in an issuance), and on the date on which, the property is actually acquired by the controlled partnership from the transferor member. Accordingly, this section applies to a member's acquisition of property described in this paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) in the same manner as if the member actually acquired the property from the transferor member, unless explicitly provided otherwise.


(B) *Expanded group partner's share of property.* For purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section, a partner's share of property acquired by a controlled partnership is determined in accordance with the partner's liquidation value percentage (as defined in paragraph (g)(17) of this section) with respect to the controlled partnership. The liquidation value percentage is determined on the date on which the controlled partnership acquires the property.


(C) *Exception if transferor member is an expanded group partner.* If a transferor member is an expanded group partner in the controlled partnership, paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section does not apply to such partner.


(ii) *Acquisitions of expanded group stock when a member of the expanded group becomes a partner after the acquisition*—(A) *Aggregate treatment.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, if a controlled partnership, with respect to an expanded group, owns expanded group stock, and a member of the expanded group becomes an expanded group partner in the controlled partnership, then, for purposes of this section, the member is treated as acquiring its share (as determined under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) of the expanded group stock owned by the controlled partnership. The member is treated as acquiring its share of the expanded group stock on the date on which the member becomes an expanded group partner. Furthermore, the member is treated as if it acquires its share of the expanded group stock from a member of the expanded group in exchange for property other than expanded group stock, regardless of the manner in which the partnership acquired the stock and in which the member acquires its partnership interest. Accordingly, this section applies to a member's acquisition of expanded group stock described in this paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) in the same manner as if the member actually acquired the stock from a member of the expanded group in exchange for property other than expanded group stock, unless explicitly provided otherwise.


(B) *Expanded group partner's share of expanded group stock.* For purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, a partner's share of expanded group stock owned by a controlled partnership is determined in accordance with the partner's liquidation value percentage with respect to the controlled partnership. The liquidation value percentage is determined on the date on which a member of the expanded group becomes an expanded group partner in the controlled partnership.


(C) *Exception if an expanded group partner acquires its interest in a controlled partnership in exchange for expanded group stock.* Paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section does not apply to a member of an expanded group that acquires its interest in a controlled partnership either from another partner in exchange solely for expanded group stock or upon a partnership contribution to the controlled partnership comprised solely of expanded group stock.


(3) *Issuances of debt instruments by a controlled partnership to a member of an expanded group*—(i) *Aggregate treatment.* If a controlled partnership, with respect to an expanded group, issues a debt instrument to a member of the expanded group, then, for purposes of this section, a covered member that is an expanded group partner is treated as the issuer with respect to its share (as determined under paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section) of the debt instrument issued by the controlled partnership. This section applies to the portion of the debt instrument treated as issued by the covered member as described in this paragraph (f)(3)(i) in the same manner as if the covered member actually issued the debt instrument to the holder-in-form, unless otherwise provided. See paragraph (f)(4) of this section, which deems a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership to be held by an expanded group partner rather than the holder-in-form in certain cases.


(ii) *Expanded group partner's share of a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership*—(A) *General rule.* An expanded group partner's share of a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership is determined on each date on which the partner makes a distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section (testing date). An expanded group partner's share of a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership to a member of the expanded group is determined in accordance with the partner's issuance percentage (as defined in paragraph (g)(16) of this section) on the testing date. A partner's share determined under this paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) is adjusted as described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.


(B) *Additional rules if there is a specified portion with respect to a debt instrument*—(*1*) An expanded group partner's share (as determined under paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section) of a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership is reduced, but not below zero, by the sum of all of the specified portions (as defined in paragraph (g)(23) of this section), if any, with respect to the debt instrument that correspond to one or more deemed transferred receivables (as defined in paragraph (g)(8) of this section) that are deemed to be held by the partner.


(*2*) If the aggregate of all of the expanded group partners' shares (as determined under paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section and reduced under paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B)(*1*) of this section) of the debt instrument exceeds the adjusted issue price of the debt, reduced by the sum of all of the specified portions with respect to the debt instrument that correspond to one or more deemed transferred receivables that are deemed to be held by one or more expanded group partners (excess amount), then each expanded group partner's share (as determined under paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section and reduced under paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B)(*1*) of this section) of the debt instrument is reduced. The amount of an expanded group partner's reduction is the excess amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the partner's share, and the denominator of which is the aggregate of all of the expanded group partners' shares.


(iii) *Qualified short-term debt instrument.* The determination of whether a debt instrument is a qualified short-term debt instrument for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this section is made at the partnership-level without regard to paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section.


(4) *Recharacterization when there is a specified portion with respect to a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership*—(i) *General rule.* A specified portion, with respect to a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership and an expanded group partner, is not treated as stock under paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (f)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the holder-in-form (as defined in paragraph (g)(15) of this section) of the debt instrument is deemed to transfer a portion of the debt instrument (a deemed transferred receivable, as defined in paragraph (g)(8) of this section) with a principal amount equal to the adjusted issue price of the specified portion to the expanded group partner in exchange for stock in the expanded group partner (deemed partner stock, as defined in paragraph (g)(6) of this section) with a fair market value equal to the principal amount of the deemed transferred receivable. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(4)(vi) of this section (concerning the treatment of a deemed transferred receivable for purposes of section 752) and paragraph (f)(5) of this section (concerning specified events subsequent to the deemed transfer), the deemed transfer described in this paragraph (f)(4)(i) is deemed to occur for all Federal tax purposes.


(ii) *Expanded group partner is the holder-in-form of a debt instrument.* If the specified portion described in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section is with respect to an expanded group partner that is the holder-in-form of the debt instrument, then paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section will not apply with respect to that specified portion except that only the first sentence of paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section is applicable.


(iii) *Expanded group partner is a consolidated group member.* This paragraph (f)(4)(iii) applies when one or more expanded group partners is a member of a consolidated group that files (or is required to file) a consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return. In this case, notwithstanding § 1.385-4(b)(1) (which generally treats members of a consolidated group as one corporation for purposes of this section), the holder-in-form of the debt instrument issued by the controlled partnership is deemed to transfer the deemed transferred receivable or receivables to the expanded group partner or partners that are members of a consolidated group that make, or are treated as making under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the regarded distributions or acquisitions (within the meaning of § 1.385-4(e)(5)) described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section in exchange for deemed partner stock in such partner or partners. To the extent those regarded distributions or acquisitions are made by a member of the consolidated group that is not an expanded group partner (excess amount), the holder-in-form is deemed to transfer a portion of the deemed transferred receivable or receivables to each member of the consolidated group that is an expanded group partner in exchange for deemed partner stock in the expanded group partner. The portion is the excess amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of the consolidated group's share (as determined under paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section) of the debt instrument issued by the controlled partnership that would have been the expanded group partner's share if the partner was not a member of a consolidated group, and the denominator of which is the consolidated group's share of the debt instrument issued by the controlled partnership.


(iv) *Rules regarding deemed transferred receivables and deemed partner stock*—(A) *Terms of deemed partner stock.* Deemed partner stock has the same terms as the deemed transferred receivable with respect to the deemed transfer, other than the identity of the issuer.


(B) *Treatment of payments with respect to a debt instrument for which there is one or more deemed transferred receivables.* When a payment is made with respect to a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership for which there is one or more deemed transferred receivables, then, if the amount of the retained receivable (as defined in paragraph (g)(22) of this section) held by the holder-in-form is zero and a single deemed holder is deemed to hold all of the deemed transferred receivables, the entire payment is allocated to the deemed transferred receivables held by the single deemed holder. If the amount of the retained receivable held by the holder-in-form is greater than zero or there are multiple deemed holders of deemed transferred receivables, or both, the payment is apportioned among the retained receivable, if any, and each deemed transferred receivable in proportion to the principal amount of all the receivables. The portion of a payment allocated or apportioned to a retained receivable or a deemed transferred receivable reduces the principal amount of, or accrued interest with respect to, as applicable depending on the payment, the retained receivable or deemed transferred receivable. When a payment allocated or apportioned to a deemed transferred receivable reduces the principal amount of the receivable, the expanded group partner that is the deemed holder with respect to the deemed transferred receivable is deemed to redeem the same amount of deemed partner stock, and the specified portion with respect to the debt instrument is reduced by the same amount. When a payment allocated or apportioned to a deemed transferred receivable reduces accrued interest with respect to the receivable, the expanded group partner that is the deemed holder with respect to the deemed transferred receivable is deemed to make a matching distribution in the same amount with respect to the deemed partner stock. The controlled partnership is treated as the paying agent with respect to the deemed partner stock.


(v) *Holder-in-form transfers debt instrument in a transaction that is not a specified event.* If the holder-in-form transfers the debt instrument (which is disregarded for Federal tax purposes) to a member of the expanded group or a controlled partnership (and therefore the transfer is not a specified event described in paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(F) of this section), then, for Federal tax purposes, the holder-in-form is deemed to transfer the retained receivable and the deemed partner stock to the transferee.


(vi) *Allocation of deemed transferred receivable under section 752.* A partnership liability that is a debt instrument with respect to which there is one or more deemed transferred receivables is allocated for purposes of section 752 without regard to any deemed transfer.


(5) *Specified events affecting ownership following a deemed transfer*—(i) *General rule.* If a specified event (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(5)(iii) of this section) occurs with respect to a deemed transfer, then, immediately before the specified event, the expanded group partner that is both the issuer of the deemed partner stock and the deemed holder of the deemed transferred receivable is deemed to distribute the deemed transferred receivable (or portion thereof, as determined under paragraph (f)(5)(iv) of this section) to the holder-in-form in redemption of the deemed partner stock (or portion thereof, as determined under paragraph (f)(5)(iv) of this section) deemed to be held by the holder-in-form. The deemed distribution is deemed to occur for all Federal tax purposes, except that the distribution is disregarded for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section. Except when the deemed transferred receivable (or portion thereof, as determined under paragraph (f)(5)(iv) of this section) is deemed to be retransferred under paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section, the principal amount of the retained receivable held by the holder-in-form is increased by the principal amount of the deemed transferred receivable, the deemed transferred receivable ceases to exist for Federal tax purposes, and the specified portion (or portion thereof) that corresponds to the deemed transferred receivable (or portion thereof) ceases to be treated as a specified portion for purposes of this section.


(ii) *New deemed transfer when a specified event involves a transferee that is a covered member that is an expanded group partner.* If the specified event is described in paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(E) of this section, the holder-in-form of the debt instrument is deemed to retransfer the deemed transferred receivable (or portion thereof, as determined under paragraph (f)(5)(iv) of this section) that the holder-in-form is deemed to have received pursuant to paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section, to the transferee expanded group partner in exchange for deemed partner stock issued by the transferee expanded group partner with a fair market value equal to the principal amount of the deemed transferred receivable (or portion thereof) that is retransferred. For purposes of this section, this deemed transfer is treated in the same manner as a deemed transfer described in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section.


(iii) *Specified events.* A specified event, with respect to a deemed transfer, occurs when, immediately after the transaction and taking into account all related transactions:


(A) The controlled partnership that is the issuer of the debt instrument either ceases to be a controlled partnership or ceases to have an expanded group partner that is a covered member.


(B) The holder-in-form is a member of the expanded group immediately before the transaction, and the holder-in-form and the deemed holder cease to be members of the same expanded group for the reasons described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.


(C) The holder-in-form is a controlled partnership immediately before the transaction, and the holder-in-form ceases to be a controlled partnership.


(D) The expanded group partner that is both the issuer of deemed partner stock and the deemed holder transfers (directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships) all or a portion of its interest in the controlled partnership to a person that neither is a covered member nor a controlled partnership with an expanded group partner that is a covered member. If there is a transfer of only a portion of the interest, see paragraph (f)(5)(iv) of this section.


(E) The expanded group partner that is both the issuer of deemed partner stock and the deemed holder transfers (directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships) all or a portion of its interest in the controlled partnership to a covered member or a controlled partnership with an expanded group partner that is a covered member. If there is a transfer of only a portion of the interest, see paragraph (f)(5)(iv) of this section.


(F) The holder-in-form transfers the debt instrument (which is disregarded for Federal tax purposes) to a person that is neither a member of the expanded group nor a controlled partnership. See paragraph (f)(4)(v) of this section if the holder-in-form transfers the debt instrument to a member of the expanded group or a controlled partnership.


(iv) *Specified event involving a transfer of only a portion of an interest in a controlled partnership.* If, with respect to a specified event described in paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(D) or (E) of this section, an expanded group partner transfers only a portion of its interest in a controlled partnership, then, only a portion of the deemed transferred receivable that is deemed to be held by the expanded group partner is deemed to be distributed in redemption of an equal portion of the deemed partner stock. The portion of the deemed transferred receivable referred to in the preceding sentence is equal to the product of the entire principal amount of the deemed transferred receivable deemed to be held by the expanded group partner multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of the expanded group partner's capital account attributable to the interest that is transferred, and the denominator of which is the expanded group partner's capital account with respect to its entire interest, determined immediately before the specified event.


(6) *Issuance of a partnership's debt instrument to a partner and a partner's debt instrument to a partnership.* If a controlled partnership, with respect to an expanded group, issues a debt instrument to an expanded group partner, or if a covered member that is an expanded group partner issues a covered debt instrument to a controlled partnership, and in each case, no partner deducts or receives an allocation of expense with respect to the debt instrument, then this section does not apply to the debt instrument.


(g) *Definitions.* The definitions in this paragraph (g) apply for purposes of this section and §§ 1.385-3 and 1.385-4.


(1) *Asset reorganization.* The term asset reorganization means a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(A), (C), (D), (F), or (G).

The preceding sentence applies solely to the extent that—


(A) The dealer accounts for the debt instruments as securities held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business;


(B) The dealer disposes of the debt instruments (or the debt instruments mature) within a period of time that is consistent with the holding of the debt instruments for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, taking into account the terms of the debt instruments and the conditions and practices prevailing in the markets for similar debt instruments during the period in which it is held; and

(ii) A distribution of property in a complete liquidation under section 336(a) or 337(a).


(11) *Exempt exchange.* The term exempt exchange means an acquisition of expanded group stock in which either—

(iii) The transferor of the expanded group stock is an acquiring entity that is deemed to issue the stock in exchange for cash from an issuing corporation in a transaction described in § 1.1032-3(b).


(12) *Expanded group partner.* The term expanded group partner means, with respect to a controlled partnership of an expanded group, a member of the expanded group that is a partner (directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships).


(13) *Expanded group stock.* The term expanded group stock means, with respect to a member of an expanded group, stock of a member of the same expanded group.


(14) *Funded member.* The term funded member has the meaning provided in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.

Therefore, the term holder-in-form does not include a deemed holder (as defined in paragraph (g)(5) of this section).


(16) *Issuance percentage.* The term *issuance percentage* means, with respect to a controlled partnership and an expanded group partner, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the partner's reasonably anticipated distributive share of all the partnership's interest expense over a reasonable period, divided by all of the partnership's reasonably anticipated interest expense over that same period, taking into account any and all relevant facts and circumstances. The relevant facts and circumstances include, without limitation, the term of the debt instrument; whether the partnership anticipates issuing other debt instruments; and the partnership's anticipated section 704(b) income and expense, and the partners' respective anticipated allocation percentages, taking into account anticipated changes to those allocation percentages over time resulting, for example, from anticipated contributions, distributions, recapitalizations, or provisions in the controlled partnership agreement.

(ii) *Predecessor ceasing to be a member of the same expanded group as corporation.* The term predecessor does not include the distributing corporation described in paragraph (g)(20)(i)(B) of this section from the date that the distributing corporation ceases to be a member of the expanded group of which the controlled corporation is a member.


(iii) *Multiple predecessors.* A corporation may have more than one predecessor, including by reason of a predecessor of the corporation having a predecessor or successor. Accordingly, references to a corporation also include references to a predecessor or successor of a predecessor of the corporation.

(23) *Specified portion.* The term *specified portion* means, with respect to a debt instrument issued by a controlled partnership and a covered member that is an expanded group partner, the portion of the debt instrument that is treated under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section as issued on a testing date (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section) by the covered member and that, absent the application of paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, would be treated as stock under paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section on the testing date. A specified portion is reduced as described in paragraphs (f)(4)(iv)(B) and (f)(5)(i) of this section.


(24) *Successor*—(i) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g)(24)(iii) of this section, the term successor means, with respect to a corporation—


(A) The acquiring corporation in a transaction described in section 381(a) in which the corporation is the distributor or transferor corporation;


(B) A controlled corporation in a distribution or exchange to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 that relates to section 355) applies in which the corporation is the distributing corporation; or


(C) Subject to the rules in paragraph (g)(24)(ii) of this section, a seller in an acquisition described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section in which the corporation is the acquirer.


(ii) *Special rules for certain acquisitions of subsidiary stock.* The following rules apply with respect to a successor described in paragraph (g)(24)(i)(C) of this section:


(A) The seller is a successor to the acquirer only to the extent of the value (adjusted as described in paragraph (g)(24)(ii)(C) of this section) of the expanded group stock acquired from the seller in exchange for property (other than expanded group stock) in the acquisition described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section.


(B) A distribution or acquisition by either the seller or a successor seller to or from either the acquirer, the seller, or a successor seller is not treated as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section for purposes of applying paragraph (b)(3) of this section to a covered debt instrument of the acquirer. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term successor seller means a member of the expanded group that receives property (other than expanded group stock) in a distribution or acquisition from the seller or another successor seller and is controlled by the acquirer as determined under the principles of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. A successor seller is treated as a successor to the acquirer to the extent of the value of the property received in a distribution or acquisition described in the preceding sentence and, for purposes of applying this paragraph (g)(24)(ii)(B).


(C) To the extent that a covered debt instrument of the acquirer is treated as funding a distribution or acquisition by the seller or successor seller described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (C) of this section, or would be treated but for the exceptions described in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, the value of the expanded group stock described in paragraph (g)(24)(ii)(A) of this section is reduced by an amount equal to the distribution or acquisition for purposes of any further application of paragraph (g)(24)(ii)(A) of this section with respect to the acquirer and seller.


(iii) *Successor ceasing to be a member of the same expanded group as corporation.* The term successor does not include a controlled corporation described in paragraph (g)(24)(i)(B) of this section with respect to a distributing corporation or a seller described in paragraph (g)(24)(i)(C) of this section with respect to an acquirer from the date that the controlled corporation or the seller ceases to be a member of the expanded group of which the controlled corporation or acquirer, respectively, is a member.


(iv) *Multiple successors.* A corporation may have more than one successor, including by reason of a successor of the corporation having a predecessor or successor. Accordingly, references to a corporation also include references to a predecessor or successor of a successor of the corporation.


(25) *Taxable year.* The term taxable year refers to the taxable year of the issuer of the covered debt instrument.


(h) *Examples*—(1) *Assumed facts.* Except as otherwise stated, the following facts are assumed for purposes of the examples in paragraph (h)(3) of this section:


(i) FP is a foreign corporation that owns 100% of the stock of USS1, a covered member, 100% of the stock of USS2, a covered member, and 100% of the stock of FS, a foreign corporation;


(ii) USS1 owns 100% of the stock of DS, a covered member, and CFC, which is a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957;


(iii) At the beginning of Year 1, FP is the common parent of an expanded group comprised solely of FP, USS1, USS2, FS, DS, and CFC (the FP expanded group);


(iv) The FP expanded group has more than $50 million of covered debt instruments described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section at all times;


(v) No issuer of a covered debt instrument has a positive expanded group earnings account within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section or has received qualified contributions within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section;


(vi) All notes are covered debt instruments (as defined in paragraph (g)(3) of this section) and are not qualified short-term debt instruments (as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this section);


(vii) Each entity has as its taxable year the calendar year;


(viii) PRS is a partnership for federal income tax purposes;


(ix) No corporation is a member of a consolidated group;


(x) No domestic corporation is a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of section 897(c)(2);


(xi) Each note is issued with adequate stated interest (as defined in section 1274(c)(2)); and


(xii) Each transaction occurs after January 19, 2017.


(2) *No inference.* Except as otherwise provided in this section, it is assumed for purposes of the examples in paragraph (h)(3) of this section that the form of each transaction is respected for federal tax purposes. No inference is intended, however, as to whether any particular note would be respected as indebtedness or as to whether the form of any particular transaction described in an example in paragraph (h)(3) of this section would be respected for federal tax purposes.


(3) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the rules of this section.


(i) *Example 1. Distribution of a covered debt instrument*—(A) *Facts.* On Date A in Year 1, FS lends $100x to USS1 in exchange for USS1 Note A. On Date B in Year 2, USS1 issues USS1 Note B, which is has a value of $100x, to FP in a distribution.


(B) *Analysis.* USS1 Note B is a covered debt instrument that is issued by USS1 to FP, a member of the expanded group of which USS1 is a member, in a distribution. Accordingly, USS1 Note B is treated as stock under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, USS1 Note B is treated as stock when it is issued by USS1 to FP on Date B in Year 2. Accordingly, USS1 is treated as distributing USS1 stock to its shareholder FP in a distribution that is subject to section 305. Under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, because the distribution of USS1 Note B is described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the distribution of USS1 Note B is not treated as a distribution of property described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section. Accordingly, USS1 Note A is not treated as funding the distribution of USS1 Note B for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section.


(ii) *Example 2. Covered debt instrument issued for expanded group stock that is exchanged for stock in a corporation that is not a member of the same expanded group*—(A) *Facts.* UST is a publicly traded domestic corporation. On Date A in Year 1, USS1 issues USS1 Note to FP in exchange for FP stock. Subsequently, on Date B of Year 1, USS1 transfers the FP stock to UST's shareholders, which are not members of the FP expanded group, in exchange for all of the stock of UST.


(B) *Analysis.* (*1*) Because USS1 and FP are both members of the FP expanded group, USS1 Note is treated as stock when it is issued by USS1 to FP in exchange for FP stock on Date A in Year 1 under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (d)(1)(i) of this section. This result applies even though, pursuant to the same plan, USS1 transfers the FP stock to persons that are not members of the FP expanded group. The exchange of USS1 Note for FP stock is not an exempt exchange within the meaning of paragraph (g)(11) of this section.


(*2*) Because USS1 Note is treated as stock for federal tax purposes when it is issued by USS1, pursuant to section § 1.367(b)-10(a)(3)(ii) (defining property for purposes of § 1.367(b)-10) there is no potential application of § 1.367(b)-10(a) to USS1's acquisition of the FP stock.


(iii) *Example 3. Issuance of a note in exchange for expanded group stock*—(A) *Facts.* On Date A in Year 1, USS1 issues USS1 Note to FP in exchange for 40% of the FS stock owned by FP.


(B) *Analysis.* (*1*) Because USS1 and FP are both members of the FP expanded group, USS1 Note is treated as stock when it is issued by USS1 to FP in exchange for FS stock on Date A in Year 1 under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (d)(1)(i) of this section. The exchange of USS1 Note for FS stock is not an exempt exchange within the meaning of paragraph (g)(11) of this section.


(*2*) Because USS1 Note is treated as stock for federal tax purposes when it is issued by USS1, USS1 Note is not treated as property for purposes of section 304(a) because it is not property within the meaning specified in section 317(a). Therefore, USS1's acquisition of FS stock from FP in exchange for USS1 Note is not an acquisition described in section 304(a)(1).


(iv) *Example 4. Funding occurs in same taxable year as distribution*—(A) *Facts.* On Date A in Year 1, FP lends $200x to DS in exchange for DS Note A. On Date B in Year 1, DS distributes $400x of cash to USS1 in a distribution.


(B) *Analysis.* Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, DS Note A is treated as funding the distribution by DS to USS1 because DS Note A is issued to a member of the FP expanded group during the per se period with respect to DS's distribution to USS1. Accordingly, under paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) and (d)(1)(ii) of this section, DS Note A is treated as stock on Date B in Year 1.


(v) *Example 5. Additional funding*—(A) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(iv)(A) of this section (*Example 4*), except that, in addition, on Date C in Year 2, FP lends an additional $300x to DS in exchange for DS Note B.


(B) *Analysis.* The analysis is the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(iv)(B) of this section (*Example 4*) with respect to DS Note A. DS Note B is also issued to a member of the FP expanded group during the per se period with respect to DS's distribution to USS1. Under paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A) and (b)(6) of this section, DS Note B is treated as funding only the remaining portion of DS's distribution to USS1, which is $200x. Accordingly, $200x of DS Note B is treated as stock under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, $200x of DS Note B is treated as stock when it is issued by DS to FP on Date C in Year 2. The remaining $100x of DS Note B continues to be treated as indebtedness.


(vi) *Example 6. Funding involving multiple interests*—(A) *Facts.* On Date A in Year 1, FP lends $300x to USS1 in exchange for USS1 Note A. On Date B in Year 2, USS1 distributes $300x of cash to FP. On Date C in Year 3, FP lends another $300x to USS1 in exchange for USS1 Note B.


(B) *Analysis.* (*1*) Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, USS1 Note A is tested under paragraph (b)(3) of this section before USS1 Note B is tested. USS1 Note A is issued during the per se period with respect to USS1's $300x distribution to FP and, therefore, is treated as funding the distribution under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section. Beginning on Date B in Year 2, USS1 Note A is treated as stock under paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) and (d)(1)(ii) of this section.


(*2*) Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, USS1 Note B is tested under paragraph (b)(3) of this section after USS1 Note A is tested. Because USS1 Note A is treated as funding the entire $300x distribution by USS1 to FP, USS1 Note B will continue to be treated as indebtedness. See paragraph (b)(6) of this section.


(vii) *Example 7. Re-testing*—(A) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(vi)(A) of this section (*Example 6*), except that on Date D in Year 4, FP sells USS1 Note A to Bank.


(B) *Analysis.* (*1*) Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, USS1 Note A ceases to be treated as stock when FP sells USS1 Note A to Bank on Date D in Year 4. Immediately before FP sells USS1 Note A to Bank, USS1 is deemed to issue a debt instrument to FP in exchange for USS1 Note A in a transaction that is disregarded for purposes of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.


(*2*) Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, after USS1 Note A is deemed exchanged for a new debt instrument, USS1's other covered debt instruments that are not treated as stock as of Date D in Year 4 (USS1 Note B) are re-tested for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section to determine whether the instruments are treated as funding the $300x distribution by USS1 to FP on Date B in Year 2. USS1 Note B was issued by USS1 to FP during the per se period. Accordingly, USS1 Note B is re-tested under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, USS1 Note B is treated as funding the distribution on Date C in Year 3 and, accordingly, is treated as stock under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section. USS1 Note B is deemed to be exchanged for stock on Date D in Year 4, the re-testing date, under paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section. See § 1.385-1(d) for rules regarding the treatment of this deemed exchange.


(viii) *Example 8. Distribution of expanded group stock and covered debt instrument in a reorganization that qualifies under section 355*—(A) *Facts.* On Date A in Year 1, FP lends $200x to USS2 in exchange for USS2 Note. In a transaction that is treated as independent from the transaction on Date A in Year 1, on Date B in Year 2, USS2 transfers a portion of its assets to DS2, a newly formed domestic corporation, in exchange for all of the stock of DS2 and DS2 Note. Immediately afterwards, USS2 distributes all of the DS2 stock and the DS2 Note to FP with respect to FP's USS2 stock in a transaction that qualifies under section 355. USS2's transfer of a portion of its assets to DS2 qualifies as a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D). The DS2 stock has a value of $150x and DS2 Note has a value of $50x. The DS2 stock is not non-qualified preferred stock as defined in section 351(g)(2). Absent the application of this section, DS2 Note would be treated by FP as other property within the meaning of section 356.


(B) *Analysis.* (*1*) The contribution and distribution transaction is a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D) involving a transfer of property by USS2 to DS2 in exchange for DS2 stock and DS2 Note. The transfer of property by USS2 to DS2 is a contribution of excluded property described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(D)(*2*) of this section and an excluded contribution described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E)(*2*) of this section. Accordingly, USS2's contribution of property to DS2 is not a qualified contribution described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.


(*2*) DS2 Note is a covered debt instrument that is issued by DS2 to USS2, both members of the FP expanded group, in exchange for property of USS2 in an asset reorganization (as defined in paragraph (g)(1) of this section), and received by FP, another FP expanded group member immediately before the reorganization, as other property with respect to FP's USS2 stock. Accordingly, the transaction is described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, and DS2 Note is treated as stock when it is issued by DS2 to USS2 on Date B in Year 2 pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2)(iii) and (d)(1)(i) of this section.


(*3*) Because the issuance of DS2 Note by DS2 in exchange for the property of USS2 in an asset reorganization is described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the distribution and acquisition of DS2 Note by USS2 is not treated as a distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. Accordingly, USS2 Note is not treated as funding the distribution of DS2 Note for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.


(*4*) USS2's acquisition of DS2 stock is not an acquisition described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section because it is an exempt exchange (as defined in paragraph (g)(11) of this section). USS2's acquisition of DS2 stock is an exempt exchange because USS2 and DS2 are both parties to a reorganization that is an asset reorganization, section 1032 applies to DS2, the transferor of the expanded group stock, and the DS2 stock is distributed by USS2, the transferee of the expanded group stock, pursuant to the plan of reorganization.


(*5*) USS2's distribution of $150x of the DS2 stock is a distribution of stock that is permitted to be received by FP without recognition of gain under section 355(a)(1). Accordingly, USS2's distribution of the DS2 stock (other than the DS2 Note) to FP is an exempt distribution, and is not described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section.


(*6*) Because USS2 has not made a distribution or acquisition that is described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A), (B), or (C) of this section, USS2 Note is not treated as stock.


(ix) *Example 9. Funding a distribution by a successor to funded member*—(A) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in *Example 8* of this paragraph (h)(3), except that on Date C in Year 3, DS2 distributes $200x of cash to FP and, subsequently, on Date D in Year 3, USS2 distributes $100x of cash to FP.


(B) *Analysis.* (*1*) USS2 is a predecessor of DS2 under paragraph (g)(20)(i)(B) of this section and DS2 is a successor to USS2 under paragraph (g)(24)(i)(B) of this section because USS2 is the distributing corporation and DS2 is the controlled corporation in a distribution to which section 355 applies. Accordingly, under paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section, a distribution by DS2 is treated as a distribution by USS2. Under paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A) and (b)(3)(v)(B) of this section, USS2 Note is treated as funding the distribution by DS2 to FP because USS2 Note was issued during the per se period with respect to DS2's $200x cash distribution, and because both the issuance of USS2 Note and the distribution by DS2 occur during the per se period with respect to the section 355 distribution. Accordingly, under paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) and (d)(1)(ii) of this section, USS2 Note is treated as stock beginning on Date C in Year 3. See § 1.385-1(d) for rules regarding the treatment of this deemed exchange.


(*2*) Because the entire amount of USS2 Note is treated as funding DS2's $200x distribution to FP, under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, USS2 Note is not treated as funding the subsequent distribution by USS2 on Date D in Year 3.


(x) *Example 10. Asset reorganization; section 354 qualified property*—(A) *Facts.* On Date A in Year 1, FS lends $100x to USS2 in exchange for USS2 Note. On Date B in Year 2, in a transaction that qualifies as a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D), USS2 transfers all of its assets to USS1 in exchange for stock of USS1 and the assumption by USS1 of all of the liabilities of USS2, and USS2 distributes to FP, with respect to FP's USS2 stock, all of the USS1 stock that USS2 receives. FP does not recognize gain under section 354(a)(1).


(B) *Analysis.* (*1*) USS1 is a successor to USS2 under paragraph (g)(24)(i)(A) of this section. For purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, USS2 and, under paragraph (b)(3)(v)(A) of this section, its successor, USS1, are funded members with respect to USS2 Note. Although USS2, a funded member, distributes property (USS1 stock) to its shareholder, FP, pursuant to the reorganization, the distribution of USS1 stock is not described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section because the stock is distributed in an exempt distribution (as defined in paragraph (g)(10) of this section). In addition, neither USS1's acquisition of the assets of USS2 nor USS2's acquisition of USS1 stock is described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(C) of this section because FP does not receive other property within the meaning of section 356 with respect to its stock in USS2.


(*2*) USS2's acquisition of USS1 stock is not an acquisition described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section because it is an exempt exchange (as defined in paragraph (g)(11) of this section). USS2's acquisition of USS1 stock is an exempt exchange because USS1 and USS2 are both parties to an asset reorganization, section 1032 applies to USS1, the transferor of the USS1 stock, and the USS1 stock is distributed by USS2, the transferee, pursuant to the plan of reorganization. Furthermore, USS2's acquisition of its own stock from FS is not an acquisition described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section because USS2 acquires its stock in exchange for USS1 stock.


(*3*) Because neither USS1 nor USS2 has made a distribution or acquisition described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A), (B), or (C) of this section, USS2 Note is not treated as stock under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section.


(xi) *Example 11. Distribution of a covered debt instrument and issuance of a covered debt instrument with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of this section*—(A) *Facts.* On Date A in Year 1, USS1 issues USS1 Note A, which has a value of $100x, to FP in a distribution. On Date B in Year 1, with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of this section, FP sells USS1 Note A to Bank for $100x of cash and lends $100x to USS1 in exchange for USS1 Note B.


(B) *Analysis.* USS1 Note A is a covered debt instrument that is issued by USS1 to FP, a member of USS1's expanded group, in a distribution. Accordingly, under paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (d)(1)(i) of this section, USS1 Note A is treated as stock when it is issued by USS1 to FP on Date A in Year 1. Accordingly, USS1 is treated as distributing USS1 stock to FP. Because the distribution of USS1 Note A is described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the distribution of USS1 Note A is not described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section under paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, USS1 Note A ceases to be treated as stock when FP sells USS1 Note A to Bank on Date B in Year 1. Immediately before FP sells USS1 Note A to Bank, USS1 is deemed to issue a debt instrument to FP in exchange for USS1 Note A in a transaction that is disregarded for purposes of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3)(i) of this section. USS1 Note B is not treated as stock under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section because the funded member, USS1, has not made a distribution of property. However, because the transactions occurring on Date B of Year 1 were undertaken with a principal purpose of avoiding the purposes of this section, USS1 Note B is treated as stock on Date B of Year 1 under paragraph (b)(4) of this section.


(xii) *Example 12: Distribution of a covered debt instrument to a controlled partnership*—(A) *Facts.* CFC and FS are equal partners in PRS. PRS owns 100% of the stock in X Corp, a domestic corporation. On Date A in Year 1, X Corp issues X Note to PRS in a distribution.


(B) *Analysis.* (*1*) Under § 1.385-1(c)(4), in determining whether X Corp is a member of the FP expanded group that includes CFC and FS, CFC and FS are each treated as owning 50% of the X Corp stock held by PRS. Accordingly, 100% of X Corp's stock is treated as owned by CFC and FS, and X Corp is a member of the FP expanded group.


(*2*) Together CFC and FS own 100% of the interests in PRS capital and profits, such that PRS is a controlled partnership under § 1.385-1(c)(1). CFC and FS are both expanded group partners on the date on which PRS acquired X Note. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section, each of CFC and FS is treated as acquiring its share of X Note in the same manner (in this case, by a distribution of X Note), and on the date on which, PRS acquired X Note. Likewise, X Corp is treated as issuing to each of CFC and FS its share of X Note. Under paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section, each of CFC's and FS's share of X Note, respectively, is determined in accordance with its liquidation value percentage determined on Date A in Year 1, the date X Corp distributed X Note to PRS. On Date A in Year 1, pursuant to paragraph (g)(17) of this section, each of CFC's and FS's liquidation value percentages is 50%. Accordingly, on Date A in Year 1, under paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section, for purposes of this section, CFC and FS are each treated as acquiring 50% of X Note in a distribution.


(*3*) Under paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (d)(1)(i) of this section, X Note is treated as stock on the date of issuance, which is Date A in Year 1. Under paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section, each of CFC and FS are treated as acquiring 50% of X Note in a distribution for purposes of this section. Therefore, X Corp is treated as distributing its stock to PRS in a distribution described in section 305.


(xiii) *Example 13: Loan to a controlled partnership; proportionate distributions by expanded group partners*—(A) *Facts.* DS, USS2, and USP are partners in PRS. USP is a domestic corporation that is not a member of the FP expanded group. Each of DS and USS2 own 45% of the interests in PRS profits and capital, and USP owns 10% of the interests in PRS profits and capital. The PRS partnership agreement provides that all items of PRS income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit are allocated in accordance with the percentages in the preceding sentence. On Date A in Year 1, FP lends $200x to PRS in exchange for PRS Note with stated principal amount of $200x, which is payable at maturity. PRS Note also provides for annual payments of interest that are qualified stated interest. PRS uses all $200x in its business and does not distribute any money or other property to a partner. Subsequently, on Date B in Year 1, DS distributes $90x to USS1, USS2 distributes $90x to FP, and USP distributes $20x to its shareholder. Each of DS's and USS2's issuance percentage is 45% on Date B in Year 1, the date of the distributions and therefore a testing date under paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.


(B) *Analysis.* (*1*) DS and USS2 together own 90% of the interests in PRS profits and capital and therefore PRS is a controlled partnership under § 1.385-1(c)(1). Under § 1.385-1(c)(2), each of DS and USS2 is a covered member.


(*2*) Under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, each of DS and USS2 is treated as issuing its share of PRS Note, and under paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, DS's and USS2's share is each $90x (45% of $200x). USP is not an expanded group partner and therefore has no issuance percentage and is not treated as issuing any portion of PRS Note.


(*3*) The $90x distributions made by DS to USS1 and by USS2 to FP are described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, the portions of PRS Note treated as issued by each of DS and USS2 are treated as funding the distribution made by DS and USS2 because the distributions occurred within the per se period with respect to PRS Note. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the portions of PRS Note treated as issued by each of DS and USS2 would, absent the application of paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, be treated as stock of DS and USS2 on Date B in Year 1, the date of the distributions. See paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(23) of this section, each of the $90x portions is a specified portion.


(*4*) Under paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, the specified portions are not treated as stock under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. Instead, FP is deemed to transfer a portion of PRS Note with a principal amount equal to $90x (the adjusted issue price of the specified portion with respect to DS) to DS in exchange for deemed partner stock in DS with a fair market value of $90x. Similarly, FP is deemed to transfer a portion of PRS Note with a principal amount equal to $90x (the adjusted issue price of the specified portion with respect to USS2) to USS2 in exchange for deemed partner stock in USS2 with a fair market value of $90x. The principal amount of the retained receivable held by FP is $20x ($200x−$90x−$90x).


(xiv) *Example 14: Loan to a controlled partnership; disproportionate distributions by expanded group partners*—(A) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(xiii)(A) of this section (*Example 13*), except that on Date B in Year 1, DS distributes $45x to USS1 and USS2 distributes $135x to FP.


(B) *Analysis.* (*1*) The analysis is the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(xiii)(B)(*1*) of this section (*Example 13*).


(*2*) The analysis is the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(xiii)(B)(*2*) of this section (*Example 13*).


(*3*) The $45x and $135x distributions made by DS to USS1 and by USS2 to FP, respectively, are described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, the portion of PRS Note treated as issued by DS is treated as funding the distribution made by DS because the distribution occurred within the per se period with respect to PRS Note, but under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, only to the extent of DS's $45x distribution. USS2 is treated as issuing $90x of PRS Note, all of which is treated as funding $90x of USS2's $135x distribution under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, absent the application of paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, $45x of PRS Note would be treated as stock of DS and $90x of PRS Note would be treated as stock of USS2 on Date B in Year 1, the date of the distributions. See paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(23) of this section, $45x of PRS Note is a specified portion with respect to DS and $90x of PRS Note is a specified portion with respect to USS2.


(*4*) Under paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, the specified portions are not treated as stock under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. Instead, FP is deemed to transfer a portion of PRS Note with a principal amount equal to $45x (the adjusted issue price of the specified portion with respect to DS) to DS in exchange for stock of DS with a fair market value of $90x. Similarly, FP is deemed to transfer a portion of PRS Note with a principal amount equal to $90x (the adjusted issue price of the specified portion with respect to USS2) to USS2 in exchange for stock of USS2 with a fair market value of $90x. The principal amount of the retained receivable held by FP is $65x ($200x−$45x−$90x).


(xv) *Example 15: Loan to partnership; distribution in later year*—(A) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(xiii)(A) of this section (*Example 13*), except that USS2 does not distribute $90x to FP until Date C in Year 2, which is less than 36 months after Date A in Year 1. On Date C in Year 2, DS's, USS2's, and USP's issuance percentages under paragraph (g)(16) of this section are unchanged at 45%, 45%, and 10%, respectively.


(B) *Analysis.* (*1*) The analysis is the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(xiii)(B)(*1*) of this section (*Example 13*).


(*2*) The analysis is the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(xiii)(B)(*2*) of this section (*Example 13*).


(*3*) With respect to the distribution made by DS, the analysis is the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(xiii)(B)(*3*) of this section (*Example 13*).


(*4*) With respect to the deemed transfer to DS, the analysis is the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(xiii)(B)(*4*) of this section (*Example 13*). Accordingly, the amount of the retained receivable held by FP as of Date B in Year 1 is $110x ($200x−$90x).


(*5*) Under paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, USS2's share of PRS Note is determined on Date C in Year 2. On Date C in Year 2, DS's, USS2's, and USP's respective shares of PRS Note under paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section are $90x, $90x, and $20x. However, because DS is treated as the issuer with respect to a $90x specified portion of PRS Note, DS's share of PRS Note is reduced by $90x to $0 under paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B)(*1*) of this section. No reduction to either of USS2's or USP's share of PRS Note is required under paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B)(*2*) of this section because the aggregate of DS's, USS2's, and USP's shares of PRS Note as reduced is $110x (DS has a $0 share, USS2 has a $90x share, and USP has a $20x share), which does not exceed $110x (the $200x adjusted issue price of PRS Note reduced by the $90x specified portion with respect to DS). Under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, USS2 is treated as issuing its share of PRS Note.


(*6*) The $90x distribution made by USS2 to FP is described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, the portion of PRS Note treated as issued by USS2 is treated as funding the distribution made by USS2, because the distribution occurred within the per se period with respect to PRS Note. Accordingly, the portion of PRS Note treated as issued by USS2 would, absent the application of paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, be treated as stock of USS2 under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section on Date C in Year 2. See paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(23) of this section, the $90x portion is a specified portion.


(*7*) Under paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, the specified portion of PRS Note treated as issued by USS2 is not treated as stock under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. Instead, on Date C in Year 2, FP is deemed to transfer a portion of PRS Note with a principal amount equal to $90x (the adjusted issue price of the specified portion with respect to USS2) to USS2 in exchange for stock in USS2 with a fair market value of $90x. The principal amount of the retained receivable held by FP is reduced from $110x to $20x.


(xvi) *Example 16: Loan to a controlled partnership; partnership ceases to be a controlled partnership*—(A) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(xiii)(A) of this section (*Example 13*), except that on Date C in Year 4, USS2 sells its entire interest in PRS to an unrelated person.


(B) *Analysis.* (*1*) On date C in Year 4, PRS ceases to be a controlled partnership with respect to the FP expanded group under § 1.385-1(c)(1). This is the case because DS, the only remaining partner that is a member of the FP expanded group, only owns 45% of the total interest in PRS profits and capital. Because PRS ceases to be a controlled partnership, a specified event (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(A) of this section) occurs with respect to the deemed transfers with respect to each of DS and USS2.


(*2*) Under paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section, on Date C in Year 4, immediately before PRS ceases to be a controlled partnership, each of DS and USS2 is deemed to distribute its deemed transferred receivable to FP in redemption of FP's deemed partner stock in DS and USS2. The specified portion that corresponds to each of the deemed transferred receivables ceases to be treated as a specified portion. Furthermore, the deemed transferred receivables cease to exist, and the retained receivable held by FP increases from $20x to $200x.


(xvii) *Example 17: Transfer of an interest in a partnership to a covered member*—(A) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(3)(xiii)(A) of this section (*Example 13*), except that on Date C in Year 4, USS2 sells its entire interest in PRS to USS1.


(B) *Analysis.* (*1*) After USS2 sells its interest in PRS to USS1, DS and USS1 together own 90% of the interests in PRS profits and capital and therefore PRS continues to be a controlled partnership under § 1.385-1(c)(1). A specified event (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(E) of this section) occurs as result of the sale only with respect to the deemed transfer with respect to USS2.


(*2*) Under paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section, on Date C in Year 4, immediately before USS2 sells its entire interest in PRS to USS1, USS2 is deemed to distribute its deemed transferred receivable to FP in redemption of FP's deemed partner stock in USS2. Because the specified event is described in paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(E) of this section, under paragraph (f)(5)(ii) of this section, FP is deemed to retransfer the deemed transferred receivable deemed received from USS2 to USS1 in exchange for deemed partner stock in USS1 with a fair market value equal to the principal amount of the deemed transferred receivable that is retransferred to USS1.


(xviii) *Example 18: Loan to partnership and all partners are members of a consolidated group*—(A) *Facts.* USS1 and DS are equal partners in PRS. USS1 and DS are members of a consolidated group, as defined in § 1.1502-1(h). The PRS partnership agreement provides that all items of PRS income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit are allocated equally between USS1 and DS. On Date A in Year 1, FP lends $200x to PRS in exchange for PRS Note. PRS uses all $200x in its business and does not distribute any money or other property to any partner. On Date B in Year 1, DS distributes $200x to USS1, and USS1 distributes $200x to FP. If neither of USS1 or DS were a member of the consolidated group, each would have an issuance percentage under paragraph (g)(16) of this section, determined as of Date A in Year 1, of 50%.


(B) *Analysis.* (*1*) Pursuant to § 1.385-4(b)(6), PRS is treated as a partnership for purposes of this section. Under § 1.385-4(b)(1), DS and USS1 are treated as one corporation for purposes of this section, and thus a single covered member under § 1.385-1(c)(2). For purposes of this section, the single covered member owns 100% of the PRS profits and capital and therefore PRS is a controlled partnership under § 1.385-1(c)(1). Under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, the single covered member is treated as issuing all $200x of PRS Note to FP, a member of the same expanded group as the single covered member. DS's distribution to USS1 is a disregarded distribution because it is a distribution between members of a consolidated group that is disregarded under the one-corporation rule described in § 1.385-4(b)(1). However, under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, PRS Note, treated as issued by the single covered member, is treated as funding the distribution by USS1 to FP, which is described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section and which is a regarded distribution. Accordingly, PRS Note, absent the application of paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, would be treated as stock under paragraph (b) of this section on Date B in Year 1. Thus, pursuant to paragraph (g)(23) of this section, the entire PRS Note is a specified portion.


(*2*) Under paragraphs (f)(4)(i) and (iii) of this section, the specified portion is not treated as stock and, instead, FP is deemed to transfer PRS Note with a principal amount equal to $200x to USS1 in exchange for stock of USS1 with a fair market value of $200x. Under paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section, FP is deemed to transfer PRS Note to USS1 because only USS1 made a regarded distribution described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.


(xix) *Example 19: Loan to a disregarded entity*—(A) *Facts.* DS owns DRE, a disregarded entity within the meaning of § 1.385-1(c)(3). On Date A in Year 1, FP lends $200x to DRE in exchange for DRE Note. Subsequently, on Date B in Year 1, DS distributes $100x of cash to USS1.


(B) *Analysis.* Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, $100x of DRE Note would be treated as funding the distribution by DS to USS1 because DRE Note is issued to a member of the FP expanded group during the per se period with respect to DS's distribution to USS1. Accordingly, under paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) and (d)(1)(ii) of this section, $100x of DRE Note would be treated as stock on Date B in Year 1. However, under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, DS, as the regarded owner, within the meaning of § 1.385-1(c)(5), of DRE is deemed to issue its stock to FP in exchange for a portion of DRE Note equal to the $100x applicable portion (as defined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section). Thus, DS is treated as the holder of $100x of DRE Note, which is disregarded, and FP is treated as the holder of the remaining $100x of DRE Note. The $100x of stock deemed issued by DS to FP has the same terms as DRE Note, other than the issuer, and payments on the stock are determined by reference to payments on DRE Note.


(i) [Reserved]


(j) *Applicability date and transition rules*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (j)(2) or (3) or (k) of this section, this section applies to taxable years ending on or after January 19, 2017.


(2) *Transition rules*—(i) *Transition rule for covered debt instruments that would be treated as stock in taxable years ending before January 19, 2017.* If paragraphs (b) and (d)(1) of this section, taking into account §§ 1.385-1, 1.385-3, and 1.385-4, would have treated a covered debt instrument as stock in a taxable year ending before January 19, 2017 but for the application of paragraph (j)(1) of this section, to the extent that the covered debt instrument is held by a member of the expanded group of which the issuer is a member immediately after January 19, 2017, then the covered debt instrument is deemed to be exchanged for stock immediately after January 19, 2017.


(ii) *Transition rule for certain covered debt instruments treated as stock in taxable years ending on or after* January 19, 2017. If paragraphs (b) and (d)(1) of this section, taking into account §§ 1.385-1, 1.385-3, and 1.385-4, would treat a covered debt instrument as stock on or before January 19, 2017 but in a taxable year ending on or after January 19, 2017, that covered debt instrument is not treated as stock during the 90-day period after October 21, 2016. Instead, to the extent that the covered debt instrument is held by a member of the expanded group of which the issuer is a member immediately after January 19, 2017, the covered debt instrument is deemed to be exchanged for stock immediately after January 19, 2017.


(iii) *Transition funding rule.* When a covered debt instrument would be recharacterized as stock after April 4, 2016, and on or before January 19, 2017 (the *transition period*), but that covered debt instrument is not recharacterized as stock on such date due to the application of paragraph (j)(1), (j)(2)(i), or (j)(2)(ii) of this section, any payments made with respect to such covered debt instrument (other than stated interest), including pursuant to a refinancing, after the date that the covered debt instrument would have been recharacterized as stock and through the remaining portion of the transition period are treated as distributions for purposes of applying paragraph (b)(3) of this section for taxable years ending on or after January 19, 2017. In addition, to the extent that the holder and the issuer of the covered debt instrument cease to be members of the same expanded group during the transition period, the distribution or acquisition that would have caused the covered debt instrument to be treated as stock is available to be treated as funded by other covered debt instruments of the issuer for purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section (to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section). The prior sentence is applied in a manner that is consistent with the rules set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.


(iv) *Coordination between the general rule and funding rule.* When a covered debt instrument would be recharacterized as stock pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section after April 4, 2016, and on or before January 19, 2017, but that covered debt instrument is not recharacterized as stock on such date due to the application of paragraph (j)(1), (j)(2)(i), or (j)(2)(ii) of this section, the issuance of such covered debt instrument is not treated as a distribution or acquisition described in § 1.385-3(b)(3)(i), but only to the extent that the covered debt instrument is held by a member of the expanded group of which the issuer is a member immediately after January 19, 2017.


(v) *Option to apply proposed regulations.* In lieu of applying §§ 1.385-1, 1.385-3, and 1.385-4, taxpayers may apply the provisions matching §§ 1.385-1, 1.385-3, and 1.385-4 from the Internal Revenue Bulletin (IRB) 2016-17 (*https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-irbs/irb16-17.pdf*) to all debt instruments issued by a particular issuer (and members of its expanded group that are covered members) after April 4, 2016, and before October 13, 2016, solely for purposes of determining whether a debt instrument is treated as stock, provided that those sections are consistently applied.


(3) *Paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section.* Paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section applies to taxable years for which the U.S. Federal income tax return is due, without extensions, after May 14, 2020. For taxable years ending on or after January 19, 2017, and for which the U.S. Federal income tax return is due, without extensions, on or before May 14, 2020, see § 1.385-3T(f)(4)(iii), as contained in 26 CFR in part 1 in effect on April 1, 2019. In the case of a taxable year that ends after October 13, 2019, and on or before May 14, 2020, a taxpayer may choose to apply paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section to the portion of the taxable year that occurs after the expiration of § 1.385-3T on October 13, 2019, provided that all members of the taxpayer's expanded group apply such paragraph.


(k) *Additional transition rules.* See transition rules in § 1.385-3T(k)(2) as contained in 26 CFR in part 1 in effect on April 1, 2019.
