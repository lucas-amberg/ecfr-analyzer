# § 1.585-4   Reorganizations and asset acquisitions.

(a) *In general.* In computing a reasonable addition to the reserve for losses on loans for the first taxable year ending after a transaction to which section 381(a) applies and for subsequent taxable years, the separate reserves for losses on loans, the amount of loans outstanding, the total bad debts sustained (adjusted for recoveries), and the amount of eligible loans outstanding of the distributor or transferor corporation and the acquiring corporation (or, in the case of a consolidation, the transferor corporations) shall be combined for all applicable years. Thus, for example, in applying § 1.585-2(c)(1)(i) for the first taxable year ending after the distribution or transfer, the total bad debts sustained during the 5 preceding taxable years are the sum of the bad debts sustained by the acquiring corporation for the 5 preceding taxable years and bad debts sustained by the distributor or transferor corporation for the taxable year ending on the date of distribution or transfer and the 4 preceding taxable years.


(b) *Base year and base year amounts of acquiring corporation*—(1) *Base year.* For transactions to which section 381(a) applies, the base year of the acquiring corporation for the first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer shall be the last taxable year ending on or before the date of distribution or transfer. The balance of the reserve, the amount of loans outstanding, and the amount of eligible loans outstanding at the close of such base year shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph. For taxable years subsequent to the first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer, the base year of the acquiring corporation shall be the more recent of the base year provided by the first sentence of this subparagraph or the base year provided by § 1.585-2(e)(1). If § 1.585-2(e)(1) provides the more recent base year, the balance of the reserve for losses on loans, the amount of loans outstanding, and the amount of eligible loans outstanding shall be determined at the close of such base year without regard to this paragraph.


(2) *Base year amounts*—(i) *Method of determination.* The balance of the reserve for losses on loans, the amount of loans outstanding, and the amount of eligible loans outstanding at the close of the base year provided by the first sentence of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be the total of such amounts of the distributor or transferor corporation and the acquiring corporation (or, in the case of a consolidation, the transferor corporations) at the close of what would have been their respective base years determined under § 1.585-2(e)(1) if the distribution or transfer to which section 381(a) applies had not occurred, except that the method (experience or percentage) used or adopted by the acquiring corporation to determine its reasonable addition to a reserve for losses on loans for the first taxable year ending after the date of the distribution or transfer shall be considered to be the method that the distributor or transferor corporation (or, in the case of a consolidation, that the transferor corporation) would have used or adopted for its first taxable year ending after the date of distribution or transfer if the distribution or transfer had not occurred.


(ii) *Examples.* The application of the rule provided by this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:
