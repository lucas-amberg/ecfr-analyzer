# § 1.281-4   Taxable years affected.

(a) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the provisions of section 281 and §§ 1.281-2 and 1.281-3 shall apply to all taxable years to which either the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 apply. 


(b) *Taxable years ending before October 23, 1962.* (1)(i) In the case of a taxable year of a terminal railroad corporation ending before October 23, 1962, section 281 (a) shall apply only to the extent that the terminal railroad corporation (*a*) computed its taxable income on its return for such taxable year as if the “reduced amount”, described in paragraph (c) of § 1.281-2, were not received or accrued, and (*b*) did not decrease its otherwise allowable deductions for such taxable year on account of that “reduced amount”. Similarly, in the case of a taxable year of a shareholder of a terminal railroad corporation ending before October 23, 1962, section 281(b) shall apply only to the extent that such shareholder computed its taxable income on its return for such taxable year as if the shareholder had neither received or accrued as a dividend nor paid or incurred as an expense the “reduced amount” described in paragraph (c) of § 1.281-2. Such return must have been filed on or before the due date (including the period of any extension of time) for filing the return for the applicable taxable year. The fact that an amended return or claim for refund or credit of overpayment was subsequently filed, or a deficiency subsequently assessed, based upon a computation of taxable income which is inconsistent with the manner in which the taxable income was computed on the timely filed return, is immaterial. 


(ii) The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(2) For any taxable year of a terminal railroad corporation ending before October 23, 1962, a claim for refund or credit of overpayment of income tax based upon section 281 may be filed, even though such refund or credit of overpayment was otherwise barred by operation of any law or rule of law on October 23, 1962, subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(i) through (v) of this section. 


(i) The claim for refund or credit of overpayment must not have been barred by a closing agreement (under either section 3760 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or section 7121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954), or by a compromise (under section 3761 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or section 7122 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954); 


(ii) The claim for refund or credit of overpayment shall be allowed only to the extent that the overpayment of income tax results from the recomputation of the terminal railroad corporation's taxable income in the manner described in paragraph (a) of § 1.281-2; 


(iii) The claim for refund or credit of the overpayment must have been filed prior to October 23, 1963; 


(iv) The claim for refund or credit of overpayment shall be allowed only to the extent that the manner in which the terminal railroad corporation's taxable income is recomputed is the manner in which the terminal railroad corporation's taxable income was computed on its timely filed income tax return for such taxable year; and 


(v) Each railroad corporation which was a shareholder of the terminal railroad corporation during such taxable year must consent in writing to the assessment, within such period as may be agreed upon with the district director, of any deficiency for any year (even though assessment of the deficiency would otherwise be prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law at the time of filing the consent) to the extent that: 


(A) The deficiency is attributable to the recomputation of the shareholder's taxable income in the manner described in paragraph (b) of § 1.281-2, and 


(B) The deficiency results from the shareholder's allocable portion of the “reduced amount” (described in paragraph (c) of § 1.281-2) which gives rise to the refund or credit granted to the terminal railroad corporation under this subparagraph.
