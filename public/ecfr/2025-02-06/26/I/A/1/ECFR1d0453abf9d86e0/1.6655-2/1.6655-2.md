# § 1.6655-2   Annualized income installment method.

(a) *In general.* In the case of any required installment, if the corporation establishes that the annualized income installment determined under this section, or the adjusted seasonal installment determined under § 1.6655-3, is less than the amount determined under § 1.6655-1—


(1) The amount of such required installment is the annualized income installment (or, if less, the adjusted seasonal installment); and


(2) Any reduction in a required installment resulting from the application of this section will be recaptured by increasing the amount of the next required installment determined under § 1.6655-1 by the amount of such reduction (and, if the next required installment is similarly reduced, by increasing subsequent required installments to the extent that the reduction has not previously been recaptured).


(b) *Determination of annualized income installment—in general.* In the case of any required installment, the annualized income installment is the excess (if any) of—


(1) The product of the applicable percentage and the tax (after reducing the annualized tax by the amount of any allowable credits) for the taxable year computed by annualizing the taxable income and alternative minimum taxable income—


(i) For the first 3 months of the taxable year, in the case of the first required installment;


(ii) For the first 3 months of the taxable year, in the case of the second required installment;


(iii) For the first 6 months of the taxable year, in the case of the third required installment; and


(iv) For the first 9 months of the taxable year, in the case of the fourth required installment; over


(2) The aggregate amount of any prior required installments for the taxable year.


(c) *Special rules*—(1) *Applicable percentage.* Except as otherwise provided in § 1.6655-5(d) with respect to short taxable years—


(2) *Partial month.* Except as otherwise provided, for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section a partial month is treated as a month.


(3) *Annualization period not a short taxable year.* An annualization period is not treated as a short taxable year for purposes of determining the taxable income of an annualization period.


(d) *Election of different annualization periods.* (1) If the taxpayer timely files Form 8842, “Election to Use Different Annualization Periods for Corporate Estimated Tax,” in accordance with section 6655(e)(2)(C)(iii), and elects Option 1—


(i) Paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section will be applied by using the language “2 months” instead of “3 months”;


(ii) Paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section will be applied by using the language “4 months” instead of “3 months”;


(iii) Paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section will be applied by using the language “7 months” instead of “6 months”; and


(iv) Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section will be applied by using the language “10 months” instead of “9 months”.


(2) If the taxpayer timely files Form 8842, in accordance with section 6655(e)(2)(C)(iii), and elects Option 2—


(i) Paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section will be applied by using the language “5 months” instead of “3 months”;


(ii) Paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section will be applied by using the language “8 months” instead of “6 months”; and


(iii) Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section will be applied by using the language “11 months” instead of “9 months”.


(3) The application of the annualized income installment method is illustrated by the following example:


(e) *52-53 week taxable year.* (1) Generally, except as provided in the alternative rule in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, in the case of a taxpayer whose taxable year constitutes 52 or 53 weeks in accordance with section 441(f), the rules prescribed by § 1.441-2 are applicable in determining—


(i) Whether a taxable year is a taxable year of 12 months; and


(ii) When the 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, or 11-month period (whichever is applicable) commences and ends for purposes of paragraphs (b)(1), (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.


(2) If a taxpayer employs four 13-week periods or thirteen 4-week accounting periods and the end of any accounting period employed by the taxpayer does not correspond to the end of the 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, or 11-month period (whichever is applicable), then, provided the taxpayer has at least one full 4-week or 13-week accounting period, as appropriate, within the applicable period, annualized taxable income for the applicable period is—


(i) [(x/(y*13))*z], in the case of a taxpayer using four 13-week periods, if—


(A) x = Taxable income for the number of full 13-week periods in the applicable period;


(B) y = The number of full 13-week periods in the applicable period; and


(C) z = The number of weeks in the taxable year; or


(ii) [(x/(y*4))*z], in the case of a taxpayer using thirteen 4-week periods, if—


(A) x = Taxable income for the number of full 4-week periods in the applicable period;


(B) y = The number of full 4-week periods in the applicable period; and


(C) z = The number of weeks in the taxable year.


(3) If a taxpayer employs four 13-week periods and the taxpayer does not have at least one 13-week period within the applicable 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, or 11-month period, the taxpayer is permitted to determine annualized taxable income for the applicable period based upon—


(i) The taxable income for the number of weeks in the applicable period; or


(ii) The taxable income for the full 13-week periods that end before the due date of the required installment.


(4) As an alternative to using the 52/53 week taxable year rules provided in paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), and (e)(3) of this section, a taxpayer whose taxable year constitutes 52 or 53 weeks in accordance with section 441(f) may base its annualization period on the month that ends closest to the end of its applicable 4-week period or 13-week period that ends within the applicable annualization period. This alternative may only be used if it is used for determining annualization periods for all required installments for the taxable year.


(5) The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (e):


(f) *Determination of taxable income for an annualization period*—(1) *In general.* This paragraph (f) applies for purposes of determining the applicability of the exception described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section (relating to the annualization of income) and the exception described in § 1.6655-3 (relating to annualization of income for corporations with seasonal income). An item of income, deduction, gain or loss is to be taken into account in determining the taxable income and alternative minimum taxable income (and applicable tax and alternative minimum tax) for an annualization period in the manner provided in this paragraph (f). An item may not be taken into account in determining taxable income for any annualization period unless the item is properly taken into account by the last day of that annualization period and the item is properly taken into account in determining the taxpayer's taxable income and alternative minimum taxable income (and applicable tax and alternative minimum tax) for the taxable year that includes the annualization period.


(i) *Items of income.* An item of income is taken into account in the annualization period in which the item is properly includible under the method of accounting employed by the taxpayer with respect to the item and in accordance with the appropriate provision of the Internal Revenue Code (for example, section 451 for accrual method taxpayers, section 453 for installment sales or section 460 for long-term contracts).


(ii) *Items of deduction.* An item of deduction is taken into account in the annualization period in which the item is properly deductible under the method of accounting employed by the taxpayer with respect to the item and in accordance with the appropriate provision of the Internal Revenue Code (for example, under the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, the deduction must be paid under § 1.461-1(a)(1) and be otherwise deductible in computing taxable income; under an accrual method of accounting, the deduction must be incurred under § 1.461-1(a)(2) and be otherwise deductible in computing taxable income). Section 170(a)(2) and § 1.170A-11(b) (charitable contributions by accrual method corporations) and § 1.461-5 (recurring item exception) may not be taken into consideration by an accrual method taxpayer in any annualization period in determining whether an item of deduction has been incurred under § 1.461-1(a)(2) during that annualization period.


(iii) *Losses.* An item of loss is to be taken into account during the annualization period in which events have occurred that permit the loss to be taken into account under the appropriate provision of the Internal Revenue Code.


(2) *Certain deductions required to be allocated in a reasonably accurate manner*—(i) *In general.* The following deductions allowed for a taxable year must be allocated throughout the taxable year in a reasonably accurate manner (as defined in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section), regardless of the annualization period in which the item is paid or incurred:


(A) Real property tax deductions.


(B) Employee and independent contractor bonus compensation deductions (including the employer's share of employment taxes related to such compensation).


(C) Deductions under sections 404 (deferred compensation) and 419 (welfare benefit funds).


(D) Items allowed as a deduction for the taxable year by reason of section 170(a)(2) and § 1.170A-11(b) (certain charitable contributions by accrual method corporations), § 1.461-5 (recurring item exception) or § 1.263(a)-4(f) (12-month rule).


(E) Items of deduction designated by the Secretary by publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(*b*) of this chapter).


(ii) *Application of the reasonably accurate manner requirement to certain charitable contributions, recurring items, and 12-month rule items.* For purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(i)(D) of this section, the total amount of the item deducted in the computation of taxable income for the taxable year must be allocated in a reasonably accurate manner, notwithstanding the fact that section 170(a)(2) and § 1.170A-11(b), § 1.461-5, or § 1.263(a)-4(f) applies to only a portion of the total amount of the item deducted for the taxable year. For example, if a portion of a taxpayer's rebate liabilities are deducted in the computation of taxable income under the recurring item exception, all rebate liabilities deducted in the computation of taxable income for the taxable year must be allocated in a reasonably accurate manner.


(iii) *Reasonably accurate manner defined.* (A) An item is allocated throughout the taxable year in a reasonably accurate manner if the item is allocated ratably throughout the taxable year or if the allocation provides a reasonably accurate estimate of taxable income for the taxable year based upon the facts known as of the end of the annualization period. In determining that an allocation of an item provides a reasonably accurate estimate of taxable income for the taxable year, relevant considerations include—


(*1*) The extent to which the allocation is consistent with the taxpayer's accounting for the item on its non-tax books and records;


(*2*) The extent to which the allocable portion of the item becomes fixed and determinable (under § 1.461-1(a)(2)) during the applicable annualization period; and


(*3*) The extent to which the allocation, if compared to the ratable allocation of the item, results in a better matching of the item of deduction to revenue, earnings, the use of property or the provision of services occurring during the annualization period.


(B) None of the relevant considerations above override the general requirement that the allocation must be done in a reasonably accurate manner based upon the facts known as of the end of the annualization period. For example, the fact that a liability for an annual expense becomes fixed and determinable during an annualization period will not establish that allocating all of the expense to that annualization period has been done in a reasonably accurate manner if the facts known as of the end of the annualization period indicate otherwise.


(iv) *Special rule for certain real property tax liabilities.* Notwithstanding paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, real property tax liabilities for which an election under section 461(c) is in effect must be allocated ratably throughout the taxable year for purposes of this section.


(v) *Examples.* Unless otherwise stated, the following examples assume that the taxpayer uses the 3-3-6-9 annualization period:


(3) *Special rules*—(i) *Advance payments under Rev. Proc. 2004-34.* An advance payment for which the taxpayer uses the Deferral Method provided in section 5.02 of Rev. Proc. 2004-34 (2004-1 CB 991), (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(*b*) of this chapter) is includible in computing taxable income for an annualization period in accordance with that method of accounting, except that any amount not included in computing taxable income by the end of the taxable year succeeding the taxable year of receipt is includible in computing taxable income on the last day of such succeeding taxable year.


(ii) *Extraordinary items*—(A) *In general.* In general, extraordinary items must be taken into account after annualizing the taxable income for the annualization period. For purposes of the preceding sentence an extraordinary item is any item identified in § 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(C)(1), (2), (3), (4), (7), and (8), a net operating loss carryover, a section 481(a) adjustment, net gain or loss from the disposition of 25 percent or more of the fair market value of a taxpayer's business assets during a taxable year, and any other item designated by the Secretary by publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter).


(B) *De minimis extraordinary items.* A taxpayer may treat any *de minimis* extraordinary item, other than a net operating loss carryover or section 481(a) adjustment, as an item under the general rule of paragraph (f)(1) of this section rather than an extraordinary item as provided for in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section. A *de minimis* extraordinary item is any item identified in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section resulting from a transaction in which the total extraordinary items resulting from such transaction is less than $1,000,000.


(C) *Special rule for net operating loss deductions and section 481(a) adjustments.* For purposes of paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section, a taxpayer must treat a net operating loss deduction and section 481(a) adjustment as extraordinary items arising on the first day of the tax year in which the item is taken into account in determining taxable income. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a taxpayer may choose to treat the portion of a section 481(a) adjustment recognized during the tax year of the accounting method change as an extraordinary item arising on the date the Form 3115, “Application for Change in Accounting Method,” requesting the change was filed with the national office of the Internal Revenue Service.


(iii) *Credits*—(A) *Current year credits.* With respect to a current year credit, the items upon which the credit is computed are annualized, the amount of the credit is computed based on the annualized items, and the amount of the credit is deducted from the annualized tax. For example, for an annualization period consisting of three months in a full 12-month taxable year, the items upon which the credit is based that are taken into account for the three month period are multiplied by four, the credit is determined based on the annualized amount of the items, and the credit reduces the annualized tax.


(B) *Credit carryovers.* Any credit carryover to the current taxable year is taken into account in computing an annualized income installment only after annualizing the taxable income for the annualization period and computing the applicable tax, and before applying the applicable percentage.


(iv) *Depreciation and amortization*—(A) *Estimated annual depreciation and amortization.* In general, in determining taxable income for any annualization period, a proportionate amount of the taxpayer's estimated annual depreciation and amortization (depreciation) expense may be taken into account. For purposes of the preceding sentence, estimated annual depreciation expense is the estimated depreciation expense to be properly taken into account in determining the taxpayer's taxable income for the taxable year. In determining the estimated annual depreciation expense, a taxpayer may take into account purchases, sales or other dispositions, changes in use, additional first-year depreciation and expense deductions and section 179 or any similar provision, and other events that, based on all the relevant information available as of the last day of the annualization period (such as capital spending budgets, financial statement data and projections, or similar reports that provide evidence of the taxpayer's capital spending plans for the current taxable year), are reasonably expected to occur or apply during the taxable year.


(B) *Safe harbors*—(*1*) *Proportionate depreciation allowance.* In determining taxable income for any annualization period, in lieu of the rule provided in paragraph (f)(3)(iv)(A) of this section a taxpayer may take into account a proportionate amount of the depreciation and amortization (depreciation) expense, including special depreciation and expense deductions such as those provided for in section 168(k) and section 179 or any similar provision, allowed for the taxable year from—


(*i*) Assets that were in service on the last day of the prior taxable year, are in service on the first day of the current taxable year, and that have not been disposed of during the annualization period;


(*ii*) Assets placed in service during the annualization period and have not been disposed of during that period; and


(*iii*) Assets that were in service on the last day of the prior taxable year and that are disposed of during the annualization period.


(*2*) *90 percent of preceding year's depreciation.* In determining taxable income for any annualization period, in lieu of the general rule provided in paragraph (f)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, a proportionate amount of 90 percent of the amount of depreciation and amortization (depreciation) expense taken on the taxpayer's Federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year may be taken into account. If the taxpayer's preceding taxable year is less than 12 months (a short taxable year), the amount of depreciation expense taken into account is annualized by multiplying the depreciation and amortization for the short taxable year by 12, and dividing the result by the number of months in the short taxable year.


(*3*) *Safe harbor operational rules.* If a taxpayer selects one of the two safe harbors provided in paragraph (f)(3)(iv)(B)(*1*) or paragraph (f)(3)(iv)(B)(*2*) of this section, the taxpayer must use that safe harbor for all depreciation expenses within the annualization period for the annualized income installment. However, a taxpayer may use either the method provided for in paragraph (f)(3)(iv)(A) of this section or a method provided for in this paragraph (f)(3)(iv)(B) of this section for each annualized income installment during the taxable year. For example, a taxpayer may use the safe harbor provided in paragraph (f)(3)(iv)(B)(*1*) of this section for its first annualized income installment and may use the general rule provided in paragraph (f)(3)(iv)(A) of this section for its second annualized income installment.


(C) *Short taxable years.* If the taxable year is, or will be, a short taxable year (based on all relevant information available as of the last day of the annualization period), annual depreciation expense is computed using the rules applicable for computing depreciation during a short taxable year for purposes of determining the annual depreciation expense to be allocated to an annualization period. For this purpose, the rules applicable for computing depreciation during a short taxable year are applied on the basis of the date the taxable year is expected to end based on all relevant information available as of the last day of the annualization period. See Rev. Proc. 89-15 (1989-1 CB 816) for computing depreciation expense under section 168 (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(*b*) of this chapter). An annualization period is not treated as a short taxable year for purposes of determining the depreciation expense for an annualization period. See paragraph (c)(3) of this section.


(v) *Distributive share of items*—(A) *Member of partnership.* In determining a partner's distributive share of partnership items that must be taken into account during an annualization period, the rules set forth in § 1.6654-2(d)(2) are applicable.


(B) *Treatment of subpart F income and income under section 936(h)*—(*1*) *General rule.* Any amounts required to be included in gross income under section 936(h) or section 951(a), and credits properly allocable thereto, are taken into account in computing any annualized income installment in a manner similar to the manner under which partnership inclusions, and credits properly allocable thereto, are taken into account in accordance with paragraph (f)(3)(v)(A) of this section.


(*2*) *Prior year safe harbor*—(i) *General rule.* If a taxpayer elects to have the safe harbor in this paragraph (f)(3)(v)(B)(2) apply for any taxable year, then paragraph (f)(3)(v)(B)(*1*) of this section does not apply; and, for purposes of computing any annualized income installment for the taxable year, the taxpayer is treated as having received ratably during the taxable year items of income and credit described in paragraph (f)(3)(v)(B)(*1*) of this section in an amount equal to 115 percent of the amount of such items shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding taxable year (the second preceding taxable year in the case of the first and second required installments for such taxable year).


(ii) *Special rule for noncontrolling shareholder.* If a taxpayer making the election under paragraph (f)(3)(v)(B)(*2*)(*i*) of this section is a noncontrolling shareholder of a corporation, paragraph (f)(3)(v)(B)(*2*)(*i*) of this section is applied with respect to items of such corporation by substituting “100 percent” for “115 percent”. For purposes of paragraph (f)(3)(v)(B)(*2*)(*ii*) of this section, the term *noncontrolling shareholder* means, with respect to any corporation, a shareholder that, as of the beginning of the taxable year for which the installment is being made, does not own within the meaning of section 958(a), and is not treated as owning within the meaning of section 958(b), more than 50 percent by vote or value of the stock in the corporation.


(C) *Dividends from closely held real estate investment trust*—(*1*) *General rule.* Any dividend received from a closely held real estate investment trust by any person that owns, after the application of section 856(d)(5), 10 percent or more by vote or value of the stock or beneficial interests in the trust is taken into account in computing annualized income installments in a manner similar to the manner under which partnership income inclusions are taken into account.


(*2*) *Closely held real estate investment trust.* For purposes of paragraph (f)(3)(v)(C)(*1*) of this section, the term *closely held real estate investment trust* means a real estate investment trust with respect to which 5 or fewer persons own, after the application of section 856(d)(5), 50 percent or more by vote or value of the stock or beneficial interests in the trust.


(D) *Other passthrough entities.* A taxpayer's distributive share of items from a passthrough entity, other than those described in paragraphs (f)(3)(v)(A) and (f)(3)(v)(C) of this section, is taken into account in computing any annualized income installment in a manner similar to the manner under which partnership items are taken into account under paragraph (f)(3)(v)(A) of this section.


(vi) *Alternative minimum taxable income exemption amount.* The alternative minimum taxable income exemption amount provided by section 55(d)(2) is applied after the alternative minimum taxable income for the annualization period is annualized.


(vii) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph (f) are illustrated by the following examples. Unless otherwise stated, the following examples assume that the taxpayer uses the 3-3-6-9 annualization period.


(g) *Items that substantially affect taxable income but cannot be determined accurately by the installment due date*—(1) *In general.* In determining the applicability of the annualization exceptions described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and § 1.6655-3, reasonable estimates may be made from existing data for items that substantially affect income if the amount of such items cannot be determined accurately by the installment due date. This paragraph (g) applies only to the inflation index for taxpayers using the dollar-value LIFO (last-in, first-out) inventory method, adjustments required under section 263A, the computation of a taxpayer's section 199 deduction, intercompany adjustments for taxpayers that file consolidated returns, the liquidation of a LIFO layer at the installment date that the taxpayer reasonably believes will be replaced at the end of the year, deferred gain on a qualifying conversion or exchange of property under sections 1031 and 1033 that the taxpayer reasonably believes will be replaced with qualifying replacement property, and any other item designated by the Secretary by publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(*b*) of this chapter).


(2) *Example.* The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (g):


(h) *Effective/applicability date.* This section applies to taxable years beginning after September 6, 2007.
