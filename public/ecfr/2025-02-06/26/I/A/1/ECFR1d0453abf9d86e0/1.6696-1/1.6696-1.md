# § 1.6696-1   Claims for credit or refund by tax return preparers or appraisers.

(a) *Notice and demand.* (1) The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) shall issue to each tax return preparer or appraiser one or more statements of notice and demand for payment for all penalties assessed against the tax return preparer or appraiser under section 6694 and § 1.6694-1, under section 6695 and § 1.6695-1, or under section 6695A (and any subsequently issued regulations).


(2) For the definition of the term “tax return preparer”, see section 7701(a)(36) and § 301.7701-15 of this chapter. A person who prepares a claim for credit or refund under this section for another person, however, is not, with respect to that preparation, a tax return preparer as defined in section 7701(a)(36) and § 301.7701-15 of this chapter.


(b) *Claim filed by tax return preparer or appraiser.* A claim for credit or refund of a penalty (or penalties) assessed against a tax return preparer or appraiser under section 6694 and § 1.6694-1, under section 6695 and § 1.6695-1, or under section 6695A (and any subsequently issued regulations) may be filed under this section only by the tax return preparer or the appraiser (or the tax return preparer's or appraiser's estate) against whom the penalty (or penalties) is assessed and not by, for example, the tax return preparer's or appraiser's employer. This paragraph (b) is not intended, however, to impose any restrictions on the preparation of this claim for credit or refund. The claim may be prepared by the tax return preparer's or appraiser's employer or by other persons. In all cases, however, the claim for credit or refund shall contain the information specified in paragraph (d) of this section and, as required by paragraph (d) of this section, shall be verified by a written declaration by the tax return preparer or appraiser that the information is provided under penalty of perjury.


(c) *Separation and consolidation of claims.* (1) Unless paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies, a tax return preparer shall file a separate claim for each penalty assessed in each statement of notice and demand issued to the tax return preparer.


(2) A tax return preparer may file one or more consolidated claims for any or all penalties imposed on the tax return preparer by a single IRS campus or office under section 6695(a) and § 1.6695-1(a) (relating to failure to furnish copy of return to taxpayer), section 6695(b) and § 1.6695-1(b) (relating to failure to sign), section 6695(c) and § 1.6695-1(c) (relating to failure to furnish identifying number), or under section 6695(d) and § 1.6695-1(d) (relating to failure to retain copy of return or record), whether the penalties are asserted on a single or on separate statements of notice and demand. In addition, a tax return preparer may file one consolidated claim for any or all penalties imposed on the tax return preparer by a single IRS campus or office under section 6695(e) and § 1.6695-1(e) (relating to failure to file correct information return), which are asserted on a single statement of notice and demand.


(d) *Content of claim.* Each claim for credit or refund for any penalty (or penalties) paid by a tax return preparer under section 6694 and § 1.6694-1, or under section 6695 and § 1.6695-1, or paid by an appraiser under section 6695A (and any subsequently issued regulations) shall include the following information, verified by a written declaration by the tax return preparer or appraiser that the information is provided under penalty of perjury:


(1) The tax return preparer's or appraiser's name.


(2) The tax return preparer's or appraiser's identification number. If the tax return preparer or appraiser is—

(ii) An individual who is not a citizen or resident of the United States and also was not employed by another tax return preparer or appraiser to prepare the document (or documents) with respect to which the penalty (or penalties) was assessed, the tax return preparer's or appraiser's employer identification number shall be provided; or


(iii) A person (whether an individual, corporation, or partnership) that employed one or more persons to prepare the document (or documents) with respect to which the penalty (or penalties) was assessed, the tax return preparer's or appraiser's employer identification number shall be provided.


(3) The tax return preparer's or appraiser's address where the IRS mailed the statement (or statements) of notice and demand and, if different, the tax return preparer's or appraiser's address shown on the document (or documents) with respect to which the penalty (or penalties) was assessed.


(4)(i) The address of the IRS campus or office that issued the statement (or statements) of notice and demand for payment of the penalty (or penalties).


(ii) The date (or dates) and identifying number (or numbers) of the statement (or statements) of notice and demand.
