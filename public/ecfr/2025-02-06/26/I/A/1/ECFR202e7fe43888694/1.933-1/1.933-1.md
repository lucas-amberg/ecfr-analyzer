# § 1.933-1   Exclusion of certain income from sources within Puerto Rico.

(a) *General rule.* (1) An individual (whether a United States citizen or an alien), who is a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico during the entire taxable year, will exclude from gross income the income derived from sources within Puerto Rico, except amounts received for services performed as an employee of the United States or any agency thereof. For purposes of section 933 and this section, an employee of the government of Puerto Rico will not be considered an employee of the United States or of an agency of the United States.


(2) The following example illustrates the application of the general rule in paragraph (a)(1) of this section:


(b) *Taxable year of change of residence from Puerto Rico.* A citizen of the United States who changes his residence from Puerto Rico after having been a bona fide resident thereof for a period of at least two years immediately preceding the date of such change in residence shall exclude from his gross income the income derived from sources within Puerto Rico which is attributable to that part of such period of Puerto Rican residence which preceded the date of such change in residence, except amounts received for services performed as an employee of the United States or any agency thereof.


(c) *Deductions and credits.* In any case in which any amount otherwise constituting gross income is excluded from gross income under the provisions of section 933, there will not be allowed as a deduction from gross income any items of expenses or losses or other deductions (except the deduction under section 151, relating to personal exemptions), or any credit, properly allocable to, or chargeable against, the amounts so excluded from gross income. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the rules of § 1.861-8 will apply (with creditable expenditures treated in the same manner as deductible expenditures).


(d) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section—


(1) The rules of § 1.937-1 will apply for determining whether an individual is a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico; and


(2) The rules of § 1.937-2 will apply for determining whether income is from sources within Puerto Rico.


(e) *Effective/applicability date.* Paragraphs (a), (c), (d), and (e) of this section apply to taxable years ending after April 9, 2008.
