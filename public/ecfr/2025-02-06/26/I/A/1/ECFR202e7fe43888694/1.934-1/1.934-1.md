# § 1.934-1   Limitation on reduction in income tax liability incurred to the Virgin Islands.

(a) *General rule.* Section 934(a) provides that tax liability incurred to the United States Virgin Islands (Virgin Islands) must not be reduced or remitted in any way, directly or indirectly, whether by grant, subsidy, or other similar payment, by any law enacted in the Virgin Islands, except to the extent provided in section 934(b). For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “tax liability” means the liability incurred to the Virgin Islands pursuant to subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), as made applicable in the Virgin Islands by the Act of July 12, 1921 (48 U.S.C. 1397), or pursuant to section 28(a) of the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands (48 U.S.C. 1642), as modified by section 7651(5)(B).


(b) *Exception for Virgin Islands income*—(1) *In general.* Section 934(b)(1) provides an exception to the application of section 934(a). Under this exception, section 934(a) does not apply with respect to tax liability incurred to the Virgin Islands to the extent that such tax liability is attributable to income derived from sources within the Virgin Islands or income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the Virgin Islands.


(2) *Limitation.* Section 934(b)(2) limits the scope of the exception provided by section 934(b)(1). Pursuant to this limitation, the exception does not apply with respect to an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States (other than a bona fide resident of the Virgin Islands). For the rules for determining tax liability incurred to the Virgin Islands by such an individual, see section 932(a) and the regulations under that section.


(3) *Computation rule*—(i) *Operative rule.* For purposes of section 934(b)(1) and this paragraph (b), tax liability incurred to the Virgin Islands for the taxable year attributable to income derived from sources within the Virgin Islands or income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the Virgin Islands will be computed as follows:


(A) Add to the income tax liability incurred to the Virgin Islands any credit against the tax allowed under mirrored section 901(a).


(B) Multiply by taxable income from sources within the Virgin Islands and income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the Virgin Islands (applying the rules of § 1.861-8 to determine deductions allocable to such income).


(C) Divide by total taxable income.


(D) Subtract the portion of any credit allowed under mirrored section 901 (other than credits for taxes paid to the United States) determined by multiplying the amount of taxable income from sources outside the Virgin Islands or the United States that is effectively connected to the conduct of a trade or business in the Virgin Islands divided by the total amount of taxable income from such sources.


(ii) *Limitation.* Tax liability incurred to the Virgin Islands attributable to income derived from sources within the Virgin Islands or income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the Virgin Islands, as computed in this paragraph (b)(3), however, will not exceed the total amount of income tax liability actually incurred.


(4) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section—


(i) *Bona fide resident.* The rules of § 1.937-1 will apply for determining whether an individual is a bona fide resident of the Virgin Islands;

(c) *Exception for qualified foreign corporations*—(1) *In general.* Section 934(b)(3) provides an exception to the application of section 934(a). Under this exception, section 934(a) does not apply with respect to tax liability incurred to the Virgin Islands by a qualified foreign corporation to the extent that such tax liability is attributable to income that is derived from sources outside the United States and that is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.


(2) *Qualified foreign corporation.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the term *qualified foreign corporation* means any foreign corporation if 1 or more United States persons own or are treated as owning (within the meaning of section 958) less than 10 percent of—


(i) The total voting power of the stock of such corporation; and


(ii) The total value of the stock of such corporation.


(3) *Computation rule*—(i) *Operative rule.* For purposes of section 934(b)(3) and this paragraph (c), tax liability incurred to the Virgin Islands for the taxable year attributable to income that is derived from sources outside the United States and that is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States will be computed as follows:


(A) Add to the income tax liability incurred to the Virgin Islands any credit against the tax allowed under mirrored section 901(a).


(B) Multiply by taxable income that is derived from sources outside the United States and that is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States (applying the rules of § 1.861-8 to determine deductions allocable to such income).


(C) Divide by total taxable income.


(D) Subtract any credit allowed under mirrored section 901 (other than credits for taxes paid to the United States or taxes for which a credit is allowable for Federal income tax purposes under section 906 of the Code).


(ii) *Limitation.* Tax liability incurred to the Virgin Islands attributable to income that is derived from sources outside the United States and that is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, as computed in this paragraph (c)(3), however, will not exceed the total amount of income tax liability actually incurred.


(4) *U.S. income*—(i) *In general.* For purposes of this section, except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the rules of sections 861 through 865 and the regulations under those provisions will apply for determining whether income is from sources outside the United States or effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.


(ii) *Conduit arrangements.* Income will be considered to be from sources within the United States for purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section if, pursuant to a plan or arrangement—


(A) The income is received in exchange for consideration provided to another person; and


(B) Such person (or another person) provides the same consideration (or consideration of a like kind) to a third person in exchange for one or more payments constituting income from sources within the United States.
