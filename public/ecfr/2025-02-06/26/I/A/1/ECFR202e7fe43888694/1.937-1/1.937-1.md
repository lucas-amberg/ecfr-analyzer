# § 1.937-1   Bona fide residency in a possession.

(a) *Scope*—(1) *In general.* Section 937(a) and this section set forth the rules for determining whether an individual qualifies as a bona fide resident of a particular possession (the relevant possession) for purposes of subpart D, part III, Subchapter N, Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code as well as section 865(g)(3), section 876, section 881(b), paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 901(b), section 957(c), section 3401(a)(8)(C), and section 7654(a).


(2) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section and §§ 1.937-2 and 1.937-3—


(i) *Possession* means one of the following United States possessions: American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands. When used in a geographical sense, the term comprises only the territory of each such possession (without application of sections 932(c)(3) and 935(c)(2) (as in effect before the effective date of its repeal)).


(ii) *United States*, when used in a geographical sense, is defined in section 7701(a)(9), and without application of sections 932(a)(3) and 935(c)(1) (as in effect before the effective date of its repeal).


(b) *Bona fide resident*—(1) *General rule.* An individual qualifies as a bona fide resident of the relevant possession if such individual satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section with respect to such possession.


(2) *Special rule for members of the Armed Forces.* A member of the Armed Forces of the United States who qualified as a bona fide resident of the relevant possession in a prior taxable year is deemed to have satisfied the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section for a subsequent taxable year if such individual otherwise is unable to satisfy such requirements by reason of being absent from such possession or present in the United States during such year solely in compliance with military orders. Conversely, a member of the Armed Forces of the United States who did not qualify as a bona fide resident of the relevant possession in a prior taxable year is not considered to have satisfied the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section for a subsequent taxable year by reason of being present in such possession solely in compliance with military orders. *Armed Forces of the United States* is defined (and members of the Armed Forces are described) in section 7701(a)(15).


(3) *Juridical persons.* Except as provided in § 1.881-5(f):


(i) Only natural persons may qualify as bona fide residents of a possession; and


(ii) The rules governing the tax treatment of bona fide residents of a possession do not apply to juridical persons (including corporations, partnerships, trusts, and estates).


(4) *Transition rule.* For taxable years beginning before October 23, 2004, and ending after October 22, 2004, an individual is considered to qualify as a bona fide resident of the relevant possession if that individual would be a bona fide resident of the relevant possession by applying the principles of §§ 1.871-2 through 1.871-5.


(5) *Special rule for cessation of bona fide residence in Puerto Rico.* See paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section for a special rule applicable to a citizen of the United States who ceases to be a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico during a taxable year.


(c) *Presence test*—(1) *In general.* A United States citizen or resident alien individual (as defined in section 7701(b)(1)(A)) satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (c) for a taxable year if that individual—


(i) Was present in the relevant possession for at least 183 days during the taxable year;


(ii) Was present in the relevant possession for at least 549 days during the three-year period consisting of the taxable year and the two immediately preceding taxable years, provided that the individual was also present in the relevant possession for at least 60 days during each taxable year of the period;


(iii) Was present in the United States for no more than 90 days during the taxable year;


(iv) During the taxable year had earned income (as defined in § 1.911-3(b)) in the United States, if any, not exceeding in the aggregate the amount specified in section 861(a)(3)(B) and was present for more days in the relevant possession than in the United States; or


(v) Had no significant connection to the United States during the taxable year. See paragraph (c)(5) of this section.


(2) *Special rule for alien individuals.* A nonresident alien individual (as defined in section 7701(b)(1)(B)) satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (c) for a taxable year if during that taxable year that individual satisfies the substantial presence test of § 301.7701(b)-1(c) of this chapter (except for the substitution of the name of the relevant possession for the term *United States* where appropriate).


(3) *Days of presence.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section—


(i) An individual is considered to be present in the relevant possession on:


(A) Any day that the individual is physically present in that possession at any time during the day;

(A) Any period of inpatient care in a hospital or hospice and any period immediately before or after that inpatient care to the extent it is medically necessary; or


(B) Any temporary period of inpatient care in a residential medical care facility for medically necessary rehabilitation services;


(ii) *Inpatient care.* The term *inpatient care* means care requiring an overnight stay in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility, as the case may be.


(iii) *Documentation and production requirements.* In order to satisfy the documentation and production requirements of this paragraph, an individual must, with respect to each qualifying medical treatment, prepare (or obtain), maintain, and, upon a request by the Commissioner (or the person responsible for tax administration in the relevant possession), make available within 30 days of such request:


(A) Records that provide—


(*1*) The patient's name and relationship to the individual (if the medical treatment is provided to a person other than the individual);


(*2*) The name and address of the hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility where the medical treatment was provided;


(*3*) The name, address, and telephone number of the physician who provided the medical treatment;


(*4*) The date(s) on which the medical treatment was provided; and


(*5*) Receipt(s) of payment for the medical treatment;


(B) Signed certification by the providing or supervising physician that the medical treatment was qualified medical treatment within the meaning of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, and setting forth—

(*2*) A reasonably detailed description of the medical treatment provided by (or under the supervision of) the physician;


(*3*) The dates on which the medical treatment was provided; and


(*4*) The medical facts that support the physician's certification and determination that the treatment was medically necessary; and


(C) Such other information as the Commissioner may prescribe by notice, form, instructions, or other publication (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).


(5) *Significant connection.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section—


(i) The term *significant connection to the United States* means—


(A) A permanent home in the United States;


(B) Current registration to vote in any political subdivision of the United States; or


(C) A spouse or child (as defined in section 152(f)(1)) who has not attained the age of 18 whose principal place of abode is in the United States other than—


(*1*) A child who is in the United States because the child is living with a custodial parent under a custodial decree or multiple support agreement; or


(*2*) A child who is in the United States as a student (as defined in section 152(f)(2)).


(ii) *Permanent home*—(A) *General rule.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(5)(i)(A) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, the term *permanent home* has the same meaning as in § 301.7701(b)-2(d)(2) of this chapter.


(B) *Exception for rental property.* If an individual or the individual's spouse owns property and rents it to another person at any time during the taxable year, then notwithstanding that the rental property may constitute a permanent home under § 301.7701(b)-2(d)(2) of this chapter, it is not a permanent home under this paragraph (c)(5)(ii) unless the taxpayer uses any portion of it as a residence during the taxable year under the principles of section 280A(d). In applying the principles of section 280A(d) for this purpose, an individual is treated as using the rental property for personal purposes on any day determined under the principles of section 280A(d)(2) or on any day that the rental property (or any portion of it) is not rented to another person at fair rental for the entire day. The rental property is not used for personal purposes on any day on which the principal purpose of the use of the rental property is to perform repair or maintenance work on the property. Whether the principal purpose of the use of the rental property is to perform repair or maintenance work is determined in light of all the facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, the following: The amount of time devoted to repair and maintenance work, the frequency of the use for repair and maintenance purposes during a taxable year, and the presence and activities of companions.


(iii) For purposes of this paragraph (c)(5), the term *spouse* does not include a spouse from whom the individual is legally separated under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance.


(d) *Tax home test*—(1) *General rule.* Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an individual satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (d) for a taxable year if that individual did not have a tax home outside the relevant possession during any part of the taxable year. For purposes of section 937 and this section, an individual's tax home is determined under the principles of section 911(d)(3) without regard to the second sentence thereof. Thus, under section 937, an individual's tax home is considered to be located at the individual's regular or principal (if more than one regular) place of business. If the individual has no regular or principal place of business because of the nature of the business, or because the individual is not engaged in carrying on any trade or business within the meaning of section 162(a), then the individual's tax home is the individual's regular place of abode in a real and substantial sense.


(2) *Exceptions*—(i) *Year of move.* See paragraph (f) of this section for a special rule applicable to an individual who becomes or ceases to be a bona fide resident of the relevant possession during a taxable year.


(ii) *Special rule for seafarers.* For purposes of section 937 and this section, an individual is not considered to have a tax home outside the relevant possession solely by reason of employment on a ship or other seafaring vessel that is predominantly used in local and international waters. For this purpose, a vessel is considered to be predominantly used in local and international waters if, during the taxable year, the aggregate amount of time it is used in international waters and in the waters within three miles of the relevant possession exceeds the aggregate amount of time it is used in the territorial waters of the United States, another possession, and a foreign country.


(iii) *Special rule for students and government officials.* Any days described in paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(D) and (E) of this section are disregarded for purposes of determining whether an individual has a tax home outside the relevant possession under paragraph (d)(1) of this section during any part of the taxable year.


(e) *Closer connection test*—(1) *General rule.* Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, an individual satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (e) for a taxable year if that individual did not have a closer connection to the United States or a foreign country than to the relevant possession during any part of the taxable year. For purposes of this paragraph (e)—


(i) The principles of section 7701(b)(3)(B)(ii) and § 301.7701(b)-2(d) of this chapter apply (without regard to the final sentence of § 301.7701(b)-2(b) of this chapter); and


(ii) An individual's connections to the relevant possession are compared to the aggregate of the individual's connections with the United States and foreign countries.


(2) *Exception for year of move.* See paragraph (f) of this section for a special rule applicable to an individual who becomes or ceases to be a bona fide resident of the relevant possession during a taxable year.


(f) *Year of move*—(1) *Move to a possession.* For the taxable year in which an individual's residence changes to the relevant possession, the individual satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) and (e)(1) of this section if—


(i) For each of the 3 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year of the change of residence, the individual is not a bona fide resident of the relevant possession;


(ii) For each of the last 183 days of the taxable year of the change of residence, the individual does not have a tax home outside the relevant possession or a closer connection to the United States or a foreign country than to the relevant possession; and


(iii) For each of the 3 taxable years immediately following the taxable year of the change of residence, the individual is a bona fide resident of the relevant possession.


(2) *Move from a possession*—(i) *General rule.* Except for a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico to whom § 1.933-1(b) and paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section apply, for the taxable year in which an individual ceases to be a bona fide resident of the relevant possession, the individual satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) and (e)(1) of this section if—


(A) For each of the 3 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year of the change of residence, the individual is a bona fide resident of the relevant possession;


(B) For each of the first 183 days of the taxable year of the change of residence, the individual does not have a tax home outside the relevant possession or a closer connection to the United States or a foreign country than to the relevant possession; and


(C) For each of the 3 taxable years immediately following the taxable year of the change of residence, the individual is not a bona fide resident of the relevant possession.


(ii) *Year of move from Puerto Rico.* Notwithstanding an individual's failure to satisfy the presence, tax home, or closer connection test prescribed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the taxable year, the individual is a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico for that part of the taxable year described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(E) of this section if the individual—


(A) Is a citizen of the United States;


(B) Is a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico for a period of at least 2 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year;


(C) Ceases to be a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico during the taxable year;


(D) Ceases to have a tax home in Puerto Rico during the taxable year; and


(E) Has a closer connection to Puerto Rico than to the United States or a foreign country throughout the part of the taxable year preceding the date on which the individual ceases to have a tax home in Puerto Rico.


(g) *Examples.* The principles of this section are illustrated by the following examples:


(h) *Information reporting requirement.* The following individuals are required to file notice of their new tax status in such time and manner as the Commissioner may prescribe by notice, form, instructions, or other publication (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter):


(1) Individuals who take the position for U.S. tax reporting purposes that they qualify as bona fide residents of a possession for a tax year subsequent to a tax year for which they were required to file Federal income tax returns as citizens or residents of the United States who did not so qualify.


(2) Citizens and residents of the United States who take the position for U.S. tax reporting purposes that they do not qualify as bona fide residents of a possession for a tax year subsequent to a tax year for which they were required to file income tax returns (with the Internal Revenue Service, the tax authorities of a possession, or both) as individuals who did so qualify.


(3) Bona fide residents of Puerto Rico or a section 931 possession (as defined in § 1.931-1(c)(1)) who take a position for U.S. tax reporting purposes that they qualify as bona fide residents of that possession for a tax year subsequent to a tax year for which they were required to file income tax returns as bona fide residents of the U.S. Virgin Islands or a section 935 possession (as defined in § 1.935-1(a)(3)(i)).


(i) *Effective/applicability date.* Except as provided in this paragraph (i), this section applies to taxable years ending after January 31, 2006. Paragraph (h) of this section also applies to a taxpayer's 3 taxable years immediately preceding the taxpayer's first taxable year ending after October 22, 2004. Taxpayers also may choose to apply this section in its entirety to all taxable years ending after October 22, 2004 for which the statute of limitations under section 6511 is open.
