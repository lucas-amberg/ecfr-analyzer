# § 1.279-3   Corporate acquisition indebtedness.

(a) *Corporate acquisition indebtedness.* For purposes of section 279, the term *corporate acquisition indebtedness* means any obligation evidenced by a bond, debenture, note, or certificate or other evidence of indebtedness issued after October 9, 1969, by a corporation (referred to in section 279 and the regulations thereunder as “issuing corporation”) if the obligation is issued to provide consideration directly or indirectly for the acquisition of stock in, or certain assets of, another corporation (as described in paragraph (b) of this § 1.279-3), is “subordinated” (as described in paragraph (c) of this § 1.279-3), is “convertible” (as described in paragraph (d) of this § 1.279-3), and satisfies either the ratio of debt to equity test (as described in paragraph (f) of § 1.279-5) or the projected earnings test (as described in paragraph (d) of § 1.279-5). 


(b) *Acquisition of stock or assets.* (1) Section 279(b)(1) describes one of the tests to be satisfied if an obligation is to be classified as corporate acquisition indebtedness. Under section 279(b)(1), the obligation must be issued to provide consideration directly or indirectly for the acquisition of: 


(i) Stock (whether voting or nonvoting) in another corporation (referred to in section 279 and the regulations thereunder as “acquired corporation”), or 


(ii) Assets of another corporation (referred to in section 279 and the regulations thereunder as “acquired corporation”) pursuant to a plan under which at least two-thirds (in value) of all the assets (excluding money) used in trades or businesses carried on by such corporation are acquired.


(2) *Direct or indirect consideration.* Obligations are issued to provide direct consideration for an acquisition within the meaning of section 279(b)(1) where the obligations are issued to the shareholders of an acquired corporation in exchange for stock in such acquired corporation or where the obligations are issued to the acquired corporation in exchange for its assets. The application of the provisions of this subsection relating to indirect consideration for an acquisition of stock or assets depends upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the acquisition and the issuance of the obligations. Obligations are issued to provide indirect consideration for an acquisition of stock or assets within the meaning of section 279(b)(1) where (i) at the time of the issuance of the obligations the issuing corporation anticipated the acquisition of such stock or assets and the obligations would not have been issued if the issuing corporation had not so anticipated such acquisition, or where (ii) at the time of the acquisition the issuing corporation foresaw or reasonably should have foreseen that it would be required to issue obligations, which it would not have otherwise been required to issue if the acquisition had not occurred, in order to meet its future economic needs. 


(3) *Stock acquisition.* (i) For purposes of section 279, an acquisition in which the issuing corporation issues an obligation to provide consideration directly or indirectly for the acquisition of stock in the acquired corporation shall be treated as a stock acquisition within the meaning of section 279(b)(1)(A). Where the stock of one corporation is acquired from another corporation and such stock constitutes at least two-thirds (in value) of all the assets (excluding money) of the latter corporation, such acquisition shall be deemed an asset acquisition as described in section 279(b)(1)(B) and subparagraph (4) of this section. If the issuing corporation acquires less than two-thirds (in value) of all the assets (excluding money) used in trades or businesses carried on by the acquired corporation within the meaning of section 279(b)(1)(B) and subparagraph (4) of this paragraph and such assets include stock of another corporation, the acquisition of such stock is a stock acquisition within the meaning of section 279(b)(1)(A) and of this subparagraph. In such a case the amount of the obligation which is characterized as corporate acquisition indebtedness shall bear the same relationship to the total amount of the obligation issued as the fair market value of the stock acquired bears to the total of the fair market value of the assets acquired and stock acquired, as of the date of acquisition. For rules with respect to acquisitions of stock, where the total amount of stock of the acquired corporation held by the issuing corporation never exceeded 5 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the acquired corporation entitled to vote, see § 1.279-4(b)(1). 


(ii) If the issuing corporation acquired stock of an acquired corporation in an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1)(A), and liquidated the acquired corporation under section 334(b)(2) and the regulations thereunder before the last day of the taxable year in which such stock acquisition is made, such obligation issued to provide consideration directly or indirectly to acquire such stock of the acquired corporation shall be considered as issued in an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1)(B). 


(4) *Asset acquisition.* (i) For purposes of section 279, an acquisition in which the issuing corporation issues an obligation to provide consideration directly or indirectly for the acquisition of assets of an acquired corporation pursuant to a plan under which at least two-thirds of the gross value of all the assets (excluding money) used in trades and businesses carried on by such acquired corporation are acquired shall be treated as an asset acquisition within the meaning of section 279(b)(1)(B). For purposes of section 279(b)(1)(B), the gross value of any acquired asset shall be its fair market value as of the day of its acquisition. In determining the fair market value of an asset, no reduction shall be made for any liabilities, mortgages, liens, or other encumbrances to which the asset or any part thereof may be subjected. For purposes of this subparagraph, an asset which has been actually used in the trades and businesses of a corporation but which is temporarily not being used in such trades and businesses shall be treated as if it is being used in such manner. For purposes of this paragraph, the day of acquisition will be determined by reference to the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction. 


(ii) For purposes of the two-thirds test described in section 279(b)(1)(B), the stock of any corporation which is controlled by the acquired corporation shall be considered as an asset used in the trades and businesses of such acquired corporation. 


(5) *Certain nontaxable transactions.* (i) Under section 279(e), an acquisition of stock of a corporation of which the issuing corporation is in control in a transaction in which gain or loss is not recognized shall be deemed an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1)(A) only if immediately before such transaction the acquired corporation was in existence, and the issuing corporation was not in control of such corporation. If the issuing corporation is a member of an affiliated group, then in accordance with section 279(g), the affiliated group shall be treated as the issuing corporation. Thus, any stock of the acquired corporation, owned by members of the affiliated group, shall be aggregated in determining whether the issuing corporation was in control of the acquired corporation. 


(ii) The $5 million limitation provided by section 279(a)(1) is not reduced by the interest on an obligation issued in a transaction which, under section 279 (e), is deemed not to be an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1). 


(iii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(c) *Subordinated obligation*—(1) *In general.* An obligation which is issued to provide consideration for an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1) is subordinated within the meaning of section 279(b)(2) if it is either: 


(i) Subordinated to the claims of trade creditors of the issuing corporation generally, or 


(ii) Expressly subordinated in right of payment to the payment of any substantial amount of unsecured indebtedness, whether outstanding or subsequently issued, of the issuing corporation, irrespective of whether such subordination relates to payment of interest, or principal, or both. In applying section 279 (b)(2) and this paragraph in any case where the issuing corporation is a member of an affiliated group of corporations, the affiliated group shall be treated as the issuing corporation. 


(2) *Expressly subordinated obligation.* In applying subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, an obligation is considered expressly subordinated whether the terms of the subordination are provided in the evidence of indebtedness itself, or in another agreement between the parties to such obligation. An obligation shall be considered to be expressly subordinated within the meaning of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph if such obligation by its terms can become subordinated in right of payment to the payment of any substantial amount of unsecured indebtedness which is outstanding or which may be issued subsequently. However, an obligation shall not be considered expressly subordinated if such subordination occurs solely by operation of law, such as in the case of bankruptcy laws. For purposes of this paragraph, the term *substantial amount of unsecured indebtedness* means an amount of unsecured indebtedness equal to 5 percent or more of the face amount of the obligations issued within the meaning of section 279(b)(1). 


(d) *Convertible obligation.* An obligation which is issued to provide consideration directly or indirectly for an acquisition described in section 279 (b)(1) is convertible within the meaning of section 279(b)(3) if it is either—(1) Convertible directly or indirectly into stock of the issuing corporation, or (2) Part of an investment unit or other arrangement which includes, in addition to such bond or other evidence of indebtedness, an option to acquire directly or indirectly stock in the issuing corporation. Stock warrants or convertible preferred stock included as part of an investment unit constitute options within the meaning of the preceding sentence. Indebtedness is indirectly convertible if the conversion feature gives the holder the right to convert into another bond of the issuing corporation which is then convertible into the stock of the issuing corporation. In any case where the corporation which in fact issues an obligation to provide consideration for an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1) is a member of an affiliated group, the provisions of section 279(b)(3) and this paragraph are deemed satisfied if the stock into which either the obligation or option which is part of an investment unit or other arrangement is convertible, directly or indirectly, is stock of any member of the affiliated group. 


(e) *Ratio of debt to equity and projected earnings test.* For rules with respect to the application of section 279(b)(4) (relating to the ratio of debt to equity and the ratio of projected earnings to annual interest to be paid or incurred), see paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of § 1.279-5. 


(f) *Certain obligations issued after October 9, 1969*—(1) *In general.* Under section 279(i), an obligation shall not be corporate acquisition indebtedness if such obligation is issued after October 9, 1969, to provide consideration for the acquisition of: 


(i) Stock or assets pursuant to a binding written contract which was in effect on October 9, 1969, and at all times thereafter before such acquisition, or 


(ii) Stock in any corporation where the issuing corporation, on October 9, 1969, and at all times thereafter before such acquisition, owned at least 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of the acquired corporation.


(2) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(g) *Exemptions for certain acquisitions of foreign corporations*—(1) *In general.* Under section 279(f), the term *corporate acquisition indebtedness* does not include any indebtedness issued to any person to provide consideration directly or indirectly for the acquisition of stock in, or assets of, any foreign corporation substantially all the income of which, for the 3-year period ending with the date of such acquisition or for such part of such period as the foreign corporation was in existence, is from sources without the United States. The interest attributable to any obligation excluded from treatment as corporate acquisition indebtedness by reason of this paragraph shall reduce the $5 million limitation of 279(a)(1). 


(2) *Foreign corporation.* For purposes of this paragraph, the term *foreign corporation* shall have the same meaning as in section 7701(a)(5). 


(3) *Income from sources without the United States.* For purposes of this paragraph, the term *income from sources without the United States* shall be determined in accordance with sections 862 and 863. If more than 80 percent of a foreign corporation's gross income is derived from sources without the United States, such corporation shall be considered to be deriving substantially all of its income from sources without the United States.
