# § 1.279-6   Application of section 279 to certain affiliated groups.

(a) *In general.* Under section 279(g), in any case in which the issuing corporation is a member of an affiliated group, the application of section 279 shall be determined by treating all of the members of the affiliated group in the aggregate as the issuing corporation, except that the ratio of debt to equity of, projected earnings of, and the annual interest to be paid or incurred by any corporation (other than the issuing corporation determined without regard to this paragraph) shall be included in the determinations required under section 279(b)(4) as of any day only if such corporation is a member of the affiliated group on such day, and, in determining projected earnings of such corporation under section 279(c)(3), there shall be taken into account only the earnings and profits of such corporation for the period during which it was a member of the affiliated group. The total amount of an affiliated member's assets, indebtedness, projected earnings, and interest to be paid or incurred will enter into the computation required by this section, irrespective of any minority ownership in such member. 


(b) *Aggregate money and other assets.* In determining the aggregate money and all the other assets of the affiliated group, the money and all the other assets of each member of such group shall be separately computed and such separately computed amounts shall be added together, except that adjustments shall be made, as follows: 


(1) There shall be eliminated from the aggregate money and all the other assets of the affiliated group intercompany receivables as of the date described in section 279(c)(1); 


(2) There shall be eliminated from the total assets of the affiliated group any amount which represents stock ownership in any member of such group; 


(3) In any case where gain or loss is not recognized on transactions between members of an affiliated group under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the basis of any asset involved in such transaction shall be the transferor's basis;


(4) The basis of property in a transaction to which § 1.1502-13 applies is the basis of the property determined under that section; and 


(5) There shall be eliminated from the money and all the other assets of the affiliated group any other amount which, if included, would result in a duplication of amounts in the aggregate money and all the other assets of the affiliated group. 


(c) *Aggregate indebtedness.* For purposes of applying section 279(c), in determining the aggregate indebtedness of an affiliated group of corporations the total indebtedness of each member of such group shall be separately determined, and such separately determined amounts shall be added together, except that there shall be eliminated from such total indebtedness as of the date described in section 279(c)(1): 


(1) The amount of intercompany accounts payable, 


(2) The amount of intercompany bonds or other evidences of indebtedness, and 


(3) The amount of any other indebtedness which, if included, would result in a duplication of amounts in the aggregate indebtedness of such affiliated group. 


(d) *Aggregate projected earnings.* In the case of an affiliated group of corporations (whether or not such group files a consolidated return under section 1501), the aggregate projected earnings of such group is computed by separately determining the projected earnings of each member of such group under paragraph (d) of § 1.279-5, and then adding together such separately determined amounts, except that—


(1) A dividend (a distribution which is described in section 301(c)(1) other than a distribution described in section 243(c)(1)) distributed by one member to another member is eliminated;


(2) In determining the earnings and profits of any member of an affiliated group, there is eliminated any amount of interest income received or accrued, and of interest expense paid or incurred, which is attributable to intercompany indebtedness; and


(3) No gain or loss is recognized in any transaction between members of the affiliated group.




(e) *Aggregate interest to be paid or incurred.* For purposes of section 279(c)(4), in determining the aggregate annual interest to be paid or incurred by an affiliated group of corporations, the annual interest to be paid or incurred by each member of such affiliated group shall be separately calculated under paragraph (e) of § 1.279-5, and such separately calculated amounts shall be added together, except that any amount of annual interest to be paid or incurred on any intercompany indebtedness shall be eliminated from such aggregate interest.
