# ยง 1.280C-1   Disallowance of certain deductions for wage or salary expenses.

If an employer elects to claim the targeted jobs credit under section 44B (as amended by the Revenue Act of 1978), or elects to claim the new jobs credit under section 44B (as in effect prior to enactment of the Revenue Act of 1978), the employer must reduce its deduction for wage or salary expenses paid or incurred in the year the credit is earned by the amount allowable as credit (determined without regard to the provisions of section 53). In the case in which wages and salaries are capitalized the amount subject to depreciation must be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of the credit (determined without regard to the provisions of section 53) in determining the depreciation deduction. In the case of an employer who uses the full absorption method of inventory costing under ยง 1.471-11, the portion of the basis of the inventory attributable to the wage or salary expenses giving rise to the credit and paid or incurred in the year the credit is earned must be reduced by the amount of the credit allowable (determined without regard to the provisions of section 53). If the employer is an organization that is under common control (as described in ยง 1.52-1), it must reduce its deduction for wage or salary expenses by the amount of the credit apportioned to it under ยง 1.52-1 (a) or (b). The deduction for wage and salary expenses must be reduced in the year the credit is earned, even if the employer is unable to use the credit in that year because of the limitations imposed by section 53.
