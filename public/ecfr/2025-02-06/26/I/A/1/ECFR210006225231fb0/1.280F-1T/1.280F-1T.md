Section 280F(c) provides that lessees are to be subject to restrictions substantially equivalent to those imposed on owners of such property under section 280F (a) and (b). Section 280F(d) provides definitions and special rules; note that section 280F(d) (2) and (3) apply with respect to all listed property, even if the other provisions of section 280F do not affect the treatment of the property.
