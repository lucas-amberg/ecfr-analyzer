# § 1.6081-2   Automatic extension of time to file certain returns filed by partnerships.

(a) *In general.* A partnership required to file Form 1065, “U.S. Partnership Return of Income,” or Form 8804, “Annual Return for Partnership Withholding Tax,” for any taxable year will be allowed an automatic six-month extension of time to file the return after the date prescribed for filing the return if the partnership files an application under this section in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. No additional extension will be allowed pursuant to § 1.6081-1(b) beyond the automatic six-month extension provided by this section. In the case of a partnership described in § 1.6081-5(a)(1), the automatic extension of time to file allowed under this section runs concurrently with an extension of time to file granted pursuant to § 1.6081-5.




(b) *Requirements.* To satisfy this paragraph (b), the partnership must—


(1) Submit a complete application on Form 7004, “Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File Certain Business Income Tax, Information, and Other Returns,” or in any other manner prescribed by the Commissioner;


(2) File the application on or before the later of—


(i) The date prescribed for filing the return of the partnership; or


(ii) The expiration of any extension of time to file granted under § 1.6081-5(a); and


(3) File the application with the Internal Revenue Service office designated in the application's instructions.


(c) *Payment of section 7519 amount.* An automatic extension of time for filing a partnership return of income granted under paragraph (a) of this section does not extend the time for payment of any amount due under section 7519, relating to required payments for entities electing not to have a required taxable year.


(d) *Section 444 election.* An automatic extension of time for filing a partnership return of income will run concurrently with any extension of time for filing a return allowed because of section 444, relating to the election of a taxable year other than a required taxable year.


(e) *Effect of extension on partner.* An automatic extension of time for filing a partnership return of income under this section does not extend the time for filing a partner's income tax return or the time for the payment of any tax due on a partner's income tax return.


(f) *Termination of automatic extension.* The Commissioner may terminate an automatic extension at any time by mailing to the partnership a notice of termination at least 10 days prior to the termination date designated in such notice. The Commissioner must mail the notice of termination to the address shown on the Form 7004 or to the partnership's last known address. For further guidance regarding the definition of last known address, *see* § 301.6212-2 of this chapter.


(g) *Penalties.* See section 6698 for failure to file a partnership return.


(h) *Applicability date.* This section applies to applications for an automatic extension of time to file the partnership returns listed in paragraph (a) of this section on or after January 30, 2020. Section 1.6081-2T (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 2019) applies to applications for an automatic extension of time to file before January 30, 2020.
