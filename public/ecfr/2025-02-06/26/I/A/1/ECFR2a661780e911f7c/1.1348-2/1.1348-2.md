# § 1.1348-2   Computation of the fifty-percent maximum tax on earned income.

(a) *Computation of tax for taxable years beginning after 1971.* If, for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1971, an individual has earned taxable income (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) which exceeds the applicable amount in column (1) of table A, the tax imposed by section 1 for such year shall be the sum of:


(1) The applicable amount in column (2) of table A.


(2) 50 percent of the amount by which earned taxable income exceeds the applicable amount in column (1) of table A, and


(3) The amount by which the tax imposed by chapter 1 on the entire taxable income exceeds a tax so computed on earned taxable income, such computations to be made without regard to section 1348 or 1301.


(b) *Computation of tax for taxable years beginning in 1971.* If, for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1970, and before January 1, 1972, an individual has earned taxable income (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) which exceeds the applicable amount in column (1) of table B, the tax imposed by section 1 for such year shall be the sum of:


(1) The applicable amount in column (2) of table B,


(2) 60 percent of the amount by which earned taxable income exceeds the applicable amount in column (1) of table B, and


(3) The amount by which the tax imposed by chapter 1 on the entire taxable income exceeds a tax so computed on earned taxable income, such computations to be made without regard to section 1348 or 1301.


(c) *Short taxable periods.* If a taxpayer is required under section 443(a)(1) to make a return for a period of less than 12 months, the tax under section 1348 and this section shall be determined by placing his taxable income, earned net income, adjusted gross income, and items of tax preference on an annual basis in accordance with section 443 and the regulations thereunder. If a taxable year referred to in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(*a*) of this section is a period of less than 12 months for which a return is required under section 443(a)(1), the average described in such paragraph shall also be determined by placing the items of tax preference for such period on an annual basis in accordance with section 443 and the regulations thereunder. If a return for a period of less than 12 months is required under section 443(a)(3) for any taxable year referred to in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(*a*) of this section, section 1348 and this section shall not apply unless such period is reopened by the taxpayer as provided by section 6851(b).


(d) *Earned taxable income*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of section 1348 and this section, the term *earned taxable income* means the excess of (i) the portion of taxable income which, under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, is attributable to earned net income over (ii) the tax preference offset (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph). For purposes of computing the alternative tax under section 1201, earned taxable income shall not exceed the excess of taxable income over 50 percent of the net capital gain (net section 1201 gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977).


(2) *Taxable income attributable to earned net income.* The portion of taxable income which is attributable to earned net income shall be determined by multiplying taxable income by a fraction (not exceeding one), the numerator of which is earned net income, and the denominator of which is adjusted gross income. For purposes of this subparagraph the term *earned net income* means the excess of the total of earned income (as defined in § 1.1343-(a)) over the total of any deductions which are required to be taken into account under section 62 in determining adjusted gross income and are properly allocable to or chargeable against earned income. Deductions are properly allocable to or chargeable against earned income if, and to the extent that, they are allowable in respect of expenses paid or incurred in connection with the production of earned income and have not been taken into account in determining the net profits of a trade or business in which both personal services and capital are material income producing factors (as defined in § 1.1348-3(a)(3)). Except as otherwise provided, deductions properly allocable to or chargeable against earned income include:


(i) Deductions attributable to a trade or business from which earned income is derived, except that if less than all the gross income from a trade or business constitutes earned income, only a ratable portion of the deductions attributable to such trade or business is allowable in respect of expenses paid or incurred in connection with the production of earned income,


(ii) Deductions consisting of expenses paid or incurred in connection with the performance of services as an employee,


(iii) The deductions described in section 62(7) and allowable by sections 404 and 405(c),


(iv) The deduction allowable by section 217,


(v) The deduction allowable by section 1379(b)(3), and


(vi) A net operating loss deduction to the extent that the net operating losses carried to the taxable year are properly allocable to or chargeable against earned income.


(3) *Tax preference offset.* (i) For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the *tax preference offset* is the amount by which the greater of:


(A) The average of the taxpayer's items of tax preference for the taxable year and the four preceding taxable years, or


(B) The taxpayer's items of tax preference for the taxable year,


(ii) The items of tax preference to be taken into account under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph for any taxable year shall be those items of tax preference referred to in section 57(a) and the regulations thereunder for the taxable year, but excluding any amount not taken into account in computing the tax under section 56(a) and the regulations thereunder for such taxable year. The items of tax preference to be taken into account by an individual for any taxable year in which such individual is or was a nonresident alien shall not include items of tax preference which are not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.


(iii) Taxable years ending before January 1, 1970 shall not be included in computing the average described in subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph. Thus, for example, the tax preference offset for a taxable year ending on December 31, 1973, is the amount by which the average of the taxpayer's items of tax preference for 1970, 1971, 1972, and 1973, or the taxpayer's items of tax preference for 1973, whichever is greater, exceeds $30,000. Taxable years during which the taxpayer was not in existence shall not be included in computing the average described in subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph. A fractional part of a year which is treated as a taxable year under sections 441(b) and 7701(a)(23) shall be treated as a taxable year for purposes of this section for special rules if a taxable year referred to in subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph is a period of less than 12 months for which a return is required under section 443(a)(1).


(iv) If for the current taxable year the taxpayer and his spouse (or the estate of such spouse) file a joint return together, the items of tax preference for a preceding taxable year taken into account under subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph shall be the sum of the items of tax preference of the taxpayer and his spouse for such preceding year even though a joint return was not, or could not have been, filed by the taxpayer and such spouse for such preceding taxable year. If for the current taxable year the taxpayer (A) is no longer married to a spouse to whom he was married for a preceding taxable year taken into account under subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph and files a return as a single person, head of household, or surviving spouse for such current taxable year, or (B) is married to a spouse other than the spouse to whom he was married for a preceding taxable year taken into account under subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph, his items of tax preference shall be computed as if he were not married during such preceding taxable year.


(v) The sum of the items of tax preference of an estate or trust shall, for purposes of this paragraph, be apportioned between the estate or trust and the beneficiary in the manner and to the extent provided by section 58(c)(1) and the regulations thereunder.


(vi) If an item of gross income in respect of a decedent is includible in the gross income of a taxpayer and is treated as earned income in the hands of the taxpayer by reason of § 1.1348-3(a)(4), the items of tax preference for a taxable year taken into account under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be the sum of the taxpayer's items of tax preference for such taxable year and the decedent's items of tax preference for any taxable year of the decedent (including a short taxable year described in section 441(b)(3)) which ends with or within such taxable year of the taxpayer. For purposes of this subdivision, if a taxpayer (such as the estate of the decedent or a testamentary trust created by the decedent) has not been in existence for the number of preceding taxable years specified in subdivision (i)(A) or (iii) of this subparagraph, the items of tax preference for preceding taxable years taken into account shall be the taxpayer's items of tax preference for each of its preceding taxable years plus the decedent's items of tax preference for that number of the most recent taxable years of the decedent ending prior to the taxpayer's earliest taxable year which, when added to the taxpayer's preceding taxable years, equals such number of preceding taxable years specified in subdivision (i)(A), or (iii). The increase, if any, in the taxpayer's tax preference offset computed under this subdivision shall not exceed the amount by which the taxpayer's taxable income attributable to earned net income, computed as provided in § 1.1348-2(d)(2) and including the item of gross income in respect of a decedent, exceeds the taxpayer's taxable income attributable to earned net income computed without regard to such item of gross income.
