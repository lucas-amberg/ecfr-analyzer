# § 1.1348-3   Definitions.

(a) *Earned income*—(1) *In general.* (i) For purposes of section 1348 and the regulations thereunder, the term *earned income* means any item of gross income which is earned income within the meaning of section 401(c)(2)(C) or 911(b) unless the item constitutes deferred compensation as defined in paragraph (b) of this section or is otherwise excluded by application of this paragraph. Thus, subject to such exceptions, the term includes:


(A) Wages, salaries, professional fees, bonuses, amounts includible in gross income under section 83, commissions on sales or on insurance premiums, tips, and other amounts received, actually or constructively, as compensation for personal services actually rendered regardless of the medium or basis of payment.


(B) Compensatory payments for personal services made prior to the time such services are actually rendered, provided such advance payments are not made for a purpose of minimizing Federal income taxes by reason of the application of section 1348, and are either customary in the particular profession, trade, or business, or are made for a bona fide business purpose.


(C) Prizes and awards in recognition of personal services includible in gross income under section 74, amounts includible in gross income under section 79 (relating to group-term life insurance purchased for employees), and amounts includible in gross income under section 1379(b) (relating to contributions to qualified pension plans in the case of certain shareholder-employees); and


(D) Gains (other than gain which is treated as capital gain under any provision of chapter 1) and net earnings derived from the sale or other disposition of, the transfer of any interest in, or the licensing of the use of property (other than good will) by an individual whose personal efforts created such property


(ii) In the case of a nonresident alien individual, earned income includes only earned income from sources within the United States which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.


(2) *Earned income and employed assistants.* The entire amount received as professional fees shall be treated as earned income if the taxpayer is engaged in a professional occupation, such as a doctor, dentist, lawyer, architect, or accountant, even though he employs assistants to perform part or all of the services, provided the patients or clients are those of the taxpayer and look to the taxpayer as the person responsible for the services performed.


(3) *Earned income from business in which capital is material.* (i) If an individual is engaged in a trade or business (other than in corporate form) in which both personal services and capital are material income-producing factors, a reasonable allowance as compensation for the personal services actually rendered by the individual shall be considered earned income, but the total amount which shall be treated as the earned income of the individual from such a trade or business shall in no case exceed 30 percent of his share of the net profits of such trade or business (which share shall include any guaranteed payment (as defined by § 1.707-1(c)) received from a partnership). For purpose of the preceding sentence, the term *net profits of the trade or business* means the excess of gross income from such trade or business (including income from all sources, whether or not subject to Federal income tax, and without taking into account any deductions which may be allowable under section 1202) over the deductions attributable to such trade or business.


(ii) Whether capital is a material income-producing factor must be determined by reference to all the facts of each case. Capital is a material income-producing factor if a substantial portion of the gross income of the business is attributable to the employment of capital in the business, as reflected, for example, by a substantial investment in inventories, plant, machinery, or other equipment. In general, capital is not a material income-producing factor where gross income of the business consists principally of fees, commissions, or other compensation for personal services performed by an individual. Thus, the practice of his profession by a doctor, dentist, lawyer, architect, or accountant will not, as such, be treated as a trade or business in which capital is a material income-producing factor even though the practitioner may have a substantial capital investment in professional equipment or in the physical plant constituting the office from which he conducts his practice since his capital investment is regarded as only incidental to his professional practice.


(iii) This subparagraph does not apply to gains and net earnings derived from the sale or other disposition of, the transfer of any interest in, or the licensing of the use of property by an individual whose personal efforts created such property which are, by reason of subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, treated as earned income. Thus, for example, a research chemist's substantial capital investment in laboratory facilities which he uses to produce patentable chemical processes from which he derives gains within the meaning of this subdivision would not be considered a material income-producing factor.


(4) *Income in respect of a decedent.* An item of gross income in respect of a decedent includible in the gross income of a person described in section described in section 691(a)(1) shall be treated as earned income in the hands of such person for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph if such item of gross income would have constituted earned income of the decedent had he lived and received such amount. See § 1.1348-2(d)(3)(vi) for rules relating to attribution of tax preferences by reason of an item of income in respect of a decedent.


(5) *Exceptions to definition of earned income.* For purposes of section 1348 and the regulations thereunder, the term *earned income* does not include:


(i) Any distribution to which section 72(m)(5), relating to certain amounts received by owner-employees from a trust described in section 401(a) or under a plan described in section 403(a), applies,


(ii) Any distribution to which section 402(e), relating to the treatment of certain total distributions from a trust described in section 401(a) or under a plan described in section 403(a), applies,


(iii) Any distribution to which section 402(a)(2), relating to capital gains treatment of certain total distributions from a trust described in section 401(a), applies,


(iv) Any distribution to which section 403(a)(2)(A), relating to capital gains treatment for certain distributions under a plan described in section 404(a)(2), applies, or


(v) Any deferred compensation within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section.


(6) *Examples.* The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(b) *Deferred compensation*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of section 1348 and the regulations thereunder, the term *deferred compensation* means, except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, any compensation which is deferred within the meaning of that concept in section 404, including any deferred compensation to which the provisions of section 404 and the regulations thereunder apply and any other compensation taxation of which is deferred in a manner similar to the treatment applicable to deferred compensation to which such provisions apply. Thus, the term includes any amounts includable in gross income as compensation for personal services pursuant to a plan, or method having the effect of a plan, deferring the taxation of such payment to a taxable year later than that in which such services were rendered. For purposes of section 1348, the term *deferred compensation* is not limited to payments to common-law employees but also includes payments to self-employed individuals: nor is it material that no deduction is allowable in respect of all or part of such payments or that a deduction in respect thereof is allowable under some provision of the Code other than section 404. For example, amounts received by a retired partner pursuant to a written plan of the partnership of the kind described in section 1402(a)(10) constitute deferred compensation except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. The term *deferred compensation,* as defined in this paragraph, shall have no application to a determination of the deductibility of any amount under section 162, 404, or any other provision of the Code.


(2) *Amounts not treated as deferred compensation.* Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, any amount includible in gross income as compensation before the end of the taxable year following the first taxable year of the taxpayer in which his right to receive such amount is not subject to any requirement or condition which would be treated as resulting in a substantial risk of forfeiture within the meaning of section 83 and the regulations thereunder does not constitute deferred compensation for purposes of section 1348 and the regulations thereunder. For purposes of this subparagraph, a fractional part of a year which is a taxable year under sections 441(b) and 7701(a)(23) shall be treated as a taxable year.


(3) *Application to certain compensation*—(i) *In general.* This subparagraph provides rules for the application of the principles of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph to certain types of compensation.


(ii) *Pension, etc., plans.* (A) In accordance with subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the taxable portion of distributions under a pension, annuity, profit-sharing, or stock bonus plan, whether or not such plan meets the requirements of section 401(a), or pursuant to a method having the effect of such a plan, generally constitutes deferred compensation. However, under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, such portion constitutes earned income if includible in gross income before the end of the taxable year following the first taxable year of the taxpayer in which his right to receive such amount is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. In the case of a distribution under a contributory plan, the preceding sentence applies only to that part of the taxable portion of the distribution which is attributable to employer contributions to the plan. For purposes of the preceding sentence, that part of the taxable portion of a distribution which is attributable to employer contributions is the amount of such part, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the employer contributions to the plan on behalf of the employee (determined in accordance with the principles of § 1.402(a)-2), and the denominator of which is the sum of such employer contributions and the net employee contributions to the plan (as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.402(a)-2). Thus, if the employer does not contribute to the plan, no part of any distribution thereunder constitutes earned income. Amounts included in gross income under section 402(b), 403(c), or 1379(b)(1) in respect of employer contributions to a plan described in this subdivision do not constitute deferred compensation.


(B) If a recipient's rights to receive amounts pursuant to a plan cease to be subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture in more than one of his taxable years, each payment pursuant to such plan shall be considered to consist of a ratable portion of all of the amounts which are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture at the time of such payment. Thus, for example, if an employment contract provides in part that an employee or his estate is to receive in each of the fifteen years after the year in which he attains or would have attained age 65 an amount equal to $2,000 times his years of service with the employer and if he had eighteen years of service with the employer, each $36,000 payment would be considered to consist of 18 payments of $2,000, his right to receive one of which ceased to be subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture upon completing his first year of service with the employer, his right to receive another of which ceased to be subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture upon completing his second year of service with the employer, etc. Therefore, if the employee's last year of service with the employer was completed in the year in which he attained age 65, $2,000 of the first payment in the next year would not be deferred compensation under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, and the remaining $34,000 of that payment and all of the other fourteen payments of $36,000 would be deferred compensation. If the employee's last year of service was completed in an earlier year, all fifteen payments would constitute deferred compensation in full.


(iii) *Income attributable to options.* (A) Ordinary income realized by a taxpayer upon a disqualifying disposition of stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of a statutory option (as defined in § 1.421-7(b)) is not deferred compensation for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph and, therefore, constitutes earned income.


(B) Ordinary income realized by a taxpayer upon the transfer of property pursuant to the exercise, or sale or other disposition, of an option which is not a statutory option (as defined in § 1.421-7(b)) and which was granted on or before December 15, 1971, is not deferred compensation for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph and, therefore, constitutes earned income. Ordinary income realized by a taxpayer upon the transfer of property pursuant to the exercise, or sale or other disposition, of an option which is not a statutory option (as defined in § 1.421-(b)) and which is granted after December 15, 1971 constitutes earned income rather than deferred compensation if such option cannot, by its terms, be exercised more than three months after termination (for any reason other than death) of the grantee's employment by the grantor of the option. If the terms of such an option granted after December 15, 1971 permit the exercise of the option more than three months after termination (for any reason other than death) of the grantee's employment by the grantor, ordinary income realized by a taxpayer upon the transfer of property pursuant to exercise, or sale or other disposition, of the option constitutes earned income rather than deferred compensation only if such income is realized in a taxable year no later than that following the taxable year in which the option was granted. In the case of the grantee's death within a period during which ordinary income realized upon the transfer of property pursuant to his exercise, or sale or other disposition, of an option described in this subdivision would have constituted earned income as provided in this subdivision had the grantee lived, ordinary income realized subsequently upon the transfer of property pursuant to exercise, or sale or other disposition, of an option described in this subdivision, by the grantee's legal represedntatives or beneficiary constitutes earned income only if such exercise or sale or other disposition, occurs on a date no later than the date twelve months following that of the grantee's death. For purposes of this subdivision, the term *employment by the grantor* includes employment by a related corporation as defined in § 1.421-7(i), and by a corporation which is considered a related corporation under § 1.421-7(h)(3). Therefore, the transfer of an employee from the grantor corporation to such a related corporation or from one related corporation to another related corporation or to the grantor corporation will not be treated as a termination of employment by the grantor.


(C) For purposes of (B) of this subdivision, if an option described therein and granted after December 15, 1971 is exercisable only following completion of a specified period of employment, the taxable year in which such period of employment is completed shall be treated as the taxable year in which the option was granted. Further, if the terms of an option described in (B) of this subdivision and granted after December 15, 1971 are modified, such modification shall not be considered as the granting of a new option for purposes of (B) in determining the taxable year in which such option was granted.


(D) For purposes of (B) of this subdivision, an option will not be considered exercisable by its terms more than three months following termination (for any reason other than death) of the grantee's employment by the grantor solely because the terms of such option permit, in the event of such grantee's death within three months following termination of such employment, exercise of the option by the grantee's legal representative or beneficiary during or following such three-month period.


(4) *Examples.* The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples, in each of which it is assumed that any amounts paid as described therein constitute salaries or other compensation for personal services actually rendered rather than a distribution of earnings and profits:
