# § 1.430(d)-1   Determination of target normal cost and funding target.

(a) *In general*—(1) *Overview.* This section sets forth rules for determining a plan's target normal cost and funding target under sections 430(b) and 430(d), including guidance relating to the rules regarding actuarial assumptions under sections 430(h)(1), 430(h)(4), and 430(h)(5). Section 430 and this section apply to single employer defined benefit plans (including multiple employer plans as defined in section 413(c)) that are subject to section 412, but do not apply to multiemployer plans (as defined in section 414(f)). For further guidance on actuarial assumptions, *see* § 1.430(h)(2)-1 (relating to interest rates) and §§ 1.430(h)(3)-1 and 1.430(h)(3)-2 (relating to mortality tables). *See* also § 1.430(i)-1 for the determination of the funding target and the target normal cost for a plan that is in at-risk status.


(2) *Organization of regulation.* Paragraph (b) of this section sets forth certain definitions that apply for purposes of section 430. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules regarding which benefits are taken into account in determining a plan's target normal cost and funding target. Paragraph (d) of this section sets forth the rules regarding the plan provisions that are taken into account in making these determinations, and paragraph (e) of this section provides rules on the plan population that is taken into account for this purpose. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules relating to the actuarial assumptions and the plan's funding method that are used to determine present values. Paragraph (g) of this section contains effective/applicability dates and transition rules.


(3) *Special rules for multiple employer plans.* In the case of a multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) applies, the rules of section 430 and this section are applied separately for each employer under the plan, as if each employer maintained a separate plan. Thus, the plan's funding target and target normal cost are computed separately for each employer under such a multiple employer plan. In the case of a multiple employer plan to which section 413(c)(4)(A) does not apply (that is, a plan described in section 413(c)(4)(B) that has not made the election for section 413(c)(4)(A) to apply), the rules of section 430 and this section are applied as if all participants in the plan were employed by a single employer.


(b) *Definitions*—(1) *Target normal cost*—(i) *In general.* For a plan that is not in at-risk status under section 430(i) for a plan year, subject to the adjustments described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the *target normal cost* of the plan for the plan year is the present value (determined as of the valuation date) of all benefits under the plan that accrue during, are earned during, or are otherwise allocated to service for the plan year under the applicable rules of this section, including paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B), (C), or (D) of this section. *See* § 1.430(i)-1(d) and (e)(2) for the determination of the target normal cost for a plan that is in at-risk status.


(ii) *Benefits allocated to a plan year.* The benefits that accrue, are earned, or are otherwise allocated to service for the plan year are based on the actual benefits accrued, earned, or otherwise allocated to service for the plan year through the valuation date and benefits expected to accrue, be earned, or be otherwise allocated to service for the plan year for the period from the valuation date through the end of the plan year. The benefits that are allocated to the plan year under the rules of paragraph (c) of this section include any increase in benefits during the plan year that is attributable to increases in compensation for the current plan year even if that increase in benefits is with respect to benefits attributable to service performed in a preceding plan year. In addition, the benefits that are allocated to the plan year under the rules of paragraph (c) of this section include any increase in benefits during the plan year that arises on account of mandatory employee contributions (within the meaning of § 1.411(c)-1(c)(4)) that are made during the plan year.


(iii) *Special adjustments*—(A) *In general.* The target normal cost of the plan for the plan year (determined under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section) is adjusted (not below zero) by adding the amount of plan-related expenses expected to be paid from plan assets during the plan year and subtracting the amount of mandatory employee contributions (within the meaning of § 1.411(c)-1(c)(4)) that are expected to be made during the plan year.


(B) *Plan-related expenses.* [Reserved]


(2) *Funding target.* For a plan that is not in at-risk status under section 430(i) for a plan year, the funding target of the plan for the plan year is the present value (determined as of the valuation date) of all benefits under the plan that have been accrued, earned, or otherwise allocated to years of service prior to the first day of the plan year under the applicable rules of this section, including paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B), (C), or (D) of this section. *See* § 1.430(i)-1(c) and (e)(1) for the determination of the funding target for a plan that is in at-risk status.


(3) *Funding target attainment percentage*—(i) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(3), the funding target attainment percentage of a plan for a plan year is a fraction (expressed as a percentage)—


(A) The numerator of which is the value of plan assets for the plan year (determined under the rules of § 1.430(g)-1) after subtraction of the prefunding balance and the funding standard carryover balance under section 430(f)(4)(B) and § 1.430(f)-1(c); and


(B) The denominator of which is the funding target of the plan for the plan year (determined without regard to the at-risk rules of section 430(i) and § 1.430(i)-1).


(ii) *Determination of funding target attainment percentage for plans with delayed effective dates.* If section 430 does not apply for purposes of determining the plan's minimum required contribution for a plan year that begins on or after January 1, 2008 (as is the case for a plan described in section 104, 105, or 106 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA '06), Public Law 109-280 (120 Stat. 780)), then the funding target attainment percentage is determined for that plan year in accordance with the rules of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section in the same manner as for a plan to which section 430 applies to determine the plan's minimum required contribution, except that the value of plan assets that forms the numerator under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section is determined without subtraction of the funding standard carryover balance or the credit balance under the funding standard account.


(iii) *Special rule for plans with zero funding target.* If the funding target of the plan is equal to zero for a plan year, then the funding target attainment percentage under this paragraph (b)(3) is equal to 100 percent for the plan year.


(4) *Present value.* The present value of a benefit (including a portion of a benefit) with respect to a participant that is taken into account under the rules of paragraph (c) of this section is determined as of the valuation date by multiplying the amount of that benefit by the probability that the benefit will be paid at a future date and then discounting the resulting product using the appropriate interest rate under § 1.430(h)(2)-1. The probability that the benefit will be paid with respect to the participant at such future date is determined using the actuarial assumptions that satisfy the standards of paragraph (f) of this section as to the probability of future service, advancement in age, and other events (such as death, disability, termination of employment, and selection of optional form of benefit) that affect whether the participant or beneficiary will be eligible for the benefit and whether the benefit will be paid at that future date.


(c) *Benefits taken into account*—(1) *In general*—(i) *Benefits earned or accrued.* The benefits taken into account in determining the target normal cost and the funding target under paragraph (b) of this section are all benefits earned or accrued under the plan that have not yet been paid as of the valuation date, including retirement-type and ancillary benefits (within the meaning of § 1.411(d)-3(g)). The benefits taken into account are based on the participant's or beneficiary's status (such as active employee, vested or partially vested terminated employee, or disabled participant) as of the valuation date, and those benefits are allocated to the funding target or the target normal cost under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.


(ii) *Allocation of benefits*—(A) *In general.* To the extent that the amount of a participant's benefit that is expected to be paid is a function of the accrued benefit, the allocation of the benefit for purposes of determining the funding target and the target normal cost is made using the rules of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. To the extent that the amount of a participant's benefit that is expected to be paid is not a function of the accrued benefit, but is a function of the participant's years of service (or is the excess of a function of the participant's years of service over a function of the participant's accrued benefit), the allocation of the benefit for purposes of determining the funding target and the target normal cost is made using the rules of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C) of this section. To the extent that the amount of a participant's benefit that is expected to be paid is not allocated under the rules of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section, the allocation of the benefit for purposes of determining the funding target and the target normal cost is made using the rules of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(D) of this section.


(B) *Benefits that are based on accrued benefits.* If the allocation of the benefit for purposes of determining the funding target and the target normal cost is made under this paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B), then the portion of a participant's benefit that is taken into account in the funding target for a plan year is determined by applying the function to the accrued benefit as of the first day of the plan year, and the portion of the benefit that is taken into account in determining the target normal cost for the plan year is determined by applying that function to the increase in the accrued benefit during the plan year. For example, a benefit that is assumed to be payable at a particular early retirement age in the amount of 90 percent of the accrued benefit is taken into account in the funding target in the amount of 90 percent of the accrued benefit as of the beginning of the plan year, and that benefit is taken into account in the target normal cost in the amount of 90 percent of the increase in the accrued benefit during the plan year.


(C) *Benefits that are based on service.* If the allocation of the benefit for purposes of determining the funding target and the target normal cost is made under this paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C), then the portion of a participant's benefit that is taken into account in determining the funding target for a plan year is determined by applying the function to the participant's years of service as of the first day of the plan year, and the portion of the benefit that is taken into account in determining the target normal cost for the plan year is determined by applying that function to the increase in the participant's years of service during the plan year. For example, if a plan provides a post-retirement death benefit of $500 per year of service, then the funding target is determined based on a death benefit of $500 multiplied by a participant's years of service at the beginning of the year, and if the participant earns or is expected to earn a full year of service during the plan year, the target normal cost is based on the additional $500 in death benefits attributable to that additional year of service.


(D) *Other benefits.* If the allocation of the benefit for purposes of determining the funding target and the target normal cost is made under this paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(D), then the portion of a participant's benefit that is taken into account in determining the funding target for a plan year is equal to the total benefit multiplied by the ratio of the participant's years of service as of the first day of the plan year to the years of service the participant will have at the time of the event that causes the benefit to be payable (whether the benefit is expected to be paid at the time of that decrement or at a future time), and the portion of the benefit that is taken into account in determining the target normal cost for the plan year is the increase in the proportionate benefit attributable to the increase in the participant's years of service during the plan year. For example, if a plan provides a Social Security supplement for a participant who retires after 30 years of service that is equal to a participant's Social Security benefit, the funding target with respect to the benefit payable beginning at a particular age (which reflects the probability of retirement at that age) is determined based on the projected Social Security benefit payable at the particular age multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the participant's years of service as of the first day of the plan year and the denominator of which is the participant's projected years of service at the particular age. In such a case, if the participant earns or is expected to earn a full year of service during the plan year, the target normal cost is determined based on the projected Social Security benefit payable at the particular age multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the participant's projected years of service at the particular age.


(iii) *Application of section 436 limitations to funding target and target normal cost determination*—(A) *Effect of limitation on unpredictable contingent event benefits.* The determination of the funding target and the target normal cost of a plan for a plan year must take into account any limitation on unpredictable contingent event benefits under section 436(b) with respect to unpredictable contingent events which occurred before the valuation date, but must not take into account anticipated funding-based limitations on unpredictable contingent event benefits under section 436(b) with respect to unpredictable contingent events which are expected to occur on or after the valuation date.


(B) *Effect of limitation on applicability of plan amendments.* See paragraph (d) of this section for rules regarding the treatment of plan amendments that take effect during the plan year taking into account the restrictions under section 436(c).


(C) *Effect of limitation on prohibited payments.* The determination of the funding target and the target normal cost of a plan for a plan year must take into account any limitation on prohibited payments under section 436(d) with respect to any annuity starting date that was before the valuation date, but must not take into account any limitation on prohibited payments under section 436(d) for any annuity starting date on or after the valuation date (however, the determination must take into account benefit distributions under plan provisions that allow new annuity starting dates with respect to distributions that were limited under section 436(d)).


(D) *Effect of limitation on benefit accruals.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(D), the determination of the funding target of a plan for a plan year must take into account any limitation on benefit accruals under section 436(e) applicable before the valuation date. However, if the plan terms provide for the automatic restoration of benefit accruals as permitted under § 1.436-1(a)(4)(ii)(B), and the restoration of benefits as of the valuation date will not be treated as resulting from a plan amendment under the rules of § 1.436-1(c)(3) (because the period of limitation as of the valuation date does not exceed 12 months and the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for the plan would not be less than 60 percent taking into account the restored benefit accruals), then the determination of the funding target of a plan for a plan year must not take into account the limitation on benefit accruals under section 436(e) for that period. The determination of the target normal cost of a plan for a plan year must not take into account any limitation on benefit accruals under section 436(e). Thus, if an employer wishes to take a plan freeze into account in determining the target normal cost, the plan must be specifically amended to cease accruals.


(iv) *Effect of other limitations of benefits*—(A) *Liquidity shortfalls.* The determination of the funding target and the target normal cost of a plan for a plan year must take into account any restrictions on payments under section 401(a)(32) on account of a liquidity shortfall (as defined in section 430(j)(4)) for periods preceding the valuation date. The determination of the funding target and the target normal cost must not take into account any restrictions on payments under section 401(a)(32) on account of a liquidity shortfall or possible liquidity shortfall for any period on or after the valuation date.


(B) *High 25 limitation.* The determination of the funding target and the target normal cost of a plan for a plan year must take into account any restrictions on payments under § 1.401(a)(4)-5(b) to highly compensated employees to the extent that benefits were not paid or will not be paid because of a limitation that applied prior to the valuation date. If a benefit that was otherwise restricted was paid prior to the valuation date but with suitable security (such as an escrow account) provided to the plan in the event of a plan termination, the benefit is treated as distributed for purposes of section 430 and this section. Accordingly, the funding target does not include any liability for the benefit and the plan assets do not include the security. The determination of the funding target and the target normal cost of a plan for a plan year must not take into account any restrictions on payments under § 1.401(a)(4)-5(b) to highly compensated employees that are anticipated with respect to annuity starting dates on or after the valuation date on account of the funded status of the plan.


(2) *Benefits provided by insurance*—(i) *General rule.* A plan generally is required to reflect in the plan's funding target and target normal cost the liability for benefits that are funded through insurance contracts held by the plan, and to include the corresponding insurance contracts in plan assets. Paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section sets forth an alternative to this general approach. A plan's treatment of benefits funded through insurance contracts pursuant to this paragraph (c)(2) is part of the plan's funding method. Accordingly, that treatment can be changed only with the consent of the Commissioner.


(ii) *Separate funding of insured benefits.* As an alternative to the treatment described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, in the case of benefits that are funded through insurance contracts, the liability for benefits provided under such contracts is permitted to be excluded from the plan's funding target and target normal cost, provided that the corresponding insurance contracts are excluded from plan assets. This treatment is only available with respect to insurance purchased from an insurance company licensed under the laws of a State and only to the extent that a participant's or beneficiary's right to receive those benefits is an irrevocable contractual right under the insurance contracts, based on premiums paid to the insurance company prior to the valuation date. For example, in the case of a retired participant receiving benefits from an annuity contract in pay status under which no premiums are required on or after the valuation date, the liability for benefits provided by the contract is permitted to be excluded from the plan's funding target provided that the value of the contract is also excluded from the value of plan assets. Similarly, in the case of an active or deferred vested participant whose benefits are funded by a life insurance or annuity contract under which further premiums are required on or after the valuation date, the liability for benefits, if any, that would be paid from the contract if no further premiums were to be paid (for example, if the contract were to go on reduced paid-up status) is permitted to be excluded from the plan's funding target and target normal cost, provided that the value of the contract is excluded from the value of plan assets. By contrast, if the plan trustee can surrender a contract to the insurer for its cash value, then the participant's or beneficiary's right to receive those benefits is not an irrevocable contractual right and, therefore, the liability for benefits provided under the contract must be taken into account in determining the plan's funding target and target normal cost and the contracts cannot be excluded from plan assets.


(d) *Plan provisions taken into account*—(1) *General rule*—(i) *Plan provisions adopted by valuation date.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d), a plan's funding target and target normal cost for a plan year are determined based on plan provisions that are adopted no later than the valuation date for the plan year and that take effect on or before the last day of the plan year. For example, in the case of a plan amendment adopted on or before the valuation date for the plan year that has an effective date occurring in the current plan year, the plan amendment is taken into account in determining the funding target and the target normal cost for the current plan year if it is permitted to take effect under the rules of section 436(c) for the current plan year, but the amendment is not taken into account for the current plan year if it does not take effect until a future plan year.


(ii) *Plan provisions adopted after valuation date.* If a plan administrator makes the election described in section 412(d)(2) with respect to a plan amendment, then the plan amendment is treated as having been adopted on the first day of the plan year for purposes of this paragraph (d). Section 412(d)(2) applies to any plan amendment adopted no later than 2
1/2 months after the close of the plan year, including an amendment adopted during the plan year. Thus, if an amendment is adopted after the valuation date for a plan year (and no later than 2
1/2 months after the close of the plan year), but takes effect by the last day of the plan year, the amendment is taken into account in determining the plan's funding target and target normal cost for the plan year if the plan administrator makes the election described in section 412(d)(2) with respect to such amendment.


(iii) *Determination of when an amendment takes effect.* For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1), the determination of whether an amendment that increases benefits takes effect and when it takes effect is determined in accordance with the rules of section 436(c) and § 1.436-1(c)(5). For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1), in the case of an amendment that decreases benefits, the amendment takes effect under a plan on the first date on which the benefits of any individual who is or could be a participant or beneficiary under the plan would be less than those benefits would be under the pre-amendment plan provisions if the individual were on that date to satisfy the applicable conditions for the benefits. In either case, the determination of when an amendment takes effect is unaffected by an election under section 412(d)(2).


(2) *Special rule for certain amendments increasing liabilities.* In the case of a plan amendment that is not required to be taken into account under the rules of paragraph (d)(1) of this section because it is adopted after the valuation date for the plan year, the plan amendment must be taken into account in determining a plan's funding target and target normal cost for the plan year if the plan amendment—


(i) Takes effect by the last day of the plan year;


(ii) Increases the liabilities of the plan by reason of increases in benefits, establishment of new benefits, changing the rate of benefit accrual, or changing the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable; and


(iii) Would not be permitted to take effect under the rules of section 436(c) if those rules were applied—


(A) By treating the increase in the target normal cost for the plan year attributable to the amendment (and all other amendments that must be taken into account solely because of the application of the rules in this paragraph (d)(2)) as if the increase were an increase in the funding target for the plan year; and


(B) By taking into account all unpredictable contingent event benefits permitted to be paid for unpredictable contingent events that occurred during the current plan year and all plan amendments that took effect in the current plan year (including all amendments to which this paragraph (d)(2) applies for the plan year).


(3) *Allocation of benefits attributable to plan amendments.* If a plan amendment is taken into account for a plan year under the rules of this paragraph (d), then the allocation of benefits that is used to determine the funding target and the target normal cost for that plan year is based on the plan as amended. Thus, if an amendment that is taken into account for a plan year increases a participant's accrued benefit for service prior to the beginning of the plan year, then the present value of that increase is included in the funding target for the plan year.


(e) *Plan population taken into account*—(1) *In general.* In making any determination of the funding target or target normal cost under paragraph (b) of this section, the plan population is determined as of the valuation date. The plan population must include three classes of individuals—


(i) Participants currently employed in the service of the employer;


(ii) Participants who are retired under the plan or who are otherwise no longer employed in the service of the employer; and


(iii) All other individuals currently entitled to benefits under the plan.


(2) *Assumption regarding rehiring of former employees*—(i) *Special exclusion for “rule of parity” cases.* Certain individuals may be excluded from the class of individuals described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. The excludable individuals are those former employees who, prior to the valuation date for the plan year, have terminated service with the employer without vested benefits and whose service might be taken into account in future years because the “rule of parity” of section 411(a)(6)(D) does not permit that service to be disregarded. However, if the plan's experience as to separated employees returning to service has been such that the exclusion described in this paragraph (e)(2) would be unreasonable, then no such exclusion is permitted.


(ii) *Application to partially vested participants.* Whether former employees who are terminated with partially vested benefits are assumed to return to service is determined under the same rules that apply to former employees without vested benefits under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section.


(3) *Anticipated future participants.* In making any determination of the funding target or target normal cost under paragraph (b) of this section, the actuarial assumptions and funding method used for the plan must not anticipate the affiliation with the plan of future participants not employed in the service of the employer on the plan's valuation date. However, any such determination may anticipate the affiliation with the plan of current employees who have not yet satisfied the participation (age and service) requirements of the plan as of the valuation date.


(f) *Actuarial assumptions and funding method used in determination of present value*—(1) *Selection of actuarial assumptions and funding method*—(i) *General rules.* The determination of any present value or other computation under section 430 and this section must be made on the basis of actuarial assumptions and a funding method. Except as otherwise specifically provided (for example, in § 1.430(h)(2)-1(b)(6) or section 4006(a)(3)(E)(iv) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA)), the same actuarial assumptions and funding method must be used for all computations under sections 430 and 436. For example, the actuarial assumptions and the funding method used in making a certification of the adjusted funding target attainment percentage for a plan year must be the same as those disclosed on the actuarial report under section 6059 (Schedule SB, “Single-Employer Defined Benefit Plan Actuarial Information” of Form 5500, “Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan”).


(ii) *Changes in actuarial assumptions and funding method.* Actuarial assumptions established for a plan year cannot subsequently be changed for that plan year unless the Commissioner determines that the assumptions that were used are unreasonable. Similarly, a funding method established for a plan year cannot subsequently be changed for that plan year unless the Commissioner determines that the use of that funding method for that plan year is impermissible.


(iii) *Procedures for establishing actuarial assumptions and funding method.* For purposes of this paragraph (f)(1), in the case of a plan for which an actuarial report under section 6059 (Schedule SB of Form 5500) is required to be filed for a plan year, actuarial assumptions and the funding method are established by the filing of the actuarial report if it is filed no later than the due date (with extensions) for the report. In the case of a plan for which an actuarial report for a plan year is not required to be filed, actuarial assumptions and the funding method are established by the delivery of the completed report to the employer if it is delivered no later than what would be the due date (with extensions) for filing the actuarial report were such a filing required. If the actuarial report is not filed or delivered by the applicable date described in the two preceding sentences, then the same actuarial assumptions (such as the same interest rate and mortality table elections) and funding method as were used for the preceding plan year apply for all computations under sections 430 and 436 for the current plan year, unless the Commissioner permits or requires other actuarial assumptions or another funding method permitted under section 430 to be used for the current plan year.


(iv) *Scope of funding method.* A plan's funding method includes not only the overall funding method used by the plan but also each specific method of computation used in applying the overall method. However, the choice of which actuarial assumptions are appropriate to the overall method or to the specific method of computation is not a part of the funding method. The assumed earnings rate used for purposes of determining the actuarial value of assets under section 430(g)(3)(B) is treated as an actuarial assumption, rather than as part of the funding method.


(2) *Interest and mortality rates.* Section 430(h)(2) and § 1.430(h)(2)-1 set forth the interest rates, and section 430(h)(3) and §§ 1.430(h)(3)-1 and 1.430(h)(3)-2 set forth the mortality tables, that must be used for purposes of determining any present value under this section. However, notwithstanding the requirement to use the mortality tables, in the case of a plan which has fewer than 100 participants and beneficiaries who are not in pay status, the actuarial assumptions may assume no pre-retirement mortality, but only if that assumption would be a reasonable assumption.


(3) *Other assumptions.* In the case of actuarial assumptions other than those specified in sections 430(h)(2), 430(h)(3), and 430(i), each of those actuarial assumptions must be reasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations). In addition, the actuarial assumptions (other than those specified in sections 430(h)(2), 430(h)(3), and 430(i)) must, in combination, offer the plan's enrolled actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan based on information determined as of the valuation date. *See* paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section for special rules for determining the present value of a single-sum and similar distributions.


(4) *Probability of benefit payments in single sum or other optional forms*—(i) *In general.* This paragraph (f)(4) provides rules relating to the probability that benefit payments will be paid as single sums or other optional forms under a plan and the impact of that probability on the determination of the present value of those benefit payments under section 430.


(ii) *General rules of application.* Any determination of present value or any other computation under this section must take into account—


(A) The probability that future benefit payments under the plan will be made in the form of any optional form of benefit provided under the plan (including single-sum distributions), determined on the basis of the plan's experience and other related assumptions, in accordance with paragraph (f)(3) of this section; and


(B) Any difference in the present value of future benefit payments that results from the use of actuarial assumptions in determining the amount of benefit payments in any such optional form of benefit that are different from those prescribed by section 430(h).


(iii) *Single-sum and similar distributions*—(A) *Distributions using section 417(e) assumptions.* In the case of a distribution that is subject to section 417(e)(3) and that is determined using the applicable interest rates and applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3), for purposes of applying paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section, the computation of the present value of that distribution is treated as having taken into account any difference in present value that results from the use of actuarial assumptions that are different from those prescribed by section 430(h) (as required under paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(B) of this section) if and only if the present value of the distribution is determined in accordance with this paragraph (f)(4)(iii).


(B) *Substitution of annuity form.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (f)(4)(iii), the present value of a distribution is determined in accordance with this paragraph (f)(4)(iii) if that present value is determined as the present value, using special actuarial assumptions, of the annuity (either the deferred or immediate annuity) which is used under the plan to determine the amount of the distribution. Under these special assumptions, for the period beginning with the expected annuity starting date for the distribution, the current applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3) that would apply to a distribution with an annuity starting date occurring on the valuation date is substituted for the mortality table under section 430(h)(3) that would otherwise be used. In addition, under these special assumptions, the valuation interest rates under section 430(h)(2) are used for purposes of discounting the projected annuity payments from their expected payment dates to the valuation date (as opposed to the interest rates under section 417(e)(3) which the plan uses to determine the amount of the benefit).


(C) *Optional application of generational mortality and phase-in of interest rates.* In determining the present value of a distribution under this paragraph (f)(4)(iii), if a plan uses the generational mortality tables under § 1.430(h)(3)-1(a)(4) or § 1.430(h)(3)-2, the plan is permitted to use a 50-50 male-female blend of the annuitant mortality rates under the § 1.430(h)(3)-1(a)(4) generational mortality tables in lieu of the applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3) that would apply to a distribution with an annuity starting date occurring on the valuation date. Similarly, a plan is permitted to make adjustments to the interest rates in order to reflect differences between the phase-in of the section 430(h)(2) segment rates under section 430(h)(2)(G) and the adjustments to the segment rates under section 417(e)(3)(D)(iii).


(D) *Distributions subject to section 417(e)(3) using other assumptions.* In the case of a distribution that is subject to section 417(e)(3) but that is determined on a basis other than using the applicable interest rates and the applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3), for purposes of applying paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, the computation of present value must take into account the extent to which the present value of the distribution is different from the present value determined using the rules of paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) of this section, based on actuarial assumptions that satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this section. If the plan provides that the amount of the benefit is based on a comparison of the section 417(e)(3) benefit (that is, the benefit determined using the applicable interest rates and the applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3)) with another benefit determined using some other basis, then paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(B) of this section is applied as of the valuation date by comparing the present value of the section 417(e)(3) benefit determined under the rules of paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) of this section with the present value of the other benefit. The rule of this paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(D) applies, for example, where a distribution that is subject to section 417(e)(3) is determined as the greater of the benefit determined using the applicable interest rates and the applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3) and the benefit determined using some other basis, or where the amount of a distribution that is subject to section 417(e)(3) is determined using an interest rate other than the applicable interest rates as required under section 415(b)(2)(E)(ii) (*see* § 1.417(e)-1(d)(1)).


(5) *Distributions from applicable defined benefit plans under section 411(a)(13)(C)*—(i) *In general.* In the case of an applicable defined benefit plan described in section 411(a)(13)(C), if the amount of a future distribution is based on an interest adjustment applied to the current accumulated benefit, then the amount of that distribution is determined by projecting the future interest credits or equivalent amount under the plan's interest crediting rules using actuarial assumptions that satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this section. Thus, if a plan provides for a single-sum distribution equal to the balance of a participant's hypothetical account under a cash balance plan, then the amount of that future distribution is equal to the projected account balance at the expected date of payment determined using actuarial assumptions that satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this section.


(ii) *Annuity distributions*—(A) *General rule.* In the case of an applicable defined benefit plan described in section 411(a)(13)(C), if the amount of an annuity distribution is based on either the balance of a hypothetical account maintained for a participant or the accumulated percentage of a participant's final average compensation, then the amount of that annuity distribution is calculated by converting the projected account balance (or accumulated percentage of final average compensation), in accordance with paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section, to an annuity by applying the plan's annuity conversion provisions using the rules of this paragraph (f)(5)(ii).


(B) *Use of current annuity factors.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(C) of this section, if the plan bases the conversion of the projected account balance (or accumulated percentage of final average compensation) to an annuity using the applicable interest rates and applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3), then the amount of the annuity distribution is determined by dividing the projected account balance (or accumulated percentage of final average compensation) by an annuity factor corresponding to the assumed form of payment using, for the period beginning with the annuity starting date, the current applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3) that would apply to a distribution with an annuity starting date occurring on the valuation date (in lieu of the mortality table under section 430(h)(3) that would otherwise be used) and the valuation interest rates under section 430(h)(2) (as opposed to the interest rates under section 417(e)(3) which the plan uses to determine the amount of the annuity).


(C) *Optional application of generational mortality and phase-in of segment rates.* In determining the amount of an annuity distribution under paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, a plan is permitted to apply the options described in paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(C) of this section.


(D) *Distributions using assumptions other than assumptions under section 417(e)(3).* In applying this paragraph (f)(5)(ii), in the case of a plan that determines an annuity using a basis other than the applicable interest rates and applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3), the amount of the annuity distribution must be based on actuarial assumptions that satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this section.


(6) *Unpredictable contingent event benefits.* Any determination of present value or any other computation under this section must take into account, based on information as of the valuation date, the probability that future benefits (or increased benefits) will become payable under the plan due to the occurrence of an unpredictable contingent event (as described in § 1.436-1(j)(9)). For this purpose, this probability with respect to an unpredictable contingent event may be assumed to be zero if there is not more than a de minimis likelihood that the unpredictable contingent event will occur.


(7) *Reasonable techniques permitted*—(i) *Determination of benefits to be paid during the plan year.* Any reasonable technique can be used to determine the present value of the benefits expected to be paid during a plan year, based on the interest rates and mortality assumptions applicable for the plan year. For example, the present value of a monthly retirement annuity payable at the beginning of each month can be determined—


(A) Using the standard actuarial approximation that reflects 13/24ths of the discounted expected payments for the year as of the beginning of the year and 11/24ths of the discounted expected payments for the year as of the end of the year;


(B) By assuming a uniform distribution of death during the year; or


(C) By assuming that the payment is made in the middle of the year.


(ii) *Determination of target normal cost.* In the case of a participant for whom there is a less than 100 percent probability that the participant will terminate employment during the plan year, for purposes of determining the benefits expected to accrue, be earned, or otherwise allocated to service during the plan year which are used to determine the target normal cost, it is permissible to assume the participant will not terminate during the plan year, unless using this method of calculation would be unreasonable.


(8) *Approval of significant changes in actuarial assumptions for large plans*—(i) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(8)(iii) of this section, any actuarial assumptions used to determine the funding target of a plan for a plan year during which the plan is described in paragraph (f)(8)(ii) of this section cannot be changed from the actuarial assumptions that were used for the preceding plan year without the approval of the Commissioner if the changes in assumptions result in a decrease in the plan's funding shortfall (within the meaning of section 430(c)(4)) for the current plan year (disregarding the effect on the plan's funding shortfall resulting from changes in interest and mortality assumptions under sections 430(h)(2) and (h)(3)) that either exceeds $50,000,000, or exceeds $5,000,000 and is 5 percent or more of the funding target of the plan before such change.


(ii) *Affected plans.* A plan is described in this paragraph (f)(8)(ii) for a plan year if—


(A) The plan is a defined benefit plan (other than a multiemployer plan) to which title IV of ERISA applies; and


(B) The aggregate unfunded vested benefits used to determine variable-rate premiums for the plan year (as determined under section 4006(a)(3)(E)(iii) of ERISA) of the plan and all other plans maintained by the contributing sponsors (as defined in section 4001(a)(13) of ERISA) and members of such sponsors' controlled groups (as defined in section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA) which are covered by title IV of ERISA (disregarding multiemployer plans and disregarding plans with no unfunded vested benefits) exceed $50,000,000.


(iii) *Automatic approval to resume use of previously used assumptions upon exiting at-risk status during phase-in.* A plan that is not in at-risk status for the current plan year and that was in at-risk status for the prior plan year (but not for a period of 5 or more consecutive plan years) is granted automatic approval to use the actuarial assumptions that were applied before the plan entered at-risk status and that were used in combination with the required at-risk assumptions during the period the plan was in at-risk status.


(9) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the rules of this section. Unless otherwise indicated, these examples are based on the following assumptions: The normal retirement age is 65, the minimum required contribution for the plan is determined under the rules of section 430 starting in 2008, the plan year is the calendar year, the valuation date is January 1, no plan-related expenses are paid or expected to be paid from plan assets, and the plan does not provide for mandatory employee contributions. The examples are as follows:


(g) *Effective/applicability dates and transition rules*—(1) *Statutory effective date/applicability date*—(i) *In general.* Section 430 generally applies to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2008. The applicability of section 430 for purposes of determining the minimum required contribution is delayed for certain plans in accordance with sections 104 through 106 of PPA '06.


(ii) *Applicability of special adjustments.* The special adjustments of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section (relating to adjustments to the target normal cost for plan-related expenses and mandatory employee contributions) apply to plan years beginning after December 31, 2008. In addition, a plan sponsor may elect to make the special adjustments of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section for a plan year beginning in 2008. This election must take into account both adjustments described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. This election is subject to the same rules that apply to an election to add an amount to the plan's prefunding balance pursuant to § 1.430(f)-1(f), and it must be made in the same manner as the election made under § 1.430(f)-1(f). Thus, the election can be made no later than the last day for making the minimum required contribution for the plan year to which the election relates.


(2) *Effective date/applicability date of regulations.* This section applies to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2010, regardless of whether section 430 applies to determine the minimum required contribution for the plan year. For plan years beginning before January 1, 2010, plans are permitted to rely on the provisions set forth in this section for purposes of satisfying the requirements of section 430.


(3) *Approval for changes in funding method*—(i) *2008 plan year.* Any changes in a plan's funding method that are made for the first plan year beginning in 2008 that are not inconsistent with the requirements of section 430 are treated as having been approved by the Commissioner and do not require the Commissioner's specific prior approval.


(ii) *Application of this section*—(A) *First plan year for which regulations are effective.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, any change in a plan's funding method for the first plan year that begins on or after January 1, 2010, is treated as having been approved by the Commissioner and does not require the Commissioner's specific prior approval.


(B) *Optional earlier application of regulations.* For the first plan year that a plan applies all the provisions of this section, §§ 1.430(f)-1, 1.430(g)-1, 1.430(i)-1, and 1.436-1, any change in a plan's funding method for that plan year is treated as having been approved by the Commissioner and does not require the Commissioner's specific prior approval. For example, if the change in funding method includes a change in the valuation software, the change in the valuation software is treated as having been approved by the Commissioner and does not require the Commissioner's specific prior approval. If that plan year begins before January 1, 2010, the automatic approval for a change in funding method under paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(A) of this section does not apply to the plan.


(C) *Special rule for changes in allocation.* Any change in a plan's funding method for a plan year earlier than the first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2010, that is necessary to apply the rules of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section is treated as having been approved by the Commissioner and does not require the Commissioner's specific prior approval.


(iii) *First plan year for which section 430 applies to determine minimum funding.* For a plan for which the minimum required contribution is not determined under section 430 for the first plan year that begins on or after January 1, 2008, pursuant to sections 104 through 106 of PPA '06, any change in a plan's funding method for the first plan year to which section 430 applies to determine the plan's minimum required contribution is treated as having been approved by the Commissioner and does not require the Commissioner's specific prior approval.


(4) *Approval for changes in actuarial assumptions.* The Commissioner's specific prior approval is not required with respect to any actuarial assumptions that are adopted for the first plan year for which section 430 applies to determine the minimum required contribution for the plan and that are not inconsistent with the requirements of section 430.


(5) *Transition rule for determining funding target attainment percentage for the 2007 plan year*—(i) *In general.* For purposes of the first plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2008, the funding target attainment percentage for the plan's prior plan year (the 2007 plan year) is determined as the fraction (expressed as a percentage), the numerator of which is the value of plan assets determined under paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section, and the denominator of which is the plan's current liability determined pursuant to section 412(l)(7) (as in effect prior to amendment by PPA '06) as of the valuation date for the 2007 plan year.


(ii) *Determination of value of plan assets*—(A) *In general.* The value of plan assets for the 2007 plan year under this paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(A) is determined as the value of plan assets as described in paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, reduced by the plan's funding standard account credit balance for the 2007 plan year as described in paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section except to the extent provided in paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(B) of this section.


(B) *Value of plan assets.* The value of plan assets for the 2007 plan year under this paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(B) is determined under section 412(c)(2) as in effect for the 2007 plan year, except that the value of plan assets prior to subtracting the plan's funding standard account credit balance described in paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section must be adjusted so that it is neither less than 90 percent of the fair market value of plan assets nor greater than 110 percent of the fair market value of plan assets on the valuation date for that plan year. If the value of plan assets prior to adjustment under this paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(B) is less than 90 percent of the fair market value of plan assets on the valuation date, then the value of plan assets under this paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(B) is equal to 90 percent of the fair market value of plan assets. If the value of plan assets determined under this paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(B) is greater than 110 percent of the fair market value of plan assets on the valuation date, then the value of plan assets under this paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(B) is equal to 110 percent of the fair market value of plan assets.


(iii) *Subtraction of credit balance*—(A) *In general.* If a plan has a funding standard account credit balance as of the valuation date for the 2007 plan year, then, except as described in paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(B) of this section, that balance is subtracted from the value of plan assets described in paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(B) of this section as of that valuation date to determine the value of plan assets for the 2007 plan year. However, the value of plan assets is not reduced below zero.


(B) *Effect of funding standard carryover balance reduction for the 2008 plan year.* Notwithstanding the rules of paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, for the first plan year beginning in 2008, if the employer has made an election to reduce some or all of the funding standard carryover balance as of the first day of that year in accordance with § 1.430(f)-1(e), then the present value (determined as of the valuation date for the 2007 plan year using the valuation interest rate for that 2007 plan year) of the amount so reduced is not treated as part of the funding standard account credit balance when that balance is subtracted from the value of plan assets pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section.
