# § 1.6033-2   Returns by exempt organizations and returns by certain nonexempt organizations.

(a) *In general.* (1) Except as provided in section 6033(a)(3) and paragraph (g) of this section, every organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a) shall file an annual information return specifically setting forth its items of gross income, gross receipts and disbursements, and such other information as may be prescribed in the instructions, issued with respect to the return. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, such return shall be filed annually regardless of whether such organization is chartered by, or affiliated or associated with, any central, parent, or other organization.


(2)(i) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph and paragraph (g) of this section, every organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a), and required to file a return under section 6033 and this section (including, for taxable years ending before December 31, 1972, private foundations, as defined in section 509(a)), other than an organization described in section 401(a) or 501(d), shall file its annual return on Form 990. For taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1972, every private foundation shall file Form 990-PF as its annual information return. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1977, every section 501(c)(21) black lung trust shall file an annual information return on Form 990-BL or any other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service for that purpose.






(ii) Subject to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the information generally required to be furnished by an organization exempt under section 501(a) is:


(A) Its gross income for the year. For this purpose, gross income includes tax-exempt income, but does not include contributions, gifts, grants, and similar amounts received. Whether an item constitutes a contribution, gift, grant, or similar amount depends upon all the surrounding facts and circumstances. The computation of gross income shall be made by subtracting the cost of goods sold from all receipts other than gross contributions, gifts, grants, and similar amounts received and nonincludible dues and assessments from members and affiliates.


(B) To the extent not included in gross income, its dues and assessments from members and affiliates for the year.


(C) Its expenses incurred within the year attributable to gross income.


(D) Its disbursements (including prior years' accumulations) made within the year for the purposes for which it is exempt.


(E) A balance sheet showing its assets, liabilities, and net worth as of the beginning and end of such year. Detailed information relating to the assets, liabilities, and net worth shall be furnished on the schedule provided for this purpose on the return required by this section. Such schedule shall be supplemented by attachments where appropriate.


(F) The total of the contributions, gifts, grants, and similar amounts received by it during the taxable year, and, in the case of an organization described in section 501(c)(3), the names and addresses of all persons that contributed, bequeathed, or devised $5,000 or more (in money or other property) during the taxable year. In the case of a private foundation (as defined in section 509(a)), the names and addresses of all persons who became substantial contributors (as defined in section 507(d)(2)) during the taxable year shall be furnished. In addition, for its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, each private foundation shall furnish the names and addresses of all persons who became substantial contributors before such taxable year. For special rules with respect to contributors and donors, see paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.




(G) The names and addresses of all officers, directors, or trustees (or any person having responsibilities or powers similar to those of officers, directors or trustees) of the organization, and, in the case of a private foundation, all persons who are foundation managers, within the meaning of section 4946(b)(1). Organizations must also attach a schedule showing the names and addresses and/or total numbers of key employees, highly compensated employees, and independent contractors as prescribed by publication, form, or instructions.


(H) A schedule showing the compensation and other payments made to each person whose name is required to be listed pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(G) of this section during the calendar year ending within the organization's annual accounting period, or during such other period as prescribed by publication, form, or instructions.








(I) For any taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1971, such information as is required by Forms 4848 and 4849 and, only with respect to any such taxable year ending before December 31, 1972, such information as is required by Form 2950. Such forms are required by this section to be filed by an organization exempt from tax under section 501(a) which is an employer who maintains a funded pension or annuity plan for its employees. See paragraph (g) of this section for exceptions from filing. Form 4849 need not be filed by the organization if the fiduciary for the plan has given written notification to the organization that such form will be filed as an attachment to Form 990-P filed by the fiduciary. Form 4848 (and Form 4849 if required to be filed by the organization) shall be filed as a separate return on or before the due date for Form 990. For rules relating to the extension of time for filing, see section 6081 and the regulations thereunder and the instructions for Form 4848. A central organization which files Form 990 as a group return under paragraph (d) of this section may also file Form 4848 as a group return. The rules provided by paragraph (d) of this section with respect to a group return filed on Form 990 shall apply to a group return filed on Form 4848. Unless otherwise expressly provided therein, an authorization to include a local organization in a group for purposes of filing Form 990 as a group return shall be treated as an authorization to include such local organization in a group for purposes of filing Form 4848 as a group return. A group return on Form 4848 shall be filed in accordance with this section and the instructions to Form 4848 and shall be considered the return of each local organization included therein. In addition to the information required to be furnished by Forms 4848 and 4849, the district director may require any further information that he considers necessary to determine qualification of the plan under section 401 or the taxability under section 403(b) of a beneficiary under an annuity purchased by a section 501(c)(3) organization.

(*1*) Section 4911 (relating to tax on excess expenditures to influence legislation);


(*2*) Section 4912 (relating to tax on disqualifying lobbying expenditures of certain organizations); and


(*3*) Section 4955 (relating to taxes on political expenditures of section 501(c)(3) organizations), except to the extent that, by reason of section 4962, the taxes imposed under such section are not required to be paid or are credited or refunded.






(L) In the case of organizations described in section 501(c)(3), (4), or (29), the respective amounts (if any) of—


(*1*) The taxes imposed with respect to the organization on any organization manager, or any disqualified person, during the taxable year under section 4958 (relating to taxes on excess benefit transactions); and


(*2*) Reimbursements paid by the organization during the taxable year with respect to taxes imposed under such section, except to the extent that, by reason of section 4962, the taxes imposed under such section are not required to be paid or are credited or refunded.














(M) Its lobbying expenditures, grass roots expenditures, exempt purpose expenditures, lobbying nontaxable amount, and grass roots nontaxable amount for the taxable year and for prior taxable years that are base years (within the meaning of § 1.501(h)-3(c)(7)), if the organization has an election under section 501(h) in effect for the taxable year. An organization that is a member of an affiliated group of organizations (as defined in § 56.4911-7(e)) but that is not a member of a limited affiliated group (as defined in § 56.4911-10(b)) shall report this information based on the expenditures of all members of the group during the taxable year of the group that ends with or within the member's taxable year and for prior taxable years of the group that are base years (within the meaning of § 56.4911-9(b)). For additional information required to be furnished by members of an affiliated group of organizations, and by controlling members in a limited affiliated group, see §§ 56.4911-9(d) and 56.4911-10(f)(1), respectively.


(N) In the case of a hospital organization (as defined in § 1.501(r)-1(b)(18)) described in section 501(c)(3) during the taxable year—


(*1*) A copy of its audited financial statements for the taxable year (or, in the case of an organization the financial statements of which are included in consolidated financial statements with other organizations, such consolidated financial statements);


(*2*) Either a copy of the most recently adopted implementation strategy, within the meaning of § 1.501(r)-3(c), for each hospital facility it operates or the URL of each Web page where it has made each such implementation strategy widely available on a Web site within the meaning of § 1.501(r)-1(b)(29) along with or as part of the report documenting the community health needs assessment (CHNA) to which the implementation strategy relates;


(*3*) For each hospital facility it operates, a description of the actions taken during the taxable year to address the significant health needs identified through its most recently conducted CHNA, within the meaning of § 1.501(r)-3(b), or, if no actions were taken with respect to one or more of these health needs, the reason(s) why no actions were taken; and


(*4*) The amount of the excise tax imposed on the organization under section 4959 during the taxable year.


(iii) *Special rules.* In providing the names and addresses of contributors and donors under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(F) of this section:


(A) An organization described in section 501(c)(3) which meets the 33
1/3 percent-of-support test of the regulations under section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) (without regard to whether such organization otherwise qualifies as an organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)) is required to provide the name and address of a person who contributed, bequeathed, or devised $5,000 or more during the year only if his amount is in excess of 2 percent of the total contributions, bequests and devises received by the organization during the year.


(B) An organization other than a private foundation is required to report only the names and addresses of contributors of whom it has actual knowledge. For instance, an organization need not require an employer who withholds contributions from the compensation of employees and pays over to the organization periodically the total amounts withheld, to specify the amounts paid over with respect to a particular employee. In such case, unless the organization has actual knowledge that a particular employee gave more than $5,000 (and in excess of 2 percent if paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section is applicable), the organization need report only the name and address of the employer, and the total amount paid over by the employer.










(C) Separate and independent gifts made by one person in a particular year need be aggregated to determine whether his contributions and bequests exceed $5,000 (and are in excess of 2 percent if paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section is applicable), only if such gifts are of $1,000 or more.


(D)(*1*) Organizations described in section 501(c)(7), (8), or (10) that receive contributions or bequests to be used exclusively for purposes described in section 170(c)(4), 2055(a)(3), or 2522(a)(3), must attach a schedule with respect to all gifts that aggregate more than $1,000 from any one person showing the total amount of the contributions or bequests from each such person, the specific purpose or purposes for which such amount was received, and the specific use or uses to which such amount was put. 

 In the case of an amount set aside for such purposes, the organization shall indicate the manner in which such amount is held (for instance, whether such amount is commingled with amounts held for other purposes). If the contribution or bequest was transferred to another organization, the schedule must include the name of the transferee organization, a description of the nature of such organization, and a description of the relationship between the transferee and transferor organizations.


(*2*) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1970, such organizations must also attach a statement showing the total dollar amount of contributions and bequests received for such purposes which are $1,000 or less.








(iv) *Listing of States.* A private foundation is required to attach to its return required by this section a list of all States:


(A) To which the organization reports in any fashion concerning its organization, assets, or activities, or


(B) With which the organization has registered (or which it has otherwise notified in any manner) that it intends to be, or is, a charitable organization or a holder of property devoted to a charitable purpose.


(3)(i) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, and ending before December 31, 1971, every employee's trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) shall file an annual return on Form 990-P. The return shall include the information required by paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of § 1.401-1. For such years, in addition, the trust must file the information required to be filed by the employer pursuant to the provisions of § 1.404(a)-2, unless the employer has notified the trustee in writing that he has filed or will timely file such information. If the trustee has received such notification from the employer, then such notification, or a copy thereof, shall be retained by the trust as a part of its records.


(ii) For taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1971, and before December 31, 1975, every employee's trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) shall file an annual return on Form 990-P. The trust shall furnish such information as is required by such form and the instructions issued with respect thereto.








(4) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1980, trusts described in section 4947(a)(1) and nonexempt private foundations shall comply with the requirements of section 6033 and this section in the same manner as organizations described in section 501(c)(3) which are exempt from tax under section 501(a). This section shall be applied for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1980 as if trusts described in section 4947(a)(1) and nonexempt private foundations were described in section 501(c)(3). Therefore, for purposes of this section, all references to exempt organizations shall include section 4947(a)(1) trusts and nonexempt private foundations and all references to private foundations shall include section 4947(a)(1) trusts that would be private foundations if they were described in section 501(c)(3) and all nonexempt private foundations. Similarly, for purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(d), the purposes for which a section 4947(a)(1) trust or a nonexempt private foundation is organized shall be treated as the purposes for which it is exempt. Similarly, for purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(D) of this section, the purposes for which a section 4947(a)(1) trust or a nonexempt private foundation is organized shall be treated as the purposes for which it is exempt. See section 509(b) and § 1.509(b)-1. See also section 642(c)(6) and § 1.642(c)-4.








(5) Political organizations, as defined by section 527(e)(1), that have gross receipts of $25,000 or more for the taxable year (or in the case of a qualified State or local political organization, as defined in section 527(e)(5), that has gross receipts of $100,000 or more for the taxable year) generally must comply with the requirements of section 6033 and this section in the same manner as organizations exempt from tax under section 501(a), except to the extent that the Commissioner may modify such requirements through forms, instructions to forms, or guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin as appropriate for carrying out the purposes of section 527. For the purposes of this section, all references to organizations exempt from tax under section 501(a) shall include political organizations referred to in section 6033(g), other than those referred to in section 6033(g)(3) and except to the extent the Commissioner exercises discretion under section 6033(g)(4). This discretion may be exercised through forms, instructions to forms, or guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. In addition to the reporting requirements applicable to organizations exempt under section 501(a), such political organizations generally must report the names and addresses of all persons that contributed, bequeathed, or devised $5,000 or more (in money or other property) during the taxable year.


(6) Each controlling organization (within the meaning of section 512(b)(13)) that is subject to the requirements of section 6033(a) shall include on its annual return such information required by that return regarding—


(i) Any interest, annuities, royalties, or rents received from each controlled entity (within the meaning of section 512(b)(13));


(ii) Any loans made to each such controlled entity; and


(iii) Any transfers of funds between such controlling organization and each such controlled entity.


(7) Every organization described in section 4966(d)(1) shall, on its annual return for the taxable year—


(i) List the total number of donor advised funds (as defined in section 4966(d)(2)) it owns at the end of such taxable year;


(ii) Report the aggregate value of assets held in such funds at the end of such taxable year; and


(iii) Report the aggregate contributions to and grants made from such funds during such taxable year.


(8) Every organization described in section 509(a)(3) shall, on its annual return—


(i) List the supported organizations (as defined in section 509(f)(3)) with respect to which such organization provides support;


(ii) Specify whether the organization meets the requirements of clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of section 509(a)(3)(B); and


(iii) Certify that the organization meets the requirements of section 509(a)(3)(C).




















(b) *Accounting period for filing return.* A return required by this section shall be on the basis of the established annual accounting period of the organization. If the organization has no such established accounting period, such return shall be on the basis of the calendar year.


(c) *Returns when exempt status not established.* An organization claiming an exempt status under section 501(a) prior to the establishment of such exempt status under section 501 and § 1.501(a)-1, shall file a return required by this section in accordance with the instructions applicable thereto. In such case the organization must indicate on such return that it is being filed in the belief that the organization is exempt under section 501(a), but that the Internal Revenue Service has not yet recognized such exemption.






(d) *Group returns.* (1) A central, parent, or like organization (referred to in this paragraph as “central organization”), exempt under section 501(a) and described in section 501(c) (other than a private foundation), although required to file a separate annual return for itself under section 6033 and paragraph (a) of this section, may file annually, in addition to such separate annual return, a group return on Form 990. Such group return may be filed for two or more of the local organizations, chapters, or the like (referred to in this paragraph as “local organizations”) which are (i) affiliated with such central organization at the close of its annual accounting period, (ii) subject to the general supervision or control of the central organization, and (iii) exempt from taxation under the same paragraph of section 501(c) of the Code, although the local organizations are not necessarily exempt under the paragraph under which the central organization is exempt. Such group return may not be filed for a local organization which is a private foundation.


(2)(i) The filing of the group return shall be in lieu of the filing of a separate return by each of the local organizations included in the group return. The group return shall include only those local organizations which in writing have authorized the central organization to include them in the group return, and which have made and filed, with the central organization, their statements, specifically stating their items of gross income, receipts, and disbursements, and such other information relating to them as is required to be stated in the group return. Such an authorization and statement by a local organization shall be made under the penalties of perjury, shall be signed by a duly authorized officer of the local organization in his official capacity, and shall contain the following statement, or a statement of like import: “I hereby declare under the penalties of perjury that this authorization (including any accompanying schedules and statements) has been examined by me and to the best of my knowledge and belief is true, correct and complete and made in good faith.” Such authorization and statement with respect to a local organization shall be retained by the central organization until the expiration of 6 years after the last taxable year for which a group return filed by such central organization includes such local organization.


(ii) There shall be attached to the group return and made a part thereof a schedule showing the name, address, and employer identification number of each of the local organizations and the total number thereof included in such return, and a schedule showing the name, address, and employer identification number of each of the local organizations and the total number thereof not included in the group return.


(3) The group return shall be on the basis of the established annual accounting period of the central organization. Where such central organization has no established annual accounting period, such return shall be on the basis of the calendar year. The same income, receipts, and disbursements of a local organization shall not be included in more than one group return.


(4) The group return shall be filed in accordance with these regulations and the instructions issued with respect to Form 990, and shall be considered the return of each local organization included therein. The tax exempt status of a local organization must be established under a group exemption letter issued to the central organization before a group return including the local organization will be considered as the return of the local organization. See § 1.501(a)-1 for requirements for establishing a tax-exempt status.








(5) In providing the information required by paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(F), (G), and (H) of this section, such information may be provided:




(i) With respect to the central or parent organization on its Form 990, and with respect to the local organizations on separate schedules attached to the group return for the year, or


(ii) On a consolidated basis for all the local organizations and the central or parent organization on the group return.


(e) *Time and place for filing.* The annual return required by this section shall be filed on or before the 15th day of the fifth month following the close of the period for which the return is required to be filed. The annual return on Form 1065 required to be filed by a religious or apostolic association or corporation shall be filed on or before the date prescribed by section 6072(b). Each such return shall be filed in accordance with the instructions applicable thereto.




(f) *Penalties and additions to tax.* For penalties and additions to tax for failure to file a return and filing a false or fraudulent return, see sections 6652, 7203, 7206, and 7207.






(g) *Organizations not required to file annual returns.* (1) Annual returns required by this section are not required to be filed by an organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a) which is:

(ii) An exclusively religious activity of any religious order;


(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(1)(viii) of this section, an organization described in section 501(c) (other than a private foundation or a supporting organization described in section 509(a)(3)) the gross receipts of which in each taxable year are normally not more than $50,000 (as described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section);










(iv) A mission society (other than an organization described in section 509(a)(3)) sponsored by or affiliated with one or more churches or church denominations, more than one-half of the activities of which society are conducted in, or directed at persons in foreign countries;

(B) That has no significant activity (including lobbying and political activity and the operation of a trade or business, but excluding investment activity) in the United States.








(2) The provisions of section 6033(a) relieving certain specified types of organizations exempt from taxation under section 501(a) from filing annual returns do not abridge or impair in any way the powers and authority of district directors or directors of service centers provided for in other provisions of the Code and in regulations thereunder to require the filing of returns or notices by such organizations. See section 6001 and § 1.6001-1.


(3) For purposes of paragraphs (g)(1)(iii) and (viii) of this section, the gross receipts (as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) of an organization are normally not more than $50,000 if:


(i) In the case of an organization that has been in existence for 1 year or less, the organization has received, or donors have pledged to give, gross receipts of $75,000 or less during the first taxable year of the organization;


(ii) In the case of an organization that has been in existence for more than one but less than 3 years, the average of the gross receipts received by the organization in its first 2 taxable years is $60,000 or less; and

(4) For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (a)(2) of this section, “gross receipts” means the gross amount received by the organization during its annual accounting period from all sources without reduction for any costs or expenses including, for example, cost of goods or assets sold, cost of operations, or expenses of earning, raising, or collecting such amounts. Thus “gross receipts” includes, but is not limited to (i) the gross amount received as contributions, gifts, grants, and similar amounts without reduction for the expenses of raising and collecting such amounts, (ii) the gross amount received as dues or assessments from members or affiliated organizations without reduction for expenses attributable to the receipt of such amounts, (iii) gross sales or receipts from business activities (including business activities unrelated to the purpose for which the organization qualifies for exemption, the net income or loss from which may be required to be reported on Form 990-T), (iv) the gross amount received from the sale of assets without reduction for cost or other basis and expenses of sale, and (v) the gross amount received as investment income, such as interest, dividends, rents, and royalties.






(5) An organization that is not required to file an annual return by virtue of paragraphs (g)(1)(iii) and (viii) of this section must submit an annual electronic notification as described in section 6033(i). See § 1.6033-6.




(6) The Commissioner may relieve any organization or class of organizations (other than an organization described in section 509(a)(3)) from filing, in whole or in part the annual return required by this section where he determines that such returns are not necessary for the efficient administration of the internal revenue laws. This discretion may be exercised through forms, instructions to forms, or guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.












(h) *Integrated auxiliary*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of this title, the *term integrated auxiliary of a church* means an organization that is—


(i) Described both in sections 501(c)(3) and 509(a) (1), (2), or (3);


(ii) Affiliated with a church or a convention or association of churches; and


(iii) Internally supported.


(2) *Affiliation.* An organization is affiliated with a church or a convention or association of churches, for purposes of paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section, if—


(i) The organization is covered by a group exemption letter issued under applicable administrative procedures, (such as Rev. Proc. 80-27 (1980-1 C.B. 677); See § 601.601(a)(2)(ii)(*b*)), to a church or a convention or association of churches;


(ii) The organization is operated, supervised, or controlled by or in connection with (as defined in § 1.509(a)-4) a church or a convention or association of churches; or


(iii) Relevant facts and circumstances show that it is so affiliated.


(3) *Facts and circumstances.* For purposes of paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section, relevant facts and circumstances that indicate an organization is affiliated with a church or a convention or association of churches include the following factors. However, the absence of one or more of the following factors does not necessarily preclude classification of an organization as being affiliated with a church or a convention or association of churches—


(i) The organization's enabling instrument (corporate charter, trust instrument, articles of association, constitution or similar document) or by-laws affirm that the organization shares common religious doctrines, principles, disciplines, or practices with a church or a convention or association of churches;


(ii) A church or a convention or association of churches has the authority to appoint or remove, or to control the appointment or removal of, at least one of the organization's officers or directors;


(iii) The corporate name of the organization indicates an institutional relationship with a church or a convention or association of churches;


(iv) The organization reports at least annually on its financial and general operations to a church or a convention or association of churches;


(v) An institutional relationship between the organization and a church or a convention or association of churches is affirmed by the church, or convention or association of churches, or a designee thereof; and


(vi) In the event of dissolution, the organization's assets are required to be distributed to a church or a convention or association of churches, or to an affiliate thereof within the meaning of this paragraph (h). 


(4) *Internal support.* An organization is internally supported, for purposes of paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section, unless it both—


(i) Offers admissions, goods, services or facilities for sale, other than on an incidental basis, to the general public (except goods, services, or facilities sold at a nominal charge or for an insubstantial portion of the cost); and


(ii) Normally receives more than 50 percent of its support from a combination of governmental sources, public solicitation of contributions, and receipts from the sale of admissions, goods, performance of services, or furnishing of facilities in activities that are not unrelated trades or businesses.


(5) *Special rule.* Men's and women's organizations, seminaries, mission societies, and youth groups that satisfy paragraphs (h)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section are integrated auxiliaries of a church regardless of whether such an organization meets the internal support requirement under paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section.


(6) *Effective date.* This paragraph (h) applies for returns filed for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969. For returns filed for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969 but beginning before December 20, 1995, the definition for the term *integrated auxiliary of a church* set forth in § 1.6033-2(g)(5) (as contained in the 26 CFR edition revised as of April 1, 1995) may be used as an alternative definition to such term set forth in this paragraph (h).


(7) *Examples of internal support.* The internal support test of this paragraph (h) is illustrated by the following examples, in each of which it is assumed that the organization's provision of goods and services does not constitute an unrelated trade or business:


(i) *Records, statements, and other returns of tax-exempt organizations.* (1) An organization that is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) and is not required to file annually an information return required by this section shall immediately notify in writing Exempt Organizations Determinations, at an address prescribed by publication (including publication on the Internal Revenue Service Web site), of any changes in its character, operations, or purpose for which it was originally created.


(2) Every organization which is exempt from tax, whether or not it is required to file an annual information return, shall submit such additional information as may be required by the Internal Revenue Service for the purpose of inquiring into its exempt status and administering the provisions of subchapter F (section 501 and following), chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Code, section 6033, and chapter 42 of subtitle D of the Code. See section 6001 and § 1.6001-1 with respect to the authority of the district directors or directors of service centers to require such additional information and with respect to the books of account or records to be kept by such organizations.


(3) An organization which has established its exemption from taxation under section 501(a), including an organization which is relieved under section 6033 and this section from filing annual returns of information, is not relieved of the duty of filing other returns of information. See, for example, sections 6041, 6043, 6051, 6057, and 6058 and the regulations thereunder.


(j) *Unrelated business tax returns.* In addition to the foregoing requirements of this section, certain organizations otherwise exempt from tax under section 501(a) which are subject to tax on unrelated business taxable income are also required to file returns on Form 990-T. See paragraph (e) of § 1.6012-2 and paragraph (a)(5) of § 1.6012-3 for requirements with respect to such returns.








(k) *Foreign organizations and United States possession organizations*—(1) *Foreign organization.* For purposes of this section, a *foreign organization* is any organization not described in section 170(c)(2)(A).


(2) *United States possession organization.* For purposes of this section, a *United States possession organization* is any organization created or organized in a possession of the United States.


(3) *Source of funds.* For purposes of paragraph (g)(1)(viii) of this section, the source of an organization's gross receipts from gifts, grants, contributions or membership fees is determined by applying the rules found in § 53.4948-1(b) of this chapter. For purposes of paragraph (g)(1)(viii) of this section, the source of an organization's gross receipts other than gifts, grants, contributions, and membership fees is determined by applying the rules in sections 861 through 865 and the regulations in this part issued under section 861 through 865. For purposes of applying this paragraph (k)(3) regarding United States possession organizations, a United States person does not include individuals who are *bona fide* residents of a United States possession.


(l) *Applicability date*—(1) *Generally.* This section applies to returns filed on or after January 30, 2020. Section 1.6033-2T (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 2019) applies to returns filed before January 30, 2020.


(2) Paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(F), (a)(2)(iii)(D)(*1*), (g)(1)(iii) and (viii), and (g)(3) of this section apply to annual information returns filed after May 28, 2020. Under section 7805(b)(7) an organization may choose to apply the paragraphs listed in this paragraph (l)(2) to returns filed after September 6, 2019.
