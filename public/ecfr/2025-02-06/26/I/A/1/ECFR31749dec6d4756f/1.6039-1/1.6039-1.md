(3) A return is required by reason of a transfer described in section 6039(a)(2) only with respect to the first transfer of legal title of the shares by the transferor, including the first transfer of legal title to a recognized broker or financial institution. If a contractual agreement exists or is entered into with a recognized broker or financial institution pursuant to which shares acquired upon exercise of the option will be immediately deposited into a brokerage account established on behalf of the transferor, then the deposit of shares by the transferor into the brokerage account following the exercise of the option is the first transfer of legal title of the shares acquired by the transferor, and the corporation is only required to file a return relating to such transfer of legal title.


(4) Every corporation that transfers any share of stock pursuant to the exercise of an option described in this paragraph shall identify such stock in a manner sufficient to enable the accurate reporting of the transfer of legal title to such shares. Such identification may be accomplished by assigning to the certificates of stock issued pursuant to the exercise of such options a special serial number or color.
