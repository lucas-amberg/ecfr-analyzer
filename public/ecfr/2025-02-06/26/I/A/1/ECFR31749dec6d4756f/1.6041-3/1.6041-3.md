Returns of information are not required under section 6041 and §§ 1.6041-1 and 1.6041-2 for payments described in paragraphs (a) through (q) of this section. See § 1.6041-4 for reporting exemptions regarding payments to foreign persons. 


(a) Payments of income required to be reported on Forms 1120-S, 941, W-2, and W-3 (however, see § 1.6041-2(a) with respect to Forms W-2 and W-3).

(h)(1) *In general.* Payments made under reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangements that meet the requirements of section 62(c) of the Code and § 1.62-2, that do not exceed the amount of the expenses substantiated (i.e., amounts which are treated as paid under an accountable plan), and that are received by an employee on or after January 1, 1989, with respect to expenses paid or incurred on or after January 1, 1989.


(2) *Transition rule.* Payments made under reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangements that are received by an employee on or after January 1, 1989, but prior to July 1, 1990, to the extent that the employee is required to account (within the meaning of the term “account” as set forth in § 1.162-17(b)(4) or 1.274-5T(f)(4), whichever is applicable) and does so account to the payor for such expenses, provided the payor has made a reasonable, good faith effort to comply with the requirements of section 62(c). In general, compliance with the provisions of this section, as in effect for payments made under reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangements that were received by an employee before January 1, 1989, with respect to expenses paid or incurred before January 1, 1989, will constitute such reasonable good faith compliance.

(2) The organization has immunity with respect to the invoilability of its archives pursuant to an international agreement having full force and effect in the United States.


(l) A payment to an informer as an award, fee, or reward for information relating to criminal activity, but only if such payment is made by the United States, a State, Territory, or political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or, with respect to payments made after December 31, 1987, by an organization that is described in section 501(c)(3) and that makes such payments in furtherance of a charitable purpose to lessen the burdens of government within the meaning of § 1.501(c)(3)-1(d)(2).

(n) Payments to individuals as scholarships or fellowship grants within the meaning of section 117(b)(1), whether or not “qualified scholarships” as described in section 117(b).
