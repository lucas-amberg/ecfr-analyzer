For provisions relating to the use of TTINs, see § 301.6109-4 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations).

(ii) A consolidated reporting statement must be furnished on or before February 15 of the year following the calendar year reported. Any statement that otherwise must be furnished on or before January 31 must be furnished on or before February 15 if it is furnished in the consolidated reporting statement.


(e) *When substitute payment deemed received.* A Broker is deemed to have received a substitute payment on behalf of a customer when the amount is paid or deemed paid to the broker (or as it accrues in the case of original issue discount deemed a payment in lieu of tax-exempt interest).


(f) *Identification of customer and recordkeeping with respect to substitute payments*—(1) *Payments in lieu of tax-exempt interest and exempt-interest dividends.* A broker that receives substitute payments in lieu of tax-exempt interest, exempt-interest dividends, or other items (to the extent specified in a rule-related notice published pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(i)(C) of this section) on behalf of a customer and is required to furnish a statement under paragraph (a) of this section must determine the identity of the customer whose security was transferred and on whose behalf the broker received such substitute payments by specific identification of the record owner of the security so transferred. A broker must keep adequate records of the determination so made.


(2) *Payments in lieu of dividends other than exempt-interest dividends*—(i) *Requirements and methods.* A broker that receives substitute payments in lieu of dividends, other than exempt-interest dividends, on behalf of a customer and is required to furnish a statement under paragraph (a) of this section must make a determination of the identity of the customer whose stock was transferred and on whose behalf such broker receives substitute payments. Such determination must be made as of the record date with respect to the dividend distribution, and must be made in a consistent manner by the broker in accordance with any of the following methods:


(A) Specific identification of the record owner of the transferred stock;


(B) The method of allocation and selection specified in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section; or


(C) Any other method, with the prior approval of the Commissioner.


(ii) *Method of allocation and selection*—(A) *Allocation to borrowed shares and individual and nonindividual pools.* With respect to each substitute payment in lieu of a dividend received by a broker, the broker must allocate the transferred shares (*i.e.,* the shares giving rise to the substitute payment) among all shares of stock of the same class and issue as the transferred shares which were (*1*) borrowed by the broker, and (*2*) which the broker holds (or has transferred in a transaction described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) and is authorized by its customers to transfer (including shares of stock of the same class and issue held for the broker's own account) (“loanable shares”). The broker may first allocate the transferred shares to any borrowed shares. Then to the extent that the number of transferred shares exceeds the number of borrowed shares (or if the broker does not allocate to the borrowed shares first), the broker must allocate the transferred shares between two pools, one consisting of the loanable shares of all individual customers (the “individual pool”) and the other consisting of the loanable shares of all nonindividual customers (the “nonindividual pool”). The transferred shares must be allocated to the individual pool in the same proportion that the number of loanable shares held by individual customers bears to the total number of loanable shares available to the broker. Similarly, the transferred shares must be allocated to the nonindividual pool in the same proportion that the number of loanable shares held by nonindividual customers bears to the total number of loanable shares available to the broker.


(B) *Selection of deemed transferred shares within the nonindividual pool.* The broker must select which shares within the nonindividual pool are deemed transferred for use in a short sale (the “deemed transferred shares”). Selection of deemed transferred shares may be made either by purely random lottery or on a first-in-first-out (“FIFO”) basis.


(C) *Selection of deemed transferred shares within the individual pool.* The broker must select which shares within the individual pool are deemed transferred shares (in the manner described in the preceding paragraph) only with respect to substitute payments as to which a statement is required to be furnished under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.


(3) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the identification of customer rules of paragraph (f)(2):


(g) *Reporting by brokers*—(1) *Requirement of reporting.* Any broker required to furnish a statement under paragraph (a) of this section shall report on Form 1096 showing such information as may be required by Form 1096, in the form, manner, and number of copies required by Form 1096. With respect to each customer for which a broker is required to furnish a statement, the broker shall make a return of information on Form 1099, in the form, manner and number of copies required by Form 1099.




(2) *Reporting in electronic form.* For information returns filed after December 31, 1996, see § 301.6011-2 of this chapter for rules relating to filing information returns in electronic form and for rules relating to waivers granted for undue hardship. A broker or barter exchange that fails to file a Form 1099 electronically, when required, may be subject to a penalty under section 6721 for each such failure. See paragraph (g)(4) of this section.






(3) *Time and place of filing.* The returns required under this paragraph (g) for any calendar year shall be filed after September 30 of such year, but not before the final substitute payment for the year is received by the broker, and on or before February 28 (March 31 if filed electronically) of the following year with any of the Internal Revenue Service Centers, the addresses of which are listed in the instructions for Form 1096. 


(4) *Cross-reference to penalties.* For provisions relating to the penalty provided for failure to file timely a correct information return required under section 6045(d) and § 1.6045-2(g)(1), including a failure to file on magnetic media, see § 301.6721-1 of this chapter. For provisions relating to the penalty provided for failure to furnish timely a correct payee statement required under section 6045(d) and § 1.6045-2(a), see § 301.6722-1 of this chapter. See § 301.6724-1 of this chapter for the waiver of a penalty if the failure is due to reasonable cause and is not due to willful neglect.


(h) *Coordination with section 6042.* In cases in which reporting is required by both sections 6042 and 6045(d) with respect to the same substitute payment in lieu of a dividend, the provisions of section 6045(d) control, and no report or statement under section 6042 need be made. If reporting is not required under section 6045(d) with respect to a substitute payment in lieu of a dividend, a report under section 6042 must be made if required in accordance with the rules of section 6042 and the regulations thereunder. Thus, if a broker receives a substitute payment in lieu of a dividend on behalf of an individual customer and the broker does not have reason to know by the record date of the payment that the payment is in lieu of a dividend of a type described in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section, the broker must report with respect to the substitute payment if required in accordance with section 6042 and the regulations thereunder.






(i) *Applicability date.* This section applies to substitute payments received by a broker after December 31, 1984. Section 1.6045-2(c) (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised July 15, 2014) applies to payee statements due after December 31, 2014. For payee statements due before January 1, 2015, § 1.6045-2(c) (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 2013) applies. Paragraph (g)(2) of this section applies to information returns required to be filed during calendar years beginning after December 31, 2023.
