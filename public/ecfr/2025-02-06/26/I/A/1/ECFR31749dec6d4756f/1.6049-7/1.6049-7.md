(f) *Requirement of furnishing statement to recipient*—(1) *In general.* Every person filing a Form 1099 under section 6049 (a) and this section must furnish to the holder (the person whose identifying number is required to be shown on the form) a written statement showing the information required by paragraph (f)(2) of this section. The written statement provided by a REMIC must also contain the information specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.


(2) *Form of statement*—(i) *REMIC regular interests and collateralized debt obligations not issued with original issue discount.* For a REMIC regular interest or collateralized debt obligation issued without original issue discount, the written statement must specify for the calendar year the following information—


(A) The aggregate amount shown on Form 1099 to be included in income by that person for the calendar year;


(B) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person required to furnish this statement;

(E) The CUSIP number, account number, serial number, or other identifying number or information, of each REMIC regular interest or collateralized debt obligation, with respect to which a return is being made;


(F) All other items shown on Form 1099 for the calendar year; and


(G) Information necessary to compute accrual of market discount. For calendar years after 1989, this requirement is satisfied by furnishing to the holder for each accrual period during the year a fraction computed in the manner described in either paragraph (f)(2)(i)(G)(*1*) or (f)(2)(i)(G)(*2*) of this section. For calendar years after December 31, 1991, the REMIC or the issuer of the collateralized debt obligation must be consistent in the method used to compute this fraction.


(*1*) The numerator of the fraction equals the interest, other than original issue discount, allocable to the accrual period. The denominator of the fraction equals the interest, other than original issue discount, allocable to the accrual period plus the remaining interest, other than original issue discount, as of the end of that accrual period. The interest allocable to each accrual period and the remaining interest are calculated by taking into account events which have occurred before the close of the accrual period and the prepayment assumption, if any, determined as of the startup day (as defined in section 860G(a)(9)) of the REMIC or the issue date (as defined in section 1275(a)(2)) of the collateralized debt obligaition that would be made in computing original issue discount if the debt instrument had been issued with original issue discount.


(*2*) If the REMIC regular interest or the collateralized debt obligation has de minimis original issue discount (as defined in section 1273(a)(3) and any regulations thereunder), then, at the option of the REMIC or the issuer of the collateralized debt obligation, the fraction may be computed in the manner specified in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(K) of this section taking into account the de minimis original issue discount.


(ii) *REMIC regular interests and collateralized debt obligations issued with original issue discount.* For a REMIC regular interest or collateralized debt obligation issued with original issue discount, the written statement must specify for the calendar year the following information—


(A) The aggregate amount of original issue discount includible in the gross income of the holder for the calendar year with respect to the REMIC regular interest or the collateralized debt obligation;


(B) The aggregate amount of interest, other than original issue discount, includible in the gross income of the holder for the calendar year with respect to the REMIC regular interest or the collateralized debt obligation;


(C) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person required to file this form;


(D) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person who must include the amount of interest specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section in gross income;


(E) For calendar years after 1987, the daily portion of original issue discount per $l,000 of original principal amount (or for calendar years prior to 1992, per other specified unit) as determined under section 1272(a)(6) and the regulations thereunder for each accrual period any day of which is in that calendar year;


(F) For calendar years after 1987, the length of the accrual period;


(G) All other items shown on Form 1099 for the calendar year;


(H) A legend, including a statement that the information required under paragraphs (f)(2)(ii) (A), (B), (C), (D) and (G) of this section is being reported to the Internal Revenue Service, that conforms to the legend on Form 1099, Copy B, For Recipient;


(I) For calendar years after 1987, the adjusted issue price (as defined in section 1275(a)(4)(B)(ii)) of the REMIC regular interest or the collateralized debt obligation at the beginning of each accrual period with respect to which interest income is required to be reported on Form 1099 for the calendar year;


(J) The CUSIP number, account number, serial number, or other identifying number or information, of each class of REMIC regular interest or collateralized debt obligation, with respect to which a return is being made; and


(K) Information necessary to compute accrual of market discount. For calendar years after 1989, this information includes:


(*1*) For each accrual period in the calendar year, a fraction, the numerator of which equals the original issue discount allocable to that accrual period, and the denominator of which equals the original issue discount allocable to that accrual period plus the remaining original issue discount as of the end of that accrual period, and 


(*2*) [Reserved]


The original issue discount allocable to each accrual period and the remaining original issue discount are calculated by taking into account events which have occurred before the close of the accrual period and the prepayment assumption determined as of the startup day (as defined in section 860G (a)(9)) of the REMIC or the issue date (as defined in section 1275 (a)(2)) of the collateralized debt obligation.


(3) *Information with respect to REMIC assets*—(i) *95 percent asset test.* For calendar years after 1988, the written statement provided by a REMIC must also contain the following information for each calendar quarter—

(B) The percentage of REMIC assets that are assets described in section 7701 (a)(19), and

If for any calendar quarter the percentage of REMIC assets represented by a category is at least 95 percent, then the statement need only specify that the percentage for that category, for that calendar quarter, was at least 95 percent.


(ii) *Additional information required if the 95 percent test not met.* If, for any calendar quarter after 1988, less than 95 percent of the assets of the REMIC are real estate assets defined in section 856 (c)(6)(B), then, for that calendar quarter, the REMIC's written statement must also provide to any real estate investment trust (REIT) that holds a regular interest the following information—


(A) The percentage of REMIC assets described in section 856 (c)(5)(A), computed by reference to the average adjusted basis of the REMIC assets during the calendar quarter (as described in § 1.860F-4 (e)(1)(iii)),


(B) The percentage of REMIC gross income (other than gross income from prohibited transactions defined in section 860F (a)(2)) described in section 856 (c)(3)(A) through (E), computed as of the close of the calendar quarter, and


(C) The percentage of REMIC gross income (other than gross income from prohibited transactions defined in section 860F (a)(2)) described in section 856 (c)(3)(F), computed as of the close of the calendar quarter. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(C), the term “foreclosure property” contained in section 856 (c)(3)(F) shall have the meaning specified in section 860G (a)(8).


In determining whether a REIT satisfies the limitations of section 856 (c)(2), all REMIC gross income is deemed to be derived from a source specified in section 856 (c)(2).


(iii) *Calendar years 1988 and 1989.* For calendar years 1988 and 1989, the percentage of assets required in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section may be computed by reference to the average fair market value of the assets of the REMIC during the calendar quarter (as described in § 1.860F-4 (e)(1)(iii)), instead of by reference to the average adjusted basis of the assets of the REMIC during the calendar quarter.


(4) *Cross-reference.* See § 1.67-3T (f)(2)(ii) for additional information that may be separately stated on the statement required by this paragraph (f) with respect to certain holders of regular interests in REMICs described in § 1.67-3T (a)(2)(ii).


(5) *Time for furnishing statements*—(i) *For calendar quarters and calendar years after 1988.* For calendar quarters and calendar years after 1988, each statement required under this paragraph (f) to be furnished to any person for a calendar year with respect to amounts includible as interest must be furnished to that person after April 30 of that year and on or before March 15 of the following year, but not before the final interest payment (if any) for the calendar year.


(ii) *For calendar quarters and calendar years prior to 1989*—(A) *In general.* For calendar quarters and calendar years prior to 1989, each statement required under this paragraph (f) to be furnished to any person for a calendar year with respect to amounts includible as interest must be furnished to that person after April 30 of that year and on or before January 31 of the following year, but not before the final interest payment (if any) for the calendar year.


(B) *Nominee reporting.* For calendar quarters and calendar years prior to 1989, each statement required under this paragraph (f) to be furnished by a nominee must be furnished to the actual owner of a REMIC regular interest or a collateralized debt obligation to which section 1272 (a)(6) applies on or before the later of—


(*1*) The 30th day after the nominee receives such information, or


(*2*) January 31 of the year following the calendar year to which the statement relates.


(6) *Special rules*—(i) *Copy of Form 1099 permissible.* The requirements of this paragraph (f) for the furnishing of a statement to any person, including the legend requirement of paragraphs (f)(2)(i)(D) and (f)(2)(ii)(H) of this section, may be met by furnishing to that person—


(A) A copy of the Form 1099 filed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section in respect of that person, plus a separate statement (mailed with the Form 1099) that contains the information described in paragraphs (f)(2)(i)(E) and (G), (f)(2)(ii)(E), (F), (I), and (K), (f)(3), and (f)(4) of this section, if applicable, or

(7) *Requirement that nominees furnish information to corporations and certain other specified persons*—(i) *In general.* For calendar quarters and calendar years after 1988, every broker or middleman must provide in writing or by telephone the information specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section to—
