(ii) Furnish a statement, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, to each individual described in paragraph (c) of this section. 


(2) *Exceptions*—(i) *No reporting by institution or insurer for nonresident alien individuals.* The information reporting requirements of this section do not apply with respect to any individual who is a nonresident alien (as defined in section 7701(b) and § 301.7701(b)-3 of this chapter) during the calendar year, unless the individual requests the institution or insurer to report. If a nonresident alien individual requests an institution or insurer to report, the institution or insurer must comply with the requirements of this section for the calendar year with respect to which the request is made. 


(ii) *No reporting by institutions for noncredit courses*—(A) *In general.* The information reporting requirements of this section do not apply with respect to any course for which no academic credit is offered by the institution.

(C) *Example.* The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (a)(2)(ii): 


(iii) *No reporting by institutions for individuals whose qualified tuition and related expenses are waived or are paid with scholarships.* The information reporting requirements of this section do not apply with respect to any individual whose qualified tuition and related expenses are waived in their entirety or are paid entirely with scholarships. 


(iv) *No reporting by institutions for individuals whose qualified tuition and related expenses are covered by a formal billing arrangement*—(A) *In general.* The information reporting requirements of this section do not apply with respect to any individual whose qualified tuition and related expenses are covered by a formal billing arrangement as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section.

(*1*) An arrangement in which the institution bills only an employer for education furnished by the institution to an individual who is the employer's employee and does not maintain a separate financial account for that individual; 


(*2*) An arrangement in which the institution bills only a governmental entity for education furnished by the institution to an individual and does not maintain a separate financial account for that individual; or 


(*3*) Any other similar arrangement in which the institution bills only an institutional third party for education furnished to an individual and does not maintain a separate financial account for that individual, but only if designated as a formal billing arrangement by the Commissioner in published guidance of general applicability or in guidance directed to participants in specific arrangements. 


(b) *Requirement to file return*—(1) *In general.* Institutions may elect to report either the information described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or the information described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Once an institution elects to report under either paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section, the institution must use the same reporting method for all calendar years in which it is required to file returns, unless permission is granted to change reporting methods. Paragraph (b)(2) of this section requires institutions to report, among other information, the amount of payments received during the calendar year for qualified tuition and related expenses. Institutions must report separately adjustments made during the calendar year that relate to payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses that were reported for a prior calendar year. For purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an adjustment made to payments received means a reimbursement or refund. Paragraph (b)(3) requires institutions to report, among other information, the amounts billed during the calendar year for qualified tuition and related expenses. Institutions must report separately adjustments made during the calendar year that relate to amounts billed for qualified tuition and related expenses that were reported for a prior calendar year. For purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, an adjustment made to amounts billed means a reduction in charges. Insurers must report the information described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. 


(2) *Information reporting requirements for institutions that elect to report payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses*—(i) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, an institution reporting payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses must file an information return with the IRS on Form 1098-T, “Tuition Statement,” with respect to each individual enrolled (as determined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) for an academic period beginning during the calendar year or during a prior calendar year and for whom a transaction described in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(C), (E), (F) or (G) of this section is made during the calendar year. An institution may use a substitute Form 1098-T if the substitute form complies with applicable revenue procedures relating to substitute forms (*see* § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). 


(ii) *Information included on return.* An institution reporting payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses must include on Form 1098-T—

(iii) *Reportable amount of payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses during calendar year determined.* The amount of payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses with respect to an individual during the calendar year that is reportable on Form 1098-T is determined by netting the amount of payments received (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section) for qualified tuition and related expenses during the calendar year against any reimbursements or refunds (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section) made during the calendar year that relate to payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses during the same calendar year. 


(iv) *Separate reporting of reimbursements or refunds of payments of qualified tuition and related expenses that were reported for a prior calendar year.* An institution must separately report on Form 1098-T any reimbursements or refunds (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section) made during the current calendar year that relate to payments of qualified tuition and related expenses that were reported by the institution for a prior calendar year. Such reimbursements or refunds shall not be netted against the payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses during the current calendar year.


(v) *Payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses determined.* For purposes of determining the amount of payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses during a calendar year, payments received with respect to an individual during the calendar year from any source (except for any scholarship or grant that, by its terms, must be applied to expenses other than qualified tuition and related expenses, such as room and board) are treated as payments of qualified tuition and related expenses up to the total amount billed by the institution for such expenses. For purposes of this section, a payment includes any positive account balance (such as any reimbursement or refund credited to an individual's account) that an institution applies toward current charges.


(vi) *Reimbursements or refunds of payments for qualified tuition and related expenses determined.* For purposes of determining the amount of reimbursements or refunds made of payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses, any reimbursement or refund made with respect to an individual during a calendar year (except for any refund of a scholarship or grant that, by its terms, was required to be applied to expenses other than qualified tuition and related expenses, such as room and board) is treated as a reimbursement or refund of payments for qualified tuition and related expenses up to the amount of any reduction in charges for such expenses. For purposes of this section, a reimbursement or refund includes amounts that an institution credits to an individual's account, as well as amounts disbursed to, or on behalf of, the individual.

(iv) *Separate reporting of reductions made to amounts billed for qualified tuition and related expenses that were reported for a prior calendar year.* An institution must separately report on Form 1098-T any reductions in charges made during the current calendar year that relate to amounts billed for qualified tuition and related expenses that were reported by the institution for a prior calendar year. Such reductions shall not be netted against amounts billed for qualified tuition and related expenses during the current calendar year.

(i) 30 days after the first day of the academic period; 


(ii) A date during the academic period on which enrollment data must be collected for purposes of the Integrated Post Secondary Education Data System administered by the Department of Education; or 


(iii) A date during the academic period on which the institution must report enrollment data to the State, the institution's governing body, or some other external governing body. 


(2) *Payments of qualified tuition and related expenses received or collected by one or more persons*—(i) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, if a person collects or receives payments of qualified tuition and related expenses on behalf of another person (e.g., an institution), the person collecting or receiving payments must satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. In this case, those requirements do not apply to the transfer of the payments to the institution. 


(ii) *Exception.* If the person collecting or receiving payments of qualified tuition and related expenses on behalf of another person (e.g., an institution) does not possess the information needed to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the other person must satisfy those requirements. 


(3) *Governmental units.* An institution or insurer that is a governmental unit, or an agency or instrumentality of a governmental unit, is subject to the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and an appropriately designated officer or employee of the governmental entity must satisfy those requirements. 


(e) *Penalty provisions*—(1) *Failure to file correct returns.* The section 6721 penalty may apply to an institution or insurer that fails to file information returns required by section 6050S and this section on or before the required filing date; that fails to include all of the required information on the return; or that includes incorrect information on the return. *See* section 6721, and the regulations thereunder, for rules relating to penalties for failure to file correct returns. *See* section 6724, and the regulations thereunder, for rules relating to waivers of penalties for certain failures due to reasonable cause. 


(2) *Failure to furnish correct information statements.* The section 6722 penalty may apply to an institution or insurer that fails to furnish statements required by section 6050S and this section on or before the prescribed date; that fails to include all the required information on the statement; or that includes incorrect information on the statement. *See* section 6722, and the regulations thereunder, for rules relating to penalties for failure to furnish correct statements. See section 6724, and the regulations thereunder, for rules relating to waivers of penalties for certain failures due to reasonable cause. 


(3) *Waiver of penalties for failures to include a correct TIN*—(i) *In general.* In the case of a failure to include a correct TIN on Form 1098-T or a related information statement, penalties may be waived if the failure is due to reasonable cause. Reasonable cause may be established if the failure arose from events beyond the institution's or insurer's control, such as a failure of the individual to furnish a correct TIN. However, the institution or insurer must establish that it acted in a responsible manner both before and after the failure. 


(ii) *Acting in a responsible manner.* An institution or insurer must request the TIN of each individual for whom it is required to file a return if it does not already have a record of the individual's correct TIN. If the institution or insurer does not have a record of the individual's correct TIN, then it must solicit the TIN in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section on or before December 31 of each year during which it receives payments, or bills amounts, for qualified tuition and related expenses or makes reimbursements, refunds, or reductions of such amounts with respect to the individual. If an individual refuses to provide his or her TIN upon request, the institution or insurer must file the return and furnish the statement required by this section without the individual's TIN, but with all other required information. The specific solicitation requirements of paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section apply in lieu of the solicitation requirements of § 301.6724-1(e) and (f) of this chapter for the purpose of determining whether an institution or insurer acted in a responsible manner in attempting to obtain a correct TIN. An institution or insurer that complies with the requirements of this paragraph (e)(3) will be considered to have acted in a responsible manner within the meaning of § 301.6724-1(d) of this chapter with respect to any failure to include the correct TIN of an individual on a return or statement required by section 6050S and this section. 


(iii) *Manner of soliciting TIN.* An institution or insurer must request the individual's TIN in writing and must clearly notify the individual that the law requires the individual to furnish a TIN so that it may be included on an information return filed by the institution or insurer. A request for a TIN made on Form W-9S, “Request for Student's or Borrower's Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification,” satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (e)(3)(iii). An institution or insurer may establish a system for individuals to submit Forms W-9S electronically as described in applicable forms and instructions. An institution or insurer may also develop a separate form to request the individual's TIN or incorporate the request into other forms customarily used by the institution or insurer, such as admission or enrollment forms or financial aid applications. 


(4) *Failure to furnish TIN.* The section 6723 penalty may apply to any individual who is required (but fails) to furnish his or her TIN to an institution or insurer. *See* section 6723, and the regulations thereunder, for rules relating to the penalty for failure to furnish a TIN. 


(f) *Effective/applicability date.* The rules in this section apply to information returns required to be filed, and information statements required to be furnished, after December 31, 2003. Paragraph (c)(1)(i) applies to payee statements due after December 31, 2014. For payee statements due before January 1, 2015, § 1.6050S-1 (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 2013) shall apply.
