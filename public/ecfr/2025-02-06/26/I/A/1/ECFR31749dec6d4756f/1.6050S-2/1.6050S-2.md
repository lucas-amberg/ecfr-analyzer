# § 1.6050S-2   Information reporting for payments and reimbursements or refunds of qualified tuition and related expenses.

(a) *Electronic furnishing of statements*—(1) *In general.* A person required by section 6050S(d) to furnish a written statement regarding payments and reimbursements or refunds of qualified tuition and related expenses (furnisher) to the individual to whom it is required to be furnished (recipient) may furnish the statement in an electronic format in lieu of a paper format. A furnisher who meets the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) through (6) of this section is treated as furnishing the required statement.


(2) *Consent*—(i) *In general.* The recipient must have affirmatively consented to receive the statement in an electronic format. The consent may be made electronically in any manner that reasonably demonstrates that the recipient can access the statement in the electronic format in which it will be furnished to the recipient. Alternatively, the consent may be made in a paper document if it is confirmed electronically.


(ii) *Withdrawal of consent.* The consent requirement of this paragraph (a)(2) is not satisfied if the recipient withdraws the consent and the withdrawal takes effect before the statement is furnished. The furnisher may provide that a withdrawal of consent takes effect either on the date it is received by the furnisher or on a subsequent date. The furnisher may also provide that a request for a paper statement will be treated as a withdrawal of consent.


(iii) *Change in hardware or software requirements.* If a change in the hardware or software required to access the statement creates a material risk that the recipient will not be able to access the statement, the furnisher must, prior to changing the hardware or software, provide the recipient with a notice. The notice must describe the revised hardware and software required to access the statement and inform the recipient that a new consent to receive the statement in the revised electronic format must be provided to the furnisher. After implementing the revised hardware and software, the furnisher must obtain from the recipient, in the manner described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, a new consent or confirmation of consent to receive the statement electronically.


(iv) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (a)(2):


(3) *Required disclosures*—(i) *In general.* Prior to, or at the time of, a recipient's consent, the furnisher must provide to the recipient a clear and conspicuous disclosure statement containing each of the disclosures described in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii) through (viii) of this section.


(ii) *Paper statement.* The recipient must be informed that the statement will be furnished on paper if the recipient does not consent to receive it electronically.


(iii) *Scope and duration of consent.* The recipient must be informed of the scope and duration of the consent. For example, the recipient must be informed whether the consent applies to statements furnished every year after the consent is given until it is withdrawn in the manner described in paragraph (a)(3)(v)(A) of this section or only to the statement required to be furnished on or before the January 31 immediately following the date on which the consent is given. 


(iv) *Post-consent request for a paper statement.* The recipient must be informed of any procedure for obtaining a paper copy of the recipient's statement after giving the consent described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section and whether a request for a paper statement will be treated as a withdrawal of consent. 


(v) *Withdrawal of consent.* The recipient must be informed that— 


(A) The recipient may withdraw a consent by writing (electronically or on paper) to the person or department whose name, mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail address is provided in the disclosure statement; 


(B) The furnisher will confirm the withdrawal and the date on which it takes effect in writing (either electronically or on paper); and 


(C) A withdrawal of consent does not apply to a statement that was furnished electronically in the manner described in this paragraph (a) before the date on which the withdrawal of consent takes effect. 


(vi) *Notice of termination.* The recipient must be informed of the conditions under which a furnisher will cease furnishing statements electronically to the recipient. 


(vii) *Updating information.* The recipient must be informed of the procedures for updating the information needed by the furnisher to contact the recipient. The furnisher must inform the recipient of any change in the furnisher's contact information. 


(viii) *Hardware and software requirements.* The recipient must be provided with a description of the hardware and software required to access, print, and retain the statement, and the date when the statement will no longer be available on the Web site. 


(4) *Format.* The electronic version of the statement must contain all required information and comply with applicable revenue procedures relating to substitute statements to recipients. 


(5) *Notice*—(i) *In general.* If the statement is furnished on a Web site, the furnisher must notify the recipient that the statement is posted on a Web site. The notice may be delivered by mail, electronic mail, or in person. The notice must provide instructions on how to access and print the statement. The notice must include the following statement in capital letters, “IMPORTANT TAX RETURN DOCUMENT AVAILABLE.” If the notice is provided by electronic mail, the foregoing statement must be on the subject line of the electronic mail. 


(ii) *Undeliverable electronic address.* If an electronic notice described in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section is returned as undeliverable, and the correct electronic address cannot be obtained from the furnisher's records or from the recipient, then the furnisher must furnish the notice by mail or in person within 30 days after the electronic notice is returned. 


(iii) *Corrected statements.* If the furnisher has corrected a recipient's statement that was furnished electronically, the furnisher must furnish the corrected statement to the recipient electronically. If the recipient's statement was furnished through a Web site posting and the furnisher has corrected the statement, the furnisher must notify the recipient that it has posted the corrected statement on the Web site within 30 days of such posting in the manner described in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section. The corrected statement or the notice must be furnished by mail or in person if—

(6) *Access period.* Statements furnished on a Web site must be retained on the Web site through October 15 of the year following the calendar year to which the statements relate (or the first business day after such October 15, if October 15 falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday). The furnisher must maintain access to corrected statements that are posted on the Web site through October 15 of the year following the calendar year to which the statements relate (or the first business day after such October 15, if October 15 falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday) or the date 90 days after the corrected statements are posted, whichever is later. 


(b) *Paper statements after withdrawal of consent.* If a recipient withdraws consent to receive a statement electronically and the withdrawal takes effect before the statement is furnished electronically, a paper statement must be furnished. A paper statement furnished after the statement due date under this paragraph (b) will be considered timely if furnished within 30 days after the date the withdrawal of consent is received by the furnisher. 


(c) *Effective date.* This section applies to statements required to be furnished after February 13, 2004. Paragraph (a)(6) of this section also applies to statements required to be furnished after December 31, 2004.
