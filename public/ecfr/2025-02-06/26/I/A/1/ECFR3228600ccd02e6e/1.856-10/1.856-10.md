# § 1.856-10   Definition of real property.

(a) *In general.* This section provides definitions for purposes of part II, subchapter M, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. Paragraph (b) of this section defines real property, which includes land as defined under paragraph (c) of this section and improvements to land as defined under paragraph (d) of this section. Improvements to land include inherently permanent structures as defined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section and structural components of inherently permanent structures as defined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules for determining whether an item is a distinct asset for purposes of applying the definitions in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. Paragraph (f) of this section identifies intangible assets that are real property or interests in real property. Paragraph (g) of this section provides examples illustrating the rules of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section. Paragraph (h) of this section provides the effective/applicability date for this section.


(b) *Real property.* The term *real property* means land and improvements to land. Local law definitions are not controlling for purposes of determining the meaning of the term real property.


(c) *Land.* Land includes water and air space superjacent to land and natural products and deposits that are unsevered from the land. Natural products and deposits, such as crops, water, ores, and minerals, cease to be real property when they are severed, extracted, or removed from the land. The storage of severed or extracted natural products or deposits, such as crops, water, ores, and minerals, in or upon real property does not cause the stored property to be recharacterized as real property.


(d) *Improvements to land*—(1) *In general.* The term *improvements to land* means inherently permanent structures and their structural components.


(2) *Inherently permanent structure*—(i) *In general.* The term *inherently permanent structure* means any permanently affixed building or other permanently affixed structure. Affixation may be to land or to another inherently permanent structure and may be by weight alone. If the affixation is reasonably expected to last indefinitely based on all the facts and circumstances, the affixation is considered permanent. A distinct asset that serves an active function, such as an item of machinery or equipment, is not a building or other inherently permanent structure.


(ii) *Building*—(A) *In general.* A building encloses a space within its walls and is covered by a roof.


(B) *Types of buildings.* Buildings include the following distinct assets if permanently affixed: Houses; apartments; hotels; motels; enclosed stadiums and arenas; enclosed shopping malls; factory and office buildings; warehouses; barns; enclosed garages; enclosed transportation stations and terminals; and stores.


(iii) *Other inherently permanent structures*—(A) *In general.* Other inherently permanent structures serve a passive function, such as to contain, support, shelter, cover, protect, or provide a conduit or a route, and do not serve an active function, such as to manufacture, create, produce, convert, or transport.


(B) *Types of other inherently permanent structures.* Other inherently permanent structures include the following distinct assets if permanently affixed: Microwave transmission, cell, broadcast, and electrical transmission towers; telephone poles; parking facilities; bridges; tunnels; roadbeds; railroad tracks; transmission lines; pipelines; fences; in-ground swimming pools; offshore drilling platforms; storage structures such as silos and oil and gas storage tanks; and stationary wharves and docks. Other inherently permanent structures also include outdoor advertising displays for which an election has been properly made under section 1033(g)(3).


(iv) *Facts and circumstances determination.* If a distinct asset (within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this section) does not serve an active function as described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section and is not otherwise listed in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) or (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section or in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter), the determination of whether that asset is an inherently permanent structure is based on all the facts and circumstances. In particular, the following factors must be taken into account:


(A) The manner in which the distinct asset is affixed to real property;


(B) Whether the distinct asset is designed to be removed or to remain in place indefinitely;


(C) The damage that removal of the distinct asset would cause to the item itself or to the real property to which it is affixed;


(D) Any circumstances that suggest the expected period of affixation is not indefinite (for example, a lease that requires or permits removal of the distinct asset upon the expiration of the lease); and


(E) The time and expense required to move the distinct asset.


(3) *Structural components*—(i) *In general.* The term *structural component* means any distinct asset (within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this section) that is a constituent part of and integrated into an inherently permanent structure, serves the inherently permanent structure in its passive function, and, even if capable of producing income other than consideration for the use or occupancy of space, does not produce or contribute to the production of such income. If interconnected assets work together to serve an inherently permanent structure with a utility-like function (for example, systems that provide a building with electricity, heat, or water), the assets are analyzed together as one distinct asset that may be a structural component. A structural component may qualify as real property only if the real estate investment trust (REIT) holds its interest in the structural component together with a real property interest in the space in the inherently permanent structure served by the structural component. A mortgage secured by a structural component is a real estate asset only if the mortgage is also secured by a real property interest in the inherently permanent structure served by the structural component. If a distinct asset is customized in connection with the rental of space in or on an inherently permanent structure to which the asset relates, the customization does not affect whether the distinct asset is a structural component.


(ii) *Types of structural components.* Structural components include the following distinct assets and systems if integrated into the inherently permanent structure and held together with a real property interest in the space in the inherently permanent structure served by that distinct asset or system: Wiring; plumbing systems; central heating and air-conditioning systems; elevators or escalators; walls; floors; ceilings; permanent coverings of walls, floors, and ceilings; windows; doors; insulation; chimneys; fire suppression systems, such as sprinkler systems and fire alarms; fire escapes; central refrigeration systems; security systems; and humidity control systems.


(iii) *Facts and circumstances determination.* If an interest in a distinct asset (within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this section) is held together with a real property interest in the space in the inherently permanent structure served by that distinct asset and that asset is not otherwise listed in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section or in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter), the determination of whether that asset is a structural component is based on all the facts and circumstances. In particular, the following factors must be taken into account:


(A) The manner, time, and expense of installing and removing the distinct asset;


(B) Whether the distinct asset is designed to be moved;


(C) The damage that removal of the distinct asset would cause to the item itself or to the inherently permanent structure to which it is affixed;


(D) Whether the distinct asset serves a utility-like function with respect to the inherently permanent structure;


(E) Whether the distinct asset serves the inherently permanent structure in its passive function;


(F) Whether the distinct asset produces income from consideration for the use or occupancy of space in or upon the inherently permanent structure;


(G) Whether the distinct asset is installed during construction of the inherently permanent structure; and


(H) Whether the distinct asset will remain if the tenant vacates the premises.


(e) *Distinct asset*—(1) *In general.* A distinct asset is analyzed separately from any other assets to which the asset relates to determine if the asset is real property, whether as land, an inherently permanent structure, or a structural component of an inherently permanent structure.


(2) *Facts and circumstances.* The determination of whether a particular separately identifiable item of property is a distinct asset is based on all the facts and circumstances. In particular, the following factors must be taken into account:


(i) Whether the item is customarily sold or acquired as a single unit rather than as a component part of a larger asset;


(ii) Whether the item can be separated from a larger asset, and if so, the cost of separating the item from the larger asset;


(iii) Whether the item is commonly viewed as serving a useful function independent of a larger asset of which it is a part; and


(iv) Whether separating the item from a larger asset of which it is a part impairs the functionality of the larger asset.


(f) *Intangible assets*—(1) *In general.* To the extent that an intangible asset, including an intangible asset established under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as a result of an acquisition of real property or an interest in real property, derives its value from real property or an interest in real property, is inseparable from that real property or interest in real property, and does not produce or contribute to the production of income other than consideration for the use or occupancy of space, the intangible asset is real property or an interest in real property.


(2) *Licenses and permits.* A license, permit, or other similar right that is solely for the use, enjoyment, or occupation of land or an inherently permanent structure and that is in the nature of a leasehold or easement generally is an interest in real property. A license or permit to engage in or operate a business is not real property or an interest in real property if the license or permit produces or contributes to the production of income other than consideration for the use or occupancy of space.


(g) *Examples.* The following examples demonstrate the rules of this section. *Examples 1* and *2* illustrate the definition of land as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. *Examples 3* through *10* illustrate the definition of improvements to land as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. Finally, *Examples 11* through *13* illustrate whether certain intangible assets are real property or interests in real property as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.


(h) *Effective/applicability date.* The rules of this section apply for taxable years beginning after August 31, 2016. For purposes of applying the first sentence of the flush language of section 856(c)(4) to a quarter in a taxable year that begins after August 31, 2016, the rules of this section apply in determining whether the taxpayer met the requirements of section 856(c)(4) at the close of prior quarters. Taxpayers may rely on this section for quarters that end before the applicability date.
