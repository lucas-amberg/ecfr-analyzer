# ยง 1.860-3   Interest and additions to tax.

(a) *In general.* If a qualified investment entity is allowed a deduction for deficiency dividends with respect to a taxable year, under section 860(c)(1) the tax imposed on the entity by chapter 1 of the Code (computed by taking into account the deduction) for that year is deemed to be increased by the amount of the deduction. This deemed increase in tax, however, applies solely for purposes of determining the liability of the entity for interest under subchapter A of chapter 67 of the Code and for additions to tax and additional amounts under chapter 68 of the Code. For purposes of applying subchapter A of chapter 67 and 68, the last date prescribed for payment of the deemed increase in tax is considered to be the last date prescribed for the payment of tax (determined in the manner provided in section 6601(b)) for the taxable year for which the deduction for deficiency dividends is allowed. The deemed increase in tax is considered to be paid as of the date that the claim for the deficiency dividend deduction described in section 860(g) is filed.


(b) *Overpayments of tax.* If a qualified investment entity is entitled to a credit or refund of an overpayment of the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code for the taxable year for which the deficiency dividend deduction is allowed, then, for purposes of computing interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts, the payment (or payments) that result in the overpayment and that precede the filing of the claim described in section 860(g) will be applied against and reduce the increase in tax that is deemed to occur under section 860(c)(1).


(c) *Examples.* This section is illustrated by the following examples:
