(a) *Scope.* This section provides the rules for determining the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction allowable under section 1400L(b) for qualified New York Liberty Zone property. 


(b) *Definitions.* For purposes of section 1400L(b) and this section, the definitions of the terms in § 1.168(k)-1(a)(2) apply and the following definitions also apply: 


(1) *Building* and *structural components* have the same meanings as those terms are defined in § 1.48-1(e). 


(2) *New York Liberty Zone* is the area located on or south of Canal Street, East Broadway (east of its intersection with Canal Street), or Grand Street (east of its intersection with East Broadway) in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, New York. 


(3) *Nonresidential real property* and *residential rental property* have the same meanings as those terms are defined in section 168(e)(2). 


(4) *Real property* is a building or its structural components, or other tangible real property.


(c) *Qualified New York Liberty Zone property*—(1) *In general.* Qualified New York Liberty Zone property is depreciable property that meets all the following requirements in the first taxable year in which the property is subject to depreciation by the taxpayer whether or not depreciation deductions for the property are allowable—


(i) The requirements in § 1.1400L(b)-1(c)(2) (description of property);


(ii) The requirements in § 1.1400L(b)-1(c)(3) (substantial use);


(iii) The requirements in § 1.1400L(b)-1(c)(4) (original use);


(iv) The requirements in § 1.1400L(b)-1(c)(5) (acquisition of property by purchase); and


(v) The requirements in § 1.1400L(b)-1(c)(6) (placed-in-service date).


(2) *Description of qualified New York Liberty Zone property*—(i) *In general.* Depreciable property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (c)(2) if the property is— 


(A) Described in § 1.168(k)-1(b)(2)(i); or 


(B) Nonresidential real property or residential rental property depreciated under section 168, but only to the extent it rehabilitates real property damaged, or replaces real property destroyed or condemned, as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Property is treated as replacing destroyed or condemned property if, as part of an integrated plan, the property replaces real property that is included in a continuous area that includes real property destroyed or condemned. For purposes of this section, real property is considered as destroyed or condemned only if an entire building or structure was destroyed or condemned as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Otherwise, the real property is considered damaged real property. For example, if certain structural components (for example, walls, floors, and plumbing fixtures) of a building are damaged or destroyed as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, but the building is not destroyed or condemned, then only costs related to replacing the damaged or destroyed structural components qualify under this paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B). 


(ii) *Property not eligible for additional first year depreciation deduction.* Depreciable property will not meet the requirements of this paragraph (c)(2) if—


(A) Section 168(k) or § 1.168(k)-1 applies to the property;


(B) The property is described in section 168(f);


(C) The property is required to be depreciated under the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) pursuant to section 168(g)(1)(A) through (D) or other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (for example, property described in section 263A(e)(2)(A) if the taxpayer (or any related person) has made an election under section 263A(d)(3), or property described in section 280F(b)(1));


(D) The property is included in any class of property for which the taxpayer elects not to deduct the additional first year depreciation under paragraph (e) of this section; or


(E) The property is qualified New York Liberty Zone leasehold improvement property as described in section 1400L(c)(2).


(3) *Substantial use.* Depreciable property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (c)(3) if substantially all of the use of the property is in the New York Liberty Zone and is in the active conduct of a trade or business by the taxpayer in New York Liberty Zone. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), “substantially all” means 80 percent or more. 


(4) *Original use.* Depreciable property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (c)(4) if the original use of the property commences with the taxpayer in the New York Liberty Zone after September 10, 2001.

For purposes of the preceding sentence, the rules in § 1.168(k)-1(b)(4)(iii) shall be applied without regard to ‘and before January 1, 2005.’ 


(ii) *Exception for certain transactions.* For purposes of this section, the new partnership of a transaction described in § 1.168(k)-1(f)(1)(ii) (technical termination of a partnership) or the transferee of a transaction described in § 1.168(k)-1(f)(1)(iii) (section 168(i)(7) transactions) is deemed to acquire the depreciable property by purchase. 


(6) *Placed-in-service date.* Depreciable property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (c)(6) if the property is placed in service by the taxpayer on or before December 31, 2006.

If a taxpayer makes an election under this paragraph (e), the election applies to all qualified New York Liberty Zone property that is in the same class of property and placed in service in the same taxable year, and no additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for the class of property. 


(2) *Definition of class of property.* For purposes of this paragraph (e), the term class of property means—

(3) *Time and manner for making election*—(i) *Time for making election.* Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the election specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section must be made by the due date (including extensions) of the Federal tax return for the taxable year in which the qualified New York Liberty Zone property is placed in service by the taxpayer 


(ii) *Manner of making election.* Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the election specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section must be made in the manner prescribed on Form 4562, “Depreciation and Amortization,” and its instructions.

If Form 4562 is revised or renumbered, any reference in this section to that form shall be treated as a reference to the revised or renumbered form. 


(4) *Special rules for 2000 or 2001 returns.* For the election specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section for qualified New York Liberty Zone property placed in service by the taxpayer during the taxable year that included September 11, 2001, the taxpayer should refer to the guidance provided by the Internal Revenue Service for the time and manner of making this election on the 2000 or 2001 Federal tax return for the taxable year that included September 11, 2001 (for further guidance, *see* sections 3.03(3) and 4 of Rev. Proc. 2002-33 (2002-1 C.B. 963), Rev. Proc. 2003-50 (2003-29 I.R.B. 119), and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(*b*) of this chapter). 


(5) *Failure to make election.* If a taxpayer does not make the election specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section within the time and in the manner prescribed in paragraph (e)(3) or (e)(4) of this section, the amount of depreciation allowable for that property under section 167(f)(1) or under section 168, as applicable, must be determined for the placed-in-service year and for all subsequent taxable years by taking into account the additional first year depreciation deduction. Thus, the election specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall not be made by the taxpayer in any other manner (for example, the election cannot be made through a request under section 446(e) to change the taxpayer's method of accounting). 


(6) *Alternative minimum tax.* If a taxpayer makes an election under this paragraph (e) for a class of property, the depreciation adjustments under section 56 and the regulations under section 56 apply to the property to which the election applies for purposes of computing the taxpayer's alternative minimum taxable income.

To seek the Commissioner's consent, the taxpayer must submit a request for a letter ruling.
