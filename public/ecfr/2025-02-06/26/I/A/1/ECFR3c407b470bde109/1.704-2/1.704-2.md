# § 1.704-2   Allocations attributable to nonrecourse liabilities.

(a) *Table of contents.* This paragraph contains a listing of the major headings of this § 1.704-2.


(b) *General principles and definitions*—(1) *Definition of and allocations of nonrecourse deductions.* Allocations of losses, deductions, or section 705(a)(2)(B) expenditures attributable to partnership nonrecourse liabilities (“nonrecourse deductions”) cannot have economic effect because the creditor alone bears any economic burden that corresponds to those allocations. Thus, nonrecourse deductions must be allocated in accordance with the partners' interests in the partnership. Paragraph (e) of this section provides a test that deems allocations of nonrecourse deductions to be in accordance with the partners' interests in the partnership. If that test is not satisfied, the partners' distributive shares of nonrecourse deductions are determined under § 1.704-1(b)(3), according to the partners' overall economic interests in the partnership. See also paragraph (i) of this section for special rules regarding the allocation of deductions attributable to nonrecourse liabilities for which a partner bears the economic risk of loss (as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section).


(2) *Definition of and allocations pursuant to a minimum gain chargeback.* To the extent a nonrecourse liability exceeds the adjusted tax basis of the partnership property it encumbers, a disposition of that property will generate gain that at least equals that excess (“partnership minimum gain”). An increase in partnership minimum gain is created by a decrease in the adjusted tax basis of property encumbered by a nonrecourse liability below the amount of that liability and by a partnership nonrecourse borrowing that exceeds the adjusted tax basis of the property encumbered by the borrowing. Partnership minimum gain decreases as reductions occur in the amount by which the nonrecourse liability exceeds the adjusted tax basis of the property encumbered by the liability. Allocations of gain attributable to a decrease in partnership minimum gain (a “minimum gain chargeback,” as required under paragraph (f) of this section) cannot have economic effect because the gain merely offsets nonrecourse deductions previously claimed by the partnership. Thus, to avoid impairing the economic effect of other allocations, allocations pursuant to a minimum gain chargeback must be made to the partners that either were allocated nonrecourse deductions or received distributions of proceeds attributable to a nonrecourse borrowing. Paragraph (e) of this section provides a test that, if met, deems allocations of partnership income pursuant to a minimum gain chargeback to be in accordance with the partners' interests in the partnership. If property encumbered by a nonrecourse liability is reflected on the partnership's books at a value that differs from its adjusted tax basis, paragraph (d)(3) of this section provides that minimum gain is determined with reference to the property's book basis. See also paragraph (i)(4) of this section for special rules regarding the minimum gain chargeback requirement for partner nonrecourse debt.


(3) *Definition of nonrecourse liability. Nonrecourse liability* means a nonrecourse liability as defined in § 1.752-1(a)(2) or a § 1.752-7 liability (as defined in § 1.752-7(b)(3)(i)) assumed by the partnership from a partner on or after June 24, 2003.


(4) *Definition of partner nonrecourse debt. Partner nonrecourse debt* or *partner nonrecourse liability* means any partnership liability to the extent the liability is nonrecourse for purposes of § 1.1001-2, and a partner or related person (within the meaning of § 1.752-4(b)) bears the economic risk of loss under § 1.752-2 because, for example, the partner or related person is the creditor or a guarantor.


(c) *Amount of nonrecourse deductions.* The amount of nonrecourse deductions for a partnership taxable year equals the net increase in partnership minimum gain during the year (determined under paragraph (d) of this section), reduced (but not below zero) by the aggregate distributions made during the year of proceeds of a nonrecourse liability that are allocable to an increase in partnership minimum gain (determined under paragraph (h) of this section). See paragraph (m), *Examples* (1)(i) and (vi), (2), and (3) of this section. However, increases in partnership minimum gain resulting from conversions, refinancings, or other changes to a debt instrument (as described in paragraph (g)(3)) do not generate nonrecourse deductions. Generally, nonrecourse deductions consist first of certain depreciation or cost recovery deductions and then, if necessary, a pro rata portion of other partnership losses, deductions, and section 705(a)(2)(B) expenditures for that year; excess nonrecourse deductions are carried over. See paragraphs (j)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section for more specific ordering rules. See also paragraph (m), *Example* (1)(iv) of this section.


(d) *Partnership minimum gain*—(1) *Amount of partnership minimum gain.* The amount of partnership minimum gain is determined by first computing for each partnership nonrecourse liability any gain the partnership would realize if it disposed of the property subject to that liability for no consideration other than full satisfaction of the liability, and then aggregating the separately computed gains. The amount of partnership minimum gain includes minimum gain arising from a conversion, refinancing, or other change to a debt instrument, as described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, only to the extent a partner is allocated a share of that minimum gain. For any partnership taxable year, the net increase or decrease in partnership minimum gain is determined by comparing the partnership minimum gain on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year with the partnership minimum gain on the last day of the current taxable year. See paragraph (m), *Examples* (1) (i) and (iv), (2), and (3) of this section. 


(2) *Property subject to more than one liability.* (i) *In general.* If property is subject to more than one liability, only the portion of the property's adjusted tax basis that is allocated to a nonrecourse liability under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section is used to compute minimum gain with respect to that liability. 


(ii) *Allocating liabilities.* If property is subject to two or more liabilities of equal priority, the property's adjusted tax basis is allocated among the liabilities in proportion to their outstanding balances. If property is subject to two or more liabilities of unequal priority, the adjusted tax basis is allocated first to the liability of the highest priority to the extent of its outstanding balance and then to each liability in descending order of priority to the extent of its outstanding balance, until fully allocated. See paragraph (m), *Example* (1) (v) of this section. 


(3) *Partnership minimum gain if there is a book/tax disparity.* If partnership property subject to one or more nonrecourse liabilities is, under § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) (*d*), (*f*), or (*r*), reflected on the partnership's books at a value that differs from its adjusted tax basis, the determinations under this section are made with reference to the property's book value. See section 704(c) and § 1.704-1(b)(4)(i) for principles that govern the treatment of a partner's share of minimum gain that is eliminated by the revaluation. See also paragraph (m), *Example* (3) of this section. 


(4) *Special rule for year of revaluation.* If the partners' capital accounts are increased pursuant to § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) (*d*), (*f*), or (*r*) to reflect a revaluation of partnership property subject to a nonrecourse liability, the net increase or decrease in partnership minimum gain for the partnership taxable year of the revaluation is determined by: 


(i) First calculating the net decrease or increase in partnership minimum gain using the current year's book values and the prior year's partnership minimum gain amount; and 


(ii) Then adding back any decrease in minimum gain arising solely from the revaluation. 


(e) *Requirements to be satisfied.* Allocations of nonrecourse deductions are deemed to be in accordance with the partners' interests in the partnership only if— 


(1) Throughout the full term of the partnership requirements (*1*) and (*2*) of § 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(*b*) are satisfied (*i.e.,* capital accounts are maintained in accordance with § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) and liquidating distributions are required to be made in accordance with positive capital account balances), and requirement (*3*) of either § 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(*b*) or § 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(*d*) is satisfied (*i.e.,* partners with deficit capital accounts have an unconditional deficit restoration obligation or agree to a qualified income offset); 


(2) Beginning in the first taxable year of the partnership in which there are nonrecourse deductions and thereafter throughout the full term of the partnership, the partnership agreement provides for allocations of nonrecourse deductions in a manner that is reasonably consistent with allocations that have substantial economic effect of some other significant partnership item attributable to the property securing the nonrecourse liabilities; 


(3) Beginning in the first taxable year of the partnership that it has nonrecourse deductions or makes a distribution of proceeds of a nonrecourse liability that are allocable to an increase in partnership minimum gain, and thereafter throughout the full term of the partnership, the partnership agreement contains a provision that complies with the minimum gain chargeback requirement of paragraph (f) of this section; and 


(4) All other material allocations and capital account adjustments under the partnership agreement are recognized under § 1.704-1(b) (without regard to whether allocations of adjusted tax basis and amount realized under section 613A(c)(7)(D) are recognized under § 1.704-1(b)(4)(v)).


(f) *Minimum gain chargeback requirement*—(1) *In general.* If there is a net decrease in partnership minimum gain for a partnership taxable year, the minimum gain chargeback requirement applies and each partner must be allocated items of partnership income and gain for that year equal to that partner's share of the net decrease in partnership minimum gain (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(2)).


(2) *Exception for certain conversions and refinancings.* A partner is not subject to the minimum gain chargeback requirement to the extent the partner's share of the net decrease in partnership minimum gain is caused by a recharacterization of nonrecourse partnership debt as partially or wholly recourse debt or partner nonrecourse debt, and the partner bears the economic risk of loss (within the meaning of § 1.752-2) for the liability. 


(3) *Exception for certain capital contributions.* A partner is not subject to the minimum gain chargeback requirement to the extent the partner contributes capital to the partnership that is used to repay the nonrecourse liability or is used to increase the basis of the property subject to the nonrecourse liability, and the partner's share of the net decrease in partnership minimum gain results from the repayment or the increase to the property's basis. See paragraph (m), *Example* (1)(iv) of this section.


(4) *Waiver for certain income allocations that fail to meet minimum gain chargeback requirement if minimum gain chargeback distorts economic arrangement.* In any taxable year that a partnership has a net decrease in partnership minimum gain, if the minimum gain chargeback requirement would cause a distortion in the economic arrangement among the partners and it is not expected that the partnership will have sufficient other income to correct that distortion, the Commissioner has the discretion, if requested by the partnership, to waive the minimum gain chargeback requirement. The following facts must be demonstrated in order for a request for a waiver to be considered:


(i) The partners have made capital contributions or received net income allocations that have restored the previous nonrecourse deductions and the distributions attributable to proceeds of a nonrecourse liability; and


(ii) The minimum gain chargeback requirement would distort the partners' economic arrangement as reflected in the partnership agreement and as evidenced over the term of the partnership by the partnership's allocations and distributions and the partners' contributions.


(5) *Additional exceptions.* The Commissioner may, by revenue ruling, provide additional exceptions to the minimum gain chargeback requirement.


(6) *Partnership items subject to the minimum gain chargeback requirement.* Any minimum gain chargeback required for a partnership taxable year consists first of a pro rata portion of certain gains recognized from the disposition of partnership property subject to one or more partnership nonrecourse liabilities and income from the discharge of indebtedness relating to one or more partnership nonrecourse liabilities to which partnership property is subject, and then, if necessary, consists of a pro rata portion of the partnership's other items of income and gain for that year. If the amount of the minimum gain chargeback requirement exceeds the partnership's income and gains for the taxable year, the excess carries over. See paragraphs (j)(2)(i) and (j)(2)(iii) of this section for more specific ordering rules.


(7) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the provisions in § 1.704-2(f).


(g) *Shares of partnership minimum gain*—(1) *Partner's share of partnership minimum gain.* Except as increased in paragraph (g) (3) of this section, a partner's share of partnership minimum gain at the end of any partnership taxable year equals:


(i) The sum of nonrecourse deductions allocated to that partner (and to that partner's predecessors in interest) up to that time and the distributions made to that partner (and to that partner's predecessors' in interest) up to that time of proceeds of a nonrecourse liability allocable to an increase in partnership minimum gain (see paragraph (h)(1) of this section); minus


(ii) The sum of that partner's (and that partner's predecessors' in interest) aggregate share of the net decreases in partnership minimum gain plus their aggregate share of decreases resulting from revaluations of partnership property subject to one or more partnership nonrecourse liabilities.


(2) *Partner's share of the net decrease in partnership minimum gain.* A partner's share of the net decrease in partnership minimum gain is the amount of the total net decrease multiplied by the partner's percentage share of the partnership's minimum gain at the end of the immediately preceding taxable year. A partner's share of any decrease in partnership minimum gain resulting from a revaluation of partnership property equals the increase in the partner's capital account attributable to the revaluation to the extent the reduction in minimum gain is caused by the revaluation. See paragraph (m), *Example* (3)(ii) of this section.


(3) *Conversions of recourse or partner nonrecourse debt into nonrecourse debt.* A partner's share of partnership minimum gain is increased to the extent provided in this paragraph (g)(3) if a recourse or partner nonrecourse liability becomes partially or wholly nonrecourse. If a recourse liability becomes a nonrecourse liability, a partner has a share of the partnership's minimum gain that results from the conversion equal to the partner's deficit capital account (determined under § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)) to the extent the partner no longer bears the economic burden for the entire deficit capital account as a result of the conversion. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the determination of the extent to which a partner bears the economic burden for a deficit capital account is made by determining the consequences to the partner in the case of a complete liquidation of the partnership immediately after the conversion applying the rules described in § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iii)(*c*) that deem the value of partnership property to equal its basis, taking into account section 7701(g) in the case of property that secures nonrecourse indebtedness. If a partner nonrecourse debt becomes a nonrecourse liability, the partner's share of partnership minimum gain is increased to the extent the partner is not subject to the minimum gain chargeback requirement under paragraph (i)(4) of this section.


(h) *Distribution of nonrecourse liability proceeds allocable to an increase in partnership minimum gain*—(1) *In general.* If during its taxable year a partnership makes a distribution to the partners allocable to the proceeds of a nonrecourse liability, the distribution is allocable to an increase in partnership minimum gain to the extent the increase results from encumbering partnership property with aggregate nonrecourse liabilities that exceed the property's adjusted tax basis. See paragraph (m), *Example* (1)(vi) of this section. If the net increase in partnership minimum gain for a partnership taxable year is allocable to more than one nonrecourse liability, the net increase is allocated among the liabilities in proportion to the amount each liability contributed to the increase in minimum gain.


(2) *Distribution allocable to nonrecourse liability proceeds.* A partnership may use any reasonable method to determine whether a distribution by the partnership to one or more partners is allocable to proceeds of a nonrecourse liability. The rules prescribed under § 1.163-8T for allocating debt proceeds among expenditures (applying those rules to the partnership as if it were an individual) constitute a reasonable method for determining whether the nonrecourse liability proceeds are distributed to the partners and the partners to whom the proceeds are distributed. 


(3) *Option when there is an obligation to restore.* A partnership may treat any distribution to a partner of the proceeds of a nonrecourse liability (that would otherwise be allocable to an increase in partnership minimum gain) as a distribution that is not allocable to an increase in partnership minimum gain to the extent the distribution does not cause or increase a deficit balance in the partner's capital account that exceeds the amount the partner is otherwise obligated to restore (within the meaning of § 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(*c*)) as of the end of the partnership taxable year in which the distribution occurs. 


(4) *Carryover to immediately succeeding taxable year.* The carryover rule of this paragraph applies if the net increase in partnership minimum gain for a partnership taxable year that is allocable to a nonrecourse liability under paragraph (h)(2) of this section exceeds the distributions allocable to the proceeds of the liability (“excess allocable amount”), and all or part of the net increase in partnership minimum gain for the year is carried over as an increase in partnership minimum gain for the immediately succeeding taxable year (pursuant to paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section). If the carryover rule of this paragraph applies, the excess allocable amount (or the amount carried over under paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section, if less) is treated in the succeeding taxable year as an increase in partnership minimum gain that arose in that year as a result of incurring the nonrecourse liability to which the excess allocable amount is attributable. See paragraph (m), *Example* (1)(vi) of this section. If for a partnership taxable year there is an excess allocable amount with respect to more than one partnership nonrecourse liability, the excess allocable amount is allocated to each liability in proportion to the amount each liability contributed to the increase in minimum gain.


(i) *Partnership nonrecourse liabilities where a partner bears the economic risk of loss*—(1) *In general.* Partnership losses, deductions, or section 705(a)(2)(B) expenditures that are attributable to a particular partner nonrecourse liability (“partner nonrecourse deductions,” as defined in paragraph (i)(2) of this section) must be allocated to the partner that bears the economic risk of loss for the liability. If more than one partner bears the economic risk of loss for a partner nonrecourse liability, any partner nonrecourse deductions attributable to that liability must be allocated among the partners according to the ratio in which they bear the economic risk of loss. If partners bear the economic risk of loss for different portions of a liability, each portion is treated as a separate partner nonrecourse liability. 


(2) *Definition of and determination of partner nonrecourse deductions.* For any partnership taxable year, the amount of partner nonrecourse deductions with respect to a partner nonrecourse debt equals the net increase during the year in minimum gain attributable to the partner nonrecourse debt (“partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain”), reduced (but not below zero) by proceeds of the liability distributed during the year to the partner bearing the economic risk of loss for the liability that are both attributable to the liability and allocable to an increase in the partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain. See paragraph (m), *Example* (1) (vii) and (viii) of this section. The determination of which partnership items constitute the partner nonrecourse deductions with respect to a partner nonrecourse debt must be made in a manner consistent with the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (j)(1) (i) and (iii) of this section.


(3) *Determination of partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain.* For any partnership taxable year, the determination of partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain and the net increase or decrease in partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain must be made in a manner consistent with the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (g)(3) of this section.


(4) *Chargeback of partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain.* If during a partnership taxable year there is a net decrease in partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain, any partner with a share of that partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain (determined under paragraph (i)(5) of this section) as of the beginning of the year must be allocated items of income and gain for the year (and, if necessary, for succeeding years) equal to that partner's share of the net decrease in the partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain. A partner's share of the net decrease in partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain is determined in a manner consistent with the provisions of paragraph (g)(2) of this section. A partner is not subject to this minimum gain chargeback, however, to the extent the net decrease in partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain arises because a partner nonrecourse liability becomes partially or wholly a nonrecourse liability. The amount that would otherwise be subject to the partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain chargeback is added to the partner's share of partnership minimum gain under paragraph (g)(3) of this section. In addition, rules consistent with the provisions of paragraphs (f) (2), (3), (4), and (5) of this section apply with respect to partner nonrecourse debt in appropriate circumstances. The determination of which items of partnership income and gain must be allocated pursuant to this paragraph (i)(4) is made in a manner that is consistent with the provisions of paragraph (f)(6) of this section. See paragraph (j)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section for more specific rules. 


(5) *Partner's share of partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain.* A partner's share of partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain at the end of any partnership taxable year is determined in a manner consistent with the provisions of paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(3) of this section with respect to each particular partner nonrecourse debt for which the partner bears the economic risk of loss. For purposes of § 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(*d*), a partner's share of partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain is added to the limited dollar amount, if any, of the deficit balance in the partner's capital account that the partner is obligated to restore, and the partner is not otherwise considered to have a deficit restoration obligation as a result of bearing the economic risk of loss for any partner nonrecourse debt. See paragraph (m), *Example* (1)(vii) of this section. 


(6) *Distribution of partner nonrecourse debt proceeds allocable to an increase in partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain.* Rules consistent with the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section apply to distributions of the proceeds of partner nonrecourse debt. 


(j) *Ordering rules.* For purposes of this section, the following ordering rules apply to partnership items. Notwithstanding any other provision in this section and § 1.704-1, allocations of partner nonrecourse deductions, nonrecourse deductions, and minimum gain chargebacks are made before any other allocations. 


(1) *Treatment of partnership losses and deductions.* (i) *Partner nonrecourse deductions.* Partnership losses, deductions, and section 705(a)(2)(B) expenditures are treated as partner nonrecourse deductions in the amount determined under paragraph (i)(2) of this section (determining partner nonrecourse deductions) in the following order: 


(A) First, depreciation or cost recovery deductions with respect to property that is subject to partner nonrecourse debt; 


(B) Then, if necessary, a pro rata portion of the partnership's other deductions, losses, and section 705(a)(2)(B) items. 


(ii) *Partnership nonrecourse deductions.* Partnership losses, deductions, and section 705(a)(2)(B) expenditures are treated as partnership nonrecourse deductions in the amount determined under paragraph (c) of this section (determining nonrecourse deductions) in the following order:


(A) First, depreciation or cost recovery deductions with respect to property that is subject to partnership nonrecourse liabilities; 


(B) Then, if necessary, a pro rata portion of the partnership's other deductions, losses, and section 705(a)(2)(B) items. 


(iii) *Carryover to succeeding taxable year.* If the amount of partner nonrecourse deductions or nonrecourse deductions exceeds the partnership's losses, deductions, and section 705(a)(2)(B) expenditures for the taxable year (determined under paragraphs (j)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section), the excess is treated as an increase in partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain or partnership minimum gain in the immediately succeeding partnership taxable year. See paragraph (m), *Example* (1)(vi) of this section. 


(2) *Treatment of partnership income and gains.* (i) *Minimum gain chargeback.* Items of partnership income and gain equal to the minimum gain chargeback requirement (determined under paragraph (f) of this section) are allocated as a minimum gain chargeback in the following order:


(A) First, a pro rata portion of gain from the disposition of property subject to partnership nonrecourse liabilities and discharge of indebtedness income relating to partnership nonrecourse liabilities to which property is subject;


(B) Then, if necessary, a pro rata portion of the partnership's other items of income and gain for that year. 


(ii) *Chargeback attributable to decrease in partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain.* Items of partnership income and gain equal to the partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain chargeback (determined under paragraph (i)(4) of this section) are allocated to satisfy a partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain chargeback in the following order:


(A) First, a pro rata portion of gain from the disposition of property subject to partner nonrecourse debt and discharge of indebtedness income relating to partner nonrecourse debt to which property is subject.


(B) Then, if necessary, a pro rata portion of the partnership's other items of income and gain for that year. 


(iii) *Carryover to succeeding taxable year.* If a minimum gain chargeback requirement (determined under paragraphs (f) and (i)(4) of this section) exceeds the partnership's income and gains for the taxable year, the excess is treated as a minimum gain chargeback requirement in the immediately succeeding partnership taxable years until fully charged back.


(k) *Tiered partnerships.* For purposes of this section, the following rules determine the effect on partnership minimum gain when a partnership (“upper-tier partnership”) is a partner in another partnership (“lower-tier partnership”).


(1) *Increase in upper-tier partnership's minimum gain.* The sum of the nonrecourse deductions that the lower-tier partnership allocates to the upper-tier partnership for any taxable year of the upper-tier partnership, and the distributions made during that taxable year from the lower-tier partnership to the upper-tier partnership of proceeds of nonrecourse debt that are allocable to an increase in the lower-tier partnership's minimum gain, is treated as an increase in the upper-tier partnership's minimum gain.


(2) *Decrease in upper-tier partnership's minimum gain.* The upper-tier partnership's share for its taxable year of the lower-tier partnership's net decrease in its minimum gain is treated as a decrease in the upper-tier partnership's minimum gain for that taxable year.


(3) *Nonrecourse debt proceeds distributed from the lower-tier partnership to the upper-tier partnership.* All distributions from the lower-tier partnership to the upper-tier partnership during the upper-tier partnership's taxable year of proceeds of a nonrecourse liability allocable to an increase in the lower-tier partnership's minimum gain are treated as proceeds of a nonrecourse liability of the upper-tier partnership. The increase in the upper-tier partnership's minimum gain (under paragraph (k)(1) of this section) attributable to the receipt of those distributions is, for purposes of paragraph (h) of this section, treated as an increase in the upper-tier partnership's minimum gain arising from encumbering property of the upper-tier partnership with a nonrecourse liability of the upper-tier partnership.


(4) *Nonrecourse deductions of lower-tier partnership treated as depreciation by upper-tier partnership.* For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, all nonrecourse deductions allocated by the lower-tier partnership to the upper-tier partnership for the upper-tier partnership's taxable year are treated as depreciation or cost recovery deductions with respect to property owned by the upper-tier partnership and subject to a nonrecourse liability of the upper-tier partnership with respect to which minimum gain increased during the year by the amount of the nonrecourse deductions.


(5) *Coordination with partner nonrecourse debt rules.* The lower-tier partnership's liabilities that are treated as the upper-tier partnership's liabilities under § 1.752-4(a) are treated as the upper-tier partnership's liabilities for purposes of applying paragraph (i) of this section. In addition, for purposes of applying paragraph (i) of this section, the upper-tier partnership is treated as bearing the economic risk of loss for the lower-tier partnership's liabilities that are treated as the upper-tier partnership's liabilities under § 1.752-4(a). Rules consistent with the provisions of paragraphs (k)(1) through (k)(4) of this section apply to determine the allocations that the upper-tier partnership must make with respect to any liability that constitutes a nonrecourse debt for which one or more partners of the upper-tier partnership bear the economic risk of loss.


(l) *Effective/applicability dates*—(1) *In general*—(i) *Prospective application.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (l), this section applies for partnership taxable years beginning on or after December 28, 1991. For the rules applicable to taxable years beginning after December 29, 1988, and before December 28, 1991, see former § 1.704-1T(b)(4)(iv). For the rules applicable to taxable years beginning on or before December 29, 1988, see former § 1.704-1(b)(4)(iv). 


(ii) *Partnerships subject to temporary regulations.* If a partnership agreement entered into after December 29, 1988, and before December 28, 1991, or a partnership agreement entered into on or before December 29, 1988, that elected to apply former § 1.704-1T(b)(4)(iv) (as contained in the CFR edition revised as of April 1, 1991), complied with the provisions of former § 1.704-1T(b)(4)(iv) before December 28, 1991—


(A) The provisions of former § 1.704-1T(b)(4)(iv) continue to apply to the partnership for any taxable year beginning on or after December 28, 1991, (unless the partnership makes an election under paragraph (l)(4) of this section) and ending before any subsequent material modification to the partnership agreement; and


(B) The provisions of this section do not apply to the partnership for any of those taxable years.


(iii) *Partnerships subject to former regulations.* If a partnership agreement entered into on or before December 29, 1988, complied with the provisions of former § 1.704-1(b)(4)(iv)(*d*) on or before that date—


(A) The provisions of former § 1.704-1(b)(4)(iv) (*a*) through (*f*) continue to apply to the partnership for any taxable year beginning after that date (unless the partnership made an election under § 1.704-1T(b)(4)(iv)(*m*)(*4*) in a partnership taxable year ending before December 28, 1991, or makes an election under paragraph (l)(4) of this section) and ending before any subsequent material modification to the partnership agreement; and


(B) The provisions of this section do not apply to the partnership for any of those taxable years.


(iv) Paragraph (f)(2), the first sentence of paragraph (g)(3), and the third sentence of paragraph (i)(4) of this section apply to liabilities incurred or assumed by a partnership on or after October 11, 2006 other than liabilities incurred or assumed by a partnership pursuant to a written binding contract in effect prior to October 11, 2006. The rules applicable to liabilities incurred or assumed (or subject to a binding contract in effect) prior to October 11, 2006 are contained in this section in effect prior to October 11, 2006. (See 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2006.) 


(v) The first sentence of paragraph (f)(6) of this section and paragraphs (j)(2)(i)(A) and (j)(2)(ii)(A) of this section apply on and after November 17, 2011.


(vi) The second sentence of paragraph (k)(5) of this section applies on or after *December 2, 2024.*

(2) *Special rule applicable to pre-January 30, 1989, related party nonrecourse debt.* For purposes of this section and former § 1.704-1T(b)(4)(iv), if—


(i) A partnership liability would, but for this paragraph (l)(2) of this section, constitute a partner nonrecourse debt; and

(3) *Transition rule for pre-March 1, 1984, partner nonrecourse debt.* If a partnership liability would, but for this paragraph (l)(3) or former § 1.704-1T(b)(4)(iv), constitute a partner nonrecourse debt and the liability constitutes grandfathered partner nonrecourse debt that is appropriately treated as a nonrecourse liability of the partnership under § 1.752-1 (as in effect prior to December 29, 1988)—


(i) The liability is, notwithstanding paragraphs (i) and (b)(4) of this section, former § 1.704-1T(b)(4)(iv), and former § 1.704-1(b)(4)(iv), treated as a nonrecourse liability of the partnership for purposes of this section and for purposes of former § 1.704-1T(b)(4)(iv) and former § 1.704-1(b)(4)(iv) to the extent of the amount, if any, by which the smallest outstanding balance of the liability during the period beginning at the end of the first partnership taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1986, and ending at the time of any determination under this paragraph (l)(3)(i) or former § 1.704-1T(b)(4)(iv)(*m*)(*3*)(*i*) exceeds the aggregate amount of the adjusted basis (or book value) of partnership property allocable to the liability (determined in accordance with former § 1.704-1(b)(4)(iv)(*c*) (*1*) and (*2*) at the end of the first partnership taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1986); and 


(ii) In applying this section to the liability, former § 1.704-1(b)(4)(iv)(*c*) (*1*) and (*2*) is applied as if all of the adjusted basis of partnership property allocable to the liability is allocable to the portion of the liability that is treated as a partner nonrecourse debt and as if none of the adjusted basis of partnership property that is allocable to the liability is allocable to the portion of the liability that is treated as a nonrecourse liability under this paragraph (l)(3) and former § 1.704-1T (b)(4)(iv)(*m*)(*3*)(*i*).


(4) *Election.* A partnership may elect to apply the provisions of this section to the first taxable year of the partnership ending on or after December 28, 1991.
