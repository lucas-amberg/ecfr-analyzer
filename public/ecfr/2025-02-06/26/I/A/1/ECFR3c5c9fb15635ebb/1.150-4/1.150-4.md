# § 1.150-4   Change in use of facilities financed with tax-exempt private activity bonds.

(a) *Scope.* This section applies for purposes of the rules for change of use of facilities financed with private activity bonds under sections 150(b)(3) (relating to qualified 501(c)(3) bonds), 150(b)(4) (relating to certain exempt facility bonds and small issue bonds), 150(b)(5) (relating to facilities required to be owned by governmental units or 501(c)(3) organizations), and 150(c).


(b) *Effect of remedial actions*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in this section, the change of use provisions of sections 150(b) (3) through (5), and 150(c) apply even if the issuer takes a remedial action described in §§ 1.142-2, 1.144-2, or 1.145-2.


(2) *Exceptions*—(i) *Redemption.* If nonqualified bonds are redeemed within 90 days of a deliberate action under § 1.145-2(a) or within 90 days of the date on which a failure to properly use proceeds occurs under § 1.142-2 or § 1.144-2, sections 150(b) (3) through (5) do not apply during the period between that date and the date on which the nonqualified bonds are redeemed.


(ii) *Alternative qualifying use of facility.* If a bond-financed facility is used for an alternative qualifying use under §§ 1.145-2 and 1.141-12(f), sections 150(b) (3) and (5) do not apply because of the alternative use.


(iii) *Alternative use of disposition proceeds.* If disposition proceeds are used for a qualifying purpose under §§ 1.145-2 and 1.141-12(e), 1.142-2(c)(4), or 1.144-2, sections 150(b) (3) through (5) do not apply because of the deliberate action that gave rise to the disposition proceeds after the date on which all of the disposition proceeds have been expended on the qualifying purpose. If all of the disposition proceeds are so expended within 90 days of the date of the deliberate action, however, sections 150(b) (3) through (5) do not apply because of the deliberate action.


(c) *Allocation rules*—(1) *In general.* If a change in use of a portion of the property financed with an issue of qualified private activity bonds causes section 150 (b)(3), (b)(4), or (b)(5) to apply to an issue, the bonds of the issue allocable to that portion under section 150(c)(3) are the same as the nonqualified bonds determined for purposes of §§ 1.142-1, 1.144-1, and 1.145-1, except that bonds allocable to all common areas are also allocated to that portion.


(2) *Special rule when remedial action is taken.* If an issuer takes a remedial action with respect to an issue of private activity bonds under §§ 1.142-2, 1.144-2, or 1.145-2, the bonds of the issue allocable to a portion of property are the same as the nonqualified bonds determined for purposes of those sections.


(d) *Effective dates.* For effective dates of this section, see § 1.141-16.
