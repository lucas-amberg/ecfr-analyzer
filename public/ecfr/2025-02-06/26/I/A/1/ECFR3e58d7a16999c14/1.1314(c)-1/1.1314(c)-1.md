# ยง 1.1314(c)-1   Adjustment unaffected by other items.

(a) The amount of any adjustment ascertained under ยง 1.1314(a)-1 or ยง 1.1314(a)-2 shall not be diminished by any credit or set-off based upon any item other than the one that was the subject of the adjustment.


(b) The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:


(c) If the Commissioner has refunded the amount of an adjustment under section 1311, the amount so refunded may not subsequently be recovered by the Commissioner in any suit for erroneous refund based upon any item other than the one that was the subject of the adjustment,


(d) If the Commissioner has assessed and collected the amount of an adjustment under section 1311, no part thereof may be recovered by the taxpayer in any suit for refund based upon any item other than the one that was the subject of the adjustment.


(e) If the amount of the adjustment is considered an overpayment, it may be credited, under applicable law and regulations, together with any interest allowed thereon, against any liability in respect of an internal revenue tax on the part of the person who made such overpayment. Likewise, if the amount of the adjustment is considered as a deficiency, any overpayment by the taxpayer of any internal revenue tax may be credited against the amount of such adjustment in accordance with the applicable law and regulations thereunder. (See section 6402 and the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws.) Accordingly, it may be possible in one transaction between the Commissioner and the taxpayer to settle the taxpayer's tax liability for the year with respect to which the determination is made and to make the adjustment under section 1311 for the year with respect to which the error was made or for a year which is affected, or treated as affected, by a net operating loss deduction or a capital loss carryover from the year of the error.
