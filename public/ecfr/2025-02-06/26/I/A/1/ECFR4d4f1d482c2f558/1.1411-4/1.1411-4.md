# § 1.1411-4   Definition of net investment income.

(a) *In general.* For purposes of section 1411 and the regulations thereunder, net investment income means the excess (if any) of—


(1) The sum of—


(i) Gross income from interest, dividends, annuities, royalties, and rents, except to the extent excluded by the ordinary course of a trade or business exception described in paragraph (b) of this section;


(ii) Other gross income derived from a trade or business described in § 1.1411-5; and


(iii) Net gain (to the extent taken into account in computing taxable income) attributable to the disposition of property, except to the extent excluded by the exception described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(A) of this section for gain or loss attributable to property held in a trade or business not described in § 1.1411-5; over


(2) The deductions allowed by subtitle A that are properly allocable to such gross income or net gain (as determined in paragraph (f) of this section).


(b) *Ordinary course of a trade or business exception.* Gross income described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is excluded from net investment income if it is derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business not described in § 1.1411-5. See § 1.1411-6 for rules regarding working capital. To determine whether gross income described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is derived in a trade or business, the following rules apply.


(1) In the case of an individual, estate, or trust that owns or engages in a trade or business directly (or indirectly through ownership of an interest in an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner under § 301.7701-3), the determination of whether gross income described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is derived in a trade or business is made at the individual, estate, or trust level.


(2) In the case of an individual, estate, or trust that owns an interest in a passthrough entity (for example, a partnership or S corporation), and that entity is engaged in a trade or business, the determination of whether gross income described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is—


(i) Derived in a trade or business described in § 1.1411-5(a)(1) is made at the owner level; and


(ii) Derived in a trade or business described in § 1.1411-5(a)(2) is made at the entity level.


(3) The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (b). For purposes of these examples, assume that the taxpayer is a United States citizen, uses a calendar taxable year, and Year 1 and all subsequent years are taxable years in which section 1411 is in effect:


(c) *Other gross income from a trade or business described in § 1.1411-5.* For a trade or business described in § 1.1411-5, paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section includes all other gross income (within the meaning of section 61) that is not gross income described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section or net gain described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.


(d) *Net gain.* This paragraph (d) describes special rules for purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.


(1) *Definition of disposition.* For purposes of section 1411 and the regulations thereunder, the term *disposition* means a sale, exchange, transfer, conversion, cash settlement, cancellation, termination, lapse, expiration, or other disposition (including a deemed disposition, for example, under section 877A).


(2) *Limitation.* The calculation of net gain may not be less than zero. Losses allowable under section 1211(b) are permitted to offset gain from the disposition of assets other than capital assets that are subject to section 1411.


(3) *Net gain attributable to the disposition of property*—(i) *General rule.* Net gain attributable to the disposition of property is the gain described in section 61(a)(3) recognized from the disposition of property reduced, but not below zero, by losses deductible under section 165, including losses attributable to casualty, theft, and abandonment or other worthlessness. The rules in subchapter O of chapter 1 and the regulations thereunder apply. See, for example, § 1.61-6(b). For purposes of this paragraph, net gain includes, but is not limited to, gain or loss attributable to the disposition of property from the investment of working capital (as defined in § 1.1411-6); gain or loss attributable to the disposition of a life insurance contract; and gain attributable to the disposition of an annuity contract to the extent the sales price of the annuity exceeds the annuity's surrender value.


(ii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (d)(3). For purposes of these examples, assume that the taxpayer is a United States citizen, uses a calendar taxable year, and Year 1 and all subsequent years are taxable years in which section 1411 is in effect:


(4) *Gains and losses excluded from net investment income*—(i) *Exception for gain or loss attributable to property held in a trade or business not described in § 1.1411-5*—(A) *General rule.* Net gain does not include gain or loss attributable to property (other than property from the investment of working capital (as described in § 1.1411-6)) held in a trade or business not described in § 1.1411-5.


(B) *Special rules for determining whether property is held in a trade or business.* To determine whether net gain described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section is from property held in a trade or business—


(*1*) A partnership interest or S corporation stock generally is not property held in a trade or business. Therefore, gain from the sale of a partnership interest or S corporation stock is generally gain described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section. However, net gain does not include certain gain or loss attributable to the disposition of certain interests in partnerships and S corporations as provided in § 1.1411-7.


(*2*) In the case of an individual, estate, or trust that owns or engages in a trade or business directly (or indirectly through ownership of an interest in an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner under § 301.7701-3), the determination of whether net gain described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section is attributable to property held in a trade or business is made at the individual, estate, or trust level.


(*3*) In the case of an individual, estate, or trust that owns an interest in a passthrough entity (for example, a partnership or S corporation), and that entity is engaged in a trade or business, the determination of whether net gain described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section from such entity is attributable to—


(*i*) Property held in a trade or business described in § 1.1411-5(a)(1) is made at the owner level; and


(*ii*) Property held in a trade or business described in § 1.1411-5(a)(2) is made at the entity level.


(C) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (d)(4)(i). For purposes of these examples, assume the taxpayer is a United States citizen, uses a calendar taxable year, and Year 1 and all subsequent years are taxable years in which section 1411 is in effect:


(ii) *Other gains and losses excluded from net investment income.* Net gain, as determined under paragraph (d) of this section, does not include gains and losses excluded from net investment income by any other provision in §§ 1.1411-1 through 1.1411-10. For example, see § 1.1411-7 (certain gain or loss attributable to the disposition of certain interests in partnerships and S corporations) and § 1.1411-8(b)(4)(ii) (net unrealized appreciation attributable to employer securities realized on a disposition of those employer securities).


(iii) *Adjustment for capital loss carryforwards for previously excluded income.* [Reserved]


(e) *Net investment income attributable to certain entities*—(1) *Distributions from estates and trusts*—(i) *In general.* Net investment income includes a beneficiary's share of distributable net income, as described in sections 652(a) and 662(a), to the extent that, under sections 652(b) and 662(b), the character of such income constitutes gross income from items described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section or net gain attributable to items described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, with further computations consistent with the principles of this section, as provided in § 1.1411-3(e).


(ii) *Distributions of accumulated net investment income from foreign nongrantor trusts to United States beneficiaries.* [Reserved]


(2) *CFCs and PFICs.* For purposes of calculating net investment income, additional rules in § 1.1411-10(c) apply to an individual, an estate, or a trust that is a United States shareholder that owns an interest in a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) or that is a United States person that directly or indirectly owns an interest in a passive foreign investment company (PFIC).


(3) *Treatment of income from common trust funds.* [Reserved]


(f) *Properly allocable deductions*—(1) *General rule*—(i) *In general.* Unless provided elsewhere in §§ 1.1411-1 through 1.1411-10, only properly allocable deductions described in this paragraph (f) may be taken into account in determining net investment income.


(ii) *Limitations.* Any deductions described in this paragraph (f) in excess of gross income and net gain described in section 1411(c)(1)(A) are not taken into account in determining net investment income in any other taxable year, except as allowed under chapter 1.


(2) *Properly allocable deductions described in section 62*—(i) *Deductions allocable to gross income from rents and royalties.* Deductions described in section 62(a)(4) allocable to rents and royalties described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section are taken into account in determining net investment income.


(ii) *Deductions allocable to gross income from trades or businesses described in § 1.1411-5.* Deductions described in section 62(a)(1) allocable to income from a trade or business described in § 1.1411-5 are taken into account in determining net investment income to the extent the deductions have not been taken into account in determining self-employment income within the meaning of § 1.1411-9.


(iii) *Penalty on early withdrawal of savings.* Deductions described in section 62(a)(9) are taken into account in determining net investment income.


(iv) *Net operating loss.* The total section 1411 NOL amount of a net operating loss deduction allowed under section 172 is allowed as a properly allocable deduction in determining net investment income for any taxable year. See paragraph (h) of this section for the calculation of the total section 1411 NOL amount of a net operating loss deduction.


(v) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (f)(2). For purposes of these examples, assume the taxpayer is a United States citizen, uses a calendar taxable year, and Year 1 and all subsequent years are taxable years in which section 1411 is in effect:


(3) *Properly allocable deductions described in section 63(d).* In determining net investment income, the following itemized deductions are taken into account:


(i) *Investment interest expense.* Investment interest (as defined in section 163(d)(3)) to the extent allowed under section 163(d)(1). Any investment interest not allowed under section 163(d)(1) is treated as investment interest paid or accrued by the taxpayer in the succeeding taxable year. The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph. For purposes of this example, assume that the taxpayer uses a calendar taxable year, and Year 1 and all subsequent years are taxable years in which section 1411 is in effect:


(A) In Year 1, A, an unmarried individual, pays interest of $4,000 on debt incurred to purchase stock. Under § 1.163-8T, this interest is allocable to the stock and is investment interest within the meaning of section 163(d)(3). A has no investment income as defined by section 163(d)(4). A has $10,000 of income from a trade or business that is a passive activity (as defined in § 1.1411-5(a)(1)) with respect to A. For income tax purposes, under section 163(d)(1), A may not deduct the $4,000 investment interest in Year 1 because A does not have any section 163(d)(4) net investment income. Under section 163(d)(2), the $4,000 investment interest is a carryforward of disallowed interest that is treated as investment interest paid by A in the succeeding taxable year. Similarly, for purposes of determining A's Year 1 net investment income, A may not deduct the $4,000 investment interest.


(B) In Year 2, A has $5,000 of section 163(d)(4) net investment income. For both income tax purposes and for determining section 1411 net investment income, A's $4,000 carryforward of interest expense disallowed in Year 1 may be deducted in Year 2.


(ii) *Investment expenses.* Investment expenses (as defined in section 163(d)(4)(C)).


(iii) *Taxes described in section 164(a)(3).* State, local, and foreign income, war profits, and excess profit taxes described in section 164(a)(3) that are allocable to net investment income pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section. Except to the extent specifically expected from section 275(a)(4), foreign income, war profits, and excess profit taxes are not allowed as deductions under section 164(a)(3) in determining net investment income if the taxpayer claims the benefit of the foreign tax credit under section 901 with respect to the same taxable year. For rules applicable to refunds of taxes described in this paragraph, see paragraph (g)(2) of this section.


(iv) *Items described in section 72(b)(3).* In the case of an amount allowed as a deduction to the annuitant for the annuitant's last taxable year under section 72(b)(3), such amount is allowed as a properly allocable deduction in the same taxable year if the income from the annuity (had the annuitant lived to receive such income) would have been included in net investment income under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section (and not excluded from net investment income by reason of § 1.1411-8).


(v) *Items described in section 691(c).* Deductions for estate and generation-skipping taxes allowed by section 691(c) that are allocable to net investment income; provided, however, that any portion of the section 691(c) deduction described in section 691(c)(4) is taken into account instead in computing net gain under paragraph (d) and not under this paragraph (f)(3)(v).


(vi) *Items described in section 212(3).* Amounts described in section 212(3) and § 1.212-1(l) to the extent they are allocable to net investment income pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section.


(vii) *Amortizable bond premium.* A deduction allowed under section 171(a)(1) for the amortizable bond premium on a taxable bond (for example, see § 1.171-2(a)(4)(i)(C) for the treatment of a bond premium carryforward as a deduction under section 171(a)(1)).


(viii) *Fiduciary expenses.* In the case of an estate or trust, amounts described in § 1.212-1(i) to the extent they are allocable to net investment income pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section.


(4) *Loss deductions*—(i) *General rule.* Losses described in section 165, whether described in section 62 or section 63(d), are allowed as properly allocable deductions to the extent such losses exceed the amount of gain described in section 61(a)(3) and are not taken into account in computing net gain by reason of paragraph (d) of this section.


(ii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (f)(4). For purposes of these examples, assume the taxpayer is a United States citizen, uses a calendar taxable year, and Year 1 and all subsequent years are taxable years in which section 1411 is in effect:


(5) *Ordinary loss deductions for certain debt instruments.* An amount treated as an ordinary loss by a holder of a contingent payment debt instrument under § 1.1275-4(b) or an inflation-indexed debt instrument under § 1.1275-7(f)(1).


(6) *Other deductions.* Any other deduction allowed by subtitle A that is identified in published guidance in the _Federal Register_ or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(*b*) of this chapter) as properly allocable to gross income or net gain under this section.


(7) *Application of limitations under sections 67 and 68.* Any deductions described in this paragraph (f) that are subject to section 67 (the 2-percent floor on miscellaneous itemized deductions) or section 68 (the overall limitation on itemized deductions) are allowed in determining net investment income only to the extent the items are deductible for chapter 1 purposes after the application of sections 67 and 68. For this purpose, section 67 applies before section 68. The amount of deductions subject to sections 67 and 68 that may be deducted in determining net investment income after the application of sections 67 and 68 is determined as described in paragraph (f)(7)(i) and (f)(7)(ii) of this section.


(i) *Deductions subject to section 67.* The amount of miscellaneous itemized deductions (as defined in section 67(b)) tentatively deductible in determining net investment income after applying section 67 (but before applying section 68) is the lesser of:


(A) The portion of the taxpayer's miscellaneous itemized deductions (before the application of section 67) that is properly allocable to items of income or net gain included in determining net investment income, or


(B) The taxpayer's total miscellaneous itemized deductions allowed after the application of section 67, but before the application of section 68.


(ii) *Deductions subject to section 68.* The amount of itemized deductions allowed in determining net investment income after applying sections 67 and 68 is the lesser of:


(A) The sum of the amount determined under paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section and the amount of itemized deductions not subject to section 67 that are properly allocable to items of income or net gain included in determining net investment income, or


(B) The total amount of itemized deductions allowed after the application of sections 67 and 68.


(iii) *Itemized deductions.* For purposes of paragraph (f)(7)(ii), itemized deductions do not include any deduction described in section 68(c).


(iv) *Example.* The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (f)(7). For purposes of these examples, assume the taxpayer is a United States citizen, uses a calendar taxable year, and Year 1 and all subsequent years are taxable years in which section 1411 is in effect: 


(A) A, an unmarried individual, has adjusted gross income in Year 1 as follows:


In addition, A has the following items of expense qualifying as itemized deductions:


A's investment expenses and job-related expenses are miscellaneous itemized deductions. In addition, A's investment interest expense and investment expenses are properly allocable to net investment income (within the meaning of this section). A's job-related expenses are not properly allocable to net investment income. Of the state income tax expense, A applied a reasonable method pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section to properly allocate $20,000 to net investment income.


(B) A's 2-percent floor under section 67 is $40,000 (2% of $2,000,000). For Year 1, assume the section 68 limitation starts at adjusted gross income of $200,000. The section 68 overall limitation disallows $54,000 of A's itemized deductions that are subject to section 68 (3% of the excess of the $2,000,000 adjusted gross income over the $200,000 limitation threshold).


(C)(1) A's total miscellaneous itemized deductions allowable before the application of section 67 is $100,000 ($70,000 in investment expenses plus $30,000 in job-related expenses), and the total miscellaneous deductions allowed after the application of section 67 is $60,000 ($100,000 minus $40,000).


(2) The amount of the miscellaneous itemized deductions properly allocable to net investment income after the application of section 67 is $60,000 (the lesser of $70,000 in investment expenses that are deductible as a miscellaneous itemized deduction and properly allocable to net investment income or $60,000 of miscellaneous itemized deductions allocable to net investment income allowed after the application of section 67).


(D)(1) The amount of itemized deductions allocable to net investment income after applying section 67 to deductions that are also miscellaneous itemized deductions but before applying section 68 is $155,000. This amount is the sum of $60,000 of miscellaneous itemized deductions determined in (C)(2), plus $20,000 in state income tax properly allocable to net investment income, plus $75,000 of investment interest expense. However, under section 68(c)(2), the $75,000 deduction for investment interest expenses is not subject to the section 68 limitation on itemized deductions and is excluded from the computation under § 1.1411-4(f)(7). Thus, the amount of itemized deductions allocable to net investment income and subject to section 68, after applying section 67 but before applying section 68, is $80,000.


(2) A's total itemized deductions allowed subject to the limitation under section 68 and after application of section 67, but before the application of section 68, are the following:


(3) Of A's itemized deductions that are subject to the limitation under section 68, the amount allowed after the application of section 68 is $126,000 ($180,000 minus the $54,000 disallowed in (B)).


(E) Under paragraph (f)(7)(ii) of this section, the amount of itemized deductions allowed in determining net investment income after applying sections 67 and 68 is the lesser of $80,000 (the sum of $60,000 determined under paragraph (C)(2) and $20,000 state income tax allocable to net investment income) or $126,000 (determined under (D)(3)). Therefore, A's itemized deductions that are properly allocable to net investment income are $155,000 ($80,000 of properly allocable itemized deductions subject to section 67 or 68 plus $75,000 of investment interest expense (which is not subject to either section 67 or section 68 limitations)).


(g) *Special rules*—(1) *Deductions allocable to both net investment income and excluded income.* In the case of a properly allocable deduction described in section 1411(c)(1)(B) and paragraph (f) of this section that is allocable to both net investment income and excluded income, the portion of the deduction that is properly allocable to net investment income may be determined by taxpayers using any reasonable method. Examples of reasonable methods of allocation include, but are not limited to, an allocation of the deduction based on the ratio of the amount of a taxpayer's gross income (including net gain) described in § 1.1411-4(a)(1) to the amount of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income (as defined under section 62 (or section 67(e) in the case of an estate or trust)). In the case of an estate or trust, an allocation of a deduction pursuant to rules described in § 1.652(b)-3(b) (and § 1.641(c)-1(h) in the case of an ESBT) is also a reasonable method.


(2) *Recoveries of properly allocable deductions*—(i) *General rule.* If a taxpayer is refunded, reimbursed, or otherwise recovers any portion of an amount deducted as a section 1411(c)(1)(B) properly allocable deduction in a prior year, and such amount is not otherwise included in net investment income in the year of recovery under section 1411(c)(1)(A), the amount of the recovery will reduce the taxpayer's total section 1411(c)(1)(B) properly allocable deductions in the year of recovery (but not below zero). The preceding sentence applies regardless of whether the amount of the recovery is excluded from gross income by reason of section 111.


(ii) *Recoveries of items allocated between net investment income and excluded income.* In the case of a refund of any item that was deducted under section 1411(c)(1)(B) in a prior year and the gross amount of the deduction was allocated between items of net investment income and excluded income pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the amount of the reduction in section 1411(c)(1)(B) properly allocable deductions in the year of receipt under this paragraph (g)(2) is the total amount of the refund multiplied by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the amount of the total deduction allocable to net investment income in the prior year to which the refund relates. The denominator of the fraction is the total amount of the deduction in the prior year to which the refund relates.


(iii) *Recoveries with no prior year benefit.* For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2), section 111 applies to reduce the amount of any reduction required by paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section to the extent that such previously deducted amount did not reduce the tax imposed by section 1411. To the extent a deduction is taken into account in computing a taxpayer's net operating loss deduction under paragraph (h) of this section, section 111(c) applies. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this paragraph (g)(2), no reduction of section 1411(c)(1)(B) properly allocable deductions is required in a year when such recovered item is attributable to an amount deducted in a taxable year—


(A) Preceding the effective date of section 1411, or


(B) In which the taxpayer was not subject to section 1411 solely because that individual's (as defined in § 1.1411-2(a)) modified adjusted gross income (as defined in § 1.1411-2(c)) does not exceed the applicable threshold in § 1.1411-2(d) or such estate's or trust's (as defined in § 1.1411-3(a)(1)(i)) adjusted gross income does not exceed the amount described in section 1411(a)(2)(B)(ii) and § 1.1411-3(a)(1)(ii)(B)(*2*).


(iv) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (g)(2). For purposes of these examples, assume the taxpayer is a United States citizen, uses a calendar taxable year, and Year 1 and all subsequent years are taxable years in which section 1411 is in effect:


(3) *Deductions described in section 691(b).* For purposes of paragraph (f) of this section, properly allocable deductions include items of deduction described in section 691(b), provided that the item otherwise would have been deductible to the decedent under § 1.1411-4(f). For example, an estate may deduct the decedent's unpaid investment interest expense in computing its net investment income because section 691(b) specifically allows the deduction under section 163, and § 1.1411-4(f)(3)(i) allows those deductions as well. However, an estate or trust may not deduct a payment of real estate taxes on the decedent's principal residence that were unpaid at death in computing its net investment income because, although real estate taxes are deductible under section 164 and specifically are allowed by section 691(b), the real estate taxes would not have been a properly allocable deduction of the decedent under § 1.1411-4(f).


(4) *Amounts described in section 642(h).* For purposes of the calculation of net investment income under this section, one or more beneficiaries succeeding to the property of the estate or trust, within the meaning of section 642(h), shall—


(i) Treat excess capital losses of the estate or trust described in section 642(h)(1) as capital losses of the beneficiary in the calculation of net gain in paragraph (d) and paragraph (f)(4) of this section, as applicable, in a manner consistent with section 642(h)(1);


(ii) Treat excess net operating losses of the estate or trust described in section 642(h)(1) as net operating losses of the beneficiary in the calculation of net investment income in paragraphs (f)(2)(iv) and (h) of this section in a manner consistent with section 642(h)(1); and


(iii) Treat the deductions described in paragraph (f) of this section (other than those taken into account under paragraph (g)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section) that exceed the gross investment income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section (after taking into account any modifications, adjustments, and special rules for calculating net investment income in section 1411 and the regulations thereunder) of a terminating estate or trust as a section 1411(c)(1)(B) deduction of the beneficiary in a manner consistent with section 642(h)(2).


(5) *Treatment of self-charged interest income.* Gross income from interest (within the meaning of section 1411(c)(1)(A)(i) and paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section) that is received by the taxpayer from a nonpassive activity of such taxpayer, solely for purposes of section 1411, is treated as derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business not described in § 1.1411-5. The amount of interest income that is treated as derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business not described in § 1.1411-5, and thus excluded from the calculation of net investment income, under this paragraph (g)(5) is limited to the amount that would have been considered passive activity gross income under the rules of § 1.469-7 if the payor was a passive activity of the taxpayer. For purposes of this rule, the term nonpassive activity does not include a trade or business described in § 1.1411-5(a)(2). However, this rule does not apply to the extent the corresponding deduction is taken into account in determining self-employment income that is subject to tax under section 1401(b).


(6) *Treatment of certain nonpassive rental activities*—(i) *Gross income from rents.* To the extent that gross rental income described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is treated as not derived from a passive activity by reason of § 1.469-2(f)(6) or as a consequence of a taxpayer grouping a rental activity with a trade or business activity under § 1.469-4(d)(1), such gross rental income is deemed to be derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section.


(ii) *Gain or loss from the disposition of property.* To the extent that gain or loss resulting from the disposition of property is treated as nonpassive gain or loss by reason of § 1.469-2(f)(6) or as a consequence of a taxpayer grouping a rental activity with a trade or business activity under § 1.469-4(d)(1), then such gain or loss is deemed to be derived from property used in the ordinary course of a trade or business within the meaning of paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.


(7) *Treatment of certain real estate professionals*—(i) *Safe Harbor.* In the case of a real estate professional (as defined in section 469(c)(7)(B)) that participates in a rental real estate activity for more than 500 hours during such year, or has participated in such real estate activities for more than 500 hours in any five taxable years (whether or not consecutive) during the ten taxable years that immediately precede the taxable year, then—


(A) Such gross rental income from that rental activity is deemed to be derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section; and


(B) Gain or loss resulting from the disposition of property used in such rental real estate activity is deemed to be derived from property used in the ordinary course of a trade or business within the meaning of paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.


(ii) *Definitions*—(A) *Participation.* For purposes of establishing participation under this paragraph (g)(7), any participation in the activity that would count towards establishing material participation under section 469 shall be considered.


(B) *Rental real estate activity.* The term *rental real estate activity* used in this paragraph (g)(7) is a rental activity within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3). An election to treat all rental real estate as a single rental activity under § 1.469-9(g) also applies for purposes of this paragraph (g)(7). However, any rental real estate that the taxpayer grouped with a trade or business activity under § 1.469-4(d)(1)(i)(A) or (d)(1)(i)(C) is not a rental real estate activity.


(iii) *Effect of safe harbor.* The inability of a real estate professional to satisfy the safe harbor in this paragraph (g)(7) does not preclude such taxpayer from establishing that such gross rental income and gain or loss from the disposition of property, as applicable, is not included in net investment income under any other provision of section 1411.


(8) *Treatment of former passive activities*—(i) *Section 469(f)(1)(A) losses.* Losses allowed in computing taxable income by reason of the rules governing former passive activities in section 469(f)(1)(A) are taken into account in computing net gain under paragraph (d) of this section or as properly allocable deductions under paragraph (f) of this section, as applicable, in the same manner as such losses are taken into account in computing taxable income (as defined in section 63). The preceding sentence applies only to the extent the net income or net gain from the former passive activity (as defined in section 469(f)(3)) is included in net investment income.


(ii) *Section 469(f)(1)(C) losses.* Losses allowed in computing taxable income by reason of section 469(f)(1)(C) are taken into account in computing net gain under paragraph (d) of this section or as properly allocable deductions under paragraph (f) of this section, as applicable, in the same manner as such losses are taken into account in computing taxable income (as defined in section 63).


(iii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (g)(8). For purposes of these examples, assume the taxpayer is a United States citizen, uses a calendar taxable year, and Year 1 and all subsequent years are taxable years in which section 1411 is in effect:


(9) *Treatment of section 469(g)(1) losses.* Losses allowed in computing taxable income by reason of section 469(g) are taken into account in computing net gain under paragraph (d) of this section or as properly allocable deductions under paragraph (f) of this section, as applicable, in the same manner as such losses are taken into account in computing taxable income (as defined in section 63).


(10) *Treatment of section 707(c) guaranteed payments.* [Reserved]


(11) *Treatment of section 736 payments.* [Reserved]


(12) *Income and deductions from certain notional principal contracts.* [Reserved]


(13) *Treatment of income or loss from REMIC residual interests.* [Reserved]


(h) *Net operating loss*—(1) *General rule.* For purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section, the total section 1411 NOL amount of a net operating loss deduction for a taxable year is calculated by first determining the applicable portion of the taxpayer's net operating loss for each loss year under paragraph (h)(2) of this section. Next, the applicable portion for each loss year is used to determine the section 1411 NOL amount for each net operating loss carried from a loss year and deducted in the taxable year as provided in paragraph (h)(3) of this section. The section 1411 NOL amounts of each net operating loss carried from a loss year and deducted in the taxable year are then added together as provided in paragraph (h)(4) of this section. This sum is the total section 1411 NOL amount of the net operating loss deduction for the taxable year that is allowed as a properly allocable deduction in determining net investment income for the taxable year. For purposes of this paragraph (h), both the amount of a net operating loss for a loss year and the amount of a net operating loss deduction refer to such amounts as determined for purposes of chapter 1.


(2) *Applicable portion of a net operating loss.* In any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2012, in which a taxpayer incurs a net operating loss, the applicable portion of such loss is the lesser of:


(i) The amount of the net operating loss for the loss year that the taxpayer would incur if only items of gross income that are used to determine net investment income and only properly allocable deductions are taken into account in determining the net operating loss in accordance with section 172(c) and (d); or


(ii) The amount of the taxpayer's net operating loss for the loss year.


(3) *Section 1411 NOL amount of a net operating loss carried to and deducted in a taxable year.* The section 1411 NOL amount of each net operating loss that is carried from a loss year that is allowed as a deduction is the total amount of such net operating loss carried from the loss year allowed as a deduction under section 172(a) in the taxable year multiplied by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the applicable portion of the net operating loss for that loss year, as determined under paragraph (h)(2) of this section. The denominator of the fraction is the total amount of the net operating loss for the same loss year.


(4) *Total section 1411 NOL amount of a net operating loss deduction.* The section 1411 NOL amounts of each net operating loss carried to and deducted in the taxable year as determined under paragraph (h)(3) of this section are added together to determine the *total* section 1411 NOL amount of the net operating loss deduction for the taxable year that is properly allocable to net investment income.


(5) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (h). For purposes of these examples, assume the taxpayer is a United States citizen, uses a calendar taxable year, and Year 1 and all subsequent years are taxable years in which section 1411 is in effect:


(i) *Effective/applicability date.* This section applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2013. However, taxpayers may apply this section to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012, in accordance with § 1.1411-1(f).
