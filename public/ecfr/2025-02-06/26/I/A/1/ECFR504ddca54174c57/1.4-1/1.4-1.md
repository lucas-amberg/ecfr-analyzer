# § 1.4-1   Number of exemptions.

(a) For the purpose of determining the optional tax imposed under section 3, the taxpayer shall use the number of exemptions allowable to him as deductions under section 151. See sections 151, 152, and 153, and the regulations thereunder. In general, one exemption is allowed for the taxpayer; one exemption for his spouse if a joint return is made, or if a separate return is made by the taxpayer and his spouse has no gross income for the calendar year in which the taxable year of the taxpayer begins and is not the dependent of another taxpayer for such calendar year; and one exemption for each dependent whose gross income for the calendar year in which the taxable year of the taxpayer begins is less than the applicable amount determined pursuant to § 1.151-2. No exemption is allowed for any dependent who has made a joint return with his spouse for the taxable year beginning in the calendar year in which the taxable year of the taxpayer begins. The taxpayer may, in certain cases, be allowed an exemption for a dependent child of the taxpayer notwithstanding the fact that such child has gross income equal to or in excess of the amount determined pursuant to § 1.151-2 applicable to the calendar year in which the taxable year of the taxpayer begins. The requirements for the allowance of such an exemption are set forth in paragraph (c) of § 1.152-1. See paragraphs (c) and (d) of § 1.151-1 with respect to additional exemptions for a taxpayer or spouse who has attained the age 65 years and for a blind taxpayer or blind spouse 


(b) The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:
