# ยง 1.4-2   Elections.

(a) *Making of election.* The election to pay the optional tax imposed under section 3 shall be made by (1) filing a return on Form 1040A, or (2) filing a return on Form 1040 and electing in such return, in accordance with the provisions of section 144 and the regulations thereunder, to take the standard deduction provided by section 141. 


(b) *Election under section 3 and election of standard deduction.* Section 144 (a) and the regulations thereunder provide rules for treating an election to pay the tax under section 3 as an election to take the standard deduction, and for treating an election to take the standard deduction as an election to pay the tax under section 3. For example, if the taxpayer's return shows $5,000 or more of adjusted gross income and he elects to take the standard deduction, he will be deemed to have elected to pay the tax under section 3 if it is subsequently determined that his correct adjusted gross income is less than $5,000. 


(c) [Reserved]


(d) *Change of election.* For rules relating to a change of election to pay, or not to pay, the optional tax imposed under section 3, see section 144 (b) and the regulations thereunder.
