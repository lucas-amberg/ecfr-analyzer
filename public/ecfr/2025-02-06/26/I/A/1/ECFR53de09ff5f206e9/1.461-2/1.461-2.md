# § 1.461-2   Contested liabilities.

(a) *General rule*—(1) *Taxable year of deduction.* If—


(i) The taxpayer contests an asserted liability,


(ii) The taxpayer transfers money or other property to provide for the satisfaction of the asserted liability,


(iii) The contest with respect to the asserted liability exists after the time of the transfer, and


(iv) But for the fact that the asserted liability is contested, a deduction would be allowed for the taxable year of the transfer (or, in the case of an accrual method taxpayer, for an earlier taxable year for which such amount would be accruable),


(2) *Exception.* Subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not apply in respect of the deduction for income, war profits, and excess profits taxes imposed by the authority of any foreign country or possession of the United States, including a tax paid in lieu of a tax on income, war profits, or excess profits otherwise generally imposed by any foreign country or by any possession of the United States.


(3) *Refunds includible in gross income.* If any portion of the contested amount which is deducted under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph for the taxable year of transfer is refunded when the contest is settled, such portion is includible in gross income except as provided in § 1.111-1, relating to recovery of certain items previously deducted or credited. Such refunded amount is includible in gross income for the taxable year of receipt, or for an earlier taxable year if properly accruable for such earlier year.


(4) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph are illustrated by the following examples:


(b) *Production costs*—(1) *In general; asserted liability.* For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the term “asserted liability” means an item with respect to which, but for the existence of any contest in respect of such item, a deduction would be allowable under an accrual method of accounting. For example, a notice of a local real estate tax assessment and a bill received for services may represent asserted liabilities.


(2) *Definition of the term “contest”.* Any contest which would prevent accrual of a liability under section 461(a) shall be considered to be a contest in determining whether the taxpayer satisfies paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. A contest arises when there is a bona fide dispute as to the proper evaluation of the law or the facts necessary to determine the existence or correctness of the amount of an asserted liability. It is not necessary to institute suit in a court of law in order to contest an asserted liability. An affirmative act denying the validity or accuracy, or both, of an asserted liability to the person who is asserting such liability, such as including a written protest with payment of the asserted liability, is sufficient to commence a contest. Thus, lodging a protest in accordance with local law is sufficient to contest an asserted liability for taxes. It is not necessary that the affirmative act denying the validity or accuracy, or both, of an asserted liability be in writing if, upon examination of all the facts and circumstances, it can be established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that a liability has been asserted and contested.


(3) *Example.* The provisions of this paragraph are illustrated by the following example:


(c) *Transfer to provide for the satisfaction of an asserted liability*—(1) *In general.* (i) A taxpayer may provide for the satisfaction of an asserted liability by transferring money or other property beyond his control to—


(A) The person who is asserting the liability;


(B) An escrowee or trustee pursuant to a written agreement (among the escrowee or trustee, the taxpayer, and the person who is asserting the liability) that the money or other property be delivered in accordance with the settlement of the contest;


(C) An escrowee or trustee pursuant to an order of the United States or of any State or political subdivision thereof or any agency or instrumentality of the foregoing, or of a court, that the money or other property be delivered in accordance with the settlement of the contest; or


(D) A court with jurisdiction over the contest.


(ii) In order for money or other property to be beyond the control of a taxpayer, the taxpayer must relinquish all authority over the money or other property.


(iii) The following are not transfers to provide for the satisfaction of an asserted liability—


(A) Purchasing a bond to guarantee payment of the asserted liability;


(B) An entry on the taxpayer's books of account;


(C) A transfer to an account that is within the control of the taxpayer;


(D) A transfer of any indebtedness of the taxpayer or of any promise by the taxpayer to provide services or property in the future; and


(E) A transfer to a person (other than the person asserting the liability) of any stock of the taxpayer or of any stock or indebtedness of a person related to the taxpayer (as defined in section 267(b)).


(2) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph are illustrated by the following examples:


(d) *Contest exists after transfer.* In order for a contest with respect to an asserted liability to exist after the time of transfer, such contest must be pursued subsequent to such time. Thus, the contest must have been neither settled nor abandoned at the time of the transfer. A contest may be settled by a decision, judgment, decree, or other order of any court of competent jurisdiction which has become final, or by written or oral agreement between the parties. For example, Z Corporation, which uses an accrual method of accounting, in 1964 contests a $100 asserted liability. In 1967 the contested liability is settled as being $80 which Z accrues and deducts for such year. In 1968 Z pays the $80. Section 461(f) does not apply to Z with respect to the transfer because a contest did not exist after the time of such transfer.


(e) *Deduction otherwise allowed*—(1) *In general.* The existence of the contest with respect to an asserted liability must prevent (without regard to section 461(f)) and be the only factor preventing a deduction for the taxable year of the transfer (or, in the case of an accrual method taxpayer, for an earlier taxable year for which such amount would be accruable) to provide for the satisfaction of such liability. Nothing in section 461(f) or this section shall be construed to give rise to a deduction since section 461(f) and this section relate only to the timing of deductions which are otherwise allowable under the Code.


(2) *Application of economic performance rules to transfers under section 461(f).* (i) A taxpayer using an accrual method of accounting is not allowed a deduction under section 461(f) in the taxable year of the transfer unless economic performance has occurred.


(ii) Economic performance occurs for liabilities requiring payment to another person arising out of any workers compensation act or any tort, or any other liability designated in § 1.461-4(g), as payments are made to the person to which the liability is owed. Except as provided in section 468B or the regulations thereunder, economic performance does not occur when a taxpayer transfers money or other property to a trust, an escrow account, or a court to provide for the satisfaction of an asserted workers compensation, tort, or other liability designated under § 1.461-4(g) that the taxpayer is contesting unless the trust, escrow account, or court is the person to which the liability is owed or the taxpayer's payment to the trust, escrow account, or court discharges the taxpayer's liability to the claimant. Rather, economic performance occurs in the taxable year the taxpayer transfers money or other property to the person that is asserting the workers compensation, tort, or other liability designated under § 1.461-4(g) that the taxpayer is contesting or in the taxable year that payment is made from a trust, an escrow account, or a court registry funded by the taxpayer to the person to which the liability is owed.


(3) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph are illustrated by the following examples:


(f) *Treatment of money or property transferred to an escrowee, trustee, or court and treatment of any income attributable thereto.* [Reserved]


(g) *Effective dates.* (1) Except as otherwise provided, this section applies to transfers of money or other property in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954.


(2) Paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(E) of this section applies to transfers of any stock of the taxpayer or any stock or indebtedness of a person related to the taxpayer on or after November 19, 2003.


(3) Paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section applies to transfers of money or other property after July 18, 1984.


(4) Paragraph (e)(2)(ii) and paragraph (e)(3) *Example 2* of this section apply to—


(i) Transfers after July 18, 1984, of money or other property to provide for the satisfaction of an asserted workers compensation or tort liability; and


(ii) Transfers in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1991, of money or other property to provide for the satisfaction of asserted liabilities designated in § 1.461-4(g) (other than liabilities for workers compensation or tort).
