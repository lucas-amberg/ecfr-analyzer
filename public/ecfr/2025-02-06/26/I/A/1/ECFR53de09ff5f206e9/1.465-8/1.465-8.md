# § 1.465-8   General rules; interest other than that of a creditor.

(a) *In general*—(1) *Amounts borrowed.* This section applies to amounts borrowed for use in an activity described in section 465(c)(1) or (c)(3)(A). Amounts borrowed with respect to an activity will not increase the borrower's amount at risk in the activity if the lender has an interest in the activity other than that of a creditor or is related to a person (other than the borrower) who has an interest in the activity other than that of a creditor. This rule applies even if the borrower is personally liable for the repayment of the loan or the loan is secured by property not used in the activity. For additional rules relating to the treatment of amounts borrowed from these persons, *see* § 1.465-20.


(2) *Certain borrowed amounts excepted.* (i) For purposes of determining a corporation's amount at risk, an interest in the corporation as a shareholder is not an interest in any activity of the corporation. Thus, amounts borrowed by a corporation from a shareholder may increase the corporation's amount at risk.


(ii) For purposes of determining a taxpayer's amount at risk in an activity of holding real property, paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to financing that is secured by real property used in the activity and is either—


(A) Qualified nonrecourse financing described in section 465(b)(6)(B); or 


(B) Financing that, if it were nonrecourse, would be financing described in section 465(b)(6)(B).


(b) *Loans for which the borrower is personally liable for repayment*—(1) *General rule.* If a borrower is personally liable for the repayment of a loan for use in an activity, a person shall be considered a person with an interest in the activity other than that of a creditor only if the person has either a capital interest in the activity or an interest in the net profits of the activity.


(2) *Capital interest.* For the purposes of this section a capital interest in an activity means an interest in the assets of the activity which is distributable to the owner of the capital interest upon the liquidation of the activity. The partners of a partnership and the shareholders of an S corporation are considered to have capital interests in the activities conducted by the partnership or S corporation.


(3) *Interest in net profits.* For the purposes of this section it is not necessary for a person to have any incidents of ownership in the activity in order to have an interest in the net profits of the activity. For example, an employee or independent contractor any part of whose compensation is determined with reference to the net profits of the activity will be considered to have an interest in the net profits of the activity.


(4) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(c) *Nonrecourse loans secured by assets with a readily ascertainable fair market value*—(1) *General rule.* This paragraph shall apply in the case of a nonrecourse loan for use in an activity where the loan is secured by property which has a readily ascertainable fair market value. In the case of such a loan a person shall be considered a person with an interest in the activity other than that of a creditor only if the person has either a capital interest in the activity or an interest in the net profits of the activity.


(2) *Example.* The provisions of this paragraph (c) may be illustrated by the following example:


(d) *Nonrecourse loans secured by assets without a readily ascertainable fair market value*—(1) *General rule.* This paragraph shall apply in the case of a nonrecourse loan for use in an activity where the loan is secured by property which does not have a readily ascertainable fair market value. In the case of such a loan a person shall be considered a person with an interest in the activity other than that of a creditor if the person stands to receive financial gain (other than interest) from the activity or from the sale of interests in the activity. For the purposes of this section persons who stand to receive financial gain from the activity include persons who receive compensation for services rendered in connection with the organization or operation of the activity or for the sale of interests in the activity. Such a person will generally include the promoter of the activity who organizes the activity or solicits potential investors in the activity.


(2) *Example.* The provisions of this paragraph (d) may be illustrated by the following example:


(e) *Effective date.* This section applies to amounts borrowed after May 3, 2004.
