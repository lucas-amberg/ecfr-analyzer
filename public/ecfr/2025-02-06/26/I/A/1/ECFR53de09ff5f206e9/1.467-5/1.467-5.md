# § 1.467-5   Section 467 rental agreements with variable interest.

(a) *Variable interest on deferred or prepaid rent*—(1) *In general.* This section provides rules for computing section 467 rent and interest in the case of section 467 rental agreements providing variable interest. For purposes of this section, a rental agreement provides for variable interest if the rental agreement provides for stated interest that is paid or compounded at least annually at a rate or rates that meet the requirements of § 1.1275-5(a)(3)(i)(A) or (B) and (a)(4). If a section 467 rental agreement provides for interest that is neither variable interest nor fixed interest, the agreement provides for contingent payments.


(2) *Exceptions.* This section is not applicable to section 467 rental agreements that provide adequate interest under § 1.467-2(b)(1)(i) (agreements with no deferred or prepaid rent) or (b)(1)(ii) (rental agreements with stated interest at a single fixed rate). The exceptions in this paragraph (a)(2) do not apply to rental agreements subject to constant rental accrual under § 1.467-3.


(b) *Variable rate treated as fixed*—(1) *In general.* If a section 467 rental agreement provides variable interest—


(i) The fixed rate substitutes (determined in the same manner as under § 1.1275-5(e), treating the agreement date as the issue date) for the variable rates of interest on deferred or prepaid fixed rent provided by the rental agreement must be used in computing the proportional rental amount under § 1.467-2(c), the constant rental amount under § 1.467-3(d), the principal balance of a section 467 loan under § 1.467-4(b), and the yield of a section 467 loan under § 1.467-4(c); and


(ii) The interest on fixed rent for any rental period is equal to the amount that would be determined under § 1.467-1(e)(2) if the section 467 rental agreement did not provide variable interest, using the fixed rate substitutes determined under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section in place of the variable rates called for by the rental agreement, plus the variable interest adjustment amount provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.


(2) *Variable interest adjustment amount*—(i) *In general.* The variable interest adjustment amount for a rental period equals the difference between—


(A) The amount of interest that, without regard to section 467, would have accrued during the rental period under the terms of the section 467 rental agreement; and


(B) The amount of interest that, without regard to section 467, would have accrued during the rental period under the terms of the section 467 rental agreement using the fixed rate substitutes determined under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section in place of the variable interest rates called for by the rental agreement.


(ii) *Positive or negative adjustment.* If the amount determined under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section is greater than the amount determined under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the variable interest adjustment amount is positive. If the amount determined under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section is less than the amount determined under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the variable interest adjustment amount is negative.


(3) *Section 467 loan balance.* The variable interest adjustment amount is not taken into account in determining the principal balance of a section 467 loan under § 1.467-4(b). Instead, the section 467 loan balance is computed as if all amounts payable under the section 467 rental agreement were based on the fixed rate substitutes determined under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.


(c) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this section:
