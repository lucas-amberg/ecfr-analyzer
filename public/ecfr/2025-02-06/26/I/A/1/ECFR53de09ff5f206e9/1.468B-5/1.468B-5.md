# § 1.468B-5   Effective dates and transition rules applicable to qualified settlement funds.

(a) *In general.* Section 468B, including section 468B(g), is effective as provided in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988. Except as otherwise provided in this section, §§ 1.468B-1 through 1.468-4 are effective on January 1, 1993. Thus, the regulations apply to income of a qualified settlement fund earned after December 31, 1992, transfers to a fund after December 31, 1992, and distributions from a fund after December 31, 1992. For purposes of § 1.468B-3(c) (relating to economic performance), previously transferred assets held by a qualified settlement fund on the date these regulations first apply to the fund (i.e., January 1, 1993, or the earlier date provided under paragraph (b)(2) of this section) are treated as transferred to the fund on that date, to the extent no taxpayer has previously claimed a deduction for the transfer.


(b) *Taxation of certain pre-1996 fund income*—(1) *Reasonable method*—(i) *In general.* With respect to a fund, account, or trust established after August 16, 1986, but prior to February 15, 1992, that satisfies (or, if it no longer exists, would have satisfied) the requirements of § 1.468B-1(c), the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge a reasonable, consistently applied method of taxation for transfers to the fund, income earned by the fund, and distributions made by the fund after August 16, 1986, but prior to January 1, 1996. A method is generally considered reasonable if, depending on the facts and circumstances, all transferors and the administrator of the fund have consistently treated transfers to the fund, income earned by the fund, and distributions made by the fund after August 16, 1986, as if the fund were—


(A) A grantor trust and the transferors are the grantors;


(B) A complex trust and the transferors are the grantors; or


(C) A designated settlement fund.


(ii) *Qualified settlement funds established after February 14, 1992, but before January 1, 1993.* With respect to a fund, account, or trust established after February 14, 1992, but prior to January 1, 1993, that satisfies the requirements of § 1.468B-1(c), the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge a reasonable, consistently applied method of taxation as described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section for transfers to, income earned by, and distributions made by the fund prior to January 1, 1993. However, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, sections 1.468B-1 through 1.468B-4 apply to transfers to, income earned by, and distributions made by the qualified settlement fund after 1992.


(iii) *Use of cash method of accounting.* For purposes of paragraphs (b)(i) and (b)(ii) of this section, for taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1996, the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge the use of the cash receipts and disbursement method of accounting by a fund, account, or trust.


(iv) *Unreasonable position.* In no event is it a reasonable position to assert, pursuant to Rev. Rul. 71-119 (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(*b*) of this chapter), that there is no current taxation of the income of a fund established after August 16, 1986.


(v) *Waiver of penalties.* For taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1993, if a fund, account or trust is subject to section 468B(g) and the Internal Revenue Service does not challenge the method of taxation for transfers to, income earned by, and distributions made by, the fund pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section, penalties will not be imposed in connection with the use of such method. For example, the penalties under section 6655 for failure to pay estimated tax, section 6651(a)(1) for failure to file a return, section 6651(a)(2) for failure to pay tax, section 6656 for failure to make deposit of taxes, and section 6662 for accuracy-related underpayments will generally not be imposed.


(2) *Election to apply qualified settlement fund rules*—(i) *In general.* The person that will be the administrator of a qualified settlement fund may elect to apply §§ 1.468B-1 through 1.468B-4 to transfers to, income earned by, and distributions made by, the fund in taxable years ending after August 16, 1986. The election is effective beginning on the first day of the earliest open taxable year of the qualified settlement fund. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), a taxable year is considered open if the period for assessment and collection of tax has not expired pursuant to the rules of section 6501. The election statement must provide the information described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section and must be signed by the person that will be the administrator. Such person must also provide each transferor of the qualified settlement fund with a copy of the election statement on or before March 15, 1993.


(ii) *Election statement.* The election statement must provide the following information—


(A) A legend, “§ 1.468B-5(b)(2) Election”, at the top of the first page;


(B) Each transferor's name, address, and taxpayer identification number;


(C) The qualified settlement fund's name, address, and employer identification number; and


(D) The date the qualified settlement fund was established within the meaning of § 1.468B-1(j).


(iii) *Due date of returns and amended returns.* The election statement described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section must be filed with, and as part of, the qualified settlement fund's timely filed tax return for the taxable year ended December 31, 1992. In addition, the qualified settlement fund must file an amended return that is consistent with the requirements of §§ 1.468B-1 through 1.468B-4 for any taxable year to which the election applies in which the fund took a position inconsistent with those requirements. Any such amended return must be filed no later than March 15, 1993, and must include a copy of the election statement described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.


(iv) *Computation of interest and waiver of penalties.* For purposes of section 6601 and section 6611, the income tax return for each taxable year of the qualified settlement fund to which the election applies is due on March 15 of the year following the taxable year of the fund. For taxable years of a qualified settlement fund ending prior to January 1, 1993, the income earned by the fund is deemed to have been earned on December 31 of each taxable year for purposes of section 6655. Thus, the addition to tax for failure to pay estimated tax under section 6655 will not be imposed. The penalty for failure to file a return under section 6651(a)(1), the penalty for failure to pay tax under section 6651(a)(2), the penalty for failure to make deposit of taxes under section 6656, and the accuracy-related penalty under section 6662 will not be imposed on a qualified settlement fund if the fund files its tax returns for taxable years ending prior to January 1, 1993, and pays any tax due for those taxable years, on or before March 15, 1993.


(c) *Grantor trust elections under § 1.468B-1(k)*—(1) *In general.* A transferor may make a grantor trust election under § 1.468B-1(k) if the qualified settlement fund is established after February 3, 2006.


(2) *Transition rules.* A transferor may make a grantor trust election under § 1.468B-1(k) for a qualified settlement fund that was established on or before February 3, 2006, if the applicable period of limitation on filing an amended return has not expired for both the qualified settlement fund's first taxable year and all subsequent taxable years and the transferor's corresponding taxable year or years. A grantor trust election under this paragraph (c)(2) requires that the returns of the qualified settlement fund and the transferor for all affected taxable years are consistent with the grantor trust election. This requirement may be satisfied by timely filed original returns or amended returns filed before the applicable period of limitation expires.


(3) *Qualified settlement funds established by the U.S. government on or before* February 3, 2006. If the U.S. government, or any agency or instrumentality thereof, established a qualified settlement fund on or before February 3, 2006, and the fund would have been classified as a trust all of which is treated as owned by the U.S. government under section 671 and the regulations thereunder without regard to the regulations under section 468B, then the U.S. government is deemed to have made a grantor trust election under § 1.468B-1(k), and the election is applicable for all taxable years of the fund.
