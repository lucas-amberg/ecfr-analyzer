(d)(3)-(e)(1) [Reserved]


(e)(2) *Trade or business activities. Trade or business activities* are activities that constitute trade or business activities within the meaning of § 1.469-4(b)(1).


(e)(3)(i)-(e)(3)(ii) [Reserved]


(e)(3)(iii) *Average period of customer use*—(A) *In general.* For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), the average period of customer use for property held in connection with an activity (the *activity's average period of customer use*) is the sum of the average use factors for each class of property held in connection with the activity.


(B) *Average use factor.* The average use factor for a class of property held in connection with an activity is the average period of customer use for that class of property multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing—


(*1*) The activity's gross rental income attributable to that class of property; by


(*2*) The activity's gross rental income.


(C) *Average period of customer use for class of property.* In determining an activity's average period of customer use for a taxable year, the average period of customer use for a class of property held in connection with an activity is determined by dividing—


(*1*) The aggregate number of days in all periods of customer use for property in the class (taking into account only periods that end during the taxable year or that include the last day of the taxable year); by


(*2*) The number of those periods of customer use.


(D) *Period of customer use.* Each period during which a customer has a continuous or recurring right to use an item of property held in connection with the activity (without regard to whether the customer uses the property for the entire period or whether the right to use the property is pursuant to a single agreement or to renewals thereof) is treated for purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(iii) as a separate period of customer use. The duration of a period of customer use that includes the last day of a taxable year may be determined on the basis of reasonable estimates.


(E) *Class of property.* Taxpayers may organize property into classes for purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(iii) using any method under which items of property for which the amount of the daily rent differs significantly are not included in the same class.


(F) *Gross rental income and daily rent.* In determining an activity's average period of customer use for a taxable year—


(*1*) The activity's gross rental income is the gross income from the activity for the taxable year taking into account only income that is attributable to amounts paid for the use of property;


(*2*) The activity's gross rental income attributable to a class of property is the gross income from the activity for the taxable year taking into account only income that is attributable to amounts paid for the use of property in that class; and


(*3*) The daily rent for items of property may be determined on any basis that reasonably reflects differences during the taxable year in the amounts ordinarily paid for one day's use of those items of property.


(e)(3)(iv)-(e)(3)(vi)(C) [Reserved]


(e)(3)(vi)(D) *Lodging rented for convenience of employer.* The provision of lodging to an employee or to an employee's spouse or dependents is treated as incidental to the activity (or activities) of the taxpayer in which the employee performs services if the lodging is furnished for the taxpayer's convenience (within the meaning of section 119).


(E) *Unadjusted basis.* For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(vi), the term *unadjusted basis* means adjusted basis determined without regard to any adjustment described in section 1016 that decreases basis.

(f)(4) *Carryover of disallowed deductions and credits*—(i) *In general.* In the case of an activity of a taxpayer with respect to which any deductions or credits are disallowed for a taxable year under § 1.469-1T (f)(2) or (f)(3) (the loss activity)—


(A) The disallowed deductions or credits is allocated among the taxpayer's activities for the succeeding taxable year in a manner that reasonably reflects the extent to which each activity continues the loss activity; and


(B) The disallowed deductions or credits allocated to an activity under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section shall be treated as deductions or credits from the activity for the succeeding taxable year.


(ii) *Business continued through C corporations or similar entities.* If a taxpayer continues part or all of a loss activity through a C corporation or similar entity (C corporation entity), the taxpayer's interest in the C corporation entity shall be treated for purposes of this paragraph (f)(4) as an interest in a passive activity that continues that loss activity in whole or part. An entity is similar to a C corporation for this purpose if the owners of interests in the entity derive only portfolio income (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i)) from the interests.


(iii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (f)(4). In each example, the taxpayer is an individual whose taxable year is the calendar year.


(g)(1)-(g)(4)(ii)(B) [Reserved]


(g)(4)(ii)(C) Portfolio income (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i)), including any gross income that is treated as portfolio income under any other provision of the regulations (See, e.g., § 1.469-2(c)(2)(iii)(F) (relating to gain from the disposition of substantially appreciated property formerly held for investment) and § 1.469-2(f)(10) (relating to certain recharacterized passive activity gross income))

(h)(1) *In general.* This paragraph (h) provides rules for applying section 469 in computing a consolidated group's consolidated taxable income and consolidated tax liability (and the separate taxable income and tax liability of each member).


(2) *Definitions.* The definitions and nomenclature in the regulations under section 1502 apply for purposes of this paragraph (h). See, e.g., §§ 1.1502-1 (definitions of group, consolidated group, member, subsidiary, and consolidated return year), 1.1502-2 (consolidated tax liability), 1.1502-11 (consolidated taxable income), 1.1502-12 (separate taxable income), 1.1502-13 (intercompany transactions), 1.1502-21 (net operating losses, and 1.1502-22 (consolidated net capital gain and loss).


(3) [Reserved]


(4) *Status and participation of members*—(i) *Determination by reference to status and participation of group.* For purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder—


(A) Each member of a consolidated group shall be treated as a closely held corporation or personal service corporation, respectively, for the taxable year, if and only if the consolidated group is treated (under the rules of paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section) as a closely held corporation or personal service corporation for that year; and


(B) The determination of whether a trade or business activity (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section) conducted by one or more members of a consolidated group is a passive activity of the members is made by reference to the consolidated group's participation in the activity.


(ii) *Determination of status and participation of consolidated group.* For purposes of determining under § 1.469-1T(g)(2) whether a consolidated group is treated as a closely held corporation or a personal service corporation, and determining under § 1.469-1T(g)(3) whether the consolidated group materially or significantly participates in any activity conducted by one or more members of the group—


(A) The members of the consolidated group shall be treated as one corporation;


(B) Only the outstanding stock of the common parent shall be treated as outstanding stock of the corporation;


(C) An employee of any member of the group shall be treated as an employee of the corporation; and

(5) [Reserved]


(6) *Intercompany transactions*—(i) *In general.* Section 1.1502-13 applies to determine the treatment under section 469 of intercompany items and corresponding items from intercompany transactions between members of a consolidated group. For example, the matching rule of § 1.1502-13(c) treats the selling member (S) and the buying member (B) as divisions of a single corporation for purposes of determining whether S's intercompany items and B's corresponding items are from a passive activity. Thus, for purposes of applying § 1.469-2(c)(2)(iii) and § 1.469-2T(d)(5)(ii) to property sold by S to B in an intercompany transaction—


(A) S and B are treated as divisions of a single corporation for determining the uses of the property during the 12-month period preceding its disposition to a nonmember, and generally have an aggregate holding period for the property; and


(B) § 1.469-2(c)(2)(iv) does not apply.


(ii) *Example.* The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (h)(6).


(iii) *Effective dates.* This paragraph (h)(6) applies with respect to transactions occurring in years beginning on or after July 12, 1995. For transactions occurring in years beginning before July 12, 1995, see § 1.469-1T(h)(6) (as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1995).
