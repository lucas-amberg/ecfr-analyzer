The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (d)(3):


(e) *Definition of “passive activity”*—(1) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e), an activity is a passive activity of the taxpayer for a taxable year if and only if the activity—


(i) Is a trade or business activity (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section) in which the taxpayer does not materially participate for such taxable year; or


(ii) Is a rental activity (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3) of this section), without regard to whether or to what extent the taxpayer participates in such activity.


(2) *Trade or business activity.* [Reserved]. See § 1.469-1(e)(2) for rules relating to this paragraph.


(3) *Rental activity*—(i) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e)(3), an activity is a rental activity for a taxable year if—


(A) During such taxable year, tangible property held in connection with the activity is used by customers or held for use by customers; and


(B) The gross income attributable to the conduct of the activity during such taxable year represents (or, in the case of an activity in which property is held for use by customers, the expected gross income from the conduct of the activity will represent) amounts paid or to be paid principally for the use of such tangible property (without regard to whether the use of the property by customers is pursuant to a lease or pursuant to a service contract or other arrangement that is not denominated a lease).


(ii) *Exceptions.* For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), an activity involving the use of tangible property is not a rental activity for a taxable year if for such taxable year—


(A) The average period of customer use for such property is seven days or less;


(B) The average period of customer use for such property is 30 days or less, and significant personal services (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section) are provided by or on behalf of the owner of the property in connection with making the property available for use by customers;


(C) Extraordinary personal services (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section) are provided by or on behalf of the owner of the property in connection with making such property available for use by customers (without regard to the average period of customer use);


(D) The rental of such property is treated as incidental to a nonrental activity of the taxpayer under paragraph (e)(3)(vi) of this section;


(E) The taxpayer customarily makes the property available during defined business hours for nonexclusive use by various customers; or


(F) The provision of the property for use in an activity conducted by a partnership, S corporation, or joint venture in which the taxpayer owns an interest is not a rental activity under paragraph (e)(3)(vii) of this section.


(iii) *Average period of customer use.* [Reserved]. See § 1.469-1(e)(3)(iii) for rules relating to this paragraph.


(iv) *Significant personal services*—(A) *In general.* For purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, personal services include only services performed by individuals, and do not include excluded services (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B) of this section). In determining whether personal services provided in connection with making property available for use by customers are significant, all of the relevant facts and circumstances shall be taken into account. Relevant facts and circumstances include the frequency with which such services are provided, the type and amount of labor required to perform such services, and the value of such services relative to the amount charged for the use of the property.


(B) *Excluded services.* For purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, the term “excluded services” means, with respect to any property made available for use by customers—


(*1*) Services necessary to permit the lawful use of the property;


(*2*) Services performed in connection with the construction of improvements to the property, or in connection with the performance of repairs that extend the property's useful life for a period substantially longer than the average period for which such property is used by customers; and


(*3*) Services, provided in connection with the use of any improved real property, that are similar to those commonly provided in connection with long-term rentals of high-grade commercial or residential real property (e.g., cleaning and maintenance of common areas, routine repairs, trash collection, elevator service, and security at entrances or perimeters).


(v) *Extraordinary personal services.* For purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, extraordinary personal services are provided in connection with making property available for use by customers only if the services provided in connection with the use of the property are performed by individuals, and the use by customers of the property is incidental to their receipt of such services. For example, the use by patients of a hospital's boarding facilities generally is incidental to their receipt of the personal services provided by the hospital's medical and nursing staff. Similarly, the use by students of a boarding school's dormitories generally is incidental to their receipt of the personal services provided by the school's teaching staff.


(vi) *Rental of property incidental to a nonrental activity of the taxpayer*—(A) *In general.* For purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(D) of this section, the rental of property shall be treated as incidental to a nonrental activity of the taxpayer only to the extent provided in this paragraph (e)(3)(vi).


(B) *Property held for investment.* The rental of property during a taxable year shall be treated as incidental to an activity of holding such property for investment if and only if—


(*1*) The principal purpose for holding the property during such taxable year is to realize gain from the appreciation of the property (without regard to whether it is expected that such gain will be realized from the sale or exchange of the property in its current state of development); and


(*2*) The gross rental income from the property for such taxable year is less than two percent of the lesser of—


(*i*) The unadjusted basis of such property; and


(*ii*) The fair market value of such property.


(C) *Property used in a trade or business.* The rental of property during a taxable year shall be treated as incidental to a trade or business activity (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section) if and only if—


(*1*) The taxpayer owns an interest in such trade or business activity during the taxable year;


(*2*) The property was predominantly used in such trade or business activity during the taxable year or during at least two of the five taxable years that immediately precede the taxable year; and


(*3*) The gross rental income from such property for the taxable year is less than two percent of the lesser of—


(*i*) The unadjusted basis of such property; and


(*ii*) The fair market value of such property.


(D) *Lodging for convenience of employer.* [Reserved]. See § 1.469-1(e)(3)(vi)(D) for rules relating to this paragraph.


(E) *Unadjusted basis.* [Reserved]. See § 1.469-1(e)(3)(vi)(E) for rules relating to this paragraph.


(vii) *Property made available for use in a nonrental activity conducted by a partnership, S corporation, or joint venture in which the taxpayer owns an interest.* If the taxpayer owns an interest in a partnership, S corporation, or joint venture conducting an activity other than a rental activity, and the taxpayer provides property for use in the activity in the taxpayer's capacity as an owner of an interest in such partnership, S corporation, or joint venture, the provision of such property is not a rental activity. Thus, if a partner contributes the use of property to a partnership, none of the partner's distributive share of partnership income is income from a rental activity unless the partnership is engaged in a rental activity. In addition, a partner's gross income attributable to a payment described in section 707(c) is not income from a rental activity under any circumstances (see § 1.469-2T (e)(2)). The determination of whether property used in an activity is provided by the taxpayer in the taxpayer's capacity as an owner of an interest in a partnership, S corporation, or joint venture shall be made on the basis of all of the facts and circumstances.


(viii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e)(3):


(4) *Special rule for oil and gas working interests*—(i) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, an interest in an oil or gas well drilled or operated pursuant to a working interest (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section) of a taxpayer is not an interest in a passive activity for the taxpayer's taxable year (without regard to whether the taxpayer materially participates in such activity) if at any time during such taxable year the taxpayer holds such working interest either—


(A) Directly; or


(B) Through an entity that does not limit the liability of the taxpayer with respect to the drilling or operation of such well pursuant to such working interest.


(ii) *Exception for deductions attributable to a period during which liability is limited*—(A) *In general.* If paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section applies for a taxable year to the taxpayer's interest in an oil or gas well that would, but for the application of paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, by an interest in a passive activity for the taxable year, and the taxpayer has a net loss (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(C)(*3*) of this section) from the well for the taxable year—


(*1*) The taxpayer's disqualified deductions (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(C)(*2*) of this section) from such oil or gas well for such year shall be treated as passive activity deductions for such year (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(d)); and


(*2*) A ratable portion (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(C)(*4*) of this section) of the taxpayer's gross income from such oil or gas well for such year shall be treated as passive activity gross income for such year (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(c)).


(B) *Coordination with rules governing the identification of disallowed passive activity deductions.* If gross income and deductions from an activity for a taxable year are treated as passive activity gross income and passive activity deductions under paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, such activity shall be treated as a passive activity for such year for purposes of applying paragraph (f) (2) and (4) of this section.


(C) *Meaning of certain terms.* For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4)(ii), the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:


(*1*) *Allocable deductions.* The deductions allocable to a taxable year are any deductions that arise in such year (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T (d)(8)) and any deductions that are treated as deductions for such year under paragraph (f)(4) of this section.


(*2*) *Disqualified deductions.* The taxpayer's “disqualified deductions” from an oil or gas well for a taxable year are the taxpayer's deductions—


(*i*) That are attributable to such well and allocable to the taxable year; and


(*ii*) With respect to which economic performance (within the meaning of section 461(h), without regard to section 461 (h)(3) or (i)(2)) occurs at a time during which the taxpayer's only interest in the working interest is held through an entity that limits the taxpayer's liability with respect to the drilling or operation of such well.


(*3*) *Net loss.* The “net loss” of a taxpayer from an oil or gas well for a taxable year equals the amount by which the taxpayer's deductions that are attributable to such oil or gas well and allocable to such year exceeds the gross income of the taxpayer from such well for such year.


(*4*) *Ratable portion.* The “ratable portion” of the taxpayer's gross income from an oil or gas well for a taxable year equals the total amount of such gross income multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing—


(*i*) The disqualified deductions from such oil or gas well for the taxable year; by


(*ii*) The total amount of the deductions that are attributable to such oil or gas well and allocable to the taxable year.


(iii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of paragraphs (e)(4) (i) and (ii) of this section:


(iv) *Definition of “working interest.”* [Reserved]. See § 1.469-1(e)(4)(iv) for rules relating to this paragraph.


(v) *Entities that limit liability*—(A) *General rule.* For purposes of paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section, an entity limits the liability of the taxpayer with respect to the drilling or operation of a well pursuant to a working interest held through such entity if the taxpayer's interest in the entity is in the form of—


(*1*) A limited partnership interest in a partnership in which the taxpayer is not a general partner;


(*2*) Stock in a corporation; or


(*3*) An interest in any entity (other than a limited partnership or corporation) that, under applicable State law, limits the potential liability of a holder of such an interest for all obligations of the entity to a determinable fixed amount (for example, the sum of the taxpayer's capital contributions).


(B) *Other limitations disregarded.* For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4), protection against loss through any of the following is not taken into account in determining whether a taxpayer holds a working interest through an entity that limits the taxpayer's liability:


(*1*) An indemnification agreement;


(*2*) A stop loss arrangement;


(*3*) Insurance;


(*4*) Any similar arrangement; or


(*5*) Any combination of the foregoing.


(C) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e)(4)(v):


(vi) *Cross reference to special rule for income from certain oil or gas properties.* A special rule relating to the treatment of income from certain interests in oil or gas properties is contained in § 1.469-2T(c)(6).


(5) *Rental of dwelling unit.* [Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(d)(2)(xii) for rules relating to this paragraph.


(6) *Activity of trading personal property*—(i) *In general.* An activity of trading personal property for the account of owners of interests in the activity is not a passive activity (without regard to whether such activity is a trade or business activity (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section)).


(ii) *Personal property.* For purposes of this paragraph (e)(6), the term “personal property” means personal property (within the meaning of section 1092(d), without regard to paragraph (3) thereof).


(iii) *Example.* The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (e)(6):


(f) *Treatment of disallowed passive activity losses and credits*—(1) *Scope of this paragraph.* The rules in this paragraph (f)—


(i) Identify the passive activity deductions that are disallowed for any taxable year in which all or a portion of the taxpayer's passive activity loss is disallowed under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section;


(ii) Identify the credits from passive activities that are disallowed for any taxable year in which all or a portion of the taxpayer's passive activity credit is disallowed under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section; and


(iii) Provide for the carryover of disallowed deductions and credits.


(2) *Identification of disallowed passive activity deductions*—(i) *Allocation of disallowed passive activity loss among activities*—(A) *General rule.* If all or any portion of the taxpayer's passive activity loss is disallowed for the taxable year under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, a ratable portion of the loss (if any) from each passive activity of the taxpayer is disallowed. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the ratable portion of a loss from an activity is computed by multiplying the passive activity loss that is disallowed for the taxable year by the fraction obtained by dividing—


(*1*) The loss from the activity for the taxable year; by


(*2*) The sum of the losses for the taxable year from all activities having losses for such year.


(B) *Loss from an activity.* For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2)(i), the term “loss from an activity” means—


(*1*) The amount by which the passive activity deductions from the activity for the taxable year (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(d)) exceed the passive activity gross income from the activity for the taxable year (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(c)); reduced by


(*2*) Any part of such amount that is allowed under section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T (relating to the $25,000 allowance for certain rental real estate activities).


(C) *Significant participation passive activities.* If the taxpayer's passive activity gross income from significant participation passive activities (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(f)(2)(ii)) for the taxable year (determined without regard to § 1.469-2T(f)(2) through (4)) exceeds the taxpayer's passive activity deductions from such activities for the taxable year, such activities shall be treated, solely for purposes of applying this paragraph (f)(2)(i) for the taxable year, as a single activity that does not have a loss for such taxable year.


(D) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (f)(2)(i):


(ii) *Allocation within loss activities*—(A) *In general.* If all or any portion of a taxpayer's loss from an activity is disallowed under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section for the taxable year, a ratable portion of each passive activity deduction (other than an excluded deduction (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section)) of the taxpayer from such activity is disallowed. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the ratable portion of a passive activity deduction of a taxpayer is the amount of the disallowed portion of the taxpayer's loss from the activity (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section) for the taxable year multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing—


(*1*) The amount of such deduction; by


(*2*) The sum of all passive activity deductions (other than excluded deductions (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section)) of the taxpayer from such activity from the taxable year.


(B) *Excluded deductions.* The term “excluded deduction” means any passive activity deduction of a taxpayer that is taken into account in computing the taxpayer's net income from an item of property for a taxable year in which an amount of the taxpayer's gross income from such item of property is treated as not from a passive activity under § 1.469-2T(c)(6) or § 1.469-2T(f) (5), (6), or (7).


(iii) *Separately identified deductions.* In identifying the deductions from an activity that are disallowed under this paragraph (f)(2), the taxpayer need not account separately for a deduction unless such deduction may, if separately taken into account, result in an income tax liability for any taxable year different from that which would result were such deduction not taken into account separately. For related rules applicable to partnerships and S corporations, see § 1.702-1(a)(8)(ii) and section 1366(a)(1)(A), respectively. Deductions that must be accounted for separately include (but are not limited to) deductions that—


(A) Arise in a rental real estate activity (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) in taxable years in which the taxpayer actively participates (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) in such activity;


(B) Arise in a rental real estate activity (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) in taxable years in which the taxpayer does not actively participate (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) in such activity; or


(C) Are taken into account under section 1211 (relating to the limitation on capital losses) or section 1231 (relating to property used in a trade or business and involuntary conversions).


(3) *Identification of disallowed credits from passive activities*—(i) *General rule.* If all or any portion of the taxpayer's passive activity credit is disallowed for the taxable year under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, a ratable portion of each credit from each passive activity of the taxpayer is disallowed. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the ratable portion of a credit of a taxpayer is computed by multiplying the portion of the taxpayer's passive activity credit that is disallowed for the taxable year by the fraction obtained by dividing—


(A) The amount of the credit; by


(B) The sum of all of the taxpayer's credits from passive activities for the taxable year.


(ii) *Coordination rule.* For purposes of paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, the credits from a passive activity do not include any credit or portion of a credit that—


(A) Is allowed for the taxable year under section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T (relating to the $25,000 allowance for certain rental real estate activities); or


(B) Increases the basis of property during the taxable year under section 469(j)(9) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-6T (relating to the election to increase the basis of certain property by disallowed credits).


(iii) *Separately identified credits.* In identifying the credits from an activity that are disallowed under this paragraph (f)(3), the taxpayer need not account separately for any credit unless such credit may, if separately taken into account, result in an income tax liability for any taxable year different from that which would result were such credit not taken into account separately. For related rules applicable to partnerships and S corporations, see § 1.702-1(a)(8)(ii) and section 1366(a)(1)(A), respectively. Credits that must be accounted for separately include (but are not limited to)—


(A) Credits (other than the low-income housing and rehabilitation investment credits) from a rental real estate activity (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) that arise in a taxable year in which the taxpayer actively participates (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) in such activity;


(B) Credits (other than the low-income housing and rehabilitation investment credits) from a rental real estate activity (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) that arise in a taxable year in which the taxpayer does not actively participate (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) in such activity;


(C) Low-income housing and rehabilitation investment credits from a rental real estate activity (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T); and


(D) Any credit that is subject to the limitations of sections 26(a), 28(d)(2), 29(b)(5), or 38(c) in a manner that differs from the manner in which any other credit is subject to such limitations.


(4) *Carryover of disallowed deductions and credits.* [Reserved]. See § 1.469-1(f)(4) for rules relating to this paragraph.


(g) *Application of these rules to C corporations*—(1) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in the rules to be contained in paragraph (k) of this section, section 469 and the regulations thereunder do not apply to any corporation that is not a personal service corporation or a closely held corporation for the taxable year. See paragraphs (g) (4) and (5) of this section for special rules for computing the passive activity loss and passive activity credit, respectively, of a closely held corporation.


(2) *Definitions.* For purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder—


(i) The term *personal service corporation* means a C corporation that is a personal service corporation for the taxable year (within the meaning of § 1.441-3(c)); and


(ii) The term *closely held corporation* means a C corporation that meets the stock ownership requirements of section 542(a)(2) (taking into account the modifications in section 465(a)(3)) for the taxable year and is not a personal service corporation for such year.


(3) *Participation of corporations*—(i) *Material participation.* For purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder, a corporation described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section shall be treated as materially participating in an activity for a taxable year if and only if—


(A) One or more individuals, each of whom is treated under paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section as materially participating in such activity for the taxable year, directly or indirectly hold (in the aggregate) more than 50 percent (by value) of the outstanding stock of such corporation; or


(B) In the case of a closely held corporation (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section), the requirements of section 465(c)(7)(C) (without regard to clause (iv) thereof and taking into account section 465(c)(7)(D)) are met with respect to such activity.


(ii) *Significant participation.* For purposes of § 1.469-2T(f)(2), an activity of a corporation described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section shall be treated as a significant participation passive activity for a taxable year if and only if—


(A) The corporation is not treated as materially participating in such activity for the taxable year; and


(B) One or more individuals, each of whom is treated under paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section as significantly participating in such activity, directly or indirectly hold (in the aggregate) more than 50 percent (by value) of the outstanding stock of such corporation.


(iii) *Participation of individual.* Whether an individual is treated for purposes of this paragraph (g)(3) as materially participating or significantly participating in an activity of a corporation shall be determined under the rules of § 1.469-5T, except that in applying such rules—


(A) All activities of the corporation shall be treated as activities in which the individual holds an interest in determining whether the individual participates (within the meaning of § 1.469-5T(f)) in an activity of the corporation; and


(B) The individual's participation in all activities other than activities of the corporation shall be disregarded in determining whether the individual's participation in an activity of the corporation is treated as material participation under § 1.469-5T(a)(4) (relating to material participation in significant participation activities).


(4) *Modified computation of passive activity loss in the case of closely held corporations*—(i) *In general.* A closely held corporation's passive activity loss for the taxable year is the amount, if any, by which the corporation's passive activity deductions for the taxable year (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(d)) exceed the sum of—


(A) The corporation's passive activity gross income for the taxable year (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(c)); and


(B) The corporation's net active income for the taxable year.


(ii) *Net active income.* For purposes of this paragraph (g)(4), a corporation's net active income for the taxable year is such corporation's taxable income for the taxable year, determined without regard to the following items for the year:


(A) Passive activity gross income;


(B) Passive activity deductions;


(C) [Reserved]. See § 1.469-1(g)(4)(ii)(C) for rules relating to this paragraph.

(A) A ratable portion (within the meaning of paragraph (h)(5)(ii) of this section) of the passive activity loss of the consolidated group that is disallowed for the taxable year shall be allocated to each member of the group;


(B) Pararaph (f)(2) of this section shall then be applied to each member of the group as if—

(C) Paragraph (f)(4) of this section shall be applied to each member of the group as if it were a separate taxpayer.


(ii) *Ratable portion of disallowed passive activity loss.* For purposes of paragraph (h)(5)(i)(A) of this section, a member's ratable portion of the disallowed passive activity loss of the consolidated group is the amount of such disallowed loss multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing—

(B) The sum of the amounts described in paragraph (h)(5)(ii)(A) of this section for all members of the group.


(iii) *Identification of disallowed credits.* In applying paragraph (f)(3) of this section to a consolidated group for purposes of identifying the credits from passive activities of members of such consolidated group that are disallowed for the taxable year, the consolidated group shall be treated as one taxpayer.
