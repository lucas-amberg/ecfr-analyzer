# § 1.469-2   Passive activity loss.

(a)-(c)(2)(ii) [Reserved]


(c)(2)(iii) *Disposition of substantially appreciated property formerly used in nonpassive activity*—(A) *In general.* If an interest in property used in an activity is substantially appreciated at the time of its disposition, any gain from the disposition shall be treated as not from a passive activity unless the interest in property was used in a passive activity for either—


(*1*) 20 percent of the period during which the taxpayer held the interest in property; or


(*2*) The entire 24-month period ending on the date of the disposition.


(B) *Date of disposition.* For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii), a disposition of an interest in property is deemed to occur on the date that the interest in property becomes subject to an oral or written agreement that either requires the owner or gives the owner an option to transfer the interest in property for consideration that is fixed or otherwise determinable on that date.


(C) *Substantially appreciated property.* For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii), an interest in property is substantially appreciated if the fair market value of the interest in property exceeds 120 percent of the adjusted basis of the interest.


(D) *Investment property.* For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii), an interest in property is treated as an interest in property used in an activity other than a passive activity and as an interest in property held for investment for any period during which the interest is held through a C corporation or similar entity. An entity is similar to a C corporation for this purpose if the owners of interests in the entity derive only portfolio income (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T) from the interests.


(E) *Coordination with § 1.469-2T(c)(2)(ii).* If § 1.469-2T(c)(2)(ii) applies to the disposition of an interest in property, this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) applies only to that portion of the gain from the disposition of the interest in property that is characterized as gain from a passive activity after the application of § 1.469-2T(c)(2)(ii).


(F) *Coordination with section 163(d).* Gain that is treated as not from a passive activity under this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) is treated as income described in section 469(e)(1)(A) and § 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i) if and only if the gain is from the disposition of an interest in property that was held for investment for more than 50 percent of the period during which the taxpayer held that interest in property in activities other than passive activities.


(G) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii):


(iv) *Taxable acquisitions.* If a taxpayer acquires an interest in property in a transaction other than a nonrecognition transaction (within the meaning of section 7701(a)(45)), the ownership and use of the interest in property before the transaction is not taken into account for purposes of applying this paragraph (c)(2) to any subsequent disposition of the interest in property by the taxpayer.


(v) *Property held for sale to customers*—(A) *Sale incidental to another activity*—(*1*) *Applicability*—(*i*) *In general.* This paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) applies to the disposition of a taxpayer's interest in property if and only if—


(*A*) At the time of the disposition, the taxpayer holds the interest in property in an activity that, for purposes of section 1221(1), involves holding the property or similar property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business (a dealing activity);


(*B*) One or more other activities of the taxpayer do not involve holding similar property for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business (nondealing activities) and the interest in property was used in the nondealing activity or activities for more than 80 percent of the period during which the taxpayer held the interest in property; and


(*C*) The interest in property was not acquired and held by the taxpayer for the principal purpose of selling the interest to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.


(*ii*) *Principal purpose.* For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A), a taxpayer is rebuttably presumed to have acquired and held an interest in property for the principal purpose of selling the interest to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business if—


(*A*) The period during which the interest in property was used in nondealing activities of the taxpayer does not exceed the lesser of 24 months or 20 percent of the recovery period (within the meaning of section 168) applicable to the property; or


(*B*) The interest in property was simultaneously offered for sale to customers and used in a nondealing activity of the taxpayer for more than 25 percent of the period during which the interest in property was used in nondealing activities of the taxpayer.


For purposes of the preceding sentence, an interest in property is not considered to be offered for sale to customers solely because a lessee of the property has been granted an option to purchase the property.


(*2*) *Dealing activity not taken into account.* If paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) applies to the disposition of a taxpayer's interest in property, holding the interest in the dealing activity is treated, for purposes of § 1.469-2T(c)(2), as the use of the interest in the last nondealing activity of the taxpayer in which the interest in property was used prior to its disposition.


(B) *Use in a nondealing activity incidental to sale.* If paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section does not apply to the disposition of a taxpayer's interest in property that is held in a dealing activity of the taxpayer at the time of disposition, the use of the interest in property in a nondealing activity of the taxpayer for any period during which the interest in property is also offered for sale to customers is treated, for purposes of § 1.469-2T(c)(2), as the use of the interest in property in the dealing activity of the taxpayer.


(C) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(2)(v):


(c)(3)-(c)(5) [Reserved]


(c)(6) *Gross income from certain oil or gas properties*—(i) *In general.* Notwithstanding any other provision of the regulations under section 469, passive activity gross income for any taxable year does not include an amount of the taxpayer's gross passive income for the year from a property described in this paragraph (c)(6)(i) equal to the taxpayer's net passive income from the property for the year. Property is described in this paragraph (c)(6)(i) if the property is—


(A) An oil or gas property that includes an oil or gas well if, for any prior taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, any of the taxpayer's loss from the well was treated, solely by reason of § 1.469-1T(e)(4) (relating to a special rule for losses from oil and gas working interests), and not by reason of the taxpayer's material participation in the activity, as a loss that is not from a passive activity; or


(B) Any property the basis of which is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of property described in paragraph (c)(6)(i)(A) of this section.


(ii) *Gross and net passive income from the property.* For purposes of this paragraph (c)(6)—


(A) The taxpayer's gross passive income for any taxable year from any property described in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section is any passive activity gross income for the year (determined without regard to this paragraph (c)(6) and § 1.469-2T(f)) from the property;


(B) The taxpayer's net passive income for any taxable year from any property described in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section is the excess, if any, of—


(*1*) The taxpayer's gross passive income for the taxable year from the property; over


(*2*) Any passive activity deductions for the taxable year (including any deduction treated as a deduction for the year under § 1.469-1T(f)(4)) that are reasonably allocable to the income; and


(C) if any oil or gas well or other item of property (the item) is included in two or more properties described in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section (the properties), the taxpayer must allocate the passive activity gross income (determined without regard to this paragraph (c)(6) and § 1.469-2T(f) from the item and the passive activity deductions reasonably allocable to the item among the properties.


(iii) *Property.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(6)(i)(A) of this section, the term “property” does not have the meaning given the term by section 614(a) or the regulations thereunder, and an oil or gas property that includes an oil or gas well is—


(A) The well; and


(B) Any other item of property (including any oil or gas well) the value of which is directly enhanced by any drilling, logging, seismic testing, or other activities the costs of which were taken into account in determining the amount of the taxpayer's income or loss from the well.

(vi) Gross income attributable to the reimbursement of a loss from fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty, or from theft (as such terms are used in section 165(c)(3)) if—


(A) The reimbursement is included in gross income under § 1.165-1(d)(2)(iii) (relating to reimbursements of losses that the taxpayer deducted in a prior taxable year); and


(B) The deduction for the loss was not a passive activity deduction; and


(c)(7)(vii) Gross income or gain allocable to business or rental use of a dwelling unit for any taxable year in which section 280A(c)(5) applies to such business or rental use.


(d)(1)-(d)(2)(viii) [Reserved]


(ix) An item of loss or deduction that is carried to the taxable year under section 172(a), section 613A(d), section 1212(a)(1) (in the case of corporations), or section 1212(b) (in the case of taxpayers other than corporations);

In addition, the rules contained in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) and (v) of this section apply in determining for purposes of this paragraph (d)(5) the activity (or activities) in which an interest in property is used at the time of its disposition and during the 12-month period ending on the date of its disposition.


(d)(5)(iii)(B)-(d)(6)(v)(D) [Reserved]

(d)(6)(v)(F)-(d)(7) [Reserved]


(d)(8) *Taxable year in which item arises.* For purposes of § 1.469-2T(d), an item of deduction arises in the taxable year in which the item would be allowable as a deduction under the taxpayer's method of accounting if taxable income for all taxable years were determined without regard to sections 469, 613A(d) and 1211.


(e)(1)-(e)(2)(i) [Reserved]


(e)(2)(ii) *Section 707(c).* Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, any payment to a partner for services or the use of capital that is described in section 707(c), including any payment described in section 736(a)(2) (relating to guaranteed payments made in liquidation of the interest of a retiring or deceased partner), is characterized as a payment for services or as the payment of interest, respectively, and not as a distributive share of partnership income.


(iii) *Payments in liquidation of a partner's interest in partnership property*—(A) *In general.* If any gain or loss is taken into account by a retiring partner (or any other person that owns (directly or indirectly) an interest in the partner if the partner is a passthrough entity) or a deceased partner's successor in interest as a result of a payment to which section 736(b) (relating to payments made in exchange for a retired or deceased partner's interest in partnership property) applies, the gain or loss is treated as passive activity gross income or a passive activity deduction only to the extent that the gain or loss would have been passive activity gross income or a passive activity deduction of the retiring or deceased partner (or the other person) if it had been recognized at the time the liquidation of the partner's interest commenced.


(B) *Payments in liquidation of a partner's interest in unrealized receivables and goodwill under section 736(a).* (*1*) If a payment is made in liquidation of a retiring or deceased partner's interest, the payment is described in section 736(a), and any income—


(*i*) Is taken into account by the retiring partner (or any other person that owns (directly or indirectly) an interest in the partner if the partner is a passthrough entity) or the deceased partner's successor in interest as a result of the payment; and


(*ii*) Is attributable to the portion (if any) of the payment that is allocable to the unrealized receivables (within the meaning of section 751(c)) and goodwill of the partnership;


(*2*) For purposes of this paragarph (e)(2)(iii)(B), the portion (if any) of a payment under section 736(a) that is allocable to unrealized receivables and goodwill of a partnership shall be determined in accordance with the principles employed under § 1.736-1(b) for determining the portion of a payment made under section 736 that is treated as a distribution under section 736(b).

(e)(3)(iii)(C)-(f)(4) [Reserved]


(f)(5) *Net income from certain property rented incidental to development activity*—(i) *In general.* An amount of the taxpayer's gross rental activity income for the taxable year from an item of property equal to the net rental activity income for the year from the item of property shall be treated as not from a passive activity if—


(A) Any gain from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of the item of property is included in the taxpayer's income for the taxable year;


(B) The taxpayer's use of the item of property in an activity involving the rental of the property commenced less than 12 months before the date of the disposition (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section) of such property; and


(C) The taxpayer materially participated (within the meaning of § 1.469-5T) or significantly participated (within the meaning of § 1.469-5T(c)(2)) for any taxable year in an activity that involved for such year the performance of services for the purpose of enhancing the value of such item of property (or any other item of property if the basis of the item of property that is sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of such other item of property).


(ii) *Commencement of use*—(A) *In general.* For purposes of paragraph (f)(5)(i)(B) of this section, a taxpayer's use of an item of property in an activity involving the rental of the property commences on the first date on which—

(*3*) No significant value-enhancing services (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(B) of this section) remain to be performed.


(B) *Value-enhancing services.* For purposes of this paragraph (f)(5)(ii), the term value-enhancing services means the services described in paragraphs (f)(5) (i)(C) and (iii) of this section, except that the term does not include lease-up. Thus, in cases in which this paragraph (f)(5) applies solely because substantial lease-up remains to be performed (see paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(C) of this section), the twelve month period described in paragraph (f)(5)(i)(B) of this section will begin when the taxpayer acquires an interest in the property if substantially all of the property is held out for rent and is in a state of readiness for rental on that date.


(iii) *Services performed for the purpose of enhancing the value of property.* For purposes of paragraph (f)(5)(i)(C) of this section, services that are treated as performed for the purpose of enhancing the value of an item of property include but are not limited to—

(iv) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (f)(5):


(f)(6) *Property rented to a nonpassive activity.* An amount of the taxpayer's gross rental activity income for the taxable year from an item of property equal to the net rental activity income for the year from that item of property is treated as not from a passive activity if the property—


(i) Is rented for use in a trade or business activity (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section) in which the taxpayer materially participates (within the meaning of § 1.469-5T) for the taxable year; and


(ii) Is not described in § 1.469-2T(f)(5).


(f)(7)-(f)(9)(ii) [Reserved]


(f)(9)(iii) The gross rental activity income for a taxable year from an item of property is any passive activity gross income (determined without regard to § 1.469-2T(f)(2) through (f)(6)) that—


(A) Is income for the year from the rental or disposition of such item of property; and


(B) In the case of income from the disposition of such item of property, is income from an activity that involved the rental of such item of property during the 12-month period ending on the date of the disposition (see § 1.469-2T(c)(2)(ii)); and

(10) *Coordination with section 163(d).* Gross income that is treated as not from a passive activity under § 1.469-2T(f)(3), (4), or (7) is treated as income described in section 469(e)(1)(A) and § 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i) except in determining whether—


(i) Any property is treated for purposes of section 469(e)(1)(A)(ii)(I) and § 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i)(C) as property that produces income of a type described in § 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i)(A);


(ii) Any property is treated for purposes of section 469(e)(1)(A)(ii)(II) and § 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i)(D) as property held for investment;


(iii) An expense (other than interest expense) is treated for purposes of section 469(e)(1)(A)(i)(II) and § 1.469-2T(d)(4) as clearly and directly allocable to portfolio income (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i); and


(iv) Interest expense is allocated under § 1.163-8T to an investment expenditure (within the meaning of § 1.163-8T(b)(3)) or to a passive activity expenditure (within the meaning of § 1.163-8T(b)(4)).
