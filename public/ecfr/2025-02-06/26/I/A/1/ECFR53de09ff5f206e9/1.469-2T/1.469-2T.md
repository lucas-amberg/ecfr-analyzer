# § 1.469-2T   Passive activity loss (temporary).

(a) *Scope of this section.* This section contains rules for determining the amount of the taxpayer's passive activity loss for the taxable year for purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder. The rules contained in this section—


(1) Provide general guidance for identifying items of income and deduction that are taken into account in determining the amount of the passive activity loss for the taxable year;


(2) Specify particular items of income and deduction that are not taken into account in determining the amount of the passive activity loss for the taxable year; and


(3) Specify the manner in which provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations, other than section 469 and the regulations thereunder, are applied for purposes of determining the extent to which items of deduction are taken into account for a taxable year in computing the amount of the passive activity loss for such year.


(b) *Definition of passive activity loss*—(1) *In general.* In the case of a taxpayer other than a closely held corporation (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(g)(2)(ii)), the passive activity loss for the taxable year is the amount, if any, by which the passive activity deductions for the taxable year exceed the passive activity gross income for the taxable year.


(2) *Cross references.* See paragraph (c) of this section for the definition of “passive activity gross income,” paragraph (d) of this section for the definition of “passive activity deduction,” and § 1.469-1T(g)(4) for the computation of the passive activity loss of a closely held corporation.


(c) *Passive activity gross income*—(1) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in the regulations under section 469, passive activity gross income for a taxable year includes an item of gross income if and only if such income is from a passive activity.


(2) *Treatment of gain from disposition of an interest in an activity or an interest in property used in an activity*—(i) *In general*—(A) *Treatment of gain.* Except as otherwise provided in the regulations under section 469, any gain recognized upon the sale, exchange or other disposition (a “disposition”) of an interest in property used in an activity at the time of the disposition or of an interest in an activity held through a partnership or S corporation is treated in the following manner:


(*1*) The gain is treated as gross income from such activity for the taxable year or years in which it is recognized;


(*2*) If the activity is a passive activity of the taxpayer for the taxable year of the disposition, the gain is treated as passive activity gross income for the taxable year or years in which it is recognized; and


(*3*) If the activity is not a passive activity of the taxpayer for the taxable year of the disposition, the gain is treated as not from a passive activity.


(B) *Dispositions of partnership interests and S corporation stock.* A partnership interest or S corporation stock is not property used in an activity for purposes of this paragraph (c)(2). See paragraph (e)(3) of this section for rules treating the gain recognized upon the disposition of a partnership interest or S corporation stock as gain from the disposition of interests in the activities in which the partnership or S corporation has an interest.


(C) *Interest in property.* For purposes of applying this paragraph (c)(2) to a disposition of property—


(*1*) Any material portion of the property that was used, at any time before the disposition, in any activity at a time when the remainder of the property was not used in such activity shall be treated as a separate interest in property; and


(*2*) The amount realized from the disposition and the adjusted basis of the property must be allocated among the separate interests in a reasonable manner.


(D) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(2)(i):


(ii) *Disposition of property used in more than one activity in 12-month period preceding disposition.* In the case of a disposition of an interest in property that is used in more than one activity during the 12-month period ending on the date of the disposition, the amount realized from the disposition and the adjusted basis of such interest must be allocated among such activities on a basis that reasonably reflects the use of such interest in property during such 12-month period. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii), an allocation of the amount realized and adjusted basis solely to the activity in which an iterest in property is predominantly used during the 12-month period ending on the date of the disposition reasonably reflects the use of such interest in property if the fair market value of such interest does not exceed the lesser of—


(A) $10,000; and


(B) 10 percent of the sum of the fair market value of such interest and the fair market value of all other property used in such activity immediately before the disposition.


(iii) *Disposition of substantially appreciated property formerly used in nonpassive activity.* [Reserved]. See § 1.469-4(c)(2)(iii) for rules relating to this paragraph.


(iv) *Taxable acquisitions.* [Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(c)(iv) for rules relating to this paragraph.


(v) *Property held for sale to customers.* [Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(c)(v) for rules relating to this paragraph.


(3) *Items of portfolio income specifically excluded*—(i) *In general.* Passive activity gross income does not include portfolio income.

(G) Other income identified by the Commissioner as income derived by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of a trade or business.


(iii) *Special rules*—(A) *Income from property held for investment by dealer.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, a dealer's income or gain from an item of property is not dervied by the dealer in the ordinary course of a trade or business of dealing in such property if the dealer held the property for investment at any time before such income or gain is recognized.


(B) *Royalties derived in the ordinary course of the trade or business of licensing intangible property*—(*1*) *In general.* Royalties received by any person with respect to a license or other transfer of any rights in intangible property shall be considered to be derived in the ordinary course of the trade or business of licensing such property only if such person—


(*i*) Created such property; or


(*ii*) Performed substantial services or incurred substantial costs with respect to the development or marketing of such property.


(*2*) *Substantial services or costs*—(*i*) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(*2*)(*ii*) of this section, the determination of whether a person has performed substantial services or incurred substantial costs with respect to the development or marketing of an item of intangible property shall be made on the basis of all the facts and circumstances.


(*ii*) *Exception.* A person has performed substantial services or incurred substantial costs for a taxable year with respect to the development or marketing of an item of intangible property if—


(*a*) The expenditures reasonably incurred by such person in such taxable year with respect to the development or marketing of the property exceed 50 percent of the gross royalties from licensing such property that are includible in such person's gross income for the taxable year; or


(*b*) The expenditures reasonably incurred by such person in such taxable year and all prior taxable years with respect to the development or marketing of the property exceed 25 percent of the aggregate capital expenditures (without any adjustment of amortization) made by such person with respect to the property in all such taxable years.


(*iii) Expenditures taken into account.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(*2*)(*ii*) of this section, expenditures in a taxable year include amounts chargeable to capital account for such year without regard to the year or years (if any) in which any deduction for such expenditure is allowed.


(*3) Passthrough entities.* For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B), in the case of any intangible property held by a partnership, S corporation, estate, or trust, the determination of whether royalties from such property are derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business shall be made by applying the rules of this paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) to such entity and not to any holder of an interest in such entity.

(*2*) If a mineral production payment is not treated as a loan under section 636, payments in discharge of the production payment shall be treated as royalties.


(iv) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(3):


(4) *Items of personal service income specifically excluded*—(i) *In general.* Passive activity gross income does not include compensation paid to or on behalf of an individual for personal services performed or to be performed by such individual at any time. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(4), compensation for personal services includes only—

(F) Other income identified by the Commissioner as income derived by the taxpayer from personal services;


(ii) *Example.* The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (c)(4):


(5) *Income from section 481 adjustment*—(i) *In general.* If a change in accounting method results in a positive section 481 adjustment with respect to an activity, a ratable portion (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section) of the amount taken into account for a taxable year as a net positive section 481 adjustment by reason of such change shall be treated as gross income from the activity for such taxable year, and such gross income shall be treated as passive activity gross income if and only if such activity is a passive activity for the year of the change (within the meaning of section 481(a)).


(ii) *Positive section 481 adjustments.* For purposes of applying this paragraph (c)(5)—


(A) The term “net positive section 481 adjustment” means the increase (if any) in taxable income taken into account under section 481(a) to prevent amounts from being duplicated or omitted by reason of a change in accounting method; and


(B) The term “positive section 481 adjustment with respect to an activity” means the increase (if any) in taxable income that would be taken into account under section 481(a) to prevent only the duplication or omission of amounts from such activity by reason of the change in accounting method.


(iii) *Ratable portion.* The ratable portion of the amount taken into account as a net positive section 481 adjustment for a taxable year by reason of a change in accounting method is determined with respect to an activity by multiplying such amount by the fraction obtained by dividing—


(A) The positive section 481 adjustment with respect to the activity; by


(B) The sum of the positive section 481 adjustments with respect to all of the activities of the taxpayer.

(d) *Passive activity deductions*—(1) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in section 469 and the regulations thereunder, a deduction is a passive activity deduction for a taxable year if and only if such deduction—


(i) Arises (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(8) of this section) in connection with the conduct of an activity that is a passive activity for the taxable year; or


(ii) Is treated as a deduction from an activity under § 1.469-1T(f)(4) for the taxable year.


(2) *Exceptions.* Passive activity deductions do not include—


(i) A deduction for an item of expense (other than interest) that is clearly and directly allocable (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(4) of this section) to portfolio income (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section);

(xi) [Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(d)(2)(xi) for rules relating to this paragraph (d)(2)(xi).


(xii) [Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(d)(2)(xii) for rules relating to this paragraph (d)(2)(xii).


(3) *Interest expense.* Except as otherwise provided in the regulations under section 469, interest expense is taken into account as a passive activity deduction if and only if such interest expense—


(i) Is allocated under § 1.163-8T to a passive activity expenditure (within the meaning of § 1.163-8T(b)(4)); and


(ii) Is not—


(A) Qualified residence interest (within the meaning of § 1.163-10T); or


(B) Capitalized pursuant to a capitalization provision (within the meaning of § 1.163-8T(m)(7)(i)).


(4) *Clearly and directly allocable expenses.* For purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder, an expense (other than interest expense) is clearly and directly allocable to portfolio income (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section) if and only if such expense is incurred as a result of, or incident to, an activity in which such gross income is derived or in connection with property from which such gross income is derived. For example, general and administrative expenses and compensation paid to officers attributable to the performance of services that do not directly benefit or are not incurred by reason of a particular activity or particular property are not clearly and directly allocable to portfolio income (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section).


(5) *Treatment of loss from disposition*—(i) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in the regulations under section 469—


(A) Any loss recognized in any year upon the sale, exchange, or other disposition (a “disposition”) of an interest in property used in an activity at the time of the disposition or of an interest in an activity held through a partnership or S corporation and any deduction allowed on account of the abandonment or worthlessness of such an interest is treated as a deduction from such activity; and


(B) Any such deduction is a passive activity deduction if and only if the activity is a passive activity of the taxpayer for the taxable year of the disposition (or other event giving rise to the deduction).


(ii) *Disposition of property used in more than one activity in 12-month period preceding disposition.* In the case of a disposition of an interest in property that is used in more than one activity during the 12-month period ending on the date of the disposition, the amount realized from the disposition and the adjusted basis of such interest must be allocated among such activities in the manner described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.


(iii) *Other applicable rules*—(A) *Applicability of rules in paragraph (c)(2).* [Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(d)(5)(iii)(A) for rules relating to this paragraph.


(B) *Dispositions of partnership interests and S corporation stock.* A partnership interest or S corporation stock is not property used in an activity for purposes of this paragraph (d)(5). See paragraph (e)(3) of this section for rules treating the loss recognized upon the disposition of a partnership interest or S corporation stock as loss from the disposition of interests in the activities in which the partnership or S corporation has an interest.


(6) *Coordination with other limitations on deductions that apply before section 469*—(i) *In general.* An item of deduction from a passive activity that is disallowed for a taxable year under section 704(d), 1366(d), or 465 is not a passive activity deduction for the taxable year. Paragraphs (d)(6) (ii) and (iii) of this section provide rules for determining the extent to which items of deduction from a passive activity are disallowed for a taxable year under sections 704(d), 1366(d), and 465.


(ii) *Proration of deductions disallowed under basis limitations*—(A) *Deductions disallowed under section 704(d).* If any amount of a partner's distributive share of a partnership's loss for the taxable year is disallowed under section 704(d), a ratable portion of the partner's distributive share of each item of deduction or loss of the partnership is disallowed for the taxable year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the ratable portion of an item of deduction or loss is the amount of such item multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing—


(*1*) The amount of the partner's distributive share of partnership loss that is disallowed for the taxable year; by


(*2*) The sum of the partner's distributive shares of all items of deduction and loss of the partnership for the taxable year.


(B) *Deductions disallowed under section 1366(d).* If any amount of an S corporation shareholder's pro rata share of an S corporation's loss for the taxable year is disallowed under section 1366(d), a ratable portion of the taxpayer's pro rata share of each item of deduction or loss of the S corporation is disallowed for the taxable year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the ratable portion of an item of deduction or loss is the amount of such item multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing—


(*1*) The amount of the shareholder's pro rata share of S corporation loss that is disallowed for the taxable year; by


(*2*) The sum of the shareholder's pro rata shares of all items of deduction and loss of the corporation for the taxable year.


(iii) *Proration of deductions disallowed under at-risk limitation.* If any amount of the taxpayer's loss from an activity (within the meaning of section 465(c)) is disallowed under section 465 for the taxable year, a ratable portion of each item of deduction or loss from the activity is disallowed for the taxable year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the ratable portion of an item of deduction or loss is the amount of such item multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing—


(*1*) The amount of the loss from the activity that is disallowed for the taxable year; by


(*2*) The sum of all deductions from the activity for the taxable year.


(iv) *Coordination of basis and at-risk limitations.* The portion of any item of deduction or loss that is disallowed for the taxable year under section 704(d) or 1366(d) is not taken into account for the taxable year in determining the loss from an activity (within the meaning of section 465(c)) for purposes of applying section 465.


(v) *Separately identified items of deduction and loss.* In identifying the items of deduction and loss from an activity that are not disallowed under sections 704(d), 1366(d), and 465 (and that therefore may be treated as passive activity deductions), the taxpayer need not account separately for any item of deduction or loss unless such item may, if separately taken into account, result in an income tax liability different from that which would result were such item of deduction or loss taken into account separately. For related rules applicable to partnerships and S corporations, see § 1.702-1(a)(8)(ii) and section 1366(a)(1)(A), respectively. Items of deduction or loss that must be accounted for separately include (but are not limited to) items of deduction or loss that—


(A) Are attributable to separate activities (within the meaning of the rules to be contained in § 1.469-4T);


(B) Arise in a rental real estate activity (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) in taxable years in which the taxpayer activity participates (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) in such activity;


(C) Arise in a rental real estate activity (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) in taxable years in which the taxpayer does not actively participate (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) in such activity;


(D) Arose in a taxable year beginning before 1987 and were not allowed for such taxable year under section 704(d), 1366(d), or 465(a)(2);


(E) [Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(d)(6)(v)(E) for rules relating to this paragraph.


(F) Are attributable to pre-enactment interests in activities (within the meaning of § 1.469-11T(c)).


(7) *Deductions from section 481 adjustment*—(i) *In general.* If a change in accounting method results in a negative section 481 adjustment with respect to an activity, a ratable portion (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(7)(iii) of this section) of the amount taken into account for a taxable year as a net negative section 481 adjustment by reason of such change shall be treated as a deduction from the activity for such taxable year, and such deduction shall be treated as a passive activity deduction if and only if such activity is a passive activity for the year of the change (within the meaning of section 481(a)). See the rules to be contained in § 1.469-1T(k) for the treatment of passive activity deductions from an activity in taxable years in which the activity is a former passive activity.


(ii) *Negative section 481 adjustments.* For purposes of applying this paragraph (d)(7)—


(A) The term “net negative section 481 adjustment” means the decrease (if any) in taxable income taken into account under section 481(a) to prevent amounts from being duplicated or omitted by reason of a change in accounting method; and


(B) The term “negative section 481 adjustment with respect to an activity” means the decrease (if any) in taxable income that would be taken into account under section 481(a) to prevent only the duplication or omission of amounts from such activity by reason of the change in accounting method.


(iii) *Ratable portion.* The ratable portion of the amount taken into account as a net negative section 481 adjustments for a taxable year by reason of a change in accounting method is determined with respect to an activity by multiplying such amount by the fraction obtained by dividing—


(A) The negative section 481 adjustment with respect to the activity; by


(B) The sum of the negative section 481 adjustments with respect to all of the activities of the taxpayer.


(8) *Taxable year in which item arises.* [Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(d)(8) for rules relating to this paragraph.


(e) *Special rules for partners and S corporation shareholders*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder, the character (as an item of passive activity gross income or passive activity deduction) of each item of gross income and deduction allocated to a taxpayer from a partnership or S corporation (a “passthrough entity”) shall be determined, in any case in which participation is relevant, by reference to the participation of the taxpayer in the activity (or activities) that generated such item. Such participation is determined for the taxable year of the passthrough entity (and not the taxable year of the taxpayer). The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (e)(1):


(2) *Payments under sections 707(a), 707(c), and 736(b).* Items of gross income and deduction attributable to a transaction described in section 707(a), 707(c), or 736(b) shall be characterized for purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder in accordance with the following rules:


(i) *Section 707(a).* Any item of gross income or deduction attributable to a transaction that is treated under section 707(a) as a transaction between a partnership and a partner acting in a capacity other than as a member of such partnership shall be characterized for purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder in a manner that is consistent with the treatment of such transaction under section 707(a).


(ii) *Section 707(c).* [Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(e)(ii) for rules relating to this paragraph.


(iii) *Payments in liquidation of a partner's interest in partnership property.* [Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(e)(iii) for rules relating to this paragraph.


(3) *Sale or exchange of interest in passthrough entity*—(i) *Application of this paragraph (e)(3).* In the case of the sale, exchange, or other disposition (a “disposition”) of an interest in a passthrough entity, the amount of the seller's gain or loss from each activity in which such entity has an interest is determined, for purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder, under this paragraph (e)(3). In the case of any such disposition, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) or (iv) of this section, paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section shall apply. See paragraphs (c)(2) and (d)(5) of this section for rules for determining the character of gain or loss, respectively, recognized upon a disposition of an interest in an activity held through a passthrough entity.


(ii) *General rule*—(A) *Allocation among activities.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e)(3)(ii) or in paragraph (e)(3) (iii) or (iv) of this section, if a holder of an interest in a passthrough entity disposes of such interest, a ratable portion (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section) of any gain or loss from such disposition shall be treated as gain or loss from the disposition of an interest in each trade or business, rental, or investment activity in which such passthrough entity owns an interest on the applicable valuation date.


(B) *Ratable portion*—(*1*) *Dispositions on which gain is recognized.* The ratable portion of any gain from the disposition of an interest in a passthrough entity that is allocable to an activity described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section is determined by multiplying the amount of such gain by the fraction obtained by dividing—


(*i*) The amount of net gain (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(E)(*3*) of this section) that would have been allocated to the holder of such interest with respect thereto if the passthrough entity had sold its entire interest in such activity for its fair market value on the applicable valuation date; by


(*ii*) The sum of the amounts of net gain that would have been allocated to the holder of such interest with respect thereto if the passthrough entity had sold its entire interest in each appreciated activity (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(E)(*1*) of this section) described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section for the fair market value of each such activity on the applicable valuation date.


(*2*) *Dispositions on which loss is recognized.* The ratable portion of any loss from the disposition of an interest in a passthrough entity that is allocable to an activity described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section is determined by multiplying the amount of such loss by the fraction obtained by dividing—


(*i*) The amount of net loss (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(E)(*4*) of this section) that would have been allocated to the holder of such interest with respect thereto if the passthrough entity had sold its entire interest in such activity for its fair market value on the applicable valuation date; by


(*ii*) The sum of the amounts of net loss that would have been allocated to the holder of such interest with respect thereto if the passthrough entity had sold its entire interest in each depreciated activity (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(E)(*2*) of this section) described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section for the fair market value of each such activity on the applicable valuation date.


(C) *Default rule.* If the gain or loss recognized upon the disposition of an interest in a passthrough entity cannot be allocated under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, such gain or loss shall be allocated among the activities described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section in proportion to the respective fair market values of the passthrough entity's interests in such activities at the applicable valuation date, and the gain or loss allocated to each activity of the passthrough entity shall be treated as gain or loss from the disposition of an interest in such activity.


(D) *Special rules.* For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(ii), the following rules shall apply:


(*1*) *Applicable valuation date*—(*i*) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(D)(*1*)(*ii*) of this section, the applicable valuation date with respect to any disposition of an interest in a passthrough entity is whichever one of the following dates is selected by the passthrough entity:


(*a*) The beginning of the taxable year of the passthrough entity in which such disposition occurs; or


(*b*) The date on which such disposition occurs.


(*ii*) *Exception.* If, after the beginning of a passthrough entity's taxable year in which a holder's disposition of an interest in such passthrough entity occurs and before the time of such disposition—


(*a*) The passthrough entity disposes of more than 10 percent of its interest (by value as of the beginning of such taxable year) in any activity;


(*b*) More than 10 percent of the property (by value as of the beginning of such taxable year) used in any activity of the passthrough entity is disposed of; or


(*c*) The holder of such interest contributes to the passthrough entity substantially appreciated property or substantially depreciated property with a total fair market value or adjusted basis, respectively, which exceeds 10 percent of the total fair market value of the holder's interest in the passthrough entity as of the beginning of such taxable year;


(*2*) *Basis adjustments.* Any adjustment to the basis of partnership property under section 743(b) made with respect to the holder of an interest in a partnership shall be taken into account in computing the net gain or net loss that would have been allocated to the holder with respect to such interest if the partnership had sold its entire interest in an activity.


(*3*) *Tiered passthrough entities.* In the case of a disposition of an interest in a passthrough entity (the “subsidiary passthrough entity”) by a holder that is also a passthrough entity, any gain or loss from such disposition that is taken into account by any person that owns (directly or indirectly) an interest in such holder shall be allocated among the activities of the subsidiary passthrough entity by applying the rules of this paragraph (e)(3)(ii) to the person taking such gain or loss into account as if such person has been the holder of an interest in such subsidiary passthrough entity and had recognized such gain or loss as a result of a disposition of such interest.


(E) *Meaning of certain terms.* For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(ii)—


(*1*) An activity is an appreciated activity with respect to a holder that has disposed of an interest in a passthrough entity if a net gain would have been allocated to the holder with respect to such interest if the passthrough entity has sold its entire interest in such activity for its fair market value on the applicable valuation date;


(*2*) An activity is a depreciated activity with respect to a holder that has disposed of an interest in a passthrough entity if a net loss would have been allocated to the holder with respect to such interest if the passthrough entity had sold its entire interest in such activity for its fair market value on the applicable valuation date;


(*3*) The term “net gain” means, with respect to the sale of a passthrough entity's entire interest in an activity, the amount by which the gains from the sale of all of the property used by (or representing the interest of) the passthrough entity in such activity exceed the losses (if any) from such sale;


(*4*) The term “net loss” means, with respect to the sale of a passthrough entity's entire interest in an activity, the amount by which the losses from the sale of all of the property used by (or representing the interest of) the passthrough entity in such activity exceed the gains (if any) from such sale.


(iii) *Treatment of gain allocated to certain passive activities as not from a passive activity.* If, in the case of a disposition of an interest in a passthrough entity—


(A) An amount of gain recognized on account of such disposition by the holder of such interest (or any other person that owns (directly or indirectly) an interest in such holder if such holder is a passthrough entity) is allocated to a passive activity of such holder (or such other person) under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section;


(B) [Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(e)(3)(iii)(B) for rules relating to this paragraph.


(C) The amount of the gain of the holder (or such other person) described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B) of this section exceeds 10 percent of the amount of the gain of the holder (or such other person) described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section;


(iv) *Dispositions occurring in taxable years beginning before February 19, 1988*—(A) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e)(3)(iv), if the holder of an interest in a passthrough entity sells, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of all or part of such interest during a taxable year of such entity beginning prior to February 19, 1988, any gain or loss recognized from such disposition shall be allocated among the activities of the passthrough entity under any reasonable method selected by the passthrough entity, and the gain or loss allocated to each activity of the passthrough entity shall be treated as gain or loss from the disposition of an interest in such activity. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a reasonable method shall include the method prescribed by paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. In addition, a method that allocates gain or loss among the passthrough entity's activities on the basis of the fair market value, cost, or adjusted basis of the property used in such activities shall generally be considered a reasonable method for purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(iv).


(B) *Exceptions.* This paragraph (e)(3)(iv) shall not apply to any disposition of an interest in a passthrough entity occurring after February 19, 1988, if after such date, but before the holder's disposition of such interest, the holder (or any other person that owns (directly or indirectly) an interest in such holder if such holder is a passthrough entity) contributes to the passthrough entity substantially appreciated portfolio assets or any other substantially appreciated property that was used in any trade or business activity (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)) of the holder (or such other person) during—


(*1*) The taxable year of such person in which such contribution occurs; or


(*2*) The immediately preceding taxable year of such person;


(v) *Treatment of portfolio assets.* For purposes of the paragraph (e)(3), all portfolio assets owned by a passthrough entity shall be treated as held in a single investment activity.

(vii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e)(3):


(f) *Recharacterization of passive income in certain situations*—(1) *In general.* This paragraph (f) sets forth rules that require income from certain passive activities to be treated as income that is not from a passive activity (regardless of whether such income is treated as passive activity gross income under section 469 or any other provision of the regulations thereunder). For definitions of certain terms used in this paragraph (f), see paragraph (f)(9) of this section.


(2) *Special rule for significant participation*—(i) *In general.* An amount of the taxpayer's gross income from each significant participation passive activity for the taxable year equal to a ratable portion of the taxpayer's net passive income from such activity for the taxable year shall be treated as not from a passive activity if the taxpayer's passive activity gross income from all significant participation passive activities for the taxable year (determined without regard to paragraphs (f) (2) through (4) of this section) exceeds the taxpayer's passive activity deductions from all such activities for such year. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2), the ratable portion of the net passive income from an activity is determined by multiplying the amount of such income by the fraction obtained by dividing—


(A) The amount of the excess described in the preceding sentence; by


(B) The amount of the excess described in the preceding sentence taking into account only significant participation passive activities from which the taxpayer has net passive income for the taxable year.


(ii) *Significant participation passive activity.* For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2), the term “significant participation passive activity” means any trade or business activity (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(2)) in which the taxpayer significantly participates (within the meaning of § 1.469-5T(c)(2)) for the taxable year but in which the taxpayer does not materially participate (within the meaning of § 1.469-5T) for such year.


(iii) *Example.* The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (f)(2):


(3) *Rental of nondepreciable property.* If less than 30 percent of the unadjusted basis of the property used or held for use by customers in a rental activity (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)) during the taxable year is subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167, an amount of the taxpayer's gross income from the activity equal to the taxpayer's net passive income from the activity shall be treated as not from a passive activity. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(3), the term “unadjusted basis” means adjusted basis determined without regard to any adjustment described in section 1016 that decreases basis. The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (f)(3):


(4) *Net interest income from passive equity-financed lending activity*—(i) *In general.* An amount of the taxpayer's gross income for the taxable year from any equity-financed lending activity equal to the lesser of—


(A) The taxpayer's equity-financed interest income from the activity for such year; and


(B) The taxpayer's net passive income from the activity for such year


(ii) *Equity-financed lending activity*—(A) *In general.* For purposes of this paragraph (f)(4), an activity is an equity-financed lending activity for a taxable year if—

(*2*) The average outstanding balance of the liabilities incurred in the activity for the taxable year does not exceed 80 percent of the average outstanding balance of the interest-bearing assets held in the activity for such year.


(B) *Certain liabilities not taken into account.* For purposes of paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(A)(*2*) of this section, liabilities incurred principally for the purpose of increasing the percentage described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(A)(*2*) of this section shall not be taken into account in computing such percentage.


(iii) *Equity-financed interest income.* For purposes of this paragraph (f)(4), the taxpayer's equity-financed interest income from an activity for a taxable year is the amount of the taxpayer's net interest income from the activity for such year multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing—


(A) The excess of the average outstanding balance for such year of the interest-bearing assets held in the activity over the average outstanding balance for such year of the liabilities incurred in the activity; by


(B) The average outstanding balance for such year of the interest-bearing assets held in the activity.


(iv) *Net interest income.* For purposes of this paragraph (f)(4), the net interest income from an activity for a taxable year is—


(A) The gross interest income from the activity for such year; reduced by


(B) Expenses from the activity (other than interest on liabilities described in paragraph (f)(4)(vi) of this section) for such year that are reasonably allocable to such gross interest income.


(v) *Interest-bearing assets.* For purposes of this paragraph (f)(4), the interest-bearing assets held in an activity include all assets that produce interest income, including loans to customers.


(vi) *Liabilities incurred in the activity.* For purposes of this paragraph (f)(4), liabilities incurred in an activity include all fixed and determinable liabilities incurred in the activity that bear interest or are issued with original issue discount other than debts secured by tangible property used in the activity.

(7) *Special rules applicable to the acquisition of an interest in a passthrough entity engaged in the trade or business of licensing intangible property*—(i) *In general.* If a taxpayer acquires an interest in an entity described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(*3*) of this section (the “development entity”) after the development entity has created an item of intangible property or performed substantial services or incurred substantial costs with respect to the development or marketing of an item of intangible property, an amount of the taxpayer's gross royalty income for the taxable year from such item of property equal to the taxpayer's net royalty income for the year from such item of property shall be treated as not from a passive activity.


(ii) *Royalty income from property.* For purposes of this paragraph (f)(7)—


(A) A taxpayer's gross royalty income for a taxable year from an item of property is the taxpayer's share of passive activity gross income for such year (determined without regard to paragraphs (f)(2) through (7) of this section) from the licensing or transfer of any right in such property; and


(B) A taxpayer's net royalty income for a taxable year from an item of property is the excess, if any, of—


(*1*) The taxpayer's gross royalty income for the taxable year from such item of property; over

(iv) *Capital expenditures.* For purposes of paragraph (f)(7)(iii)(B) of this section, a capital expenditure shall be taken into account for the taxable year of the entity in which such expenditure is chargeable to capital account, and the taxpayer's share of such expenditure shall be determined as though such expenditure were allowed as a deduction for such year.


(v) *Example.* The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (f)(7):


(8) *Limitation on recharacterized income.* The amount of gross income from an activity that is treated as not from a passive activity for the taxable year under subparagraphs (f) (2) through (4) of this paragraph (f) shall not exceed the greatest amount of gross income treated as not from a passive activity under any one of such subparagraphs.
