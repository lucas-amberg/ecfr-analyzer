(3) The individual participates in the activity for more than 100 hours during the taxable year, and such individual's participation in the activity for the taxable year is not less than the participation in the activity of any other individual (including individuals who are not owners of interests in the activity) for such year; 


(4) The activity is a significant participation activity (within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section) for the taxable year, and the individual's aggregate participation in all significant participation activities during such year exceeds 500 hours;

(ii) *Certain management activities.* An individual's services performed in the management of an activity shall not be taken into account in determining whether such individual is treated as materially participating in such activity for the taxable year under paragraph (a)(7) of this section unless, for such taxable year— 


(A) No person (other than such individual) who performs services in connection with the management of the activity receives compensation described in section 911(d)(2)(A) in consideration for such services; and 


(B) No individual performs services in connection with the management of the activity that exceed (by hours) the amount of such services performed by such individual. 


(iii) *Participation less than 100 hours.* If an individual participates in an activity for 100 hours or less during the taxable year, such individual shall not be treated as materially participating in such activity for the taxable year under paragraph (a)(7) of this section. 


(c) *Significant participation activity*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of paragraph (a)(4) of this section, an activity is a significant participation activity of an individual if and only if such activity— 


(i) Is a trade or business activity (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(2)) in which the individual significantly participates for the taxable year; and 


(ii) Would be an activity in which the individual does not materially participate for the taxable year if material participation for such year were determined without regard to paragraph (a)(4) of this section. 


(2) *Significant participation.* An individual is treated as significantly participating in an activity for a taxable year if and only if the individual participates in the activity for more than 100 hours during such year. 


(d) *Personal service activity.* An activity constitutes a personal service activity for purposes of paragraph (a)(6) of this section if such activity involves the performance of personal services in—


(1) The fields of health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, or consulting; or


(2) Any other trade or business in which capital is not a material income-producing factor.


(e) *Treatment of limited partners*—(1) *General rule.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e), an individual shall not be treated as materially participating in any activity of a limited partnership for purposes of applying section 469 and the regulations thereunder to—


(i) The individual's share of any income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit from such activity that is attributable to a limited partnership interest in the partnership; and 


(ii) Any gain or loss from such activity recognized upon a sale or exchange of such an interest.


(2) *Exceptions.* Paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall not apply to an individual's share of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit for a taxable year from any activity in which the individual would be treated as materially participating for the taxable year under paragraph (a)(1), (5), or (6) of this section if the individual were not a limited partner for such taxable year.


(3) *Limited partnership interest*—(i) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, for purposes of section 469(h)(2) and this paragraph (e), a partnership interest shall be treated as a limited partnership interest if—


(A) Such interest is designated a limited partnership interest in the limited partnership agreement or the certificate of limited partnership, without regard to whether the liability of the holder of such interest for obligations of the partnership is limited under the applicable State law; or 


(B) The liability of the holder of such interest for obligations of the partnership is limited, under the law of the State in which the partnership is organized, to a determinable fixed amount (for example, the sum of the holder's capital contributions to the partnership and contractural obligations to make additional capital contributions to the partnership).


(ii) *Limited partner holding general partner interest.* A partnership interest of an individual shall not be treated as a limited partnership interest for the individual's taxable year if the individual is a general partner in the partnership at all times during the partnership's taxable year ending with or within the individual's taxable year (or the portion of the partnership's taxable year during which the individual (directly or indirectly) owns such limited partnership interest).


(f) *Participation*—(1) [Reserved]. See § 1.469-5(f)(1) for rules relating to this paragraph.


(2) *Exceptions*—(i) *Certain work not customarily done by owners.* Work done in connection with an activity shall not be treated as participation in the activity for purposes of this section if—


(A) Such work is not of a type that is customarily done by an owner of such an activity; and


(B) One of the principal purposes for the performance of such work is to avoid the disallowance, under section 469 and the regulations thereunder, of any loss or credit from such activity. 


(ii) *Participation as an investor*—(A) *In general.* Work done by an individual in the individual's capacity as an investor in an activity shall not be treated as participation in the activity for purposes of this section unless the individual is directly involved in the day-to-day management or operations of the activity. 


(B) *Work done in individual's capacity as an investor.* For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2)(ii), work done by an individual in the individual's capacity as an investor in an activity includes— 


(*1*) Studying and reviewing financial statements or reports on operations of the activity; 


(*2*) Preparing or compiling summaries or analyses of the finances or operations of the activity for the individual's own use; and 


(*3*) Monitoring the finances or operations of the activity in a non-managerial capacity. 


(3) *Participation of spouse.* In the case of any person who is a married individual (within the meaning of section 7703) for the taxable year, any participation by such person's spouse in the activity during the taxable year (without regard to whether the spouse owns an interest in the activity and without regard to whether the spouses file a joint return for the taxable year) shall be treated, for purposes of applying section 469 and the regulations thereunder to such person, as participation by such person in the activity during the taxable year. 


(4) *Methods of proof.* The extent of an individual's participation in an activity may be established by any reasonable means. Contemporaneous daily time reports, logs, or similar documents are not required if the extent of such participation may be established by other reasonable means. Reasonable means for purposes of this paragraph may include but are not limited to the identification of services performed over a period of time and the approximate number of hours spent performing such services during such period, based on appointment books, calendars, or narrative summaries.

(2) *Treatment of certain retired farmers and surviving spouses of retired or disabled farmers.* An individual shall be treated as materially participating for a taxable year in any trade or business activity of farming if paragraph (4) or (5) of section 2032A(b) would cause the requirements of section 2032A(b)(1)(C)(ii) to be met with respect to real property used in such activity had the individual died during such taxable year.
