# § 1.1245-4   Exceptions and limitations.

(a) *Exception for gifts*—(1) *General rule.* Section 1245(b)(1) provides that no gain shall be recognized under section 1245(a)(1) upon a disposition by gift. For purposes of this paragraph (a), the term *gift* means, except to the extent that paragraph (a)(3) of this section applies, a transfer of property that, in the hands of the transferee, has a basis determined under the provisions of section 1015(a) or 1015(d) (relating to basis of property acquired by gifts) or section 1022 (relating to basis of property acquired from certain decedents who died in 2010). For reduction in amount of charitable contribution in case of a gift of section 1245 property, see section 170(e) and the regulations thereunder.


(2) *Examples.* The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(3) *Disposition in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift.* Where a disposition of property is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift, the gain to which section 1245(a)(1) applies is the amount by which (i) the lower of the amount realized upon the disposition of the property or the recomputed basis of the property, exceeds (ii) the adjusted basis of the property. For determination of the recomputed basis of the property in the hands of the transferee, see paragraph (c)(2) of § 1.1245-2.


(4) *Example.* The provisions of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:


(b) *Exception for transfers at death*—(1) *General rule.* Section 1245(b)(2) provides that, except as provided in section 691 (relating to income in respect of a decedent), no gain shall be recognized under section 1245(a)(1) upon a transfer at death. For purposes of this paragraph, the term *transfer at death* means a transfer of property which, in the hands of the transferee, has a basis determined under the provisions of section 1014(a) (relating to basis of property acquired from a decedent) because of the death of the transferor. For recomputed basis of property acquired in a transfer at death, see paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of § 1.1245-2.


(2) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(c) *Limitation for certain tax-free transactions*—(1) *Limitation on amount of gain.* Section 1245(b)(3) provides that upon a transfer of property described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the amount of gain taken into account by the transferor under section 1245(a)(1) shall not exceed the amount of gain recognized to the transferor on the transfer (determined without regard to section 1245). For purposes of this subparagraph, in case of a transfer of both section 1245 property and non-section 1245 property in one transaction, the amount realized from the disposition of the section 1245 property (as determined under paragraph (a)(5) of § 1.1245-1) shall be deemed to consist of that portion of the fair market value of each property acquired which bears the same ratio to the fair market value of such acquired property as the amount realized from the disposition of the section 1245 property bears to the total amount realized. The preceding sentence shall be applied solely for purposes of computing the portion of the total gain (determined without regard to section 1245) which shall be recognized as ordinary income under section 1245(a)(1). For determination of the recomputed basis of the section 1245 property in the hands of the transferee, see paragraph (c)(2) of § 1.1245-2. Section 1245(b)(3) does not apply to a disposition of property to an organization (other than a cooperative described in section 521) which is exempt from the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code.


(2) *Transfers covered.* The transfers referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph are transfers of property in which the basis of the property in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor by reason of the application of any of the following provisions:


(i) Section 332 (relating to distributions in complete liquidation of an 80-percent-or-more controlled subsidiary corporation). See subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.


(ii) Section 351 (relating to transfer to a corporation controlled by transferor).


(iii) Section 361 (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain corporate reorganizations).


(iv) Section 371(a) (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain receivership and bankruptcy proceedings).


(v) Section 374(a) (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain railroad reorganizations).


(vi) Section 721 (relating to transfers to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest).


(vii) Section 731 (relating to distributions by a partnership to a partner). For special carryover basis rule, see section 1245(b)(6)(A) and paragraph (f)(1) of this section.


(3) *Complete liquidation of subsidiary.* In the case of a distribution in complete liquidation of an 80-percent-or-more controlled subsidiary to which section 332 applies, the limitation provided in section 1245(b)(3) is confined to instances in which the basis of the property in the hands of the transferee is determined, under section 334(b)(1), by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor. Thus, for example, the limitation of section 1245(b)(3) may apply in respect of a liquidating distribution of section 1245 property by an 80-percent-or-more controlled corporation to the parent corporation, but does not apply in respect of a liquidating distribution of section 1245 property to a minority shareholder. Section 1245(b)(3) does not apply to a liquidating distribution of property by an 80-percent-or-more controlled subsidiary to its parent if the parent's basis for the property is determined, under section 334(b)(2), by reference to its basis for the stock of the subsidiary.


(4) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(d) *Limitation for like kind exchanges and involuntary conversions*—(1) *General rule.* Section 1245(b)(4) provides that if property is disposed of and gain (determined without regard to section 1245) is not recognized in whole or in part under section 1031 (relating to like kind exchanges) or section 1033 (relating to involuntary conversions), then the amount of gain taken into account by the transferor under section 1245(a)(1) shall not exceed the sum of:


(i) The amount of gain recognized on such disposition (determined without regard to section 1245), plus


(ii) The fair market value of property acquired which is not section 1245 property and which is not taken into account under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph (that is, the fair market value of non-section 1245 property acquired which is qualifying property under section 1031 or 1033, as the case may be).


(2) *Examples.* The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(3) *Certain tangible property.* If:


(i) A person disposes of section 1245 property in a transaction to which section 1245(b)(4) applies,


(ii) Adjustments are reflected in the adjusted basis (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.1245-2) of such property which are attributable to the use of such property (or other property) as an integral part of an activity, or as a facility, specified in section 1245(a)(3)(B) (i) or (ii), and


(iii) Property is acquired in the transaction which would be considered as section 1245 property described in section 1245(a)(3)(B) if such person used the acquired property as an integral part of such an activity, or as such a facility, then (regardless of the use of the acquired property) the acquired property shall be considered as section 1245 property described in section 1245(a)(3)(B). For definition of property described in section 1245(a)(3)(B), see paragraph (c) of § 1.1245-3. Thus, for example, if a person's section 1245 property (which is personal property) is involuntarily converted into property A which would qualify as section 1245 property only if it were devoted to a specified use, and if the person had so devoted the section 1245 property disposed of, then the acquired property is considered as section 1245 property described in section 1245(a)(3)(B) and therefore its fair market value is not taken into account under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph. For recomputed basis of property A, see paragraph (a)(5) of § 1.1245-2. Moreover, if property A is not devoted to a specified use and is subsequently involuntarily converted into property B which would qualify as section 1245 property only if it were so devoted, then property B is also considered as section 1245 property described in section 1245(a)(3)(B).


(4) *Application to disposition of section 1245 property and nonsection 1245 property in one transaction.* For purposes of this paragraph, if both section 1245 property and nonsection 1245 property are acquired as the result of one disposition in which both section 1245 property and nonsection 1245 property are disposed of, then except as provided in subparagraph (7) of this paragraph:


(i) The total amount realized upon the disposition shall be allocated (in a manner consistent with the principles of paragraph (a)(5) of § 1.1245-1) between the section 1245 property and the nonsection 1245 property disposed of in proportion to their respective fair market values.


(ii) The amount realized upon the disposition of the section 1245 property shall be deemed to consist of so much of the fair market value of the section 1245 property acquired as is not in excess of the amount realized from the section 1245 property disposed of, and the remaining portion (if any) of the amount realized upon the disposition of the section 1245 property shall be deemed to consist of so much of the fair market value of the non-section 1245 property acquired as is not in excess of the amount of such remaining portion, and


(iii) The amount realized upon the disposition of the non-section 1245 property shall be deemed to consist of so much of the fair market value of all the property acquired which was not taken into account in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.


(5) *Example.* The provisions of subparagraph (4) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:


(6) *Cross references.* For the manner of determining the recomputed basis of property acquired in a transaction to which section 1245(b)(4) applies, see paragraph (c)(4) of § 1.1245-2. For the manner of determining the basis of such property, see paragraph (a) of § 1.1245-5.


(7) *Coordination with section 1250.* For purposes of this paragraph, if section 1245 property and section 1250 property are disposed of in one transaction in which the property acquired includes section 1250 property, the allocation rules of paragraph (d)(6) of § 1.1250-3 shall apply.


(e) *Limitation for section 1071 and 1081 transactions*—(1) *Section 1071 and 1081(b) transactions.* If property is disposed of and gain (determined without regard to section 1245) is not recognized in whole or in part because of the application of section 1071 (relating to gain from sale or exchange to effectuate policies of F.C.C.) or section 1081(b) (relating to gain from sale or exchange in obedience to order of S.E.C.), then the amount of gain taken into account by the transferor under section 1245(a)(1) shall not exceed the sum of:


(i) The amount of gain recognized on such disposition (determined without regard to section 1245),


(ii) In the case of a transaction to which section 1071 applies, the fair market value of property acquired which is not section 1245 property and which is not taken into account under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, plus


(iii) The amount by which the basis of property, other than section 1245 property, is reduced (pursuant to an election under section 1071 or pursuant to the application of section 1082(a)(2)), and which is not taken into account under subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph.


(2) *Section 1081(d)(1)(A) transaction.* No gain shall be recognized under section 1245(a)(1) upon an exchange of property as to which gain would not be recognized (without regard to section 1245) because of the application of section 1081(d)(1)(A) (relating to transfers within system group). For recomputed basis of property acquired in a transaction referred to in this subparagraph, see paragraph (c)(2) of § 1.1245-2.


(3) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(f) *Limitation for property distributed by a partnership*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of section 1245(b)(3) (relating to certain tax-free transactions), the basis of section 1245 property distributed by a partnership to a partner shall be deemed to be determined by reference to the adjusted basis of such property to the partnership.


(2) *Adjustments reflected in the adjusted basis.* If section 1245 property is distributed by a partnership to a partner, then, for purposes of determining the recomputed basis of the property in the hands of the distributee, the amount of the adjustments reflected in the adjusted basis of the property immediately after the distribution shall be an amount equal to:


(i) The potential section 1245 income (as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of § 1.751-1) of the partnership in respect of the property immediately before the distribution, reduced by


(ii) The portion of such potential section 1245 income which is recognized as ordinary income to the partnership under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of § 1.751-1.


(3) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(g) [Reserved]


(h) *Timber property subject to amortization under section 194*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of section 1245(a)(2), in determining the recomputed basis of property with respect to which a deduction under section 194 was allowed for any taxable year, a taxpayer shall not take into account amortization deductions claimed under section 194 to the extent such deductions are attributable to the amortizable basis (within the meaning of section 194(c)(2)) of the taxpayer acquired before the tenth taxable year preceding the taxable year in which gain with respect to the property is recognized.


(2) *Example.* The principles of paragraph (h)(1) of this section are illustrated by the following example:


(i) *Effective/applicability date.* This section applies on and after January 19, 2017. For rules before January 19, 2017, see § 1.1245-4 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2016.
