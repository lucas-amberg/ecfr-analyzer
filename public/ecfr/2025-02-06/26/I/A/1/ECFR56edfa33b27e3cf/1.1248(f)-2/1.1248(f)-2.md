(i) One portion attributable to all property transferred in the section 361 exchange, other than property that is stock of a foreign corporation with respect to which the domestic distributing corporation is a section 1248 shareholder immediately before the section 361 exchange; and


(ii) One portion attributable to each block of stock of each foreign corporation transferred in the section 361 exchange with respect to which the domestic distributing corporation is a section 1248 shareholder immediately before the section 361 exchange. For the determination of the earnings and profits attributable to the stock (or block of stock, as applicable) of each foreign corporation transferred in the section 361 exchange that are attributable to a portion of a share of stock of the foreign distributed corporation, see § 1.1248-8(b)(2)(iv). For the determination of the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the stock (or block of stock, as applicable) of each foreign corporation transferred in the section 361 exchange that is attributable to a portion of a share of stock of the foreign distributed corporation, see paragraph (d)(2) of this section.


(3) *Basis adjustments and income inclusions.* If the section 1248(f) amount attributable to a portion of a share of stock (or whole share, if no division is required) (as determined under paragraph (d) of this section) of the foreign distributed corporation received by a distributee that is a section 1248 shareholder in the new stock distribution exceeds the section 1248 shareholder's postdistribution amount in the portion (or whole share, if no division is required) (excess amount), then the section 1248 shareholder's section 358 basis in the portion as determined under paragraph (c)(4) of this section (or whole share, if no division is required), as adjusted under § 1.367(a)-7(c)(3), is reduced by the excess amount, but not below zero. To the extent the excess amount exceeds the section 358 basis in the portion (or whole share, if no division is required), the domestic distributing corporation must include that portion of the section 1248(f) amount attributable to the portion of the share (or whole share, if no division is required) in gross income as a dividend. For an illustration of this rule, see paragraph (e) of this section, *Example 2,* and § 1.367(a)-3(e)(8), *Example 3.*

(4) *Divided shares of stock*—(i) *Basis.* The basis of a portion of a share of stock of the foreign distributed corporation created under paragraph (c)(2) of this section is the product of the section 1248 shareholder's section 358 basis, as adjusted under § 1.367(a)-7(c)(3), in the share of stock multiplied by the ratio of the basis determined under section 362 (taking into account any gain or deemed dividends recognized under section 367) of the property (section 362 basis) to which the portion relates, to the aggregate section 362 basis of all property received by the foreign distributed corporation in the section 361 exchange. For illustrations of this rule, see paragraph (e) of this section, *Example 2,* and § 1.367(a)-3(e)(8), *Example 3.*

(ii) *Fair market value.* The fair market value of a portion of a share of stock of the foreign distributed corporation created under paragraph (c)(2) of this section is the product of the fair market value of the share of stock multiplied by the ratio of the fair market value of the property to which the portion relates to the aggregate fair market value of all property received by the foreign distributed corporation in the section 361 exchange. For illustrations of this rule, see paragraph (e) of this section, *Example 2,* and § 1.367(a)-3(e)(8), *Example 3.*

(iii) *Subsequent exchanges.* For purposes of determining the gain realized on the sale or exchange of a share of stock of the foreign distributed corporation that has divided portions under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the amount realized on the sale or exchange of the share will be allocated to each divided portion based on the relative fair market value of the property to which the portion relates as determined at the time of the reorganization.


(iv) *Duration of divided shares.* Shares of stock of the foreign distributed corporation that are divided into portions under paragraph (c)(2) of this section must be divided so long as section 1248(a) would apply to a sale or exchange of the shares.


(d) *Attribution of all or a portion of section 1248(f) amount to certain stock of the foreign distributed corporation.* This paragraph (d) applies if there is a new stock distribution for which an election under § 1.1248(f)-2(c)(1) is made. This paragraph (d) provides rules for attributing all or a portion, as applicable, of the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the stock of each foreign corporation transferred in the section 361 exchange by the domestic distributing corporation to shares of stock, or to portions of shares of stock, as applicable, received in the foreign distributed corporation and distributed to one or more distributees that are section 1248 shareholders with respect to the foreign distributed corporation. Paragraph (d)(1) of this section provides rules to attribute the applicable section 1248(f) amount among shares of stock of the foreign distributed corporation received by one or more distributees that are section 1248 shareholders. If shares of stock are divided into portions under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, paragraph (d)(2) of this section provides additional rules to attribute the applicable section 1248 amount to portions of shares of stock received by one or more distributees that are section 1248 shareholders.


(1) *Attribution of all or a portion of section 1248(f) amount among shares of stock.* With respect to one or more shares of stock of the foreign distributed corporation distributed to a distributee that is a section 1248 shareholder, the portion of the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the stock of the foreign corporation transferred in the section 361 exchange that is equal to the distributee's hypothetical section 1248 amount is attributed among those shares of stock of the foreign distributed corporation based on the ratio of the value of a share distributed to the distributee to the value of all shares of stock distributed to the distributee (attributable share amount).


(2) *Attribution of all or a portion of section 1248(f) amount to portions of a share of stock*—(i) *Single block of stock.* If a single block of stock of the foreign corporation is transferred in the section 361 exchange, the attributable share amount (as determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section) is attributed to the portion of the share that relates to the single block of stock of the foreign corporation.


(ii) *Multiple blocks of stock.* If multiple blocks of stock of the foreign corporation are transferred in the section 361 exchange, the attributable share amount (as determined under paragraph (d)(1) of the section) is attributed among the portions of the share that relate to such multiple blocks of stock of the foreign corporation. The portion of the attributable share amount that is attributable to a portion to which a block of stock relates is that amount that bears the same ratio that the section 1248(f) block amount with respect to that block of stock bears to the section 1248(f) amount with respect to the stock of the foreign corporation.


(e) *Examples.* The rules of this section are illustrated by the following examples. See also § 1.367(a)-3(e)(8), *Example 3.* For purposes of the examples, unless otherwise indicated: DP and DC are domestic corporations; X is a United States citizen; FP is a foreign corporation; CFC1, CFC2, and FA are controlled foreign corporations; each corporation has a single class of stock outstanding and uses the calendar year as its taxable year; each shareholder of a corporation owns a single block of stock in the corporation; DC owns Business A, which consists solely of property whose fair market value exceeds its basis and could satisfy the requirements of the active foreign trade or business exception under section 367(a)(3) and § 1.367(a)-2; DC owns no other assets and has no liabilities; the requirements in § 1.367(a)-7(c)(5) are satisfied; no earnings and profits of a foreign corporation are described in section 1248(d); and none of the foreign corporations in the examples is a surrogate foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 7874) as a result of the transactions described in the examples because one or more of the conditions of section 7874(a)(2)(B) is not satisfied.


(f) *Applicable cross-references.* For rules relating to the attribution of earnings and profits to the stock of a foreign corporation following certain nonrecognition transactions, see § 1.1248-8. For rules relating to a transfer of property by a domestic corporation to a foreign corporation in a section 361 exchange that precedes a new stock distribution, see § 1.367(a)-7. If the property transferred includes stock of a corporation, see also §§ 1.367(a)-3(e) and 1.367(b)-4. For other rules that may apply if a domestic corporation distributes the stock of a foreign corporation in a new stock distribution or an existing stock distribution satisfying the requirements of section 355, see §§ 1.367(b)-5(b)(1) and 1.367(e)-1.
