# § 1.1248-4   Limitation on tax applicable to individuals.

(a) *General rule*—(1) *Limitation on tax.* Under section 1248(b), if during a taxable year an individual sells or exchanges stock in a foreign corporation, then in respect of the stock the increase in the individual's income tax liability for such taxable year which is attributable (under paragraph (b) of this section) to the amount included in his gross income as a dividend under section 1248(a) shall not be greater than an amount equal to the sum of:


(i) The excess, computed under paragraph (c) of this section in respect of the stock of the United States taxes which would have been paid by the corporation over the taxes (including United States taxes) actually paid by the corporation, plus.


(ii) An amount equal to the increase in the individual's income tax liability which would be attributable to the inclusion in his gross income for such taxable year, as long-term capital gain, of an amount equal to the excess of (*a*) the amount included in the individual's gross income as a dividend under section 1248(a) in respect of such stock, over (*b*) the excess referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.


(2) *Share or block.* In general, the limitation on tax attributable (under paragraph (b) of this section) to the amount included in an individual's gross income as a dividend under section 1248(a) shall be determined separately for each share of stock sold or exchanged. However, such determination may be made in respect of a block of stock if earnings and profits attributable to the block are computed under § 1.1248-2 or 1.1248-3. See paragraph (b) of § 1.1248-2 and paragraph (a)(5) of § 1.1248-3.


(3) *Application of limitation.* The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not apply unless the individual establishes:

(ii) The amount equal to the sum described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, computed in accordance with the provisions of this section.

(b) *Tax attributable to amount treated as dividend*—(1) *General.* For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, in respect of a share (or block) of stock in a foreign corporation sold or exchanged by an individual during a taxable year, the tax attributable to the amount included in his gross income as a dividend under section 1248(a) shall be the amount which bears the same ratio to (i) the excess of (*a*) his income tax liability for the taxable year determined without regard to section 1248(b) over (*b*) such tax liability determined as if the portion of the total gain recognized during the taxable year which is treated as a dividend under section 1248(a) had not been recognized, as (ii) the amount included as a dividend under section 1248(a) in respect of the share (or block), bears to (iii) the total amount included as a dividend under section 1248(a) in the individual's gross income for such taxable year.
