# § 1.1248-7   Taxpayer to establish earnings and profits and foreign taxes.

(a) *In general.* (1) If a taxpayer sells or exchanges stock in a foreign corporation which was a controlled foreign corporation and the Commissioner determines that the taxpayer has not established the amount of the earnings and profits of the corporation attributable to the stock under § 1.1248-2 or § 1.1248-3, whichever is applicable, all the gain from such sale or exchange shall be treated as a dividend under section 1248(a). See section 1248(h). A taxpayer shall be considered to have established such amount if:


(i) He attaches to his income tax return, filed on or before the last day prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for his taxable year in which he sold or exchanged the stock, the schedule prescribed by paragraph (b) of this section or, if such last day is before April 1, 1965, he files such schedule before such date with the district director with whom such return was filed, and


(ii) He establishes in the manner prescribed by paragraph (d) of this section the correctness of each amount shown on such schedule.
