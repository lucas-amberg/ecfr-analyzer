See paragraph (b)(7) *Example 6* of this section.


(5) *Reduction in earnings and profits attributable to stock to prevent multiple inclusions with respect to the same earnings and profits.* To the extent consistent with the principles of section 1248, adjustments to earnings and profits attributable to stock shall be made such that section 1223(1) and (2) and this section are applied in a manner that results in earnings and profits being taken into account only once. Thus, for example, when a controlled foreign corporation sells or exchanges all or part of the stock of another foreign corporation to which earnings and profits are attributable pursuant to this paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) of this section, proportionate reductions shall be made to the earnings and profits attributed to the stock of the selling foreign corporate shareholder owned by a section 1248 shareholder. See paragraph (b)(7) *Example 7* of this section.


(6) *Special rule regarding section 381.* Solely for purposes of determining the earnings and profits (or deficit in earnings and profits) attributable to stock pursuant to this paragraph (b), the earnings and profits of a corporation shall not include earnings and profits that are treated as received or incurred under section 381(c)(2)(A) and § 1.381(c)(2)-1(a). See paragraph (b)(7) *Example 4* of this section.


(7) *Examples.* The application of this paragraph (b) is illustrated by the following examples. Unless otherwise indicated, in the following examples assume that—


(i) There is no immediate gain recognition pursuant to section 367(a)(1) and the regulations under that section (either through operation of the rules or because the appropriate parties have entered into a gain recognition agreement under §§ 1.367(a)-3(b) and 1.367(a)-8);


(ii) There is no income inclusion required pursuant to section 367(b) and the regulations under that section, and all reporting requirements in those regulations are complied with;


(iii) References to earnings and profits are to earnings and profits that would be includible in income as a dividend under section 1248 and the regulations under that section if stock to which the earnings and profits are attributable were sold or exchanged by its shareholder;


(iv) Each corporation has only a single class of stock outstanding and uses the calendar year as its taxable year; and


(v) Each transaction is unrelated to all other transactions.


(c) *Earnings and profits attributable to stock of a foreign distributee corporation that is a foreign corporate shareholder with respect to a foreign liquidating corporation*—(1) *General rule.* If a foreign corporation (liquidating corporation) makes a distribution of property in complete liquidation under section 332 to a foreign corporation (distributee), and immediately before the liquidation the distributee was a foreign corporate shareholder with respect to the liquidating foreign corporation, the amount of earnings and profits attributable to the distributee stock upon its subsequent sale or exchange will be determined under this paragraph (c)(1). The earnings and profits attributable will be the sum of the earnings and profits attributable to the stock of the distributee immediately before the liquidation (including amounts attributed under section 1248(c)(2)) and the earnings and profits attributable to the stock of the distributee accumulated after the liquidation (including amounts attributed under section 1248(c)(2)).


(2) *Special rule regarding section 381.* Solely for purposes of determining the earnings and profits (or deficit in earnings and profits) attributable to stock under this paragraph (c), the attributed earnings and profits of a corporation shall not include earnings and profits that are treated as received or incurred pursuant to section 381(c)(2)(A) and § 1.381(c)(2)-1(a).


(3) *Example—* (i) *Facts.* DC, a domestic corporation, has owned all of the stock of CFC1, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. CFC1 is an operating company that has owned all of the stock of CFC2, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. On December 31, year 2, CFC1 has $200 of accumulated earnings and profits and CFC2 has a ($200) deficit in earnings and profits. On December 31, year 2, CFC2 distributes all of its assets and liabilities to CFC1 in a liquidation to which section 332 applies. From January 1, year 3, until December 31, year 4, CFC1 accumulates no additional earnings and profits. On December 31, year 4, DC sells its stock in CFC1.


(ii) *Result.* Pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, there are no earnings and profits attributable to DC's CFC1 stock. This amount consists of the sum of the earnings and profits attributable to the CFC1 stock immediately before the liquidation (100% of the $200 accumulated earnings and profits of CFC1 and 100% of CFC2's ($200) deficit in earnings and profits) and the amount of earnings and profits accumulated after the section 332 liquidation (see also section 1248(c)(2)).


(d) *Effective/applicability dates*—(1) *General rule.* Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, this section applies to income inclusions that occur on or after July 30, 2007.


(2) *Exception.* Paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section applies to restructuring transactions occurring on or after April 18, 2013.
