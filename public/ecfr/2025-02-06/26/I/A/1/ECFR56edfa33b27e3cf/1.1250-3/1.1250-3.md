# § 1.1250-3   Exceptions and limitations.

(a) *Exception for gifts*—(1) *General rule.* Section 1250(d)(1) provides that no gain shall be recognized under section 1250(a) upon a disposition by gift. For purposes of this paragraph, the term *gift* shall have the same meaning as in paragraph (a) of § 1.1245-4. For reduction in amount of charitable contribution in case of a gift of section 1250 property, see section 170(e) and paragraph (c)(3) of § 1.170-1.


(2) *Disposition in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift.* Where a disposition of property is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift, the disposition shall be subject to the provisions of § 1.1250-1 and the gain to which section 1250(a) applies, shall be computed under that section.


(3) *Treatment of property in hands of transferee.* If property is disposed of in a transaction which is a gift:


(i) The additional depreciation for the property in the hands of the transferee immediately after the disposition shall be an amount equal to (a) the amount of the additional depreciation for the property in the hands of the transferor immediately before the disposition, minus (b) the amount of any gain (in case the disposition is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift) which would have been taken into account under section 1250(a) by the transferor upon the disposition if the applicable percentage had been 100 percent.


(ii) For purposes of computing the applicable percentage, the holding period under section 1250(e)(2) of property received as a gift in the hands of the transferee includes the transferor's holding period,


(iii) In case of a disposition which is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift, if the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the transferee exceeds its adjusted basis immediately before the transfer, the excess is an addition to capital account under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of § 1.1250-5 (relating to property with 2 or more elements), and


(iv) If the property disposed of consists of two or more elements within the meaning of paragraph (c) of § 1.1250-5, see paragraph (e)(1) of § 1.1250-5 for the amount of additional depreciation and holding period for each element in the hands of the transferee.


(4) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(b) *Exception for transfers at death*—(1) *General rule.* Section 1250(d)(2) provides that, except as provided in section 691 (relating to income in respect of a decedent), no gain shall be recognized under section 1250(a) upon a transfer at death. For purposes of this paragraph, the term *transfer at death* shall have the same meaning as in paragraph (b) of § 1.1245-4.


(2) *Treatment of transferee.* (i) If as of the date a person acquires property from a decedent such person's basis is determined, by reason of the application of section 1014(a), solely by reference to the fair market value of the property on the date of the decedent's death or on the applicable date provided in section 2032 (relating to alternate valuation date), then (*a*) on the date of death the additional depreciation for the property is zero, and (*b*) for purposes of computing applicable percentage the holding period of the property under section 1250(e)(1)(A) is deemed to begin on the day after the date of death.


(ii) If property is acquired in a transfer at death to which section 1250(d)(2) applies, the amount of the additional depreciation for the property in the hands of the transferee immediately after the transfer shall be the amount (if any) of the additional depreciation in respect of the property allowed the transferee before the decedent's death, but only to the extent that the basis of the property (determined under section 1014(a)) is required to be reduced under the second sentence of section 1014(b)(9) (relating to adjustments to basis where property is acquired from a decedent prior to his death) by depreciation adjustments referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of § 1.1250-2 which give rise to such additional depreciation. For treatment of such property as having a special element with additional depreciation so computed, see paragraph (c)(5)(i) of § 1.1250-5 (relating to property with two or more elements). For purposes of determining applicable percentage, such special element shall have a holding period which includes the transferee's holding period for such property for the period before the decedent's death.


(3) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(c) *Limitation for certain tax-free transactions*—(1) *General.* Section 1250(d)(3) provides that upon a transfer of property described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the amount of gain taken into account by the transferor under section 1250(a) shall not exceed the amount of gain recognized to the transferor on the transfer (determined without regard to section 1250). For purposes of this subparagraph, in case of a transfer of both section 1250 property and nonsection 1250 property in one transaction, the amount realized from the disposition of the section 1250 property shall be deemed to consist of that portion of the fair market value of each property acquired which bears the same ratio to the fair market value of such acquired property as the amount realized from the disposition of the section 1250 property bears to the total amount realized. The preceding sentence shall be applied solely for purposes of computing the portion of the total gain (determined without regard to section 1250) which shall be recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a). Section 1250(d)(3) does not apply to a disposition of property to an organization (other than a cooperative described in section 521) which is exempt from the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code.


(2) *Transfers covered.* The transfers described in this subparagraph are transfers of property in which the basis of the property in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor by reason of the application of any of the following provisions:


(i) Section 332 (relating to distributions in complete liquidation of an 80 percent or more controlled subsidiary corporation). For application of section 1250(d)(3) to such a complete liquidation, the principles of paragraph (c)(3) of § 1.1245-4 shall apply.


(ii) Section 351 (relating to transfer to a corporation controlled by transferor).


(iii) Section 361 (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain corporate reorganizations).


(iv) Section 371(a) (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain receivership and bankruptcy proceedings).


(v) Section 374(a) (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain railroad reorganizations).


(vi) Section 721 (relating to transfers to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest).


(vii) Section 731 (relating to distributions by a partnership to a partner). For special carryover basis rule, see section 1250(d)(6)(A) and paragraph (f)(1) of this section.


(3) *Treatment of property in hands of transferee.* In the case of a transfer described in subparagraph (2) (other than subdivision (vii) thereof) of this paragraph:


(i) The additional depreciation for the property in the hands of the transferee immediately after the disposition shall be an amount equal to (*a*) the amount of the additional depreciation for the property in the hands of the transferor immediately before the disposition, minus (*b*) the amount of additional depreciation necessary to produce an amount equal to the gain taken into account under section 1250(a) by the transferor upon the disposition (taking into account the applicable percentage for the property),


(ii) For purposes of computing applicable percentage, the holding period under section 1250(e)(2) of the property in the hands of the transferee includes the transferor's holding period,


(iii) If the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the transferee exceeds its adjusted basis immediately before the transferee, the excess is an addition to capital account under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of § 1.1250-5 (relating to property with 2 or more elements), and


(iv) If the property disposed of consists of 2 or more elements within the meaning of paragraph (c) of § 1.1250-5, see paragraph (e)(1) of § 1.1250-5 for the amount of additional depreciation and the holding period for each element in the hands of the transferee.


(4) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(d) *Limitation for like kind exchanges and involuntary conversions*—(1) *Limitation on gain.* (i) Under section 1250(d)(4)(A), if property is disposed of and gain (determined without regard to section 1250) is not recognized in whole or in part under section 1031 (relating to like kind exchanges) or section 1033 (relating to involuntary conversions), then the amount of gain taken into account by the transferor under section 1250(a) shall not exceed the greater of the two limitations set forth in subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph. Immediately after the transfer the basis of the acquired property shall be determined under subparagraph (2), (3), or (4) (whichever is applicable) of this paragraph, and its additional depreciation shall be computed under subparagraph (5) of this paragraph. The holding period of the acquired property for purposes of computing applicable percentage, which is determined under section 1250(e)(1), does not include the holding period of the property disposed of. In the case of a disposition of section 1250 property and other property in one transaction, see subparagraph (6) of this paragraph. In case of a disposition described in section 1250(d)(4)(A) of a portion of this item of property, see subparagraph (7) of this paragraph.


(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the first limitation is the sum of:


(*a*) The amount of gain recognized on the disposition under section 1031 or 1033 (determined without regard to section 1250), plus


(*b*) An amount equal to the cost of any stock purchased in a corporation which (without regard to section 1250) would result in nonrecognition of gain under section 1033(a)(3)(A).


(iii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the second limitation is the excess (if any) of:


(*a*) The amount of gain which would (without regard to section 1250(d)(4)) be taken into account under section 1250(a), over


(*b*) The fair market value (or cost in the case of a transaction described in section 1033(a)(3)) of the section 1250 property acquired in the transaction.


(iv) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:


(2) *Basis of property purchased upon involuntary conversion into money.* (i) If section 1250 property is purchased in a compulsory or involuntary conversion to which section 1033(a)(3) applies, and if by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(4)(A) all or part of the gain computed under section 1250(a) is not taken into account, then the basis of the section 1250 property and other purchased property shall be determined under the rules prescribed in this subparagraph. See section 1250(d)(4)(D).


(ii) The total basis of all purchased property, the acquisition of which results in the nonrecognition of any part of the gain realized upon the transaction, shall be (*a*) its cost, reduced by (*b*) the portion of the total gain realized which was not recognized. To the extent that section 1250(d)(4)(A)(i) prevents the purchase of stock from resulting in nonrecognition of gain, the basis of purchased stock is its cost.


(iii) If purchased property consists of both section 1250 property and other property, the total basis computed under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph shall be allocated between the section 1250 property (treated as a class) and the other property (treated as a class) in proportion to their respective costs, except that for purposes of this subdivision (but not subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph) the cost of the section 1250 property shall be deemed to be the excess of (*a*) its actual cost, over (*b*) the gain not taken into account under section 1250(a) by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(4)(A).


(iv) If the property acquired consists of more than one item of section 1250 property (or of more than one item of other property), the total basis of the section 1250 property (or of the other property), as computed under subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph, shall be allocated to each item of section 1250 property (or other property) in proportion to their respective actual costs.


(v) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(3) *Basis of property acquired upon involuntary conversion into similar property.* If property is involuntarily converted into property similar or related in service or use in a transaction to which section 1033(a)(1) applies, and if by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(4)(A) all or part of the gain computed under section 1250(a) is not taken into account, then:


(i) The total basis of the acquired property shall be determined under the first sentence of section 1033(c), and


(ii) If more than one item of property is acquired, such total basis shall be allocated to the individual items of property acquired in accordance with the principles prescribed in subparagraph (2) (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph, except that an amount equivalent to the fair market value of each item of property on the date acquired shall be treated as its actual cost.


(4) *Basis of property acquired in like kind exchange.* If section 1250 property is transferred in an exchange described in section 1031 (a) or (b), and if by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(4)(A) all or part of the gain computed under section 1250(a) is not taken into account, then:


(i) The total basis of the property (including nonsection 1250 property) acquired of the type permitted to be received under section 1031 without recognition of gain or loss shall be determined under section 1031(d), and


(ii) If more than one item of property of such type was received, such total basis shall be allocated to the individual items of property of such type in accordance with the principles prescribed in subparagraph (2) (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph, except that an amount equivalent to the fair market value of each such item of property on the date received shall be treated as its actual cost.


(5) *Additional depreciation for property acquired in like kind exchange or involuntary conversion.* (i) If property is disposed of in a transaction described in section 1031 or 1033, and if by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(4)(A) all or part of the gain computed under section 1250(a) is not taken into account, then the additional depreciation for the acquired property immediately after the transaction (as computed under section 1250(d)(4)(E)) shall be an amount equal to the amount of gain computed under section 1250(a) which was not taken into account by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(4)(A).


(ii) In case more than one item of section 1250 property is acquired in the transaction, the additional depreciation computed under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be allocated to each such item of section 1250 property in proportion to their respective adjusted bases.


(iii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(6) *Single disposition of section 1250 property and property of different class.* (i) For purposes of this subparagraph:


(*a*) Section 1250 property, section 1245 property (as defined in section 1245(a)(3)), and other property shall each be treated as a separate class of property, and


(*b*) The term *qualifying property* means property which may be acquired without recognition of gain under the applicable provision of section 1031 or 1033 (applied without regard to section 1250 or 1245) upon the disposition of property.


(ii) If upon a sale of section 1250 property gain would be recognized under section 1250(a) and if such section 1250 property together with property of a different class or classes are disposed of in one transaction in which gain is not recognized in whole or in part under section 1031 or 1033 (without regard to sections 1245 and 1250), then:


(*a*) The total amount realized shall be allocated between the different classes of property disposed of in proportion to their respective fair market values,


(*b*) The amount realized upon the disposition of property of a class shall be deemed to consist of so much of the fair market value of qualifying property of the same class acquired as is not in excess of the amount realized from the property of such class disposed of,


(*c*) The remaining portion (if any) of the amount realized upon the disposition of property of such class shall be deemed to consist of so much of the fair market value of any other property acquired as is not in excess of such remaining portion, and


(*d*) For purposes of applying (*c*) of this subdivision, the fair market value of acquired property shall be taken into account only once and in such manner as the taxpayer determines.


(iii) The amounts determined under this subparagraph in respect of property shall apply for all purposes of the Code.


(iv) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:


(7) *Disposition of portion of property.* A disposition described in section 1250(d)(4)(A) of a portion of an item of property gives rise to an addition to capital account described in the last sentence of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of § 1.1250-5 (relating to property with 2 or more elements). If the addition to capital account is a separate improvement within the meaning of paragraph (d) of § 1.1250-5, and thus an element, then immediately after the addition is made the amount of additional depreciation for such separate improvement shall be computed under subparagraph (5) of this paragraph by treating such portion and such addition as separate properties. If the addition is not a separate improvement, then immediately after the addition is made such property is considered under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of § 1.1250-5 as having a special element with the same amount of additional depreciation so computed. For purposes of computing applicable percentage, the holding period of the separate improvement or special element (as the case may be), which is determined under section 1250(e)(1), does not include the holding period of the property disposed of.


(e) *Sections 1071 and 1081 transactions*—(1) *General.* This paragraph prescribes regulations under section 1250(d)(5) which apply in the case of a disposition of section 1250 property in a transaction in which gain (determined without regard to section 1250) is not recognized in whole or in part by reason of the application of section 1071 (relating to gain from sale or exchange to effectuate policies of FCC) or section 1081 (relating to gain from sale or exchange in obedience to order of SEC).


(2) *Involuntary conversion treatment under section 1071.* If section 1250 property is disposed of and gain (determined without regard to section 1250) is not recognized in whole or in part solely by reason of an election under the first sentence of section 1071(a) to treat the transaction as an involuntary conversion, the consequences of the transaction shall be determined under the principles of paragraph (d) of this section.


(3) *Basis reduction under sections 1071 or 1082(a)(2).* (i) If section 1250 property is disposed of and gain (determined without regard to section 1250) is not recognized in whole or in part by reason of a reduction in basis of property pursuant to an election under section 1071(a) or the application of section 1082(a)(2), then the amount of gain taken into account by the transferor under section 1250(a) shall not exceed the sum of:


(*a*) The amount of gain recognized on such disposition (determined without regard to section 1250), plus


(*b*) In case involuntary conversion treatment was also elected under section 1071(a), an amount equal to the cost of any stock purchased in a corporation which (without regard to section 1250) would result in nonrecognition of gain under section 1033(a)(3), as modified by section 1071(a), plus


(*c*) The portion of the gain computed under section 1250(a) (without regard to this paragraph) which is neither taken into account under (*a*) or (*b*) of this subdivision nor applied under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph to reduce the basis of section 1250 property.


(ii)(*a*) The amount of gain computed under section 1250(a) (without regard to this paragraph) which is not taken into account under subdivision (i) (*a*) or (*b*) of this subparagraph shall be applied to the amount by which the basis of the section 1250 property was reduced under section 1071(a) or 1082(a)(2), as the case may be, before other gain (which is not gain computed under section 1250(a)) is so applied.


(*b*) If the basis of more than one item of section 1250 property was so reduced, the gain applied under (*a*) of this subdivision to all such section 1250 properties shall be applied to such items in proportion to the amounts of their respective basis reductions.


(*c*) Any gain not applied under (*a*) of this subdivision shall be applied to the amount by which the basis of the nonsection 1250 property was reduced.


(iii) If gain computed under section 1250 is applied under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph to reduce the basis of section 1250 property, the amount so applied shall be treated as additional depreciation in respect of such section 1250 property. For treatment of such section 1250 property as having a special element with additional depreciation consisting of such amount, see paragraph (c)(5)(i) of § 1.1250-5. For purposes of computing applicable percentage, such special element shall have a holding period beginning on the day after the date as of which the property's basis was so reduced.


(4) *Section 1081(d)(1)(A) transaction.* No gain shall be recognized under section 1250(a) upon an exchange of property as to which gain is not recognized (without regard to section 1250) because of the application of section 1081(d)(1)(A) (relating to transfers within system group). For treatment of property in the hands of a transferee, the principles of paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall apply.


(f) *Property distributed by a partnership to a partner*—(1) *General.* For purposes of section 1250 (d)(3) and (e)(2), the basis of section 1250 property distributed by a partnership to a partner shall be determined by reference to the adjusted basis of such property to the partnership. Thus, if section 731 applies to a distribution of section 1250 property by a partnership to a partner, then even though the partner's basis is not determined for other purposes by reference to the partnership's basis, (i) the amount of gain taken into account by the partnership under section 1250(a) is limited by section 1250(d)(3) to the amount of gain recognized to the partnership upon the distribution (determined without regard to section 1250), and (ii) the holding period of the property in the hands of the partner shall, under section 1250(e)(2), include the holding period of the property in the hands of the partnership. For nonapplication of section 1250(d)(3) to a disposition to an organization (other than a cooperative described in section 521) which is exempt from the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code, see paragraph (c)(1) of this section.


(2) *Treatment of property distributed by partnership.* (i) If section 1250 property is distributed by a partnership to a partner in a distribution in which no part of the partnership's *potential section 1250 income* in respect of the property was recognized as ordinary income to the partnership under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of § 1.751-1, the additional depreciation for the property in the hands of the distributee attributable to periods before the distribution shall be an amount equal to the total potential section 1250 income of the partnership in respect of the property immediately before the distribution, recomputed as if the applicable percentage for the property had been 100 percent. Under paragraph (c)(4) of § 1.751-1, the potential section 1250 income is, in effect, the gain to which section 1250(a) would have applied if the property had been sold by the partnership immediately before the distribution at its fair market value at such time.


(ii) If upon the distribution any potential section 1250 income in respect of the property was recognized to the partnership under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of § 1.751-1, then after the distribution the additional depreciation shall be an amount equal to (*a*) the total potential section 1250 income in respect of the property, as recomputed in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, minus (*b*) the amount of potential section 1250 income which would have been recognized to the partnership under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of § 1.751-1 if the applicable percentage for the property had been 100 percent.


(iii) If the partner's basis for the property immediately after the transaction exceeds the partnership's adjusted basis for the property immediately before the transaction, the excess may be an addition to capital account under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of § 1.1250-5 (relating to property with two or more elements).


(3) *Examples.* The provisions of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(4) *Treatment of partnership property after certain transactions.* If under paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.751-1 (relating to certain distributions of partnership property other than section 751 property treated as sales or exchanges) a partnership is treated as purchasing section 1250 property (or a portion thereof) from a distributee who relinquishes his interest in such property (or portion), then after the date of such purchase the following rules shall apply:


(i) If only a portion of the property is treated as purchased, there shall be excluded from the additional depreciation for the remaining portion any additional depreciation in respect of the purchased portion for periods before such purchase.


(ii) In respect of the purchased property (or portion), (*a*) as of the date of purchase the amount of additional depreciation shall be zero, and (*b*) for purposes of computing applicable percentage the holding period shall begin on the day after the date of such purchase.


(5) *Cross reference.* See paragraph (f) of § 1.1250-1 for the amount of additional depreciation for partnership property in respect of a partner who acquired his partnership interest in certain transactions when an election under section 754 (relating to optional adjustments to basis of partnership property) was in effect.


(g) *Disposition of principal residence*—(1) *In general.* (i) Section 1250(d)(7)(A) provides that section 1250(a) shall not apply to a disposition of property by a taxpayer to the extent the property is used by the taxpayer as his principal residence (within the meaning of section 1034(a) and the regulations thereunder, relating to a sale or exchange of residence). Thus, for example, if a doctor sells a house, of which one portion was used as his principal residence within the meaning of section 1034(a) and the other portion was properly subject to the allowance for depreciation as property used in his trade or business, then, by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(7)(A), section 1250(a) does not apply in respect of the disposition of the portion used as his principal residence. The provisions of this subparagraph shall apply regardless of whether section 1034 applies. Thus, for example, if section 1034 did not apply to the sale because the doctor did not invest in a new principal residence within the period specified in section 1034, nevertheless section 1250(a) would not apply to the disposition of the portion used as a principal residence.


(ii) Section 1250(d)(7)(B) provides that section 1250(a) shall not apply to a disposition of section 1250 property by a taxpayer who, in respect of the property, satisfies the age and ownership requirements of section 121 (relating to exclusion from gross income of gain on sale or exchange of residence of individual who has attained age 65), but only to the extent the taxpayer satisfies the use requirements of section 121 in respect of such property. Thus, if a taxpayer has attained the age of 65 before the date on which he disposes of section 1250 property, and if during the 8-year period ending on the date of the disposition the property has been owned and used by the taxpayer solely as his principal residence for periods aggregating 5 years or more, then section 1250(a) does not apply in respect to the disposition. This result would not be changed even if the taxpayer does not or cannot make the election provided for in section 121 and even if section 121 applies to only a portion of the gain because the adjusted sales price exceeds the $20,000 limitation in section 121(b)(1). If, however, only a portion of the property has been used as his principal residence for such periods aggregating 5 years or more, then, by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(7)(B), section 1250(a) is inapplicable only to the portion so used. For special rules for determining whether the age, ownership, and use requirements of section 121 are treated as satisfied, and for the manner of applying such requirements, see section 121(d) and the regulations thereunder.


(2) *Concurrent operation of section 1250(d)(7) with other provisions.* Upon the disposition of a principal residence, gain computed under section 1250(a) may not be recognized in whole or in part by reason of the application of both the provisions of section 1250(d)(7) and the provisions of one of the other exceptions or limitations enumerated in section 1250(d). Thus, for example, if an entire house is transferred as a gift, and if section 1250(d)(7) applies to only a portion of the house, then section 1250(d)(1) excepts the disposition of the entire house from the application of section 1250(a).


(3) *Special rule.* If by reason of section 1250(d)(7) a disposition is partially excepted from the application of section 1250(a), and if no other paragraph of section 1250(d) excepts the disposition entirely from such application, then the gain to which section 1250(a) applies shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to (i) the gain computed under section 1250(a) (without regard to section 1250(d)(7)), as (ii) the fair market value of the portion of the property to which the exception in section 1250(d)(7) does not apply, bears to (iii) the total fair market value of the property. Thus, for example, if under paragraph (a)(2) of this section gain of $300 would be recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a) (without regard to section 1250(d)(7)) upon a combined sale and gift of section 1250 property, and if the property has a fair market value of $25,000 of which $10,000 is properly allocable to a portion not used as a principal residence, then the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1250(a) would be $120 (10/25 of $300).


(4) *Treatment of property in hands of transferee.* If property is disposed of in a transaction to which section 1250(d)(7) applies, and if its basis in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(1) (relating to gifts) or section 1250(d)(3) (relating to certain tax-free transactions), then the treatment of the property in the hands of the transferee shall be determined under paragraph (a)(3) or (c)(3) (whichever is applicable) of this section


(5) *Treatment of property acquired in like kind exchange or involuntary conversion.* If property is disposed of in a transaction to which section 1250(d)(7) (relating to principal residence) and section 1250(d)(4) (relating to like kind exchanges and involuntary conversions) apply, then:


(i) The basis of the property acquired shall be determined under the applicable provisions of paragraph (d) (2), (3), or (4) of this section, applied as if all gain computed under section 1250(a) (except any gain not recognized solely by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(7)) were not taken into account by reason of section 1250(d)(4)(A),


(ii) The additional depreciation for the property acquired shall be determined in the manner prescribed in paragraph (d)(5) of this section, so applied, and


(iii) For purposes of computing the applicable percentage, the holding period of the acquired property shall be determined under section 1250(e)(1).


(6) *Treatment of property acquired in section 1034 transaction.* If a principal residence is disposed of in a transaction to which section 1250(d)(7) applies, and if by reason of the application of section 1034 (relating to sale or exchange of residence) the basis of property acquired in the transaction is determined by reference to the basis in the hands of the taxpayer of the property disposed of, then:


(i) The additional depreciation for the acquired property immediately after the transaction shall be an amount equal to (*a*) the amount of the additional depreciation for the property disposed of, minus (*b*) the amount of any gain which would have been taken into account under section 1250(a) by the transferor upon the disposition if the applicable percentage for the property had been 100 percent,


(ii) For purposes of computing the applicable percentage, the holding period of the acquired property includes the holding period of the disposed of property (see section 1250(e)(3)),


(iii) If the adjusted basis of the acquired property exceeds the adjusted basis immediately before the transfer of the property disposed of, the excess is an addition to capital account under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of § 1.1250-5 (relating to property with more than one element), and


(iv) If the property disposed of consisted of two or more elements within the meaning of paragraph (c) of § 1.1250-5, see paragraph (e)(3) of § 1.1250-5 for the amount of additional depreciation and the holding period for each element in the hands of the transferee.


(h) *Limitation for disposition of qualified low-income housing*—(1) *Limitation on gain.* (i) Under section 1250(d)(8)(A), if section 1250 property is disposed of and gain (determined without regard to section 1250) is not recognized in whole or in part under section 1039 (relating to certain sales of low-income housing projects), then the amount of gain recognized by the transferor under section 1250(a) shall not exceed the greater of:


(*a*) The amount of gain recognized under section 1039 (determined without regard to section 1250), or


(*b*) The excess, if any, of the amount of gain which would, but for section 1250(d)(8)(A), be taken into account under section 1250(a), over the cost of the section 1250 property acquired in the transaction.


(ii) The principles of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(2) *Replacement project consisting of more than one element.* (i) If (*a*) section 1250 property is disposed of, (*b*) any portion of the gain which would have been recognized under section 1250(a) is not recognized by reason of section 1250(d)(8)(A), and (*c*) the cost of the replacement section 1250 property constructed, reconstructed, or acquired during the reinvestment period exceeds the net amount realized attributable to the section 1250 property disposed of, then the section 1250 property shall consist of two elements. For purposes of this paragraph, the *reinvestment element* is that portion of the section 1250 property constructed, reconstructed, or acquired during the reinvestment period the cost of which does not exceed the net amount realized attributable to the section 1250 property disposed of, reduced by any gain recognized with respect to such property. The *additional cost element* is that portion of the section 1250 property constructed, reconstructed, or acquired during the reinvestment period whose cost exceeds the net amount realized attributable to the section 1250 property disposed of.


(ii) The principles of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:


(3) *Basis of property acquired.* (i) If section 1250 property is disposed of and gain (determined without regard to section 1250) is not recognized in whole or in part under section 1039 (relating to certain sales of low-income housing projects), then the basis of the section 1250 property and other property acquired in the transaction shall be determined in accordance with the rules of this subparagraph. Generally, the basis of the property acquired in a transaction to which section 1039(a) applies is its cost reduced by the amount of any gain not recognized attributable to the property disposed of (see section 1039(d)). In a case where the replacement section 1250 property constructed, reconstructed, or acquired within the reinvestment period is treated as consisting of more than one element under section 1250(d)(8)(e), the aggregate basis of the property determined under section 1039(d) shall be allocated as follows: first, to the reinvestment element of the section 1250 property, in an amount equal to the amount determined under section 1250(d)(8)(E)(i) reduced by the amount of any gain not recognized attributable to the section 1250 property disposed of; second, to the other replacement property (other than section 1250 property) in an amount equal to the amount of its cost reduced (but not below zero) by any remaining amount of gain not recognized; and finally, to the additional cost element of the section 1250 property, in an amount equal to the amount determined under section 1250(d)(8)(E)(ii) reduced by any amount of gain not recognized which has not been taken into account in determining the basis of the reinvestment element and the other replacement property that is not section 1250 property. See paragraph (h)(2) of this section for definition of the terms *reinvestment element* and *additional cost element.*

(ii) The principles of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(4) *Additional depreciation for property acquired.* (i) If a qualified housing project is disposed of in a transaction to which section 1039(a) applies, the additional depreciation for the replacement property immediately after the transaction shall be an amount equal to (*a*) the amount of additional depreciation for the property disposed of, minus (*b*) the amount of additional depreciation necessary to produce the amount of gain recognized under section 1250(a). Thus, if no gain is recognized upon a disposition of a qualified housing project, the additional depreciation for the property acquired will be the same as for the property disposed of. On the other hand, if upon disposition of a project, gain of $40,000 was recognized under section 1250(a), and if the additional depreciation for the project and the applicable percentage were $100,000 and 80 percent, respectively, the additional depreciation for the replacement housing project would be $50,000, that is, $100,000 minus $50,000, the amount of additional depreciation necessary to produce $40,000 of recognized gain where the applicable percentage is 80 percent.


(ii) If the property acquired in the transaction consists of more than one element of section 1250 property by reason of section 1250(d)(8)(E), the additional depreciation under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be allocated solely to the reinvestment element.


(5) *Additional limitation.* If, in a transaction to which section 1039(a) applies, gain is recognized by the taxpayer, the amount of gain recognized which is attributable to section 1250 property disposed of is, under section 1250(d)(8)(F)(i), limited to an amount equal to the net amount realized attributable to the section 1250 property disposed of reduced by the greater of (i) the adjusted basis of the section 1250 property disposed of, or (ii) the cost of the section 1250 property acquired. The limitation of section 1250(d)(8)(F)(i) may be illustrated by the following example:


(6) *Allocation rule.* (i) If, in a transaction to which paragraph (h)(1) of this section applies, the section 1250 property disposed of is treated as consisting of more than one element by reason of the application of section 1250(d)(8)(E) with respect to a prior transaction, then the amount of gain recognized, the net amount realized, and the additional depreciation with respect to each such element shall be allocated to the elements of the replacement section 1250 property in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph.


(ii) The portion of the net amount realized upon such a disposition which shall be allocated to each element of the section 1250 property disposed of is that amount which bears the same ratio to the net amount realized attributable to all the section 1250 property disposed of in the transaction as the additional depreciation for that element bears to the total additional depreciation for all elements disposed of. If any gain is recognized upon disposition of the section 1250 property, such gain shall be allocated to each element in the same proportion as the gain realized for that element bears to the gain realized for all elements disposed of. The additional depreciation for each reinvestment element of the replacement section 1250 property shall be the same as for the corresponding element of the property disposed of, decreased by the amount of additional depreciation necessary to produce the amount of gain recognized for such element. The additional depreciation for any additional cost element shall be zero.


(iii) The principles of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:
