# § 1.1250-5   Property with two or more elements.

(a) *Dispositions before January 1, 1970*—(1) *Amount treated as ordinary income.* If section 1250 property consisting of two or more elements (described in paragraph (c) of this section) is disposed of before January 1, 1970, the amount of gain taken into account under section 1250(a)(2) shall be the sum, determined in three steps under subparagraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this paragraph, of the amounts of gain for each element.


(2) *Step 1.* The first step is to make the following computations:


(i) In respect of the property as a whole, compute the additional depreciation (as defined in section 1250(b)), and the gain realized. For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of a transaction other than a sale, exchange or involuntary conversion, the gain realized shall be considered to be the excess of the fair market value of the property over its adjusted basis.


(ii) In respect of each element as if it were a separate property, compute the additional depreciation for the element, and the applicable percentage (as defined in section 1250(a)(2)) for the element. For additional depreciation in respect of an element of property acquired in certain transactions, see paragraph (e) of this section. For purposes of determining additional depreciation, the holding period of an element shall be determined under section 1223, applied by treating the element as a separate property. However, for the purpose of determining applicable percentage, the holding period for an element shall, except to the extent provided in paragraphs (c)(5), (e), and (f) of this section, be determined in accordance with the rules prescribed in § 1.1250-4.


(3) *Step 2.* The second step is to determine the amount of gain for each element in the following manner:


(i) If the amount of additional depreciation in respect of the property as a whole is equal to the sum of the additional depreciation in respect of each element having additional depreciation, and if such amount is not more than the gain realized, then the amount of gain to be taken into account for an element is the product of the additional depreciation for the element, multiplied by the applicable percentage for the element.


(ii) If subdivision (i) of this subparagraph does not apply, the amount of gain to be taken into account for an element is the product of:


(*a*) The additional depreciation for the element, multiplied by


(*b*) The applicable percentage for the element, and multiplied by


(*c*) A ratio, computed by dividing (*1*) the lower of the additional depreciation in respect of the property as a whole or the gain realized, by (*2*) the sum of the additional depreciation in respect of each element having additional depreciation.


(4) *Step 3.* The third step is to compute the sum of the amounts of gain for each element, as determined in step 2.


(5) *Examples.* The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(b) *Dispositions after December 31, 1969*—(1) *Amount treated as ordinary income.* If section 1250 property consisting of two or more elements (described in paragraph (c) of this section) is disposed of after December 31, 1969, the amount of gain taken into account under section 1250(a) shall be the sum, determined in 5 steps under subparagraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) of this paragraph, of the amount of gain for each element. Steps 3 and 4 are used only if the gain realized exceeds the additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, in respect of the property as a whole.


(2) *Step 1.* The first step is to make the following computations:


(i) In respect of the property as a whole, compute the additional depreciation (as defined in section 1250(b)) attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, and the gain realized. For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of a transaction other than a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion, the gain realized shall be considered to be the excess of the fair market value of the property over its adjusted basis.


(ii) In respect of each element as if it were a separate property, compute the additional depreciation for the element attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, and the applicable percentage (as defined in section 1250(a)(1)) for the element. For additional depreciation in respect of an element of property acquired in certain transactions, see paragraph (e) of this section. For purposes of determining additional depreciation, the holding period of an element shall be determined under section 1223, applied by treating the element as a separate property. However, for the purpose of determining applicable percentage, the holding period for an element shall, except to the extent provided in paragraphs (c)(5), (e), and (f) of this section, be determined in accordance with the rules prescribed in § 1.1250-4.


(3) *Step 2.* The second step is to determine the amount of gain recognized for each element under section 1250(a) (1) in the following manner:


(i) If the amount of additional depreciation in respect of the property as a whole attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, is equal to the sum of the additional depreciation in respect of each element having such additional depreciation, and if such amount is not more than the gain realized, then the amount of gain to be taken into account for an element under section 1250(a)(1) is the product of the additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1960, for the element, multiplied by the applicable percentage for the element determined under section 1250(a)(1).


(ii) If subdivision (i) of this subparagraph does not apply, the amount of gain to be taken into account under section 1250(a)(1) for an element is the product of:


(*a*) The additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, for the element multiplied by


(*b*) The applicable percentage for the element determined under section 1250(a)(1) for the element, and multiplied by


(*c*) A ratio, computed by dividing (*1*) the lower of the additional depreciation in respect of the property as a whole which is attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, or the gain realized, by (*2*) the sum of the additional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1969, in respect of each element having such additional depreciation.


(4) *Step (3).* If the gain realized exceeds the additional depreciation in respect of the property as a whole attributable to periods after December 31, 1969.


(i) Compute the additional depreciation attributable to periods before January 1, 1970, and the remaining gain (or remaining potential gain in the case of a transaction other than a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion), in respect of the property as a whole.


(ii) Compute the additional depreciation attributable to periods before January 1, 1970, and the applicable percentage determined under section 1250(a)(2) in respect of each element as if it were a separate property. For additional depreciation in respect of an element of property acquired in certain transactions, see paragraph (e) of this section. For purposes of determining additional depreciation, the holding period of an element shall be determined under section 1223, applied by treating the element as a separate property. However, for the purpose of determining applicable percentage, the holding period of an element shall, except to the extent provided in paragraphs (c)(5), (e), and (f) of this section, be determined in accordance with the rules prescribed in § 1.1250-4.


(5) *Step (4).* The fourth step is to compute the gain recognized under section 1250(a)(2) for each element (if computation was required under step (3)) in the following manner:


(i) If the amount of additional depreciation in respect of the property as a whole attributable to periods before January 1, 1970, is equal to the sum of the additional depreciation in respect of each element having such additional depreciation, and if such amount is not more than the remaining gain (or remaining potential gain), then the amount of gain to be taken into account for an element under section 1250(a)(2) is the product of the additional depreciation attributable to periods before January 1, 1970, for the element, multiplied by the applicable percentage determined under section 1250(a)(2) for the element.


(ii) If subdivision (i) of this subparagraph does not apply, the amount of gain to be taken into account for an element under section 1250(a)(2) is the product of:


(*a*) The additional depreciation attributable to periods before January 1, 1970, for the element, multiplied by,


(*b*) The applicable percentage for the element determined under section 1250(a)(2), and multiplied by,


(*c*) A ratio, computed by dividing (*1*) the lower of the additional depreciation in respect of the property as a whole which is attributable to periods before January 1, 1970,


(6) *Step (5).* The fifth step is to compute the sum of the amount of gain for each element, as determined in steps (2) and (4).


(7) *Examples.* The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(c) *Element*—(1) *General.* For purposes of this section, in the case of section 1250 property there shall be treated as separate elements the separate improvements, units, remaining property, special elements, and low-income housing elements which are respectively referred to in paragraphs (c) (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) of this section.


(2) *Separate improvements.* There shall be treated as an element each *separate improvement* (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) to the property.


(3) *Units.* If before completion of section 1250 property one or more units thereof are placed in service, each such unit of the section 1250 property shall be treated as an element.


(4) *Remaining property.* The remaining property which is not taken into account under subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph shall be treated as an element.


(5) *Special elements.* (i) If the basis of section 1250 property is reduced in the manner described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of § 1.1250-3 (relating to property acquired from a decedent prior to his death) or in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of § 1.1250-3 (relating to basis reduction under section 1071 or 1082(a)(2)), then such property shall be considered as having a special element with additional depreciation equal to the amount of additional depreciation included in the depreciation adjustments (referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of § 1.1250-2) to which the basis reduction is attributable. For purposes of computing applicable percentage, the holding period of a special element under this subdivision shall be determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (e)(3)(iii) (whichever is applicable) of § 1.1250-3.


(ii) If a disposition described in section 1250(d)(4)(A) (relating to like kind exchanges and involuntary conversions) of a portion of an item of property gives rise to an addition to capital account (described in the last sentence of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section) which is not a separate improvement, then such property shall be considered as having a special element with additional depreciation and, for purposes of computing applicable percentage, a holding period determined under paragraph (d)(7) of § 1.1250-3.


(6) *Low-income housing elements.* If, in an approved disposition of a qualified housing project, a replacement qualified housing project is treated as consisting of more than one element of section 1250 property by reason of section 1250(d)(8)(E) (see paragraph (h)(2) of § 1.1250-3), the elements determined under such section shall be treated as elements for purposes of this section. For definition of the terms *qualified housing project* and *approved disposition,* see section 1039(b) and the regulations thereunder.


(7) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(d) *Separate improvement*—(1) *Definition.* For purposes of this section, with respect to any section 1250 property, the term *separate improvement* means an *addition to capital account* described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph which qualifies as an *improvement* under the 1-year test prescribed in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph and which satisfies the 36-month test prescribed in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.


(2) *Addition to capital account.* (i) In the case of any section 1250 property, an addition to capital account described in this subparagraph is any addition to capital account in respect of such property after its initial acquisition or completion by the taxpayer or by any person who held the property during a period included in the taxpayer's holding period (see § 1.1250-4) for the property. An addition to the capital account of section 1250 property may arise, for example, if there is an expenditure for section 1250 property which is an improvement, replacement, addition, or alteration to such property (regardless of whether the cost thereof is capitalized or charged against the depreciation reserve). In such a case, the *addition to capital account* is the gross addition, unreduced by amounts attributable to replaced property, to the net capital account and not the net addition to such account. Thus, if a roof has an adjusted basis of $20,000, and is replaced by constructing a new roof at a cost of $50,000, the gross addition of $50,000 is an addition to capital account. (The adjusted basis of the old roof is no longer included in the capital account for the property.) For purposes of this section, the status of an addition to capital account is not affected by whether or not it is treated as a separate property for purposes of determining depreciation adjustments. In case of an addition to the capital account of property arising after December 31, 1963, upon a disposition referred to in section 1250(d)(4) (relating to like kind exchanges and involuntary conversions) of a portion of an item of such property, the amount of such addition (and its basis for all purposes of the Code) shall be the basis thereof determined under paragraph (d) (2), (3), or (4) (whichever is applicable) of § 1.1250-3, applied by treating such portion and such addition as separate properties.


(ii) An addition to capital account may be attributable to an excess of the adjusted basis of section 1250 property in the hands of a transferee immediately after a transaction referred to in section 1250(e)(2) (relating to holding period of property with transferred basis) over its adjusted basis in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transaction. Thus, for example, such excess may arise from a gift which is in part a sale or exchange (see paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.1250-3), from an increase in basis due to gift tax paid (see section 1015(d)), from a transfer referred to in paragraph (c)(2) of § 1.1250-3 (relating to certain tax-free transactions) in which gain is partially recognized, or from a distribution by a partnership to a partner in which no gain is recognized by reason of the application of section 731. Similarly, an addition to capital account may be attributable to an excess of the adjusted basis of a principal residence acquired in a transaction referred to in section 1250(e)(3) over the adjusted basis of the principal residence disposed of, as well as to any increase in the adjusted basis of section 1250 property of a partnership by reason of an optional basis adjustment under section 734(b) or 743(b).


(iii) Whether or not an expenditure shall be treated as an addition to capital account described in this subparagraph, as distinguished from a separate item of property, may depend on how the property or properties are disposed of. Thus, for example, if a taxpayer, who owns a motel consisting of 10 buildings with common heating and plumbing systems, adds to the motel three new buildings which are connected to the common systems, and if the taxpayer sells the motel to one person in one transaction, then for purposes of this subparagraph the cost of the three new buildings shall be treated as an addition to the capital account of the motel and, if the 1-year and 36-month tests of subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph are satisfied, the motel consists of at least two elements. If, however, the 10-building group and the three-building group were individually sold in separate transactions to two different people each of whom would operate his group as a separate business, the motel would consist of two items of property.


(3) *One-year test for improvement.* (i) An addition to capital account of section 1250 property for any taxable year (including a short taxable year and the entire taxable year in which the disposition occurs) shall be treated as an improvement only if the sum of all additions to the capital account of such property for such taxable year exceeds the greater of:


(*a*) $2,000, or


(*b*) One percent of the unadjusted basis of the property, determined as of the beginning (*1*) of such taxable year, or (*2*) of the holding period (within the meaning of § 1.1250-4) of the property, whichever is the later.


(ii) For purposes of this section, the term *unadjusted basis* means the adjusted basis of the property, determined without regard to the adjustments provided in section 1016(a) (2) and (3) (relating to adjustments for depreciation, amortization, and depletion). For purposes of this paragraph, as of any particular date the unadjusted basis of section 1250 property (*a*) includes the cost of any addition to capital account for the property which arises prior to such date (regardless of whether such addition qualified under this subparagraph as an improvement), and (*b*) does not include the cost of a component retired before such date.


(iii) In respect of a particular disposition of section 1250 property by a person:


(*a*) There shall not be taken into account under the 1-year test for improvements in this subparagraph any addition to capital account which arises by reason of (or after) such disposition or which arises before the beginning of the holding period under § 1.1250-4 of such person for the property, and


(*b*) Such test shall be made in respect of each taxable year of such person (and of any prior transferor) any day of which is included under § 1.1250-4 in such person's holding period for the property, except that (*1*) such test shall be made for a taxable year of such person only if such person actually owned the property on at least 1 day of such taxable year, and (*2*) such test shall be made for a taxable year of such prior transferor only if such prior transferor actually owned the property on at least 1 day of such taxable year.


(iv) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(4) *36-month test for separate improvement.* (i) If, during the 36-month period ending on the last day of any taxable year (including a short taxable year and the entire taxable year in which the disposition occurs), the sum of the amounts treated under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph as improvements for such period exceeds the greatest of:


(*a*) 25 percent of the adjusted basis of the property,


(*b*) 10 percent of the unadjusted basis (determined under subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph) of the property, or


(*c*) $5,000,


(ii) In respect of a particular disposition of section 1250 property by a person:


(*a*) There shall not be taken into account under the 36-month test for separate improvements in this subparagraph any amount treated under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph as an improvement which arises by reason of (or after) the disposition or which arises before the beginning of the holding period under § 1.1250-4 of such person for the property, and


(*b*) Such test shall be made in respect of each 36-month period ending on the last day of each taxable year of such person (and of any prior transferor) if at least 1 day of such period is included under § 1.1250-4 in such person's holding period for the property, except that (*1*) such test shall be made for a 36-month period ending on the last day of a taxable year of such person only if such person actually owned the property on at least 1 day of such period, and (*2*) such test shall be made for a 36-month period ending on the last day of a taxable year of such prior transferor only if such prior transferor actually owned the property on at least 1 day of such period.


(iii) For illustration of the principles of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, see examples (2) and (3) in subparagraph (3)(iv) of this paragraph.


(5) *Example.* The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:


(e) *Additional depreciation and holding period of property acquired in certain transactions*—(1) *Transferred basis.* If property consisting of two or more elements is disposed of, and if the holding period of the property in the hands of the transferee for purposes of computing applicable percentage includes the holding period of the transferor by reason of the application of paragraph (c) (other than subparagraph (2) thereof) of § 1.1250-4, then the additional depreciation for each element of the property in the hands of the transferee immediately after the transfer shall be computed in the manner set forth in this subparagraph. First, any element having a deficit in additional depreciation in the hands of the transferor immediately before such transfer shall be considered to have the same deficit in the hands of the transferee. Second, elements having additional depreciation in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transfer shall be considered to have additional depreciation in the hands of the transferee. The sum of the transferee's additional depreciation for all elements of the property having additional depreciation in the hands of the transferor shall be an amount equal to the additional depreciation in respect of the property as a whole immediately after the transfer increased by the sum of the deficits in addition depreciation for all elements having such deficits. In case there is more than one element having additional depreciation, the additional depreciation for any such element in the hands of the transferee shall be computed by multiplying (i) the amount computed under the preceding sentence by (ii) the additional depreciation for such element in the hands of the transferor divided by the sum of the additional depreciation for all such elements having additional depreciation in the hands of the transferor. For purposes of computing applicable percentage, the holding period for an element of such property in the hands of the transferee shall include the holding period of such element in the hands of the transferor.


(2) *Example.* The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:


(3) *Principal residence.* If a principal residence consisting of two or more elements is disposed of, and if for purposes of computing applicable percentage the holding period of the principal residence acquired includes the holding period of the principal residence disposed of by reason of the application of paragraph (d) of § 1.1250-4, then the additional depreciation (or a deficit in additional depreciation) for an element of the principal residence acquired immediately after the transaction shall be determined in a manner consistent with the principles of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. For purposes of computing applicable percentage, the holding period for an element of the principal residence acquired includes the holding period of such element of the principal residence disposed of, but not the period beginning on the day after the date of the disposition and ending on the date of the acquisition.


(f) *Holding period for small separate improvements*—(1) *General.* This paragraph prescribes a special holding period solely for the purpose of computing the applicable percentage of a separate improvement (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) which is treated as an element. See paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section for determination of holding period under section 1223 for purposes of computing additional depreciation. In respect of section 1250 property, if the amount of a separate improvement does not exceed the greater of:


(i) $2,000, or


(ii) One percent of the unadjusted basis (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section) of such property, determined as of the beginning of the taxable year in which such separate improvement was made,


(2) *Example.* The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:
