# § 1.1251-4   Exceptions and limitations.

(a) *Exception for gifts*—(1) *General rule.* Section 1251(d)(1) provides that no gain shall be recognized under section 1251(c)(1) upon a disposition by gift. For purposes of this paragraph, the term *gift* shall have the same meaning as in paragraph (a) of § 1.1245-4 and, with respect to the application of this paragraph, principles illustrated by the examples of paragraph (a)(2) of § 1245-4 shall apply. For reduction in amount of charitable contribution in case of a gift of farm recapture property, see section 170(e) and § 1.170A-4.


(2) *Disposition in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift.* Where a disposition of farm recpature property is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift, the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) shall not exceed:


(i) In the case of farm recapture property other than land, the excess of the amount realized over adjusted basis, and


(ii) In the case of land, the lower of the amount in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph or the potential gain (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of § 1.1251-1.


(3) *Treatment of land in hand of transferee.* See paragraph (g) of this section for treatment of transferee in the case of a disposition of land to which this paragraph applies.


(4) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(b) *Exception for transfers at death*—(1) *General rule.* Section 1251(d)(2) provides that, except as provided in section 691 (relating to income in respect of a decedent), no gain shall be recognized under section 1251(c)(1) upon a transfer at death. For purposes of this paragraph, the term *transfer at death* shall have the same meaning as in paragraph (b) of § 1.1245-4 and, with respect to the application of this paragraph, principles illustrated by the examples of paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.1245-4 shall apply.


(2) *Treatment of land in hands of transferee.* If as of the date a person acquires land which is farm recapture property from a decedent such person's basis is determined, by reason of the application of section 1014(a), solely by reference to the fair market value of the property on the date of the decedent's death or on the applicable date provided in section 2032 (relating to alternate valuation date), then on such date the potential gain in respect to such land is zero.


(c) *Certain corporate transactions*—(1) *Limitation on amount of gain.* Under section 1251(d)(3), upon a transfer of property described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income by the transferor under section 1251(c)(1) shall not exceed an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the amount of gain recognized to the transferor on the transfer (determined without regard to section 1251) over (ii) the amount (if any) of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1245(a)(1). For purposes of this subparagraph, the principles of paragraph (c)(1) of § 1.1245-4 shall apply. Thus, in case of a transfer of both farm recapture property and property other than farm recapture property in a single transaction, the amount realized from the disposition of the farm recapture property (as determined in a manner consistent with the principles of paragraph (a)(5) of § 1.1245-1) shall be deemed to consist of that portion of the fair market value of each property acquired which bears the same ratio to the fair market value of such acquired property as the amount realized from the disposition of farm recapture property bears to the total amount realized. The preceding sentence shall be applied solely for purposes of computing the portion of the total gain (determined without regard to section 1251) which is eligible to be recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1). Section 1251(d)(3) does not apply to a disposition of property to an organization (other than a cooperative described in section 521) which is exempt from the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code.


(2) *Transfers covered.* The transfers referred to in subparagraphs (1) of this paragraph are transfers of farm recapture property in which the basis of such property in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor by reason of the application of any of the following provisions:


(i) Section 332 (relating to distributions in complete liquidation of an 80-percent-or-more controlled subsidiary corporation). For the application of section 1251(d)(3) to such a complete liquidation, the principles of paragraph (c)(3) of § 1.1245-4 shall apply. Thus, for example, the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph do not apply to a liquidating distribution of farm recapture property by an 80-percent-or-more controlled subsidiary to its parent if the parent's basis for the property is determined, under section 334(b)(2), by reference to its basis for the stock of the subsidiary.


(ii) Section 351 (relating to transfer to corporation controlled by transferor).


(iii) Section 351 (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain corporate reorganizations).


(iv) Section 371(a) (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain receivership and bankruptcy proceedings).


(v) Section 374(a) (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain railroad reorganizations).


(3) *Partnerships.* For the application of section 1251 to partnerships, see paragraph (e) of this section.


(4) *Treatment of land in hands of transferee.* See paragraph (g) of this section for treatment of transferee in the case of a disposition of land to which this paragraph applies.


(5) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(d) *Limitation for like kind exchanges and involuntary conversions*—(1) *General rule.* Under section 1251(d)(4), if farm recapture property is disposed of and gain (determined without regard to section 1251) is not recognized in whole or in part under section 1031 (relating to like kind exchanges) or section 1033 (relating to involuntary conversions), then the amount of gain recognized as ordinary income by the transferor under section 1251(c)(1) shall not exceed an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the amount of gain recognized on such disposition (determined without regard to section 1251) or (ii) the amount (if any) of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1245(a)(1).


(2) *Examples.* The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(3) *Application to single disposition of farm recapture property of one class and property of different class.* (i) If upon a sale of farm recapture property of one class gain would be recognized under section 1251(c)(1), and if such farm recapture property together with property of a different class or classes is disposed of in a single transaction in which gain is not recognized in whole or in part under section 1031 (without regard to section 1251(c)(1), then rules consistent with the principles of paragraph (d)(6) of § 1.1250-3 (relating to gain from disposition of certain depreciable realty) shall apply for purposes of allocating the amount realized to each of the classes of property disposed of and for purposes of determining what property the amount realized for each class consists of.


(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the classes of property other than farm recapture property are (*a*) section 1245 property, (*b*) section 1250 property, and (*c*) other property.


(iii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the classes of farm recapture property are (*a*) hand, (*b*) farm recapture property other than land which is section 1245 property and (*c*) farm recapture property other than land which is not section 1245 property.


(4) *Treatment of land received in like kind exchange or involuntary conversion.* The aggregate of the deductions allowed under sections 175 and 182 in respect of land acquired in a transaction described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall include the aggregate of the deductions allowable under sections 175 and 182 in respect of the land transferred or converted (as the case may be) in such transaction minus the amount of gain taken into account under sections 1251(c) and 1252(a) with respect to the land transferred or converted. Upon a subsequent disposition of such land, such deductions shall be treated as having been allowable in the same taxable year as they were allowable with respect to the land transferred or converted.


(e) *Partnerships.* [Reserved]


(f) *Property transferred to controlled corporation.* [Reserved]


(g) *Treatment of land received by a transferee in a disposition by gift and certain tax-free transactions*—(1) *General rule.* If farm recapture property which is land is disposed of in a transaction which is either a gift to which paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies or a completely tax-free transfer to which section 1251(b)(5)(A) applies, then for purposes of section 1251:


(i) The aggregate of the deductions allowable under sections 175 and 182 in respect of the land in the hands of the transferee immediately after the disposition shall be an amount equal to the aggregate of such deductions for the taxable year and the four preceding taxable years in the hands of the transferor immediately before the disposition,


(ii) Upon a subsequent disposition by the transferee (including a computation of potential gain as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of § 1.1251-1), such deductions in the hands of the transferee shall be treated as having been allowable with respect to the transferee in the same taxable year they were allowable to the transferor, and


(iii) If the taxable years of the transferor and transferee regularly end on different dates, then the aggregate of such deductions allowable for taxable year with respect to the transferor shall be treated in the hands of the transferee as allowable in the transferee's taxable year in which the taxable year of the transferor regularly ends.


(2) *Certain partially tax-free transfers.* If farm recapture property which is land is disposed of in a transaction which either is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift to which paragraph (a)(2) of this section applies, or is a partially tax-free transfer to which section 1251(b)(5)(A) applies, then for purposes of section 1251:


(i) The amount determined under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph shall be reduced by the amount of gain taken into account under sections 1251(c) and 1252(a) to the extent such gain is attributable to the sections 175 and 182 deductions for the taxable year and the preceding four taxable years (determined by attributing gain under section 1252(a) to the oldest years first) by the transferor upon the disposition, and


(ii) For purposes of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, the amount of such gain recognized under sections 1251(c) and 1252(a) shall reduce the aggregate of deductions allowable under sections 175 and 182 for the taxable year and each of the preceding four taxable years on a pro rata basis.


(3) *Examples.* The provisions of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:
