# § 1.1252-1   General rule for treatment of gain from disposition of farm land.

(a) *Ordinary income*—(1) *General rule.* (i) Except as otherwise provided in this section and § 1.1252-2, if farm land is disposed of during a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, then under section 1252(a)(1) there shall be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of property which is neither a capital asset nor property described in section 1231 (that is, shall be recognized as ordinary income) the lower of:


(*a*) The applicable percentage of the amount computed in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, or


(*b*) The amount computed in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph.


(ii) The amount computed in this subdivision is an amount equal to:


(*a*) The aggregate of the deductions allowed, in any taxable year any day of which falls within the period the taxpayer held (or is considered to have held) the farm land, under sections 175 (relating to soil and water conservation expenditures) and 182 (relating to expenditures by farmers for clearing land) for expenditures paid or incurred after December 31, 1969, with respect to the farm land disposed of, minus


(*b*) The amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) (relating to gain from disposition of property used in farming where farm losses offset nonfarm income) upon such disposition of such land.


(iii) The amount computed in this subdivision is an amount equal to:


(*a*) The gain realized, that is, the excess of the amount realized (in the case of a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion) or the fair market value of the farm land (in the case of any other disposition), over the adjusted basis of the farm land, minus


(*b*) The amount of gain recognized as ordinary income under section 1251(c)(1) upon such disposition of such land.


(iv) If a deduction under section 175 is allowed in respect of the farm land disposed of for a taxable year every day of which falls within the period after the taxpayer held (or is considered to have held) the farm land, and if the deduction is attributable to expenditures paid or incurred after December 31, 1969, with respect to such land during the period the taxpayer held (or is considered to have held) the land, then the amount of such deduction shall be applied to increase the amount computed (without regard to this subdivision) under subdivision (ii)(*a*) of this subparagraph.


(2) *Application of section.* Any gain treated as ordinary income under section 1252(a)(1) shall be recognized as ordinary income notwithstanding any other provision of subtitle A of the Code. For special rules with respect to the application of section 1252, see § 1.1252-2. For the relation of section 1252 to other provisions see paragraph (d) of this section.


(3) *Meaning of terms.* For purposes of section 1252:


(i) The term *farm land* means any land with respect to which deductions have been allowed under section 175 or 182. See section 1252(a)(2).


(ii) The period for which farm land shall be considered to be held shall be determined under section 1223.


(iii) The term *disposition* shall have the same meaning as in paragraph (a)(3) of § 1.1245-1.


(iv) The applicable percentage shall be determined as follows:


(4) *Portion of parcel.* The amount of gain to be recognized as ordinary income under section 1252(a)(1) shall be determined separately for each parcel of farm land in a manner consistent with the principles of subparagraphs (4) and (5) of § 1.1245-1(a) (relating to gain from disposition of certain depreciable property). If (i) only a portion of a parcel of farm land is disposed of in a transaction, or if two or more portions of a single parcel are disposed of in one transaction, and (ii) the aggregate of the deductions allowed under sections 175 and 182 with respect to any such portion cannot be established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner or his delegate, then the aggregate of the deductions in respect of the entire parcel shall be allocated to each portion in proportion to the fair market value of each at the time of the disposition.


(b) *Instances of non-application*—(1) *In general.* Section 1252 does not apply if a taxpayer disposes of farm land for which the holding period is in excess of 9 years or with respect to which no deductions have been allowed under sections 175 and 182.


(2) *Losses.* Section 1252(a)(1) does not apply to losses. Thus, section 1252(a)(1) does not apply if a loss is realized upon a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of property, all of which is farm land, nor does the section apply to a disposition of such property other than by way of sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion if at the time of the disposition the fair market value of such property is not greater than its adjusted basis.


(c) *Treatment of partnerships and partners.* [Reserved]


(d) *Relation of section 1252 to other provisions*—(1) *General.* The provisions of section 1252 apply notwithstanding any other provisions of subtitle A of the Code. Thus, unless an exception or limitation under § 1.1252-2 applies, gain under section 1252(a)(1) is recognized notwithstanding any contrary nonrecognition provision or income characterizing provision. For example, since section 1252 overrides section 1231 (relating to property used in the trade or business), the gain recognized under section 1252(a)(1) upon a disposition of farm land will be treated as ordinary income and only the remaining gain, if any, from the disposition may be considered as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset if section 1231 is applicable. See example (1) of paragraph (e) of this section.


(2) *Nonrecognition sections overridden.* The nonrecognition of gain provisions of subtitle A of the Code which section 1252 overrides include, but are not limited to, sections 267(d), 311(a), 336, 337, and 512(b)(5). See § 1.1252-2 for the extent to which section 1252(a)(1) overrides sections 332, 351, 361, 371(a), 374(a), 721, 731, 1031, and 1033.


(3) *Installment method.* Gain from a disposition to which section 1252(a)(1) applies may be reported under the installment method if such method is otherwise available under section 453 of the Code. In such case, the income (other than interest) on each installment payment shall (i) first be deemed to consist of gain to which section 1251(c)(1) applies (if applicable) until all such gain has been reported, (ii) the next portion (if any) of such income shall be deemed to consist of gain to which section 1252(a)(1) applies until all such gain has been reported, and (iii) finally the remaining portion (if any) of such income shall be deemed to consist of gain to which neither section 1251(c)(1) nor 1252(a)(1) applies. For treatment of amounts as interest on certain deferred payments, see section 483.


(4) *Exempt income.* With regard to exempt income, the principles of paragraph (e) of § 1.1245-6 shall be applicable.


(5) *Treatment of gain not recognized under section 1252(a)(1).* For treatment of gain not recognized under this section, the principles of paragraph (f) of § 1.1245-6 shall be applicable.


(e) *Examples.* The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:
