# § 1.1256(e)-1   Identification of hedging transactions.

(a) *Identification and recordkeeping requirements.* Under section 1256(e)(2), a taxpayer that enters into a hedging transaction must identify the transaction as a hedging transaction before the close of the day on which the taxpayer enters into the transaction. 


(b) *Requirements for identification.* The identification of a hedging transaction for purposes of section 1256(e)(2) must satisfy the requirements of § 1.1221-2(f)(1). Solely for purposes of section 1256(f)(1), however, an identification that does not satisfy all of the requirements of § 1.1221-2(f)(1) is nevertheless treated as an identification under section 1256(e)(2). 


(c) *Consistency with § 1.1221-2.* Any identification for purposes of § 1.1221-2(f)(1) is also an identification for purposes of this section. If a taxpayer satisfies the requirements of § 1.1221-2(g)(1)(ii), the transaction is treated as if it were not identified as a hedging transaction for purposes of section 1256(e)(2). 


(d) *Effective date.* The rules of this section apply to transactions entered into on or after March 20, 2002.
