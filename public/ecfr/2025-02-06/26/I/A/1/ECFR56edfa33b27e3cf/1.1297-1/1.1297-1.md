# § 1.1297-1   Definition of passive foreign investment company.

(a) *Overview.* This section provides rules concerning the income test set forth in section 1297(a)(1) and the asset test set forth in section 1297(a)(2). Paragraph (b) of this section provides a rule relating to the definition of gross income with respect to certain dividends that are excluded from gross income under section 1502 for purposes of section 1297. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules relating to the definition of passive income for purposes of section 1297. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules relating to the asset test of section 1297. See §§ 1.1297-2 and 1.1297-6 for additional rules concerning the treatment of the income and assets of a corporation subject to look-through treatment under section 1297(c). Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules relating to the determination of passive foreign investment company (PFIC) status for stapled entities. Paragraph (f) of this section provides definitions applicable for this section, and paragraph (g) of this section provides the applicability date of this section.


(b) *Dividends included in gross income*—(1) *General rule.* For purposes of section 1297, gross income includes dividends that are excluded from gross income under section 1502 and § 1.1502-13.


(2) *Example*—(i) *Facts.* USP is a domestic corporation that owns 30% of TFC, a foreign corporation. The remaining 70% of TFC is owned by FP, a foreign corporation that is unrelated to USP. TFC owns 25% of the value of USS1, a domestic corporation. USS1 owns 80% of the value of USS2, a domestic corporation. USS1 and USS2 are members of an affiliated group (as defined in section 1504(a)) filing a consolidated return. USS2 distributes a dividend to USS1 that is excluded from USS1's income pursuant to § 1.1502-13 for purposes of determining the U.S. Federal income tax liability of the affiliated group of which USS1 and USS2 are members.


(ii) *Results.* Although the dividend received by USS1 from USS2 is excluded from USS1's income for purposes of determining the U.S. Federal income tax liability of the affiliated group of which USS1 and USS2 are members, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, for purposes of section 1297, USS1's gross income includes the USS2 dividend. Accordingly, for purposes of section 1297, TFC's gross income includes 25% of the dividend received by USS1 from USS2 pursuant to section 1297(c) and § 1.1297-2(b)(2)(ii). See section 1298(b)(7) and § 1.1298-4 for rules concerning the characterization of the USS2 dividend.


(c) *Passive income*—(1) *Foreign personal holding company income*—(i) *General rule.* For purposes of section 1297(b)(1), except as otherwise provided in section 1297(b)(2), this section, and § 1.1297-6, the term *passive income* means income of a kind that would be foreign personal holding company income as defined under section 954(c). For the purpose of this paragraph (c)(1)—


(A) The exceptions to foreign personal holding company income in section 954(c)(1), 954(c)(2)(A) (relating to active rents and royalties), 954(c)(2)(B) (relating to export financing income), and 954(c)(2)(C) (relating to dealers) are taken into account;


(B) The exceptions in section 954(c)(3) (relating to certain income received from related persons), 954(c)(6) (relating to certain amounts received from related controlled foreign corporations), and 954(i) (relating to entities engaged in the active conduct of an insurance business) are not taken into account;


(C) The rules in section 954(c)(4) (relating to sales of certain partnership interests) and 954(c)(5) (relating to certain commodity hedging transactions) are taken into account; and


(D) An entity is treated as a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957(a) for purposes of applying an exception to foreign personal holding company income in section 954(c)(1)(B)'s flush language, (1)(C)(ii), (1)(D), (4), and (5) and § 1.954-2 and for purposes of identifying whether a person is a related person with respect to such entity within the meaning of section 954(d)(3).


(ii) *Determination of gross income or gain on a net basis for certain items of foreign personal holding company income.* For purposes of section 1297, the excess of gains over losses from property transactions described in section 954(c)(1)(B), the excess of gains over losses from transactions in commodities described in section 954(c)(1)(C), the excess of foreign currency gains over foreign currency losses described in section 954(c)(1)(D), and positive net income from notional principal contracts described in section 954(c)(1)(F) are taken into account as gross income. The excess of gains over losses (or, with respect to notional principal contracts, positive net income) for a category of transactions is calculated by a tested foreign corporation taking into account individual items of gain or loss (or, with respect to notional principal contracts, net income or net deduction) recognized by the tested foreign corporation and those items of gain or loss (or, with respect to notional principal contracts, net income or net deduction) treated as recognized by the tested foreign corporation with respect to its look-through subsidiaries and look-through partnerships pursuant to section 1297(c) and § 1.1297-2(b)(2) or (3).


(iii) *Amounts treated as dividends.* For purposes of section 1297, the term dividend includes all amounts treated as dividends for purposes of this chapter, including amounts treated as dividends pursuant to sections 302, 304, 356(a)(2), 964(e), and 1248.


(2) [Reserved]


(3) *Passive treatment of dividends and distributive share of partnership income.* For purposes of section 1297, a tested foreign corporation's share of dividends received from a corporation that is not a look-through subsidiary (as defined in § 1.1297-2(g)(3)) and distributive share of any item of income of a partnership that is not a look-through partnership (as defined in § 1.1297-2(g)(4)) with respect to a tested foreign corporation are treated as passive income, except to the extent that the item of income would not be treated as passive under section 1297(b)(2)(C) and paragraph (c)(4) of this section.


(4) *Exception for certain interest, dividends, rents, and royalties received from a related person*—(i) *In general.* For purposes of section 1297(b)(2)(C), interest, dividends, rents, or royalties actually received or accrued by a tested foreign corporation are considered received or accrued from a related person only if the payor of the interest, dividend, rent, or royalty is a related person (within the meaning of section 954(d)(3)) with respect to the tested foreign corporation, taking into account paragraph (c)(1)(i)(D) of this section. For rules determining when amounts received or accrued by a look-through subsidiary or look-through partnership (and treated as received directly by a tested foreign corporation pursuant to section 1297(c) and § 1.1297-2(b)(2) and (b)(3)) are treated as received from a related person, see § 1.1297-2(d).


(ii) *Ordering rule.* Gross income that is interest, a dividend, or a rent or royalty that is, in each case, received or accrued from a related person is allocated to income that is not passive under the rules of this paragraph (c)(4). If the related person is also a look-through subsidiary or a look-through partnership with respect to the tested foreign corporation, this paragraph (c)(4) applies after the application of the intercompany income rules of § 1.1297-2(c).


(iii) *Allocation of interest.* For purposes of section 1297(b)(2)(C), interest that is received or accrued, as applicable based on the recipient's method of accounting, from a related person is allocated to income of the related person that is not passive income in proportion to the ratio of the portion of the related person's non-passive gross income for its taxable year that ends with or within the taxable year of the recipient to the total amount of the related person's gross income for the taxable year. If the related person does not have gross income for the taxable year that ends with or within the taxable year of the recipient, the interest is either allocated to income of the related person that is not passive income to the extent the related person's deduction for the interest would be allocable to non-passive income of the related person under the principles of §§ 1.861-9 through 1.861-13T, applied in a reasonable and consistent manner taking into account the general operation of the PFIC rules and the purpose of section 1297(b)(2)(C) or, alternatively, at the election of the tested foreign corporation is treated as allocated entirely to passive income.


(iv) *Allocation of dividends*—(A) *In general.* For purposes of section 1297(b)(2)(C), the principles of § 1.316-2(a) apply in determining from what year's earnings and profits a dividend from a related person is treated as distributed. A dividend is considered to be distributed, first, out of the earnings and profits of the taxable year of the related person that includes the date the dividend is distributed (current earnings and profits) and that ends with or within the taxable year of the recipient; second, out of the earnings and profits accumulated for the immediately preceding taxable year of the related person; third, out of the earnings and profits accumulated for the second preceding taxable year of the related person; and so forth. For purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, the principles of § 1.243-4(a)(6) apply with respect to a deficit in an earnings and profits account for a prior year.


(B) *Dividends paid out of current earnings and profits.* To the extent that a dividend is paid out of current earnings and profits of the related person for its taxable year that ends with or within the taxable year of the recipient, the dividend is treated as paid ratably out of earnings and profits attributable to passive income and to non-passive income. The portion of the current earnings and profits that is treated as paid out of non-passive income of the related person may be determined by multiplying the current earnings and profits by the ratio of the related person's non-passive gross income as determined under this section (including paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section) for the taxable year to its total gross income as determined under this section (including paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section) for that year.


(C) *Dividends paid out of accumulated earnings and profits.* To the extent that a dividend from a related person is treated as paid out of the related person's accumulated earnings and profits, the dividend is treated as paid ratably out of accumulated earnings and profits of the related person for prior taxable years (beginning with the most recently accumulated) that are attributable to passive income and to non-passive income, which may be determined in the same manner as in paragraph (c)(4)(iv)(B) of this section. Alternatively, the accumulated earnings and profits may be allocated based on the ratio of accumulated earnings and profits that are attributable to passive income and to non-passive income during either the related party period or the three-year period. The related party period is the entire period during which the related person was related to the recipient. The three-year period is the three taxable years immediately preceding the related person's taxable year that ends with or within the current taxable year of the recipient. The three-year period may be used only if the related person has been related to the recipient for a period longer than the three taxable years immediately preceding the recipient's taxable year.


(v) *Allocation of rents and royalties.* For purposes of section 1297(b)(2)(C), rents and royalties that are received or accrued, as applicable based on the recipient's method of accounting, from a related person are allocable to income of the related person that is not passive income to the extent the related person's deduction for the rent or royalty is allocable to non-passive gross income of the related person under the principles of §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-14T.


(vi) *Determination of whether amounts are received or accrued from a related person.* For purposes of section 1297(b)(2)(C), the determination of whether interest, dividends, rents, and royalties were received or accrued from a related person is made on the date of the receipt or accrual, as applicable based on the recipient's method of accounting, of the interest, dividend, rent, or royalty.


(vii) *Allocation of distributive share of income from related partnership.* For purposes of section 1297(a)(1), a tested foreign corporation includes its distributive share as provided in section 704 of the separate items of passive or non-passive income from a partnership that is a related person (and not a look-through partnership) with respect to the tested foreign corporation for the taxable year of the tested foreign corporation.


(d) *Asset test*—(1) *Calculation of average annual value (or adjusted bases)*—(i) *General rule.* For purposes of section 1297, the calculation of the average percentage of assets held by a tested foreign corporation during its taxable year that produce passive income or that are held for the production of passive income is determined based on the average of the fair market values, or the average of the adjusted bases, as appropriate, of the passive assets and total assets held (including assets treated as held pursuant to section 1297(c) and § 1.1297-2(b)(2)(i) and (b)(3)) by the foreign corporation on the last day of each measuring period (*measuring date*) of the foreign corporation's taxable year. The average of the fair market values (or the average of the adjusted bases) of the foreign corporation's passive assets or total assets for the taxable year is equal to the sum of the values (or adjusted bases) of the passive assets or total assets, as applicable, on each measuring date of the foreign corporation's taxable year, divided by the number of measuring dates in the taxable year.


(ii) *Measuring period*—(A) *General rule.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the measuring periods for a tested foreign corporation are the four quarters that make up the foreign corporation's taxable year.


(B) *Election to use alternative measuring period.* The average percentage of assets held by a tested foreign corporation during its taxable year that produce passive income or that are held for the production of passive income may be calculated using a period that is shorter than a quarter (such as a week or month). The same period must be used to measure the assets of the foreign corporation for the first year (including a short taxable year) that this alternative measuring period is used, and for any and all subsequent years, unless a revocation is made. An election to use an alternative measuring period or a revocation of such an election must be made in accordance with the rules of paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.


(C) *Short taxable year.* For purposes of applying section 1297 to a tested foreign corporation that has a taxable year of less than twelve months (short taxable year), the average values (or adjusted bases) are determined based on the measuring dates of the foreign corporation's taxable year that fall within the short taxable year, and by treating the last day of the short taxable year as a measuring date.


(iii) *Adjusted basis election.* An election under section 1297(e)(2)(B) with respect to an eligible tested foreign corporation or a revocation of such an election may be made by the tested foreign corporation or alternatively by the owner (as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section). If made by the owner, the election must be made in accordance with the rules of paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.


(iv) *Time and manner of elections and revocations*—(A) *Elections.* An owner (as defined in this paragraph (d)(1)(iv)) of a foreign corporation makes an election described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) or (d)(1)(iii) of this section for a taxable year in the manner provided in the Instructions to Form 8621 (or successor form), if the owner is required to file a Form 8621 (or successor form) with respect to the foreign corporation for the taxable year of the owner in which or with which the taxable year of the foreign corporation for which the election is made ends. If the owner is not required to file Form 8621 (or successor form) with respect to the foreign corporation for the taxable year, the owner makes such an election by filing a written statement providing for the election and attaching the statement to an original or amended Federal income tax return for the taxable year of the owner in which or with which the taxable year of the foreign corporation for which the election is made ends clearly indicating that such election has been made. An election can be made by an owner only if the owner's taxable year for which the election is made, and all taxable years that are affected by the election, are not closed by the period of limitations on assessments under section 6501. Elections described in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(B) and (d)(1)(iii) of this section are not eligible for relief under § 301.9100-3 of this chapter. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1)(iv), an owner of a foreign corporation is a United States person that is eligible under § 1.1295-1(d) to make a section 1295 election with respect to the foreign corporation, or would be eligible under § 1.1295-1(d) to make a section 1295 election if the foreign corporation were a PFIC.


(B) *Revocations and subsequent elections.* An election described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) or (d)(1)(iii) of this section made pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(iv)(A) of this section is effective for the taxable year of the foreign corporation for which it is made and all subsequent taxable years of such corporation unless revoked by the Commissioner or the owner (as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(iv)(A) of this section) of the foreign corporation. The owner of a foreign corporation may revoke such an election at any time. If an election described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) or (d)(1)(iii) of this section has been revoked under this paragraph (d)(1)(iv)(B), a new election described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) or (d)(1)(iii) of this section, as applicable, cannot be made until the sixth taxable year following the year for which the previous election was revoked, and such subsequent election cannot be revoked until the sixth taxable year following the year for which the subsequent election was made. The owner revokes the election for a taxable year in the manner provided in the Instructions to Form 8621 (or successor form), if the owner is required to file a Form 8621 (or successor form) with respect to the foreign corporation for the taxable year of the owner in which or with which the taxable year of the foreign corporation for which the election is revoked ends, or by filing a written statement providing for the revocation and attaching the statement to an original or amended Federal income tax return for the taxable year of the owner in which or with which the taxable year of the foreign corporation for which the election is revoked ends clearly indicating that such election has been revoked, if the owner is not required to file Form 8621 (or successor form) with respect to the foreign corporation for the taxable year.


(v) *Method of measuring assets*—(A) *Publicly traded foreign corporations.* For purposes of section 1297, the assets of a publicly traded foreign corporation as defined in paragraph (f)(7) of this section (including assets treated as held pursuant to section 1297(c) and § 1.1297-2(b)(2)(i) and (b)(3)(i), other than assets of a look-through subsidiary described in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(B) of this section) must be measured for all measuring periods of the taxable year on the basis of value.


(B) *Non-publicly traded controlled foreign corporation*—(*1*) *In general.* For purposes of section 1297, the assets of a controlled foreign corporation that is not described in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(A) of this section (including assets treated as held pursuant to section 1297(c) and § 1.1297-2(b)(2)(i) and (b)(3)(i), other than assets held by a look-through subsidiary described in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(A) of this section) must be measured for all measuring periods of the taxable year during which the foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation on the basis of adjusted basis.


(*2*) *Controlled foreign corporation determination.* For purposes of section 1297(e)(2)(A) and this paragraph (d)(1)(v), the term *controlled foreign corporation* has the meaning provided in section 957, determined without applying subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of section 318(a)(3) so as to consider a United States person as owning stock which is owned by a person who is not a United States person.


(C) *Other foreign corporations*—(*1*) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(C)(*2*) of this section, the assets of a foreign corporation that is not described in paragraphs (d)(1)(v)(A) or (d)(1)(v)(B) of this section (including assets treated as held pursuant to section 1297(c) and § 1.1297-2(b)(2)(i) and (b)(3)(i), other than assets held by a look-through subsidiary described in paragraphs (d)(1)(v)(A) or (d)(1)(v)(B) of this section) are measured for all measuring periods of the taxable year on the basis of value, unless a tested foreign corporation or a shareholder makes an election under section 1297(e)(2)(B) in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section. In the case of a foreign corporation that is described in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(B) of this section for some but not all measuring periods during a taxable year, this paragraph (d)(1)(v)(C)(*1*) applies to the remaining measuring period or periods during that taxable year.


(*2*) *Lower-tier subsidiaries*—(*i*) *Lower-tier subsidiaries that are publicly traded foreign corporations.* For purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to the assets of a foreign corporation that is a lower-tier subsidiary of a foreign corporation that directly or indirectly owns all or part of the lower-tier subsidiary (a parent foreign corporation), if the lower-tier subsidiary is described in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(A), the rules of paragraph (d)(1)(v)(A) apply. The previous sentence applies both for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to the lower-tier subsidiary as a tested foreign corporation, and for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to a parent foreign corporation with respect to the assets of the lower-tier subsidiary.


(*ii*) *Lower-tier subsidiaries that are non-publicly traded controlled foreign corporations.* For purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to the assets of a foreign corporation that is a lower-tier subsidiary of a parent foreign corporation, if the lower-tier subsidiary is described in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(B), the rules of paragraph (d)(1)(v)(B) apply. The previous sentence applies both for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to the lower-tier subsidiary as a tested foreign corporation, and for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to a parent foreign corporation with respect to the assets of the lower-tier subsidiary.


(*iii*) *Other lower-tier subsidiaries.* For purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to a foreign corporation that is a lower-tier subsidiary of a parent foreign corporation, if the lower-tier subsidiary is not described in paragraphs (d)(1)(v)(A) or (d)(1)(v)(B) of this section, the assets of the lower-tier subsidiary (including assets treated as held pursuant to section 1297(c) and § 1.1297-2(b)(2)(i) and (b)(3)(i)) must be measured under the rules of the same paragraph of this section (d)(1)(v) that applies to the parent foreign corporation. The previous sentence applies both for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to the lower-tier subsidiary as a tested foreign corporation, and for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to a parent foreign corporation. If a tested foreign corporation indirectly owns a lower-tier subsidiary that is not described in paragraphs (d)(1)(v)(A) or (d)(1)(v)(B) of this section through one or more other foreign corporations, the status of any parent foreign corporation in that chain of corporations that is described in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(A) of this section, or if there is no such parent foreign corporation then the status of any parent foreign corporation in that chain of corporations that is described in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(B) of this section, determines the basis on which the assets of the lower-tier subsidiary are measured. In the case of a foreign corporation that is a lower-tier subsidiary with respect to more than one parent foreign corporation, this rule applies separately to measure the assets of the lower-tier subsidiary with respect to each parent foreign corporation.


(D) [Reserved]


(E) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (d)(1)(v).


(*1*) *Example 1*—(*i*) *Facts.* USP, a domestic corporation, owns 60% of TFC1, which is a foreign corporation. The remaining 40% of TFC1's stock is regularly traded on a national securities exchange that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and continues to be until September 1 of the taxable year, when USP acquires all of TFC1's stock pursuant to a tender offer. TFC1 owns 30% of the stock of FS1, a foreign corporation that is neither a publicly traded foreign corporation nor a controlled foreign corporation.


(*ii*) *Results.* TFC1 is a controlled foreign corporation with respect to USP. TFC1 also is a publicly traded foreign corporation until September 1 of the taxable year. For purposes of section 1297, the assets of TFC1 (including the assets of FS1 treated as held by TFC1 pursuant to section 1297(c) and § 1.1297-2(b)(2)(i)) must be measured on the basis of value for each measuring period ending before September 1, pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(v)(A) of this section. For purposes of applying section 1297 to FS1 as a tested foreign corporation with respect to USP, the assets of FS1 must be measured using the same method as is used for TFC1's assets, pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(v)(C)(*2*) of this section.


(*2*) *Example 2*—(*i*) *Facts.* A, a United States person, owns 1% of the stock of TFC2, a foreign corporation that is neither a publicly traded foreign corporation nor a controlled foreign corporation. TFC2 owns 25% of the stock of FS2, a foreign corporation that is neither a publicly traded foreign corporation nor a controlled foreign corporation.


(*ii*) *Results.* For purposes of applying section 1297 to TFC2, the assets of TFC2 (including the assets of FS2 treated as held by TFC2 pursuant to section 1297(c) and § 1.1297-2(b)(2)(i)) are measured for all measuring periods of the taxable year on the basis of value, unless A or TFC2 makes an election under section 1297(e)(2)(B) in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(v)(C)(*1*) of this section. For purposes of applying section 1297 to FS2 as a tested foreign corporation with respect to A, the assets of FS2 must be measured using the same method as is used for TFC2's assets, pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(v)(C)(*2*) of this section.


(*3*) *Example 3*—(*i*) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(E)(*2*)(*i*) (the facts in Example 2), except that the 75% of FS2's stock not owned by TFC2 is owned by TFC3, a publicly traded foreign corporation that is neither related to TFC2 nor to A. B, a United States person that is neither related to A nor to TFC2, owns 1% of the stock of TFC3.


(*ii*) *Results.* For purposes of applying section 1297 to TFC2, the results are the same as in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(E)(*2*)(*ii*) (the results in Example 2). For purposes of applying section 1297 to FS2 as a tested foreign corporation with respect to A, the assets of FS2 must be measured using the same method as is used for TFC2's assets, pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(v)(C)(*2*) of this section. For purposes of applying section 1297 to TFC3, the assets of TFC3 must be measured by reference to value pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(v)(A) because it is a publicly traded corporation. For purposes of applying section 1297 to FS2 as a tested foreign corporation with respect to B, the assets of FS2 must be measured by reference to value because TFC3 is a publicly traded foreign corporation, pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1)(v)(C)(*2*) and (d)(1)(v)(A) of this section.


(2) [Reserved] 


(3) *Dual-character assets*—(i) *General rule.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) or (d)(3)(iii) of this section and in § 1.1297-2(c), for purposes of section 1297, an asset (or portion of an asset) that produces both passive income and non-passive income during a taxable year (dual-character asset), including stock and other assets that produce passive and non-passive income under section 1297(b)(2)(C) and paragraph (c)(4) of this section, is treated as two assets for each measuring period in the taxable year, one of which is a passive asset and one of which is a non-passive asset. The value (or adjusted basis) of the dual-character asset is allocated between the passive asset and the non-passive asset in proportion to the relative amounts of passive income and non-passive income produced by the asset (or portion of an asset) during the taxable year. See paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section for a special rule concerning stock that has previously produced dividends subject to the exception provided in section 1297(b)(2)(C). For purposes of section 1297(b)(2)(C), a partnership interest in a partnership that is a related person to the tested foreign corporation is treated as producing passive or non-passive income in proportion to the tested foreign corporation's distributive share of partnership passive or non-passive income for the taxable year under paragraph (c)(4)(vii) of this section.


(ii) *Special rule when only part of an asset produces income.* For purposes of section 1297, when only a portion of an asset produces income during a taxable year or a portion of a taxable year, the asset is treated as two assets for that period, one of which is characterized as a passive asset or a non-passive asset based on the income that it produces, and one of which is characterized based on the income that it is held to produce. The value (or adjusted basis) of the asset is allocated between the two assets pursuant to the method that most reasonably reflects the uses of the property. In the case of real property, an allocation based on the physical use of the property generally is the most reasonable method.


(iii) *Special rule for stock that previously produced income that was excluded from passive income under section 1297(b)(2)(C).* Stock with respect to which no dividends are received during a taxable year, but with respect to which dividends were received during one or both of the prior two taxable years, is characterized based on the relative portion of the dividends received that was passive or non-passive. If the dividends were in whole excluded from passive income under section 1297(b)(2)(C) and paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, the stock is treated as a single non-passive asset. If the dividends were in part excluded from passive income under section 1297(b)(2)(C) and paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, the stock is treated as two assets, one of which is a passive asset and one of which is a non-passive asset. The value (or adjusted basis) of the stock is allocated between the two assets in proportion to the average percentage of aggregate dividends received in the prior two taxable years that were characterized as passive income and the average percentage of aggregate dividends received in the prior two years that were characterized as non-passive income, for the previous two taxable years pursuant to section 1297(b)(2)(C) and paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section. If the tested foreign corporation did not receive any dividends from the stock for the current taxable year or within either of the prior two taxable years of the tested foreign corporation, then the stock is treated as a passive asset.


(iv) *Example.* The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (d)(3).


(A) *Facts.* (*1*) USP is a domestic corporation that owns 30% of TFC, a foreign corporation. The remaining 70% of TFC is owned by FP, a foreign corporation that is unrelated to USP. TFC owns 20% of the value of FS1, a foreign corporation, and FP owns the remaining 80% of the value of FS1. FP, TFC, and FS1 are not controlled foreign corporations within the meaning of section 957(a), and each has a calendar year taxable year.


(*2*) In Year 1, FS1 had current earnings and profits of $1000x, attributable to passive income of $500x and non-passive income of $500x, and paid $300x of dividends to TFC. In Year 2, FS1 had current earnings and profits of $1000x, attributable to passive income of $100x and non-passive income of $900x, and paid $100x of dividends to TFC. In Year 3, FS1 has passive income of $200x and non-passive income of $800x and does not pay a dividend.


(*3*) Throughout Year 3, TFC holds an obligation of FS1 with respect to which FS1 pays $100x of interest.


(*4*) In addition to the stock in FS1 and the FS1 obligation, TFC holds an office building, 40% of which is rented to FP throughout Year 3 for $100x per quarter. During Year 3, FP has only passive income. The remaining 60% of the office building is leased throughout Year 3 to an unrelated person for $300x per quarter, and TFC's own officers or staff of employees regularly perform active and substantial management and operational functions while the property is leased.


(B) *Results.* (*1*) For purposes of section 1297(b)(2)(C), FP is a “related person” with respect to TFC because FP owns more than 50% of the vote or value of TFC, and FS1 is a “related person” with respect to TFC because FP owns more than 50% of the vote or value of both TFC and of FS1.


(*2*) Under paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, the dividends paid by FS1 in Year 1 were characterized as 50% passive income ($150x) and 50% non-passive income ($150x). Under paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, the dividends paid by FS1 in Year 2 were characterized as 10% passive income ($10x) and 90% non-passive income ($90x). Accordingly, the average percentage of dividends for the previous two taxable years that were characterized as passive income is 40% (((10% × $100x) + (50% × $300x))/($100x + $300x)), and the average percentage of dividends characterized as non-passive income is 60% (((90% × $100x) + (50% × $300x))/($100x + $300x)). Thus, under paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, 60% of each share of stock of FS1 is characterized as a non-passive asset and 40% is characterized as a passive asset for each quarter of Year 3 for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to determine whether TFC is a PFIC.


(*3*) Under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, the interest received by TFC from FS1 is characterized as 20% ($200x/($200x + $800x)) passive income and thus 80% non-passive income for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(1) to determine whether TFC is a PFIC. Accordingly, under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, 20% of the obligation of FS1 is characterized as a passive asset and 80% as a non-passive asset for each quarter of Year 3 for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to determine whether TFC is a PFIC.


(*4*) Under paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section, the rent received from FP throughout Year 3 is characterized as 100% passive income. Under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section and section 954(c)(2)(A), the rent received from the unrelated person is characterized as 100% non-passive income. Accordingly, under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the 40% of the office building rented to FP has a value of 25% (($100x × 4)/(($100x × 4) + ($300x × 4))) of the value of the office building and that 25% is a passive asset, and the 60% of the office building rented to the unrelated person has a value of 75% (($300x × 4)/(($100x × 4) + ($300x × 4))) of the value of the office building and is a non-passive asset for purposes of applying section 1297(a)(2) to determine whether TFC is a PFIC.


(4) *Passive treatment of stock and partnership interests.* For purposes of section 1297(a)(2), shares of stock in a corporation that is not a look-through subsidiary (as defined in § 1.1297-2(g)(3)) and partnership interests in a partnership that is not a look-through partnership (as defined in § 1.1297-2(g)(4)) with respect to a tested foreign corporation for a taxable year or portion thereof are treated as passive assets for the taxable year or relevant portion thereof, except to the extent the stock or partnership interest is treated as a dual-character asset under section 1297(b)(2)(C) and paragraph (d)(3) of this section because it produces both passive and non-passive income, or the stock or partnership interest produces solely non-passive income for the taxable year under section 1297(b)(2)(C) and paragraph (c)(4) of this section or under paragraph (d)(5) of this section.


(5) *Dealer property.* For purposes of section 1297(a)(2), an asset that produces, or would produce upon disposition, income or gain that is, or would be, excluded from passive income pursuant to section 954(c)(2)(C) is treated as a non-passive asset.


(e) *Stapled stock.* If a United States person that would be a shareholder (within the meaning of § 1.1291-1(b)(7) and (b)(8)) of a stapled entity (as defined in section 269B(c)(2)) owns stock in all entities that are stapled entities with respect to each other and the shares are stapled interests (as defined in section 269B(c)(3)), the United States person's interests in the stapled entities are treated as an interest in a single entity that holds all of the assets of the stapled entities, conducts all of the activities of the stapled entities, and derives all of the income of the stapled entities for all purposes of the PFIC regime.
