# § 1.1561-1   General rules regarding certain tax benefits available to the component members of a controlled group of corporations.

(a) *In general*—(1)—*Limitation.* Part II (section 1561 and following) of subchapter B of chapter 6 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) (part II) provides rules to limit the amounts of certain specified tax benefit items of component members of a controlled group of corporations for their tax years which include a particular December 31st date, or, in the case of a short taxable year member (see section 1561(b) and § 1.1561-2(e)), the date substituted for that December 31st date. The amount of the tax items enumerated in section 1561(a) available to any of the component members of a controlled group shall be determined for purposes of subtitle A of the Code as if the component members were a single corporation. Certain other tax items also set forth in section 1561(a) (for example, the additional tax imposed by section 11(b)(1) and the section 55(d)(3) phase out of the alternative minimum tax exemption amount) will be determined by combining the positive taxable income or positive alternative minimum taxable income of the component members of such a group and then allocating the amount of such items among those members.


(2) *Definitions.* For certain definitions (including the definition of a *controlled group of corporations* and a *component member*) and special rules for purposes of this part II see section 1563.


(b) *Special rules*—(1) *S Corporation.* For purposes of this part II, the term *corporation* includes a small business corporation (as defined in section 1361). However, for the treatment of such a corporation as an *excluded member* of a controlled group of corporations see § 1.1563-1(b)(2)(ii)(C).


(2) *52-53-week taxable year.* In the case of corporations electing a 52-53-week taxable year under section 441(f)(1), the provisions of this part II shall be applied in accordance with the special rule of section 441(f)(2)(A). See § 1.441-2.


(c) *Tax avoidance.* The provisions of this part II do not delimit or abrogate any principle of law established by judicial decision, or any existing provisions of the Code, such as sections 269, 482, and 1551, which serve to prevent any avoidance or evasion of income taxes.


(d) *Effective/applicability date.* This section applies to any tax year beginning on or after December 21, 2009. However, taxpayers may apply this section to any Federal income tax return filed on or after December 21, 2009. For tax years beginning before December 21, 2009, see § 1.1561-1T as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on April 1, 2009.
