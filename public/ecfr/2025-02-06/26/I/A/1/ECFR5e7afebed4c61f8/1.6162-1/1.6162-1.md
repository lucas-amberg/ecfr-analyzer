# § 1.6162-1   Extension of time for payment of tax on gain attributable to liquidation of personal holding companies.

(a) *In general.* (1) If it is shown to the satisfaction of the district director that undue hardship to the taxpayer will result from the payment of such portion of the amount determined as the tax under chapter 1 of the Code by the taxpayer as is attributable to the short-term or long-term capital gain derived by the taxpayer from the receipt by him of property other than money on a complete liquidation of a corporation to which section 331(a)(1) or 342 applies, the district director may grant an extension of time for the payment of such portion of the tax. For the meaning of the term “undue hardship”, see paragraph (b) of § 1.6161-1.


(2) The extension of time for payment shall be for a period not in excess of five years. The extension shall only be granted for a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1956, and shall apply only if the corporation, for its taxable year preceding the year in which occurred the complete liquidation (or the first of the series of distributions in complete liquidation), was, under the law applicable to such taxable year, a personal holding company or a foreign personal holding company.


(b) *Requirement of bond.* As a condition to the granting of an extension of time for payment, the taxpayer will usually be required by the district director to furnish a bond as provided in section 6165 and the regulations thereunder. For other provisions with respect to bonds, see section 7101 and the regulations in part 301 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).
