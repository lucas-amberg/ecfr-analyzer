# § 1.412(c)(3)-1   Reasonable funding methods.

(a) *Introduction*—(1) *In general.* This section prescribes rules for determining whether or not, in the case of an ongoing plan, a funding method is reasonable for purposes of section 412(c)(3). A method is unreasonable only if it is found to be inconsistent with a rule prescribed in this section. The term “reasonable funding method” under this section has the same meaning as the term “acceptable actuarial cost method” under section 3(31) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).


(2) *Computations included in method.* See § 1.412(c)(1)-1(b) for a discussion of matters that are, and are not, included in the funding method of a plan.


(3) *Plans using shortfall.* The shortfall method is a method of determining charges to the funding standard account by adapting the underlying funding method of certain collectively bargained plans in the manner described in § 1.412(c)(1)-2. As such, the shortfall method is a funding method. The underlying method of a plan that uses the shortfall method must be a reasonable funding method under this section. The rules contained in this section, relating to cost under a reasonable funding method, apply in the shortfall method to the annual computation charge under § 1.412(c)(1)-2(d).


(4) *Scope of funding method.* Except for the shortfall method, a reasonable funding method is applied to the computation of—


(i) The normal cost of a plan for a plan year; and, if applicable,


(ii) The bases established under section 412(b)(2)(B), (C), and (D), and (3) (B) (“amortizable bases”).


(b) *General rules for reasonable funding methods*—(1) *Basic funding formula.* At any time, except as provided by the Commissioner, the present value of future benefits under a reasonable funding method must equal the sum of the following amounts:


(i) The present value of normal costs (taking into account future mandatory employee contributions, within the meaning of section 411(c)(2)(C), in the case of a contributory plan) over the future working lifetime of participants;


(ii) The sum of the unamortized portions of amortizable bases, if any, treating credit bases under section 412(b)(3)(B) as negative numbers; and


(iii) The plan assets, decreased by a credit balance (and increased by a debit balance) in the funding standard account under section 412(b). 


(2) *Normal cost.* Normal cost under a reasonable funding method must be expressed as—


(i) A level dollar amount, or a level percentage of pay, that is computed from year to year on either an individual basis or an aggregate basis; or


(ii) An amount equal to the present value of benefits accruing under the method for a particular plan year.


(3) *Application to shortfall.* Paragraph (b)(2) will not fail to be satisfied merely because an amount described in (i) or (ii) is expressed as permitted under the shortfall method.


(c) *Additional requirements*—(1) *Inclusion of all liabilities.* Under a reasonable funding method, all liabilities of the plan for benefits, whether vested or not, must be taken into account.


(2) *Production of experience gains and losses.* If each actuarial assumption is exactly realized under a reasonable funding method, no experience gains or losses are produced.


(3) *Plan population*—(i) *In general.* Under a reasonable funding method, the plan population must include three classes of individuals: participants currently employed in the service of the employer; former participants who either terminated service with the employer, or retired, under the plan; and all other individuals currently entitled to benefits under the plan. See § 1.412(c)(3)-1(d)(2) for rules concerning anticipated future participants.


(ii) *Limited exclusion for certain recent participants.* Under a reasonable funding method, certain individuals may be excluded from the first class of individuals described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section unless otherwise provided by the Commissioner. The excludable individuals are participants who would be excluded from participation by the minimum age or service requirement of section 410 but who, under the terms of the plan, participate immediately upon entering the service of the employer.


(iii) *Special exclusion for “rule of parity” cases.* Under a reasonable funding method, certain individuals may be excluded from the second class of individuals described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section. The excludable individuals are those former participants who have terminated service with the employer without vested benefits and whose service might be taken into account in future years because the “rule of parity” of section 411(a)(6)(D) does not permit that service to be disregarded. However if the plan's experience as to separated employees' returning to service has been such that the exclusion described in this subparagraph would be unreasonable, the exclusion would no longer apply.


(4) *Use of salary scale*—(i) *General acceptability.* The use of a salary scale assumption is not inappropriate merely because of the funding method with which it is used. Therefore, in determining whether actuarial assumptions are reasonable, a salary scale will not be considered to be prohibited merely because a particular funding method is being used. 


(ii) *Projection to appropriate salary.* Under a reasonable funding method, salary scales reflected in projected benefits must be the expected salary on which benefits would be based under the plan at the age when the receipt of benefits is expected to begin.


(5) *Treatment of allocable items.* Under a reasonable funding method that allocates assets to individual participants to determine costs, the allocation of assets among participants must be reasonable. An initial allocation of assets among participants will be considered reasonable only if it is in proportion to related liabilities. However, the Commissioner may determine, based on the facts and circumstances, that it is unreasonable to continue to allocate assets on this basis beyond the initial year. Under a reasonable funding method that allocates liabilities among different elements of past and future service, the allocation of liabilities must be reasonable.


(d) *Prohibited considerations under a reasonable funding method*—(1) *Anticipated benefit changes*—(i) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided by the Commissioner, a reasonable funding method does not anticipate changes in plan benefits that become effective, whether or not retroactively, in a future plan year or that become effective after the first day of, but during, a current plan year.


(ii) *Exception for collectively bargained plans.* A collectively bargained plan described in section 413(a) may on a consistent basis anticipate benefit increases scheduled to take effect during the term of the collective-bargaining agreement applicable to the plan. A plan's treatment of benefit increases scheduled in a collective bargaining agreement is part of its funding method. Accordingly, a change in a plan's treatment of such benefit increases (for example, ignoring anticipated increases after taking them into account) is a change of funding method. 


(2) *Anticipated future participants.* A reasonable funding method must not anticipate the affiliation with the plan of future participants not employed in the service of the employer on the plan valuation date. However, a reasonable funding method may anticipate the affiliation with the plan of current employees who have not satisfied the participation requirements of the plan.


(e) *Special rules for certain funding methods*—(1) *Applicability of special rules.* Paragraph (e) of this section applies to a funding method that determines normal cost under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.


(2) *Use of salary scale.* For rules relating to use of a salary scale assumption, see paragraph (c)(4) of this section.


(3) *Allocation of liabilities.* In determining a plan's normal cost and accrued liability for a particular plan year, the projected benefits of the plan must be allocated between past years and future years. Except in the case of a career average pay plan, this allocation must be in proportion to the applicable rates of benefit accrual under the plan. Thus, the allocation to past years is effected by multiplying the projected benefit by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the participant's credited years of service. The denominator is the participant's total credited years of service at the anticipated benefit commencement date. Adjustments are made to account for changes in the rate of benefit accrual. An allocation based on compensation is not permitted. In the case of a career average pay plan, an allocation between past and future service benefits must be reasonable.


(f) *Treatment of ancillary benefit costs*—(1) *General rule.* Under a reasonable funding method, except as otherwise provided by this paragraph (f), ancillary benefit costs must be computed by using the same method used to compute retirement benefit costs under a plan.


(2) *Ancillary benefit defined.* For purposes of this paragraph an ancillary benefit is a benefit that is paid as a result of a specified event which—


(i) Occurs not later than a participant's separation from service, and


(ii) Was detrimental to the participant's health.


(3) *Exception for certain insurance contracts.* Under a reasonable funding method, regardless of the method used to compute retirement benefit costs, the cost of an ancillary benefit may equal the premium paid for that benefit under an insurance contract if—


(i) The ancillary benefit is provided under the contract, and


(ii) The benefit is guaranteed under the contract.


(4) *Exception for 1-year term funding and other approved methods.* [Reserved]


(5) *Section 401(h) benefits.* Section 412 does not apply to benefits that are described in section 401(h) and for which a separate account is maintained.


(g) *Examples.* The principles of this section are illustrated by the following examples:
