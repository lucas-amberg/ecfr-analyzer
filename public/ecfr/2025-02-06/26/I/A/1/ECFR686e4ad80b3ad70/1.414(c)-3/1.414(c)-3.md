(d) *Definitions*—(1) *Employee.* For purposes of this section, the term “employee” has the same meaning such term is given in section 3306(i) of the Code (relating to definitions for purposes of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act). 


(2) *Principal owner.* For purposes of this section, the term “principal owner” means a person who owns (directly and with the application of § 1.414(c)-4)— 


(i) In the case of a corporation, 5 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote in such corporation or 5 percent of more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of such corporation; 


(ii) In the case of a trust or estate, an actuarial interest of 5 percent or more of such trust or estate; or 


(iii) In the case of a partnership, 5 percent or more of the profits or capital interest of such partnership. 


(3) *Officer.* For purposes of this section, the term “officer” includes the president, vice-presidents, general manager, treasurer, secretary, and comptroller of a corporation, and any other person who performs duties corresponding to those normally performed by persons occupying such positions. 


(4) *Partner.* For purposes of this section, the term “partner” means any person defined in section 7701(a)(2) (relating to definitions of partner). 


(5) *Fiduciary.* For purposes of this section and § 1.414(c)-4, the term “fiduciary” has the same meaning as such term is given in section 7701(a)(6) and the regulations thereunder. 


(6) *Substantial conditions.* (i) *In general.* For purposes of this section, an interest in or stock of an organization is subject to conditions which substantially restrict or limit the right to dispose of such interest or stock and which run in favor of another person if the condition extends directly or indirectly to such person preferential rights with respect to the acquisition of the direct owner's (or the record owner's) interest or stock. For a condition to be in favor of another person it is not necessary that such person be extended a discriminatory concession with respect to price. A right of first refusal with respect to an interest or stock in favor of another person is a condition which substantially restricts or limits the direct or record owner's right of disposition which runs in favor of such person. Further, any legally enforceable condition which prohibits the direct or record owner from disposing of his or her interest or stock without the consent of another person will be considered to be a substantial limitation running in favor of such person. 


(ii) *Special rule.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(3) of this section only, if a condition which restricts or limits an employee's right (or direct or record owner's right) to dispose of his or her interest or stock also applies to the interest or stock in such organization held by a common owner pursuant to a bonafide reciprocal purchase arrangement, such condition shall not be treated as a substantial limitation or restriction. An example of a reciprocal purchase arrangement is an agreement whereby a common owner and the employee are given a right of first refusal with respect to stock of the employer corporation owned by the other party. If, however, the agreement also provides that the common owner has the right to purchase the stock of the employer corporation owned by the employee in the event the corporation should discharge the employee for reasonable cause, the purchase arrangement would not be reciprocal within the meaning of this subdivision.


(7) *Control.* For purposes of paragraphs (b)(6) and (c)(4) of this section, the term “control” means control in fact. The determination of whether there exists control in fact will depend upon all of the facts and circumstances of each case, without regard to whether such control is legally enforceable and irrespective of the method by which such control is exercised or exercisable. 


(e) *Examples.* The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:


(f) *Exception*—(1) *In general.* If an interest in an organization (including stock of a corporation) is owned by a person directly or with the application of the rules of paragraph (b) of § 1.414 (c)-4 and such ownership results in the membership of that organization in a group of two or more trades or businesses under common control for any period, then the interest will not be treated as an excluded interest under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section if the result of applying such provisions is that the organization is not a member of a group of two or more trades or businesses under common control for the period. 


(2) *Example.* The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:
