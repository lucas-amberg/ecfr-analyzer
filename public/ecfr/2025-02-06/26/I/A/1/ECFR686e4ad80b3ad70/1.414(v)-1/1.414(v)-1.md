# § 1.414(v)-1   Catch-up contributions.

(a) *Catch-up contributions*—(1) *General rule.* An applicable employer plan shall not be treated as failing to meet any requirement of the Internal Revenue Code solely because the plan permits a catch-up eligible participant to make catch-up contributions in accordance with section 414(v) and this section. With respect to an applicable employer plan, catch-up contributions are elective deferrals made by a catch-up eligible participant that exceed any of the applicable limits set forth in paragraph (b) of this section and that are treated under the applicable employer plan as catch-up contributions, but only to the extent they do not exceed the catch-up contribution limit described in paragraph (c) of this section (determined in accordance with the special rules for employers that maintain multiple applicable employer plans in paragraph (f) of this section, if applicable). To the extent provided under paragraph (d) of this section, catch-up contributions are disregarded for purposes of various statutory limits. In addition, unless otherwise provided in paragraph (e) of this section, all catch-up eligible participants of the employer must be provided the opportunity to make catch-up contributions in order for an applicable employer plan to comply with the universal availability requirement of section 414(v)(4). The definitions in paragraph (g) of this section apply for purposes of this section and § 1.402(g)-2. 


(2) *Treatment as elective deferrals.* Except as specifically provided in this section, elective deferrals treated as catch-up contributions remain subject to statutory and regulatory rules otherwise applicable to elective deferrals. For example, catch-up contributions under an applicable employer plan that is a section 401(k) plan are subject to the distribution and vesting restrictions of section 401(k)(2)(B) and (C). In addition, the plan is permitted to provide a single election for catch-up eligible participants, with the determination of whether elective deferrals are catch-up contributions being made under the terms of the plan. 


(3) *Coordination with section 457(b)(3).* In the case of an applicable employer plan that is a section 457 eligible governmental plan, the catch-up contributions permitted under this section shall not apply to a catch-up eligible participant for any taxable year for which a higher limitation applies to such participant under section 457(b)(3). For additional guidance, see regulations under section 457. 


(b) *Elective deferrals that exceed an applicable limit*—(1) *Applicable limits.* An applicable limit for purposes of determining catch-up contributions for a catch-up eligible participant is any of the following: 


(i) *Statutory limit.* A statutory limit is a limit on elective deferrals or annual additions permitted to be made (without regard to section 414(v) and this section) with respect to an employee for a year provided in section 401(a)(30), 402(h), 403(b), 408, 415(c), or 457(b)(2) (without regard to section 457(b)(3)), as applicable. 


(ii) *Employer-provided limit.* An employer-provided limit is any limit on the elective deferrals an employee is permitted to make (without regard to section 414(v) and this section) that is contained in the terms of the plan, but which is not required under the Internal Revenue Code. Thus, for example, if, in accordance with the terms of the plan, highly compensated employees are limited to a deferral percentage of 10% of compensation, this limit is an employer-provided limit that is an applicable limit with respect to the highly compensated employees. 


(iii) *Actual deferral percentage (ADP) limit.* In the case of a section 401(k) plan that would fail the ADP test of section 401(k)(3) if it did not correct under section 401(k)(8), the ADP limit is the highest amount of elective deferrals that can be retained in the plan by any highly compensated employee under the rules of section 401(k)(8)(C) (without regard to paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section). In the case of a simplified employee pension (SEP) with a salary reduction arrangement (within the meaning of section 408(k)(6)) that would fail the requirements of section 408(k)(6)(A)(iii) if it did not correct in accordance with section 408(k)(6)(C), the ADP limit is the highest amount of elective deferrals that can be made by any highly compensated employee under the rules of section 408(k)(6) (without regard to paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section). 


(2) *Contributions in excess of applicable limit*—(i) *Plan year limits*—(A) *General rule.* Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the amount of elective deferrals in excess of an applicable limit is determined as of the end of the plan year by comparing the total elective deferrals for the plan year with the applicable limit for the plan year. In addition, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, in the case of a plan that provides for separate employer-provided limits on elective deferrals for separate portions of plan compensation within the plan year, the applicable limit for the plan year is the sum of the dollar amounts of the limits for the separate portions. For example, if a plan sets a deferral percentage limit for each payroll period, the applicable limit for the plan year is the sum of the dollar amounts of the limits for the payroll periods. 


(B) *Alternative method for determining employer-provided limit*—(*1*) *General rule.* If the plan limits elective deferrals for separate portions of the plan year, then, solely for purposes of determining the amount that is in excess of an employer-provided limit, the plan is permitted to provide that the applicable limit for the plan year is the product of the employee's plan year compensation and the time-weighted average of the deferral percentage limits, rather than determining the employer-provided limit as the sum of the limits for the separate portions of the year. Thus, for example, if, in accordance with the terms of the plan, highly compensated employees are limited to 8% of compensation during the first half of the plan year and 10% of compensation for the second half of the plan year, the plan is permitted to provide that the applicable limit for a highly compensated employee is 9% of the employee's plan year compensation. 


(*2*) *Alternative definition of compensation permitted.* A plan using the alternative method in this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) is permitted to provide that the applicable limit for the plan year is determined as the product of the catch-up eligible participant's compensation used for purposes of the ADP test and the time-weighted average of the deferral percentage limits. The alternative calculation in this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B)(*2*) is available regardless of whether the deferral percentage limits change during the plan year.


(ii) *Other year limit.* In the case of an applicable limit that is applied on the basis of a year other than the plan year (e.g., the calendar-year limit on elective deferrals under section 401(a)(30)), the determination of whether elective deferrals are in excess of the applicable limit is made on the basis of such other year.


(c) *Catch-up contribution limit*—(1) *General rule.* Elective deferrals with respect to a catch-up eligible participant in excess of an applicable limit under paragraph (b) of this section are treated as catch-up contributions under this section as of a date within a taxable year only to the extent that such elective deferrals do not exceed the catch-up contribution limit described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, reduced by elective deferrals previously treated as catch-up contributions for the taxable year, determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The catch-up contribution limit for a taxable year is generally the applicable dollar catch-up limit for such taxable year, as set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. However, an elective deferral is not treated as a catch-up contribution to the extent that the elective deferral, when added to all other elective deferrals for the taxable year under any applicable employer plan of the employer, exceeds the participant's compensation (determined in accordance with section 415(c)(3)) for the taxable year. See also paragraph (f) of this section for special rules for employees who participate in more than one applicable employer plan maintained by the employer.


(2) *Applicable dollar catch-up limit*—(i) *In general.* The applicable dollar catch-up limit for an applicable employer plan, other than a plan described in section 401(k)(11) or 408(p), is determined under the following table:


(ii) *SIMPLE plans.* The applicable dollar catch-up limit for a SIMPLE 401(k) plan described in section 401(k)(11) or a SIMPLE IRA plan as described in section 408(p) is determined under the following table:


(iii) *Cost of living adjustments.* For taxable years beginning after 2006, the applicable dollar catch-up limit is the applicable dollar catch-up limit for 2006 described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section increased at the same time and in the same manner as adjustments under section 415(d), except that the base period shall be the calendar quarter beginning July 1, 2005, and any increase that is not a multiple of $500 shall be rounded to the next lower multiple of $500.


(3) *Timing rules.* For purposes of determining the maximum amount of permitted catch-up contributions for a catch-up eligible participant, the determination of whether an elective deferral is a catch-up contribution is made as of the last day of the plan year (or in the case of section 415, as of the last day of the limitation year), except that, with respect to elective deferrals in excess of an applicable limit that is tested on the basis of the taxable year or calendar year (e.g., the section 401(a)(30) limit on elective deferrals), the determination of whether such elective deferrals are treated as catch-up contributions is made at the time they are deferred.


(d) *Treatment of catch-up contributions*—(1) *Contributions not taken into account for certain limits.* Catch-up contributions are not taken into account in applying the limits of section 401(a)(30), 402(h), 403(b), 408, 415(c), or 457(b)(2) (determined without regard to section 457(b)(3)) to other contributions or benefits under an applicable employer plan or any other plan of the employer.


(2) *Contributions not taken into account in application of ADP test*—(i) *Calculation of ADR.* Elective deferrals that are treated as catch-up contributions pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section with respect to a section 401(k) plan because they exceed a statutory or employer-provided limit described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, respectively, are subtracted from the catch-up eligible participant's elective deferrals for the plan year for purposes of determining the actual deferral ratio (ADR) (as defined in regulations under section 401(k)) of a catch-up eligible participant. Similarly, elective deferrals that are treated as catch-up contributions pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section with respect to a SEP because they exceed a statutory or employer-provided limit described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, respectively, are subtracted from the catch-up eligible participant's elective deferrals for the plan year for purposes of determining the deferral percentage under section 408(k)(6)(D) of a catch-up eligible participant.


(ii) *Adjustment of elective deferrals for correction purposes.* For purposes of the correction of excess contributions in accordance with section 401(k)(8)(C), elective deferrals under the plan treated as catch-up contributions for the plan year and not taken into account in the ADP test under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section are subtracted from the catch-up eligible participant's elective deferrals under the plan for the plan year.


(iii) *Excess contributions treated as catch-up contributions.* A section 401(k) plan that satisfies the ADP test of section 401(k)(3) through correction under section 401(k)(8) must retain any elective deferrals that are treated as catch-up contributions pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section because they exceed the ADP limit in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. In addition, a section 401(k) plan is not treated as failing to satisfy section 401(k)(8) merely because elective deferrals described in the preceding sentence are not distributed or recharacterized as employee contributions. Similarly, a SEP is not treated as failing to satisfy section 408(k)(6)(A)(iii) merely because catch-up contributions are not treated as excess contributions with respect to a catch-up eligible participant under the rules of section 408(k)(6)(C). Notwithstanding the fact that elective deferrals described in this paragraph (d)(2)(iii) are not distributed, such elective deferrals are still considered to be excess contributions under section 401(k)(8), and accordingly, matching contributions with respect to such elective deferrals are permitted to be forfeited under the rules of section 411(a)(3)(G).


(3) *Contributions not taken into account for other nondiscrimination purposes*—(i) *Application for top-heavy.* Catch-up contributions with respect to the current plan year are not taken into account for purposes of section 416. However, catch-up contributions for prior years are taken into account for purposes of section 416. Thus, catch-up contributions for prior years are included in the account balances that are used in determining whether the plan is top-heavy under section 416(g).


(ii) *Application for section 410(b).* Catch-up contributions with respect to the current plan year are not taken into account for purposes of section 410(b). Thus, catch-up contributions are not taken into account in determining the average benefit percentage under § 1.410(b)-5 for the year if benefit percentages are determined based on current year contributions. However, catch-up contributions for prior years are taken into account for purposes of section 410(b). Thus, catch-up contributions for prior years would be included in the account balances that are used in determining the average benefit percentage if allocations for prior years are taken into account. 


(4) *Availability of catch-up contributions.* An applicable employer plan does not violate § 1.401(a)(4)-4 merely because the group of employees for whom catch-up contributions are currently available (*i.e.,* the catch-up eligible participants) is not a group of employees that would satisfy section 410(b) (without regard to § 1.410(b)-5). In addition, a catch-up eligible participant is not treated as having a right to a different rate of allocation of matching contributions merely because an otherwise nondiscriminatory schedule of matching rates is applied to elective deferrals that include catch-up contributions. The rules in this paragraph (d)(4) also apply for purposes of satisfying the requirements of section 403(b)(12).


(e) *Universal availability requirement*—(1) *General rule*—(i) *Effective opportunity.* An applicable employer plan that offers catch-up contributions and that is otherwise subject to section 401(a)(4) (including a plan that is subject to section 401(a)(4) pursuant to section 403(b)(12)) will not satisfy the requirements of section 401(a)(4) unless all catch-up eligible participants who participate under any applicable employer plan maintained by the employer are provided with an effective opportunity to make the same dollar amount of catch-up contributions. A plan fails to provide an effective opportunity to make catch-up contributions if it has an applicable limit (e.g., an employer-provided limit) that applies to a catch-up eligible participant and does not permit the participant to make elective deferrals in excess of that limit. An applicable employer plan does not fail to satisfy the universal availability requirement of this paragraph (e) solely because an employer-provided limit does not apply to all employees or different limits apply to different groups of employees under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. However, a plan may not provide lower employer-provided limits for catch-up eligible participants.


(ii) *Certain practices permitted*—(A) *Proration of limit.* An applicable employer plan does not fail to satisfy the universal availability requirement of this paragraph (e) merely because the plan allows participants to defer an amount equal to a specified percentage of compensation for each payroll period and for each payroll period permits each catch-up eligible participant to defer a pro-rata share of the applicable dollar catch-up limit in addition to that amount.


(B) *Cash availability.* An applicable employer plan does not fail to satisfy the universal availability requirement of this paragraph (e) merely because it restricts the elective deferrals of any employee (including a catch-up eligible participant) to amounts available after other withholding from the employee's pay (e.g., after deduction of all applicable income and employment taxes). For this purpose, an employer limit of 75% of compensation or higher will be treated as limiting employees to amounts available after other withholdings.


(2) *Certain employees disregarded.* An applicable employer plan does not fail to satisfy the universal availability requirement of this paragraph (e) merely because employees described in section 410(b)(3) (e.g., collectively bargained employees) are not provided the opportunity to make catch-up contributions.


(3) *Exception for certain plans.* An applicable employer plan does not fail to satisfy the universal availability requirement of this paragraph (e) merely because another applicable employer plan that is a section 457 eligible governmental plan does not provide for catch-up contributions to the extent set forth in section 414(v)(6)(C) and paragraph (a)(3) of this section.


(4) *Exception for section 410(b)(6)(C)(ii) period.* If an applicable employer plan satisfies the universal availability requirement of this paragraph (e) before an acquisition or disposition described in § 1.410(b)-2(f) and would fail to satisfy the universal availability requirement of this paragraph (e) merely because of such event, then the applicable employer plan shall continue to be treated as satisfying this paragraph (e) through the end of the period determined under section 410(b)(6)(C)(ii).


(f) *Special rules for an employer that sponsors multiple plans*—(1) *General rule.* For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, all applicable employer plans, other than section 457 eligible governmental plans, maintained by the same employer are treated as one plan and all section 457 eligible governmental plans maintained by the same employer are treated as one plan. Thus, the total amount of catch-up contributions under all applicable employer plans of an employer (other than section 457 eligible governmental plans) is limited to the applicable dollar catch-up limit for the taxable year, and the total amount of catch-up contributions for all section 457 eligible governmental plans of an employer is limited to the applicable dollar catch-up limit for the taxable year.


(2) *Coordination of employer-provided limits.* An applicable employer plan is permitted to allow a catch-up eligible participant to defer amounts in excess of an employer-provided limit under that plan without regard to whether elective deferrals made by the participant have been treated as catch-up contributions for the taxable year under another applicable employer plan aggregated with such plan under this paragraph (f). However, to the extent elective deferrals under another plan maintained by the employer have already been treated as catch-up contributions during the taxable year, the elective deferrals under the plan may be treated as catch-up contributions only up to the amount remaining under the catch-up limit for the year. Any other elective deferrals that exceed the employer-provided limit may not be treated as catch-up contributions and must satisfy the otherwise applicable nondiscrimination rules. For example, the right to make contributions in excess of the employer-provided limit is another right or feature which must satisfy § 1.401(a)(4)-4 to the extent that the contributions are not catch-up contributions. Also, contributions in excess of the employer provided limit are taken into account under the ADP test to the extent they are not catch-up contributions.


(3) *Allocation rules.* If a catch-up eligible participant makes additional elective deferrals in excess of an applicable limit under paragraph (b)(1) of this section under more than one applicable employer plan that is aggregated under the rules of this paragraph (f), the applicable employer plan under which elective deferrals in excess of an applicable limit are treated as catch-up contributions is permitted to be determined in any manner that is not inconsistent with the manner in which such amounts were actually deferred under the plan.


(g) *Definitions*—(1) *Applicable employer plan.* The term applicable employer plan means a section 401(k) plan, a SIMPLE IRA plan as defined in section 408(p), a simplified employee pension plan as defined in section 408(k) (SEP), a plan or contract that satisfies the requirements of section 403(b), or a section 457 eligible governmental plan.


(2) *Elective deferral.* The term elective deferral means an elective deferral within the meaning of section 402(g)(3) or any contribution to a section 457 eligible governmental plan.


(3) *Catch-up eligible participant.* An employee is a catch-up eligible participant for a taxable year if—


(i) The employee is eligible to make elective deferrals under an applicable employer plan (without regard to section 414(v) or this section); and


(ii) The employee's 50th or higher birthday would occur before the end of the employee's taxable year.


(4) *Other definitions.* (i) The terms employer, employee, section 401(k) plan, and highly compensated employee have the meanings provided in § 1.410(b)-9.


(ii) The term section 457 eligible governmental plan means an eligible deferred compensation plan described in section 457(b) that is established and maintained by an eligible employer described in section 457(e)(1)(A). 


(h) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this section. For purposes of these examples, the limit under section 401(a)(30) is $15,000 and the applicable dollar catch-up limit is $5,000 and, except as specifically provided, the plan year is the calendar year. In addition, it is assumed that the participant's elective deferrals under all plans of the employer do not exceed the participant's section 415(c)(3) compensation, that the taxable year of the participant is the calendar year and that any correction pursuant to section 401(k)(8) is made through distribution of excess contributions. The examples are as follows: 


(i) *Effective date*—(1) *Statutory effective date.* Section 414(v) applies to contributions in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2002.


(2) *Regulatory effective date.* Paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section apply to contributions in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2004.
