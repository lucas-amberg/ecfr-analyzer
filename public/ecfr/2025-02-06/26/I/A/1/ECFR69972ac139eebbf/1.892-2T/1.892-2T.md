(2) *Integral part.* An “integral part” of a foreign sovereign is any person, body of persons, organization, agency, bureau, fund, instrumentality, or other body, however designated, that constitutes a governing authority of a foreign country. The net earnings of the governing authority must be credited to its own account or to other accounts of the foreign sovereign, with no portion inuring to the benefit of any private person.

(i) It is wholly owned and controlled by a foreign sovereign directly or indirectly through one or more controlled entities;


(ii) It is organized under the laws of the foreign sovereign by which owned;


(iii) Its net earnings are credited to its own account or to other accounts of the foreign sovereign, with no portion of its income inuring to the benefit of any private person; and


(iv) Its assets vest in the foreign sovereign upon dissolution.


(b) *Inurement to the benefit of private persons.* For purposes of this section, income will be presumed not to inure to the benefit of private persons if such persons (within the meaning of section 7701(a)(1)) are the intended beneficiaries of a governmental program which is carried on by the foreign sovereign and the activities of which constitute governmental functions (within the meaning of § 1.892-4T(c)(4)). Income will be considered to inure to the benefit of private persons if such income benefits:


(1) Private persons through the use of a governmental entity as a conduit for personal investment; or


(2) Private persons who divert such income from its intended use by the exertion of influence or control through means explicitly or implicitly approved of by the foreign sovereign.


(c) *Pension trusts*—(1) *In general.* A controlled entity includes a separately organized pension trust if it meets the following requirements:


(i) The trust is established exclusively for the benefit of (A) employees or former employees of a foreign government or (B) employees or former employees of a foreign government and non-governmental employees or former employees that perform or performed governmental or social services;


(ii) The funds that comprise the trust are managed by trustees who are employees of, or persons appointed by, the foreign government;


(iii) The trust forming a part of the pension plan provides for retirement, disability, or death benefits in consideration for prior services rendered; and


(iv) Income of the trust satisfies the obligations of the foreign government to participants under the plan, rather than inuring to the benefit of a private person.


(2) *Illustrations.* The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (c)(1).


(d) *Political subdivision and transnational entity.* The rules that apply to a foreign sovereign apply to political subdivisions of a foreign country and to transnational entities. A transnational entity is an organization created by more than one foreign sovereign that has broad powers over external and domestic affairs of all participating foreign countries stretching beyond economic subjects to those concerning legal relations and transcending state or political boundaries.
