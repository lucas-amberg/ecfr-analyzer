# § 1.897(l)-1   Exception for interests held by foreign pension funds.

(a) *Scope and overview.* This section provides rules regarding the exception from section 897 for qualified holders. The definitions and requirements in this section apply only for purposes of this section (including as applicable by cross-reference from other sections), and no inference is to be drawn with respect to the definitions and requirements in this section, including with respect to the meaning of a pension fund, for any other purpose. Paragraph (b) of this section provides the general rule excepting qualified holders from section 897. Paragraph (c) of this section provides the requirements that an eligible fund must satisfy to be treated as a qualified foreign pension fund. Paragraph (d) of this section provides the requirements that a qualified foreign pension fund or a qualified controlled entity must satisfy to be treated as a qualified holder. Paragraph (e) of this section provides definitions. Paragraph (f) of this section provides examples illustrating the application of the rules of this section. Paragraph (g) of this section provides applicability dates. For rules applicable to a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity claiming an exemption from withholding under chapter 3, see generally §§ 1.1441-3, 1.1445-2, 1.1445-5, 1.1445-8, 1.1446-1, and 1.1446-2.


(b) *Exception from section 897*—(1) *In general.* Gain or loss of a qualified holder from the disposition of a United States real property interest, including gain from a distribution described in section 897(h), is not subject to section 897(a).


(2) *Limitation.* Paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies solely with respect to gain or loss that is attributable to one or more qualified segregated accounts maintained by a qualified holder.


(c) *Qualified foreign pension fund requirements*—(1) *In general.* An eligible fund is a qualified foreign pension fund if it satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (c). Paragraph (c)(2) of this section provides rules regarding the application of the requirements of section 897(l)(2) to an eligible fund. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section provides rules on the application of the requirements in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, including rules regarding the application of those requirements to an eligible fund that is an organization or arrangement and rules regarding recordkeeping.


(2) *Applicable requirements*—(i) *Created or organized.* An eligible fund must be created, organized, or established under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(i), a governmental unit is treated as created or organized in the foreign jurisdiction with respect to which it is, or is a part of, the foreign government.


(ii) *Establishment of eligible fund*—(A) *General requirement*—(*1*) *Purpose of and parties establishing eligible fund.* An eligible fund must be established—


(*i*) By, or at the direction of, the foreign jurisdiction in which it is created or organized to provide retirement and pension benefits to participants or beneficiaries that are current or former employees or persons designated by such employees as a result of services rendered by such employees to their employers; or


(*ii*) By one or more employers (including a governmental unit in its capacity as an employer) to provide retirement and pension benefits to participants or beneficiaries that are current or former employees or persons designated by such employees in consideration for services rendered by such employees to such employers.


(*2*) *Identification of type of eligible fund.* An eligible fund that is described in both paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*1*)(*i*) and (*ii*) of this section shall be treated solely as described in the latter paragraph.


(*3*) *Role of parties other than the foreign jurisdiction or employer.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*1*) of this section, the determination of whether an eligible fund is established by, or at the direction of, a foreign jurisdiction or established by an employer is made without regard to whether one or more persons that are not the foreign jurisdiction or employer administer or otherwise provide services with regard to the eligible fund (including holding assets in a qualified segregated account as part of or on behalf of the eligible fund).


(B) *Established to provide retirement or pension benefits.* An eligible fund is established to provide retirement or pension benefits for purposes of the general requirement in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section if—


(*1*) All of the benefits that an eligible fund provides are qualified benefits provided to qualified recipients;


(*2*) At least 85 percent of the present value of the qualified benefits that the eligible fund reasonably expects to provide to qualified recipients in the future are retirement and pension benefits; and


(*3*) No more than five percent of the present value of the qualified benefits the eligible fund reasonably expects to provide to qualified recipients in the future are non-ancillary benefits.


(C) *Present valuation*—(*1*) *In general.* For purposes of satisfying the requirements in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(B)(*2*) and (*3*) of this section, an eligible fund must determine, on at least an annual basis, the present value of the qualified benefits that the eligible fund reasonably expects to provide to qualified recipients during the entire period during which the eligible fund is expected to be in existence. An eligible fund may utilize any reasonable method for performing the present valuation.


(*2*) *48-month average alternative calculation.* An eligible fund that does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(*2*) or (*3*) of this section based on the present value determination under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*1*) of this section may satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(*2*) or (*3*) of this section based on the alternative calculation in this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*2*). The alternative calculation in this paragraph is satisfied if the average of the present values of the future qualified benefits that the eligible fund reasonably expected to provide, as determined during the 48-month period preceding (and including) the most recent present valuation determination, satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(*2*) or (*3*) of this section, respectively. The determination of such average must be based on the valuations described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*1*) of this section that were carried out during the 48-month period preceding (and including) the most recent present value determination, and must use the values (not percentages) of the qualified benefits the eligible fund reasonably expected to provide. The determination described in this paragraph must be calculated using a weighted average whereby values are adjusted if the relevant valuations are applicable for different periods (as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*3*) of this section) because an eligible fund performs valulations more frequently than on an annual basis. If an eligible fund has been in existence for less than 48 months, this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*2*) is applied to the period that the eligible fund has been in existence. The alternative calculation in this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*2*) may be satisfied based on any reasonable determination of the present valuation described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*1*) of this section for any period that starts before the date that the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section first apply to an organization or arrangement and ends on or before December 29, 2022.


(*3*) *Application of present valuation.* An eligible fund must use the present value determination made as of the most recent valuation under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*1*) of this section or the alternative calculation provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*2*) of this section (to the extent the eligible fund did not satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(B)(*2*) and (*3*) of this section in the most recent valuation) for purposes of meeting the requirements in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(B)(*2*) and (*3*) of this section with respect to dispositions of United States real property interests or distributions described in section 897(h) occurring in the twelve months succeeding the most recent valuation, or until a new present value determination is made, whichever occurs first.


(D) *Certain distributions from eligible funds.* The following distributions are not taken into account for purposes of determining whether an eligible fund satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section—


(*1*) A loan to a qualified recipient pursuant to terms set by the eligible fund (other than a loan with respect to which a qualified recipient defaults and is not required to repay in whole or part, unless the default is subject to tax and penalty in such foreign jurisdiction);


(*2*) A distribution (as permitted by the laws of the foreign jurisdiction in which the eligible fund is established or operates) made before the participant or beneficiary reaches the retirement age (as determined under the relevant foreign laws), provided that the distribution is to a designee that is a qualified holder or to another arrangement subject to similar distribution or tax rules under the laws of the foreign jurisdiction; and


(*3*) A withdrawal of funds before the participant or beneficiary reaches the retirement age (as determined under the relevant foreign laws) to satisfy a financial need (under principles similar to the U.S. hardship distribution rules, see § 1.401(k)-1(d)(3)) as permitted under the laws of the foreign jurisdiction in which the eligible fund is established or operates, provided the distribution (or at least the portion of the distribution exceeding basis) is subject to tax and penalty in such foreign jurisdiction.


(E) *Certain employers and employees.* For purposes of this section, the following rules apply—


(*1*) A self-employed individual is treated as both an employer and an employee;


(*2*) Employees of an individual, trust, corporation, or partnership that is a member of an employer group are treated as employees of each member of the employer group that includes the individual, trust, corporation, or partnership; and


(*3*) An eligible fund established by a trade union, professional association, or similar group, either alone or in combination with the employer or group of employers, is treated as established by any employer that funds, in whole or in part, the eligible fund.


(iii) *Single participant or beneficiary*—(A) *In general.* An eligible fund may not have a single qualified recipient that has a right to more than five percent of the assets or income of the eligible fund.


(B) *Constructive ownership.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, an individual is considered to have a right to the assets or income of an eligible fund to which any person who bears a relationship to the individual described in section 267(b) or 707(b) has a right.


(iv) *Regulation and information reporting*—(A) *In general.* The eligible fund must be subject to government regulation and annually provide to the relevant tax authorities (or other relevant governmental units) in the foreign jurisdiction in which the eligible fund is established or operates information about the amount of qualified benefits (if any) provided to each qualified recipient by the eligible fund, or such information must otherwise be available to the relevant tax authorities (or other relevant governmental units). An eligible fund is not treated as failing to satisfy the requirement of this paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(A) as a result of the eligible fund not being required to provide information to the relevant tax authorities (or other relevant governmental units) in a year in which no qualified benefits are provided to qualified recipients.


(B) *Treatment of certain eligible funds established by foreign jurisdictions.* An eligible fund that is described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*1*)(*i*) of this section is deemed to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(A) of this section.


(v) *Tax treatment*—(A) *In general.* The tax laws of the foreign jurisdiction in which the eligible fund is established or operates must provide that, due to the status of the eligible fund as a retirement or pension fund, either—


(*1*) Contributions to the eligible fund that would otherwise be subject to tax under such laws are deductible or excluded from the gross income of the eligible fund or taxed at a reduced rate; or


(*2*) Taxation of any investment income of the eligible fund is deferred or excluded from the gross income of the eligible fund or such income is taxed at a reduced rate.


(B) *Income subject to preferential tax treatment.* An eligible fund is treated as satisfying the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section in a taxable year if, under the tax laws of the foreign jurisdiction in which the eligible fund is established or operates—


(*1*) At least 85 percent of the contributions to the eligible fund are subject to the tax treatment described in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A)(*1*) of this section, or


(*2*) At least 85 percent of the investment income of the eligible fund is subject to the tax treatment described in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A)(*2*) of this section.


(C) *Income not subject to tax.* An eligible fund is treated as satisfying the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section if the eligible fund is exempt from the income tax of the foreign jurisdiction in which it is established or operates or the foreign jurisdiction in which it is established or operates has no income tax.


(D) *Other preferential tax regimes.* An eligible fund that does not receive the tax treatment described in either paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A)(*1*) or (*2*) of this section is nonetheless treated as satisfying the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section if the eligible fund establishes that each of the conditions described in paragraphs (c)(2)(v)(D)(*1*) and (*2*) of this section is satisfied:


(*1*) Under the tax laws of the foreign jurisdiction in which the eligible fund is established or operates, the eligible fund is subject to a preferential tax regime due to its status as a retirement or pension fund; and


(*2*) The preferential tax regime described in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(D)(*1*) of this section has a substantially similar effect as the tax treatment described in paragraphs (c)(2)(v)(A)(*1*) or (*2*) of this section.


(E) *Tax law of subnational jurisdictions.* Solely for purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(v), a reference to the tax law of a foreign jurisdiction includes the tax law of a political subdivision or other local authority of a foreign jurisdiction, provided that income taxes imposed under the subnational tax law are treated as covered taxes under an income tax treaty between that foreign jurisdiction and the United States.


(3) *Operating rules*—(i) *Rules on the application of the requirements in paragraph (c)(2) of this section*—(A) *Organizations or arrangements.* An organization or arrangement is treated as a single entity for purposes of determining whether the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section are satisfied, except that each person or governmental unit that is part of or party to an organization or arrangement must satisfy the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.


(B) *Relevant income, assets, and functions.* The determination of whether an eligible fund satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section is made solely with respect to the assets and income of the eligible fund held in one or more qualified segregated accounts, the qualified benefits funded by the qualified segregated accounts, the information reporting and regulation related to the qualified segregated accounts, and the qualified recipients whose benefits are funded by the qualified segregated accounts. For this purpose, all assets held by an eligible fund in qualified segregated accounts (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(13)(ii) of this section) are treated as a single qualified segregated account.


(ii) *Aggregate approach to partnerships.* For purposes of this section, assets held by a partnership shall be treated as held proportionately by its partners, and activities conducted by a partnership shall be treated as conducted by its partners.


(iii) *Recordkeeping.* An eligible fund that claims the exemption under section 897(l) must have records sufficient to establish that it satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. See section 6001 and § 1.6001-1, requiring records to be maintained.


(d) *Qualified holder requirements*—(1) *In general.* With respect to a disposition described in section 897(a) or a distribution described in section 897(h), a qualified foreign pension fund (including a part of a qualified foreign pension fund) or a qualified controlled entity is a qualified holder only if it satisfies the requirement of paragraph (d)(2) or (3) of this section.


(2) *Qualified holders that did not hold U.S. real property interests.* The requirement of this paragraph (d)(2) is satisfied if the qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity owned no United States real property interests as of the earliest date during an uninterrupted period, ending on the date of the disposition or distribution, in which the qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity satisfied the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section or paragraph (e)(9) of this section, as applicable.


(3) *Qualified holders that satisfy the testing period*—(i) *In general.* The requirement of this paragraph (d)(3) is satisfied if the qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity continuously satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section or paragraph (e)(9) of this section, as applicable, for the duration of the testing period.


(ii) *Testing Period.* The term testing period means whichever of the following periods is the shortest:


(A) The period beginning on December 18, 2015, and ending on the date of the disposition or the distribution;


(B) The ten-year period ending on the date of the disposition or the distribution; and,


(C) The period beginning on the date the entity (or its predecessor) was created or organized and ending on the date of the disposition or the distribution.


(4) *Transition Rules*—(i) *Qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity requirements.* With respect to any period from December 18, 2015, to the date when the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) or (e)(9) of this section first apply to a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity under paragraph (g) of this section, as applicable (but in any event no later than December 29, 2022, in the case of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and no later than June 6, 2019, in the case of paragraph (e)(9) of this section), the qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity is deemed to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) and (e)(9) of this section, as applicable, for purposes of paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section if the qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity satisfies the requirements of section 897(l)(2) based on a reasonable interpretation of those requirements (including determining any applicable valuations using a consistent method).


(ii) *Ownership of qualified controlled entity by service providers.* Solely for purposes of paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, the determination of whether a corporation or trust is a qualified controlled entity will not include stock or interests held directly or indirectly by any person that provides services to such corporation or trust, provided that such stock or interests are, in the aggregate, no more than five percent (by vote or value) of the stock or interests of such corporation or trust. This paragraph (d)(4)(ii) applies to interests held from December 18, 2015 until February 27, 2023.


(e) *Definitions.* The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.


(1) *Ancillary benefits*—(i) I*n general.* The term *ancillary benefits* means—


(A) Benefits payable upon the diagnosis of a terminal illness, incidental death benefits (for example, funeral expenses), short-term disability benefits, life insurance benefits, and medical benefits;


(B) Unemployment, shutdown, or layoff benefits that do not continue past retirement age and do not affect the payment of accrued retirement and pension benefits; and


(C) Other health-related or unemployment benefits that are similar to the benefits described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.


(ii) *Overlap with retirement and pension benefits.* Ancillary benefits do not include any benefits that could also be defined as retirement and pension benefits within the meaning of paragraph (e)(14) of this section.


(2) *Eligible fund.* The term *eligible fund* means a trust, corporation, or other organization or arrangement that maintains one or more qualified segregated accounts.


(3) *Employer group.* The term *employer group* means all individuals, trusts, partnerships, and corporations with a relationship to each other specified in section 267(b) or section 707(b).


(4) *Foreign jurisdiction.* The term *foreign jurisdiction* means a jurisdiction other than the United States, including a country, a state, province, or political subdivision of a foreign country, and a territory of the United States.


(5) *Governmental unit.* The term *governmental unit* means any foreign government or part thereof, including any person, body, group of persons, organization, agency, bureau, fund, or instrumentality, however designated, of a foreign government.


(6) *Non-ancillary benefits.* The term *non-ancillary benefits* means benefits that are neither ancillary benefits (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1) of this section) nor retirement and pension benefits (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(14) of this section), and are provided by the eligible fund as permitted or required under the laws of the foreign jurisdiction in which the eligible fund is established or operates.


(7) *Organization or arrangement.* The term *organization or arrangement* means one or more trusts, corporations, governmental units, or employers.


(8) *Qualified benefits.* The term *qualified benefits* means retirement and pension benefits, ancillary benefits and non-ancillary benefits. However, the portions of qualified benefits consisting of ancillary benefits and non-ancillary benefits provided by a qualified foreign pension fund are limited as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.


(9) *Qualified controlled entity.* The term *qualified controlled entity* means a trust or corporation created or organized under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction all of the interests of which are held by one or more qualified foreign pension funds directly or indirectly through one or more qualified controlled entities.


(10) *Qualified foreign pension fund.* The term *qualified foreign pension fund* means an eligible fund that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.


(11) *Qualified holder.* The term *qualified holder* means a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.


(12) *Qualified recipient*—(i) *In general.* The term *qualified recipient* means—


(A) With respect to an eligible fund described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*1*)(*i*) of this section, any person eligible to be treated as a participant or beneficiary of such eligible fund and any person designated by such participant or beneficiary to receive qualified benefits, and


(B) With respect to an eligible fund described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*1*)(*ii*) of this section, a current or former employee, a spouse of a current or former employee, and any person designated by such participants or beneficiaries to receive qualified benefits.


(C) To the extent not already described in paragraph (e)(12)(i)(B) of this section, with respect to an eligible fund described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*1*)(*ii*) of this section, any person eligible to be treated as a participant or beneficiary of such fund and any person designated by such participant or beneficiary to receive qualified benefits, so long as such recipients do not exceed five percent of the eligible fund's total qualified recipients or have a right to more than five percent of the assets or income of the eligible fund. An eligible fund must make a determination for purposes of this paragraph (e)(12)(i)(C) on at least an annual basis and may utilize any reasonable method in doing so. An eligible fund must use its most recent determination under this paragraph with respect to dispositions of United States real property interests or distributions described in section 897(h) occurring in the twelve months succeeding such determination, or until a new determination is made, whichever occurs first.


(ii) *Special rule regarding automatic designation.* For purposes of paragraph (e)(12)(i) of this section, a person is treated as designating another person to receive qualified benefits if the other person is, by reason of such person's relationship or other status with respect to the first person, entitled to receive benefits pursuant to the terms applicable to the eligible fund or pursuant to the laws of the foreign jurisdiction in which the eligible fund is created or organized, whether or not the first person expressly designated such person as a beneficiary.


(13) *Qualified segregated account*—(i) *In general.* The term *qualified segregated account* means an identifiable pool of assets maintained by an eligible fund or a qualified controlled entity for the sole purpose of funding and providing qualified benefits to qualified recipients.


(ii) *Assets held by eligible funds.* For purposes of paragraph (e)(13)(i) of this section, an identifiable pool of assets of an eligible fund is treated as maintained for the sole purpose of funding qualified benefits to qualified recipients, and hence as a qualified segregated account, only if the terms applicable to the eligible fund or the laws of the foreign jurisdiction in which the eligible fund is established or operates require that all the assets in the pool, and all the income earned with respect to such assets, be used exclusively to fund the provision of qualified benefits to qualified recipients or to satisfy necessary reasonable expenses of the eligible fund, and that such assets or income may not inure to the benefit of a person other than a qualified recipient. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(13)(ii), the fact that assets or income may inure to the benefit of a governmental unit by operation of escheat or similar laws, or may revert (such as upon plan termination or dissolution (after all obligations to qualified recipients and creditors have been satisfied) or the qualified recipients' benefits failing to vest) to the governmental unit or employer in accordance with applicable foreign law is ignored, so long as contributions to the plan are not more than reasonably necessary to fund the qualified benefits to be provided to qualified recipients.


(iii) *Assets held by qualified controlled entities.* For purposes of paragraph (e)(13)(i) of this section, the assets of a qualified controlled entity are treated as an identifiable pool of assets maintained for the sole purpose of funding qualified benefits to qualified recipients only if both of the following requirements are satisfied:


(A) All of the net earnings of the qualified controlled entity are credited to its own account or to the qualified segregated account of a qualified foreign pension fund or another qualified controlled entity, with no portion of the net earnings of the qualified controlled entity inuring to the benefit of a person other than a qualified recipient; and


(B) Upon dissolution, all of the assets of the qualified controlled entity, after satisfaction of liabilities to persons having interests in the entity solely as creditors, vest in a qualified segregated account of a qualified foreign pension fund or another qualified controlled entity.


(14) *Retirement and pension benefits.* The term *retirement and pension benefits* means distributions to qualified recipients that are made after the qualified recipient reaches retirement age as determined under or in accordance with the laws in the foreign jurisdiction in which the eligible fund is established or operates (including a benefit paid to a qualified recipient who retires on or after a stated early retirement age), or after a specified event that results in a qualified recipient being permanently unable to work, and includes any such distribution made to a surviving beneficiary of the qualifying recipient. Retirement and pension benefits may be based on one or more of the following factors: contributions, investment performance, years of service with an employer, or compensation received by the qualified recipient.


(f) *Examples.* This paragraph (f) provides examples that illustrate the rules of this section. The examples do not illustrate the application of the applicable withholding rules, including sections 1445 and 1446 and the regulations thereunder. It is assumed that no person is entitled to more than five percent of any eligible fund's assets or income, taking into account the constructive ownership rules in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, and that the eligible fund owns no United States real property interests other than as described.


(1) *Example 1: No legal entity*—(i) *Facts.* On January 1, 2023, Country A establishes Retirement Plan for the sole purpose of providing retirement and pension benefits to citizens of Country A aged 65 or older. Retirement Plan is composed of Asset Pool and Agency. Asset Pool is a group of accounts maintained on the balance sheet of the government of Country A. Pursuant to the laws of Country A, income and gain earned by Asset Pool is used solely to support the provision of retirement and pension benefits by Retirement Plan. Agency is a Country A agency that administers the provision of benefits by Retirement Plan and manages Asset Pool's investments. Under the laws of Country A, investment income earned by Retirement Plan is not subject to Country A's income tax. At the end of each calendar year, Retirement Plan performs a present valuation of the retirement and pension benefits it reasonably expects to provide in the future, and all of the benefits that Retirement Plan reasonably expects to provide are retirement and pension benefits. On January 1, 2024, Agency purchases Property, which is an interest in real property located in the United States owned by Asset Pool. On June 1, 2026, Agency sells Property, realizing $100x of gain with respect to Property that would be subject to tax under section 897(a) unless paragraph (b) of this section applies with respect to the gain.


(ii) *Analysis.* (A) Retirement Plan, which is composed of Asset Pool and Agency, includes one or more governmental units described in paragraph (e)(5) of this section. Accordingly, Retirement Plan is an organization or arrangement described in paragraph (e)(7) of this section. Furthermore, Retirement Plan maintains a qualified segregated account in the form of Asset Pool, an identifiable pool of assets maintained for the sole purpose of funding retirement and pension benefits to beneficiaries of the Retirement Fund (qualified recipients as defined in paragraph (e)(12)(i)(A) of this section). Therefore, Retirement Plan is an eligible fund within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section.


(B) Paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section applies for purposes of determining whether Retirement Plan is an eligible fund that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section and would therefore be treated as a qualified foreign pension fund. Accordingly, the activities of Asset Pool and Agency are integrated and treated as undertaken by a single entity to determine whether the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section are met. However, Asset Pool and Agency must independently satisfy the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.


(C) Retirement Plan is composed of Asset Pool and Agency, each of which is a governmental unit and treated as created or organized under the laws of Country A for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. Accordingly, Retirement Plan satisfies the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.


(D) Retirement Plan is established by Country A as an eligible fund described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*1*)(*i*) of this section to provide retirement and pension benefits, which are qualified benefits described in paragraph (e)(8) of this section, to citizens of Country A, who are qualified recipients described in paragraph (e)(12)(i)(A) of this section because they are eligible to be participants or beneficiaries of Retirement Plan. Accordingly, all of the benefits that Retirement Plan provides are qualified benefits provided to qualified recipients. In addition, Retirement Plan satisfies the requirements of the present valuation test as described in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section. Accordingly, Retirement Plan satisfies the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.


(E) Retirement Plan provides retirement and pension benefits to citizens of Country A aged 65 or older, with no citizen entitled to more than five percent of Retirement Fund's assets or to more than five percent of the income of the eligible fund. Accordingly, Retirement Plan satisfies the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.


(F) Retirement Plan is composed solely of governmental units within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5) of this section. Accordingly, under paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, Retirement Plan is treated as satisfying the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(A) of this section.


(G) Investment income earned by Retirement Plan is not subject to income tax in Country A. Accordingly, Retirement Plan satisfies the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section.


(H) Because Retirement Plan satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Retirement Plan is a qualified foreign pension fund. Because Retirement Plan held no United States real property interests as of January 1, 2023, the earliest date during an uninterrupted period ending on June 1, 2026, the date of the disposition, in which it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Retirement Plan is a qualified holder under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Retirement Plan's gain with respect to Property is attributable solely to Asset Pool, a qualified segregated account maintained by Retirement Plan. Accordingly, under paragraph (b) of this section, the $100x gain realized by Retirement Plan attributable to the disposition of Property is not subject to section 897(a).


(2) *Example 2: Fund established by an employer*—(i) *Facts.* Employer, a corporation organized in Country B, establishes Fund to provide retirement and pension benefits to current and former employees of Employer and S1, a Country B corporation that is wholly owned by Employer. On January 1, 2023, Fund is established as a trust under the laws of Country B, and Employer retains discretion to invest assets and to administer benefits on Fund's behalf. Fund receives contributions from Employer and S1 and contributions from employees of Employer and S1 who are beneficiaries of Fund. All contributions to Fund and all of Fund's earnings are separately accounted for on Fund's books and records and are required by Fund's organizational documents to exclusively fund the provision of benefits to Fund's beneficiaries, except as necessary to satisfy reasonable expenses of Fund. Fund currently has over 100 beneficiaries, a number that is reasonably expected to grow as Employer expands. Fund will pay benefits to employees upon retirement based on years of service and employee contributions, but, if a beneficiary dies before retirement, Fund will pay an incidental death benefit in addition to payment of any accrued retirement and pension benefits to the beneficiary's designee (or deemed designee under local laws if the beneficiary fails to identify a designee). Fund annually performs a present valuation of the benefits it reasonably expects to provide to Fund's beneficiaries, and the valuation concludes that more than 85 percent of the present value of the total benefits it reasonably expects to pay to its beneficiaries in the future are retirement and pension benefits. In addition, it is reasonably expected that the incidental death benefits paid by Fund will account for less than fifteen percent of the present value of the total benefits that Fund expects to provide in the future, and Fund does not reasonably expect to pay any other types of benefits to its beneficiaries in the future. Fund annually provides to the tax authorities of Country B the amount of benefits distributed to each participant (or designee). Country B's tax authorities prescribe rules and regulations governing Fund's operations. Under the laws of Country B, Fund is not taxed on its investment income. On January 1, 2024, Fund purchases Property, which is an interest in real property located in the United States. On June 1, 2026, Fund sells Property, realizing $100x of gain with respect to Property that would be subject to tax under section 897(a) unless paragraph (b) of this section applies with respect to the gain.


(ii) *Analysis.* (A) Fund is a trust that maintains an identifiable pool of assets for the sole purpose of funding retirement and pension benefits and ancillary benefits to current and former employees of the employer group (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3) of this section) that includes Employer and S1 (current and former employees of Employer and S1 constitute qualified recipients, as defined in paragraph (e)(12)(i)(B) of this section). All assets held by Fund and all income earned by Fund are used to provide such benefits. Therefore, Fund is a trust that maintains a qualified segregated account within the meaning of paragraph (e)(13) of this section. Accordingly, Fund is an eligible fund within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section.


(B) Because Fund is created or organized under the laws of Country B, Fund satisfies the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.


(C) The only benefits that Fund provides are retirement and pension benefits described in paragraph (e)(14) of this section and ancillary benefits (that is, the incidental death benefits) described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, both of which constitute qualified benefits described in paragraph (e)(8) of this section, to qualified recipients, described in paragraph (e)(12)(i)(B) of this section. Furthermore, Fund satisfies the requirements of the present valuation test as described in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section. Accordingly, Fund is established by Employer to provide retirement and pension benefits to qualified recipients in consideration for services rendered by such qualified recipients to Employer and S1, and Fund satisfies the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.


(D) No single qualified recipient has a right to more than five percent of the assets or income of the eligible fund. Accordingly, Fund satisfies the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.


(E) Fund is regulated and annually provides to the relevant tax authorities in the foreign jurisdiction in which it is established or operates the amount of qualified benefits provided to each qualified recipient by the eligible fund. Accordingly, Fund satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.


(F) Fund is not subject to income tax on its investment income. Accordingly, Fund satisfies the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section.


(G) Because Fund meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Fund is treated as a qualified foreign pension fund. Furthermore, because Fund held no United States real property interests as of January 1, 2023, the earliest date during an uninterrupted period ending on June 1, 2026, the date of the disposition, in which it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Fund is a qualified holder under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. All of Fund's assets are held in a qualified segregated account within the meaning of paragraph (e)(13) of this section. Accordingly, under paragraph (b) of this section, the $100x gain attributable to the disposition of Property is not subject to section 897(a).


(3) *Example 3: Fund established by an employer at the direction of a foreign jurisdiction*—(i) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(2) of this section (*Example 2*), except that Fund was established by Employer at the direction of Country B and, in addition to being established to provide retirement and pension benefits to current and former employees of Employer and S1, Fund was also established to provide retirement and pension benefits to other employees. All employees that are beneficiaries provide contributions to Fund. Fund makes a determination on at least an annual basis using a reasonable method to measure the number of participants in the Fund who are not current and former employees of Employer and S1. Each time such a determination is made, Fund finds that such employees constitute less than five percent of Fund's total qualified recipients and do not have a right to more than five percent of the assets or income of Fund.


(ii) *Analysis.* Fund satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*1*)(*i*) of this section because it was established by, or at the direction of, Country B to provide retirement and pension benefits to participants or beneficiaries that are current or former employees or persons designated by such employees as a result of services rendered by such employees to their employers. Fund also satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*1*)(*ii*) of this section because it was established by Employer to provide retirement and pension benefits to participants or beneficiaries that are current or former employees or persons designated by such employees in consideration for services rendered by such employees to Employer and S1. Because it satisfies the requirements of both such provisions, under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*2*) of this section, Fund will be treated solely as an eligible fund under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*1*)(*ii*) of this section. As a result, Fund must meet the reporting requirements described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(A) of this section and must apply the definition of qualified recipient described in paragraphs (e)(12)(i)(B) and (C) of this section. Because Fund makes a determination on at least an annual basis using a reasonable method to measure the number of participants in the Fund who are not current and former employees of Employer and S1, finding that such employees constitute less than five percent of Fund's total qualified recipients and do not have a right to more than five percent of the assets or income of Fund, the requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(*1*) of this section, requiring that all of the benefits that an eligible fund provides are provided to qualified recipients, is considered satisfied. Because Fund meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Fund is treated as a qualified foreign pension fund under paragraph (b) of this section. Accordingly, the $100x gain attributable to the disposition of Property is not subject to section 897(a).


(4) *Example 4: Employer controlled organization or arrangement*—(i) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(2) of this section (*Example 2*), except that S2, a Country B corporation that is wholly owned by Employer, performs all tax compliance functions for Employer, S1, and S2, including information reporting with respect to Fund participants.


(ii) *Analysis.* For purposes of the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Fund and S2 are an organization or arrangement that is treated as a single entity under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section and an eligible fund under paragraph (e)(2) of this section with respect to the qualified segregated account held by Fund. Because the eligible fund composed of Fund and S2 satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section (including the rule under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section that each entity satisfy the foreign organization requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section) with respect to the qualified benefits provided to the qualified recipients out of the eligible fund's qualified segregated account (determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section), the eligible fund that is composed of Fund and S2 constitutes a qualified foreign pension fund. Furthermore, the requirements for qualified holder status are satisfied, as described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Thus, under paragraph (b) of this section, the $100x gain attributable to the disposition of Property is not subject to section 897(a).


(5) *Example 5: Third-party assumption of pension liabilities*—(i) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(2) of this section (*Example 2*), except that Fund does not purchase Property on January 1, 2024. In addition, Fund anticipates $100x of qualified benefits will be paid each year beginning on January 1, 2028. Fund enters into an agreement with Guarantor, a privately held Country B corporation, which provides that Fund will, on January 30, 2023, cede a portion of its assets to Guarantor in exchange for annual payments of $100x beginning on January 1, 2028 and continuing until one or more previously identified participants (and their designees) ceases to be eligible to receive benefits. Guarantor has discretion to invest the ceded assets as it chooses, subject to certain agreed upon investment restrictions. Pursuant to its agreement with Fund, Guarantor must maintain Segregated Pool, a pool of assets securing its obligations under its agreement with Fund. The value of Segregated Pool must exceed a specified amount (determined based on an agreed upon formula) until Guarantor's payment obligations are completed, and any remaining assets in Segregated Pool (that is, assets exceeding the required payments to Fund) are retained by Guarantor. Guarantor bears all investment risk with respect to Segregated Pool. Accordingly, Guarantor is required to make annual payments of $100x to Fund regardless of the performance of Segregated Pool. On January 1, 2024, Guarantor purchases stock in Company A, a United States real property holding company that is a United States real property interest, and holds the Company A stock in Segregated Pool. On June 1, 2027, Guarantor sells the stock in Company A, realizing a gain of $100x.


(ii) *Analysis.* The Segregated Pool is not a qualified segregated account, because it is not maintained for the sole purpose of funding qualified benefits to qualified recipients, and because income attributable to assets in the Segregated Pool (including the Company A stock) may inure to Guarantor, which is not a qualified recipient. Accordingly, Fund and Guarantor do not qualify as an organization or arrangement that is an eligible fund with respect to the Company A stock. Therefore, Guarantor is not exempt under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to the $100x of gain realized in connection with the sale of its shares in Company A.


(6) *Example 6: Asset manager*—(i) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(5) of this section (*Example 5*) except that instead of ceding legal ownership of a portion of its assets to Guarantor, Fund transfers the assets into Trust with respect to which Fund is the sole beneficiary on January 30, 2023, and Trust purchases stock in Company A on January 1, 2024. Guarantor has exclusive management authority over the Trust assets and is entitled to a reasonable fixed management fee which it withdraws annually from Trust's assets. On June 1, 2027, Trust sells the stock in Company A, realizing a gain of $100x.


(ii) *Analysis.* For purposes of testing the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Fund and Trust are an organization or arrangement that is treated as a single entity under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section and an eligible fund under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Assets held by Trust are held in a qualified segregated account, and those assets are the assets that are relevant for purposes of determining whether the eligible fund composed of Fund and Trust meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The eligible fund that is composed of Fund and Trust is treated as established by Employer notwithstanding that Guarantor provides management services. See paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*3*) of this section. Paragraph (e)(13)(ii) of this section provides that the assets held by an eligible fund in a qualified segregated account may be used to satisfy reasonable expenses of the eligible fund, such that the reasonable fixed management fee paid to Guarantor does not cause the assets held in Trust to fail to be treated as held in a qualified segregated account. All of the other requirements for qualified foreign pension fund status are satisfied by the eligible fund that is composed of Fund and Trust, as described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. The eligible fund that is composed of Fund and Trust is a qualified holder under paragraph (d)(2) of this section because it held no United States real property interests on January 1, 2023, the earliest date during an uninterrupted period ending on June 1, 2027, the date of the disposition of Company A stock, in which it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The eligible fund that is composed of Fund and Trust is therefore exempt under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to the $100x of gain realized in connection with the sale by Trust of the shares in Company A.


(7) *Example 7: Partnership*—(i) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(5) of this section (*Example 5*) except that instead of ceding legal ownership of the assets to Guarantor, Fund contributes the assets to a partnership (PRS) formed with Guarantor and PRS purchases stock in Company A on January 30, 2023. Guarantor receives a profits interest in the partnership that is reasonable in light of Guarantor's management activity. Guarantor has no direct or indirect ownership in PRS assets, and the partnership agreement provides that upon dissolution, PRS assets would be distributed to Fund. Guarantor serves as the general partner of PRS and has discretionary authority to buy and sell PRS assets without approval from Fund. On June 1, 2027, PRS sells the stock in Company A, realizing a gain of $100x.


(ii) *Analysis.* All of Fund's assets, including the assets held by PRS that are treated as held proportionately by Fund under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, are held in a qualified segregated account within the meaning of paragraph (e)(13) of this section. See paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section (*Example 2*). The eligible fund that is composed of Fund is treated as established by Employer notwithstanding that Guarantor provides management services to PRS. See paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*3*) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section. All of the other requirements for qualified foreign pension fund status are satisfied by Fund as described in paragraphs (f)(2)(ii)(B) through (F) of this section, and Fund is a qualified holder as described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(G) of this section. Accordingly, Fund is exempt under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to its allocable share of the $100x of gain realized in connection with the sale by PRS of the shares in Company A. Guarantor is not exempt under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to its allocable share of the $100x of gain realized in connection with the sale by PRS of the shares in Company A because Guarantor is neither part of the organization or arrangement that forms Fund nor a qualified holder under paragraph (d) of this section that maintains qualified segregated accounts.


(8) *Example 8: Not a qualified holder*—(i) *Facts.* Fund is a qualified foreign pension fund organized in Country C that meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Fund owns all the outstanding stock of OpCo, a manufacturing corporation organized in Country C, in a qualified segregated account maintained by Fund. OpCo was originally formed by a person other than Fund on January 1, 2023. Fund purchased all of the stock of OpCo on November 1, 2023 for the purpose of conducting the manufacturing business and utilizing the business profits to fund pension liabilities. During the period from January 1, 2023, through October 31, 2023, OpCo was not a qualified foreign pension fund, a part of a qualified foreign pension fund, or a qualified controlled entity. On January 30, 2023, OpCo purchased Property A, a United States real property interest, from a third party. For all periods after Fund acquired OpCo, OpCo must either retain or distribute to Fund all of its net earnings, and upon dissolution, must distribute all of its assets to its stockholder (that is, Fund) after satisfaction of liabilities to its creditors. On June 1, 2024, OpCo realizes $100x of gain on the disposition of Property A.


(ii) *Analysis.* (A) A qualified controlled entity described in paragraph (e)(9) of this section includes any corporation organized under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction all the interests of which are owned by one or more qualified foreign pension funds directly or indirectly through one or more qualified controlled entities. Fund is a qualified foreign pension fund that wholly owns OpCo. Accordingly, OpCo is a qualified controlled entity for the period when it is owned by Fund beginning on November 1, 2023.


(B) Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, a qualified controlled entity is a qualified holder only if either, under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the qualified controlled entity owned no United States real property interests as of the earliest date during an uninterrupted period ending on the date of the disposition or distribution in which the qualified controlled entity satisfied the requirements of paragraph (e)(9) of this section, or, under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the qualified controlled entity satisfies the requirements of paragraph (e)(9) of this section throughout the entire testing period. Because OpCo owned a United States real property interest as of November 1, 2023, the earliest date during an uninterrupted period ending on the date of the disposition during which it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (e)(9) of this section, OpCo cannot satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section and must instead satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section to be a qualified holder. Under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, a qualified holder does not include any entity that was not a qualified foreign pension fund, a part of a qualified foreign pension fund, or a qualified controlled entity at any time during the testing period. The testing period with respect to OpCo is the period from January 1, 2023 (the date of OpCo's formation), to June 1, 2024 (the date of the disposition). Because OpCo was not a qualified foreign pension fund, a part of a qualified foreign pension fund, or a qualified controlled entity from January 1, 2023, to October 31, 2023, OpCo was not a qualified foreign pension fund, a part of a qualified foreign pension fund, or a qualified controlled entity at all times during the testing period. Accordingly, OpCo is not a qualified holder with respect to the disposition of Property A, and the $100x of gain recognized by OpCo is not exempt from tax under section 897(l), regardless of the amount of unrealized gain in Property A as of November 1, 2023.


(9) *Example 9: 48-month alternative test*—(i) *Facts.* Fund is a qualified foreign pension fund organized in Country C that, except as otherwise noted, meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Fund owns all the outstanding stock of OpCo, a manufacturing corporation organized in Country C and formed by Fund on January 1, 2023, in a qualified segregated account maintained by Fund. On January 30, 2023, OpCo purchased Property A, a United States real property interest, from a third party. OpCo either retains or distributes to Fund all of its net earnings, and upon dissolution, must distribute all of its assets to its stockholder (that is, Fund) after satisfaction of liabilities to its creditors. On June 1, 2027, OpCo realizes $100x of gain on the disposition of Property A. Fund reasonably expected to provide $90x of retirement and pension benefits and $100x of qualified benefits for the valuations that it performed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*1*) of this section on December 31, 2023, December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2025. Fund reasonably expected to provide $160x of retirement and pension benefits and $200x of qualified benefits for the valuation that it performed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*1*) of this section on December 31, 2026.


(ii) *Analysis.* In each of the years ending on December 31, 2023, December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2025, the valuation performed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*1*) of this section demonstrates that that the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(*2*) of this section have been met because $90x of retirement and pension benefits constitutes 90 percent of the total $100x of qualified benefits. For the year ending on December 31, 2026, the valuation performed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*1*) of this section does not demonstrate that that the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(*2*) of this section have been met because $160x of retirement and pension benefits constitutes only 80 percent of the total $200x of qualified benefits. Thus, Fund does not meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*1*) of this section for the year ending on December 31, 2026. However, under the 48-month alternative calculation in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*2*) of this section, Fund satisfies the requirement that it reasonably expects to provide 85 percent retirement and pension benefits to qualified recipients as of December 31, 2026. This is because when averaging the values (not percentages) of the qualified benefits and retirement and pension benefits that Fund reasonably expected to provide from the valuations performed over the preceding 48 months (including the most recent valuation), Fund divides the total retirement and pension benefits of $430x ($90x + $90x + $90x + $160x) by the total qualified benefits that it reasonably expected to provide of $500x ($100x + $100x + $100x + $200x) for an average of 86 percent. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*3*) of this section, Fund may rely on either the most recent present valuation described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*1*) of this section or the alternative calculation in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*2*) of this section, both of which are determined as of December 31, 2026. Because Fund satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(*2*) of this section under the test in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*2*) of this section, even though it does not do so under the test in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*1*) of this section, Fund is a qualified foreign pension fund with respect to the disposition on June 1, 2027. Because OpCo is held by a qualified foreign pension fund as of the date of the disposition, OpCo is a qualified controlled entity within the meaning of paragraph (e)(9) of this section. Accordingly, the $100x of gain realized by OpCo is exempt from tax under section 897(l).


(10) *Example 10: 48-month alternative test with multiple valuations in the same year*—(i) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(9) of this section (Example 9), except that in the year ending December 31, 2023, Fund carried out two valuations pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*1*) of this section, one on June 30, 2023 and the second on December 31, 2023. For each valuation, Fund reasonably expected to provide $90x of retirement and pension benefits and $100x of qualified benefits. In addition, in the year ending on December 31, 2026, pursuant to a valuation carried out under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*1*) of this section, Fund reasonably expected to provide $150x retirement and pension benefits and $200x of qualified benefits.


(ii) *Analysis.* In each of the years ending on December 31, 2023, December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2025 (including the two valuations performed in 2023), the valuation performed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*1*) of this section demonstrates that the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(*2*) of this section have been met because $90x of retirement and pension benefits constitutes 90 percent of the total $100x of qualified benefits. For the year ending on December 31, 2026, the valuation performed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*1*) of this section does not demonstrate that the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(*2*) of this section have been met because $150x of retirement and pension benefits constitutes 75 percent of the total $200x of qualified benefits. Thus, Fund does not meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*1*) of this section for the year ending on December 31, 2026. Under the 48-month alternative calculation in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*2*) of this section, Fund also does not satisfy the requirement that it reasonably expects to provide 85 percent retirement and pension benefits to qualified recipients as of December 31, 2026. This is because when averaging the values (not percentages) of the qualified benefits and retirement and pension benefits that Fund reasonably expected to provide from the valuations performed over the preceding 48 months (including the most recent valuation), Fund must use a weighted average whereby values are adjusted when the length of valuation periods differs. In this case, each of the two valuations in 2023 must be divided by two for a total weighted average for each valuation of $45x retirement and pension benefits and $50x of qualified benefits. When Fund then divides the total retirement and pension benefits that it reasonably expected to provide of $420x ($45x + $45x + $90x + $90x + $150x) by the total qualified benefits that it reasonably expected to provide of $500x ($50x + $50x + $100x + $100x + $200x), the average is 84 percent. Because Fund does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(*2*) of this section under the test in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*2*) of this section or the test in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*1*) of this section, Fund is not a qualified foreign pension fund with respect to the disposition on June 1, 2027. Because OpCo is not held by a qualified foreign pension fund as of the date of the disposition, OpCo is not a qualified controlled entity within the meaning of paragraph (e)(9) of this section. Accordingly, the $100x of gain realized by OpCo is not exempt from tax under section 897(l).


(11) *Example 11: Qualified foreign pension fund as qualified holder*—(i) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(10) of this section (Example 10), except that OpCo does not dispose of Property A on June 1, 2027 and Fund reasonably expects to provide 85 percent of retirement and pension benefits to qualified recipients in the future in each of the annual present valuations it performs as of December 31, 2027 through December 31, 2033. Fund also satisfies the other requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section during this period. On April 1, 2029, Fund purchases Property B, a United States real property interest, and holds it in a qualified segregated account. On June 1, 2034, Fund realizes $100x of gain on the disposition of Property B and OpCo realizes $100x of gain on the disposition of Property A. At least 85 percent and no more than five percent of the actual value of the aggregate benefits provided by Fund before December 31, 2033, the most recent present value determination, were retirement and pension benefits and non-ancillary benefits, respectively.


(ii) *Analysis.* (A) Because Fund reasonably expected to provide 85 percent of retirement and pension benefits to qualified recipients as of the valuation performed on December 31, 2033, and it met the other requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Fund is a qualified foreign pension fund under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*3*) of this section for the twelve months succeeding the most recent valuation, which includes June 1, 2034, the date of the disposition of Property A and Property B.


(B) Fund is a qualified holder under paragraph (d)(2) of this section because Fund did not own any United States real property interests as of December 31, 2027, the earliest date during the uninterrupted period ending on the date of the disposition, June 1, 2034, during which it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section and therefore qualified as a qualified foreign pension fund. Fund is eligible for the exemption under section 897(l) with respect to the disposition of Property B because it held Property B in a qualified segregated account. Thus, the $100x of gain realized by Fund on the disposition of Property B is exempt from tax under section 897(l).


(C) Because OpCo owned Property A, a United States real property interest, as of December 31, 2027, the earliest date during an uninterrupted period ending on the date of the disposition, June 1, 2034, during which it was a qualified controlled entity, OpCo cannot satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section and must instead satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section to be a qualified holder. The testing period with respect to OpCo, determined under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, ends on June 1, 2034 (the date of the disposition) and begins on June 1, 2024 (the date that is ten years before the disposition date). Because Fund failed to qualify as a qualified foreign pension fund as of December 31, 2026, OpCo was not continuously owned by a qualified foreign pension fund for the duration of the testing period, and thus did not qualify as a qualified foreign pension fund, part of a qualified foreign pension fund, or a qualified controlled entity for the duration of the testing period. As a result, OpCo is not a qualified holder under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Accordingly, the $100x of gain recognized by OpCo on the disposition of Property A is not exempt from tax under section 897(l).


(12) *Example 12: Qualified controlled entity as qualified holder*—(i) *Facts.* Fund is a qualified foreign pension fund organized in Country C that meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023. Fund purchases an interest in Company A, a United States real property holding company, on June 1, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, Fund fails to satisfy the present valuation requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(*2*) of this section and does not satisfy the alternative calculation under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*2*) of this section. From December 31, 2025, through December 31, 2030, Fund satisfies the present valuation requirement of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(*2*) of this section and meets all other requirements in paragraph (c)(2) of this section to be treated as a qualified foreign pension fund. On June 1, 2026, Fund purchases all of the stock of Company B, a Country C corporation that owns no United States real property interests and is not a qualified foreign pension fund, a part of a qualified foreign pension fund, or a qualified controlled entity. On January 1, 2027, Company B purchases Property D, a United States real property interest. Company B retains or distributes to Fund all of its net earnings, and upon dissolution, must distribute all of its assets to its stockholders (that is, Fund) after satisfaction of liabilities to its creditors. On June 1, 2031, Fund realizes $100x of gain on the disposition of stock in Company A, and Company B realizes $100x of gain on the disposition of Property D.


(ii) *Analysis.* (A) Fund owned Company A, a United States real property holding company, as of December 31, 2025, the earliest date during an uninterrupted period ending on the date of the disposition, June 1, 2031, during which Fund satisfied the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Accordingly, to be a qualified holder, Fund must satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The testing period with respect to Fund, determined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, ends on June 1, 2031 (the date of disposition) and begins on June 1, 2021 (the date that is ten years before the disposition date). Fund is not a qualified holder because it failed to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section as of December 31, 2024 and, thus, has not satisfied the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section continuously for the duration of the testing period. Accordingly, the $100x of gain realized by Fund on the disposition of the stock of Company A is not exempt from tax under section 897(l).


(B) Although Fund is not a qualified holder as of June 1, 2031, the date of Company B's disposition of Property D, Fund is still a qualified foreign pension fund because it satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Company B is therefore a qualified controlled entity within the meaning of paragraph (e)(9) of this section as of June 1, 2031, because it is wholly owned by Fund, a qualified foreign pension fund. Notwithstanding that Fund is not a qualified holder under either paragraph (d)(2) or (3) of this section, Company B is a qualified holder under paragraph (d)(2) of this section because Company B did not own a United States real property interest as of June 1, 2026, the earliest date during an uninterrupted period ending on June 1, 2031 (the date of the disposition) during which Company B was a qualified controlled entity.
