(1) *Distributions by a partnership.* A partnership with two or more related partners engages in any of the transactions described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section as follows:


(i) The partnership distributes property to one of the related partners in a current or liquidating distribution, the partnership increases the basis of one or more of its remaining properties under section 734(b) and (c) of the Code, and the applicable threshold described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section is met.

(iii) The partnership distributes property to one of the related partners, the basis of one or more of those distributed properties is increased under section 732(d) of the Code, the distributee acquired all or a part of its interest in the partnership in a transaction that would have been a transaction described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section if the partnership had a section 754 election in effect for the year of transfer, and the applicable threshold described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section is met.


(2) *Transfers of a partnership interest*—(i) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) or (c)(4) of this section, a partner transfers all or a portion of a partnership interest to a related partner in a nonrecognition transaction, the basis of one or more partnership properties is increased under section 743(b)(1) and (c) of the Code, and the applicable threshold described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section is met.


(ii) *Subsequent nonrecognition transfers*—(A) *In general.* If a partner receives an interest in a partnership from a person in a recognition transaction (first transfer) and the basis of one or more partnership properties is increased under section 743(b)(1) and (c) of the Code, and subsequently the partner (transferor) transfers the partnership interest to a person related to the transferor (transferee) in a transaction described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section (subsequent transfer), the subsequent transfer is a transaction described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section only to the extent, if any, that the transferee's basis adjustment under section 743(b)(1) and (c) resulting from the subsequent transfer exceeds the amount of the transferor's remaining basis adjustment described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section that is attributable to the transferred partnership interest (excess amount), and the applicable threshold described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section is met. Only the excess amount is counted towards the applicable threshold described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.


(B) *Transferor's remaining basis adjustment.* A *transferor's remaining basis adjustment* is equal to the amount of the transferor's basis adjustment under section 743(b)(1) and (c) resulting from the first transfer as adjusted under section 1016(a)(2) of the Code to reflect the recovery of the basis adjustment or as otherwise adjusted prior to the subsequent transfer.


(3) *Applicable threshold*—(i) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, for determining whether a transaction is described in paragraph (c)(1) or (2), (d)(1) or (2) of this section, the applicable threshold is met for a taxable year if the sum of all basis increases resulting from all such transactions of a partnership or partner during the taxable year (without netting for any basis adjustment that results in a basis decrease in the same transaction or another transaction) exceeds by at least $10 million the gain recognized from such transactions during the same taxable year, if any, on which tax imposed under subtitle A is required to be paid by any of the related partners (or tax-indifferent party, in the case of a transaction described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) who are a party to such transactions.


(ii) *Six-year lookback period threshold.* In the case of a transaction described in (c) or (d) of this section that occurred within the six-year lookback period, paragraph (c)(3)(i) applies by substituting “$25 million” for “$10 million” for determining whether the applicable threshold is met for a taxable year.


(iii) *Basis increase under section 734(b) and (c) only for shares of basis increase to related partners.* In the case of a transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section for determining whether the applicable threshold is met for a taxable year, a basis increase is an increase to the adjusted basis of the partnership's property under section 734(b)(1) and (c) only to the extent of a related partner's share of the basis increase. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(iii), a partner's share of a basis increase is determined immediately after the distribution under rules similar to the rules of § 1.197-2(h)(12)(iv)(D).


(iv) *Basis increase under sections 732(b) or (c) only for shares of corresponding basis decreases under section 734(b) to related partners or tax-indifferent parties.* In the case of a transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section for determining whether the applicable threshold is met for a taxable year, a basis increase is an increase to the basis of property distributed to one of the related partners under section 732(b) or (c), but excluding the amount of any basis increase that corresponds to a decrease to the basis of property distributed to unrelated partners (other than tax-indifferent parties) under section 732(b) and (c) or to unrelated partners' (other than tax-indifferent parties') shares of a corresponding decrease to the basis of the partnership's remaining property under section 734(b)(2) and (c). For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(iv), a partner's share of a basis decrease is determined immediately after the distribution under rules similar to the rules of § 1.197-2(h)(12)(iv)(D). In the case of a transaction described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, for purposes of determining whether the applicable threshold is met for a taxable year, a basis increase is an increase to the basis of property distributed to one of the partners under section 732(b) or (c) only to the extent of a corresponding decrease to the basis of property distributed to a tax-indifferent party under section 732(b) and (c) or to one or more tax-indifferent party's shares of a corresponding decrease to the basis of the partnership's remaining property under section 734(b)(2) and (c).


(4) *Exclusion of a transfer on the death of a partner.* A transaction described in paragraph (c)(2) or (d)(2) of this section does not include a transfer of a partnership interest that is a transfer on the death of a partner within the meaning of paragraph (b)(13) of this section.


(d) *Substantially similar transaction.* A transaction that is substantially similar (within the meaning of § 1.6011-4(c)(4)) to a transaction described in paragraph (c) of this section includes, but is not limited to:


(1) A transaction that is described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section except that the partners of the partnership are not related and one or more partners of the partnership is a tax-indifferent party that facilitates an increase in the basis of partnership property or an increase in the basis of property held by another partner in the partnership by receiving a distribution of property from the partnership or having a share of a corresponding decrease to the basis of partnership property, and the applicable threshold described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section is met; and


(2) A transaction in which a transferor transfers an interest in a partnership to a transferee that is related to the transferor in a recognition transaction, and the applicable threshold described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section is met.


(e) *Participation*—(1) *In general.* Whether a taxpayer has participated in a transaction of interest described in paragraph (c) of this section or a substantially similar transaction described in paragraph (d) of this section during a taxable year is determined under this paragraph (e).


(2) *Participating partners.* A participating partner participates in a transaction of interest described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or a substantially similar transaction described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section in any taxable year in which the partner directly receives a distribution of property, or directly transfers or receives an interest in a participating partnership, in a transaction described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section or a substantially similar transaction described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.


(3) *Participating partnerships.* A participating partnership participates in a transaction of interest described in paragraph (c) or a substantially similar transaction described in paragraph (d) of this section in any taxable year in which the partnership makes a distribution of property to a participating partner in a transaction described in paragraph (c)(1) or (d)(1) of this section, or a participating partnership interest is transferred in a transaction described in paragraph (c)(2) or (d)(2) of this section.


(4) *Related subsequent transferees.* A related subsequent transferee participates in a transaction of interest described in paragraph (c) of this section or a substantially similar transaction described in paragraph (d) of this section in any taxable year in which the related subsequent transferee directly receives, in a nonrecognition transaction, a transfer (including a distribution) of property that was subject to an increase in basis as a result of a transaction described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section that was required to be disclosed under paragraph (f) of this section.


(5) *Subsequent realization of tax benefit.* A participating partnership, participating partner, or related subsequent transferee also participates in a transaction of interest described in paragraph (c) or a substantially similar transaction described in paragraph (d) of this section in any taxable year in which its tax return reflects the tax consequences of a basis increase resulting from a transaction of interest described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, taking into account the limitations provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section. For example, if a participating partner sells property the basis of which has been increased as a result of a transaction of interest described in paragraph (c) of this section during a taxable year after the taxable year in which the transaction of interest occurred, the participating partner participates in a transaction of interest described in paragraph (c) of this section in the taxable year of the basis increase and in the taxable year of the sale.


(f) *Disclosure requirements*—(1) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (f)(1), participants must provide the information required under § 1.6011-4(d) and the Instructions to Form 8886, *Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement* (or successor form), and in the manner described in § 1.6011-4(e), for each taxable year in which the participant participated in a transaction described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section as determined under paragraph (e) of this section. For all participants, describing the transaction in sufficient detail includes describing the information described in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, as applicable, on Form 8886 (or successor form) for the taxable year of a transaction described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section. In the case of a participant that is a tax-indifferent party, the disclosure requirements of this paragraph (f) apply only if the tax-indifferent party is otherwise required to file a tax return (or an information return) for the taxable year of the transaction described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.


(i) The names and identifying numbers of all participants, including the participating partnership, participating partners and any related subsequent transferees.


(ii) All basis adjustments resulting from a transaction described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, including—


(A) Basis information, including the participating partnership's adjusted basis in the distributed property immediately before the distribution,


(B) Any adjustments to basis under section 732(a)(2), (b), (d) or section 734(b),


(C) Any adjustments to basis under section 743(b) with respect to a participating partner that is transferred an interest in a participating partnership, and


(D) With respect to a participating partner that transfers an interest in a participating partnership, that participating partner's adjusted basis in the participating partnership interest and share of the participating partnership's adjusted basis in its property immediately before the transfer.


(iii) Any Federal income tax consequences realized during the taxable year as a result of a transaction described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, including any cost recovery allowances attributable to any increase in basis as a result of a transaction described in paragraph (c) of this section, and any gain or loss attributable to the disposition of property that was subject to an increase in basis as a result of a transaction described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section. The Federal income tax consequences attributable to an increase in basis resulting from a transaction described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section are limited to those attributable to the increase in basis, taking into account the limitations of paragraph (c)(3)(iii) or (iv) of this section. For example, in the case of a distribution of depreciable property that was subject to an increase in basis because of a transaction described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, the Federal income tax consequences realized during the taxable year include the basis increase and cost recovery allowances attributable to the basis increase during the taxable year.


(2) *Six-year lookback period for taxable years described in special rule of § 1.6011-4(e)(2)(i).* For purposes of the special rule of § 1.6011-4(e)(2)(i) (describing the disclosure requirement with respect to a transaction that is identified as a transaction of interest after the filing of the taxpayer's tax return (including an amended return) reflecting the taxpayer's participation in the transaction of interest but before the end of the period of limitations for assessment of tax for such taxable year), a participant must provide the information described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section for such open years only if the transaction described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section occurred within the six-year lookback period described in paragraph (b)(11) of this section.


(g) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section.


(1) *Example 1: Reporting by a participating partner and participating partnership in the taxable year of the transaction, including cost recovery allowances*—(i) *Facts.* ABC Partnership is owned by partners A, B, and C. Partners A, B, and C are related within the meaning of paragraphs (b)(8) and (9) of this section. At the beginning of taxable year 2025, ABC Partnership distributes a depreciable asset, Property X, to Partner A in liquidation of Partner A's interest in ABC Partnership. The distribution is a transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. As a result of the distribution, the basis of Property X is increased by $10 million in Partner A's hands. On its tax return for taxable year 2025, Partner A reports deductions for depreciation expense attributable to the $10 million increase in the basis of Property X resulting from the transaction under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. In addition, ABC Partnership must reduce the basis of its remaining property under section 734(b)(2) as a result of the distribution of Property X to Partner A by $10 million. ABC Partnership and Partner A use the calendar year as their taxable year.


(ii) *Analysis.* Partner A is a participant during taxable year 2025 within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this section because it is a participating partner within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3) of this section since it directly received a distribution of property during taxable year 2025 in a transaction described in paragraph (c) of this section. ABC Partnership is a participant during taxable year 2025 within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this section because it is a participating partnership within the meaning of paragraph (b)(4) of this section since it made a distribution of property to a participating partner during taxable year 2025 in a transaction described in paragraph (c) of this section. As part of its disclosure requirements under paragraph (f) of this section and § 1.6011-4(d) and (e), Partner A must disclose the distribution as a transaction of interest under this section on Form 8886 (or successor form) and file the form with its tax return for taxable year 2025. Partner A must include the information described in paragraph (f) of this section, including the amount of the deductions attributable to the $10 million increase in the basis of Property X resulting from the transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. As part of its disclosure requirements under paragraph (f) of this section and § 1.6011-4(d) and (e), ABC Partnership must disclose the distribution as a transaction of interest under this section on Form 8886 (or successor form) and file the form with its tax return for taxable year 2025, including the information described in paragraph (f) of this section. In addition, Partner A and ABC Partnership must send a copy of their respective Form 8886 (or successor form) to the Office of Tax Shelter Analysis (OTSA).


(2) *Example 2: Reporting of the Federal income tax consequences (cost recovery allowances) of the transaction in all taxable years*—(i) *Facts.* Under the same facts as in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section (*Example 1),* on its tax returns for taxable years 2026 through 2030, Partner A reports deductions for depreciation expense attributable to the $10 million increase in the basis of Property X related to the transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, which occurred in taxable year 2025.


(ii) *Analysis.* As part of its disclosure requirements under paragraph (f) of this section and § 1.6011-4(d) and (e), Partner A must disclose the deductions on Form 8886 (or successor form) for taxable years 2026 through 2030 as the Federal income tax consequences of the transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. As a result, for each of taxable years 2026 through 2030, Partner A must file the form with its tax return for the taxable year with the information described in paragraph (f) of this section, including the amount of the deductions for the taxable year attributable to the $10 million increase in the basis of Property X resulting from the transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.


(3) *Example 3: Reporting by a participating partner, participating partnership, and related subsequent transferee in the taxable year of the transaction*—(i) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section (*Example 1),* except that at the beginning of taxable year 2025, instead of distributing a depreciable asset, ABC Partnership distributes a nondepreciable asset, Land with an adjusted basis of $5 million, to Partner A in liquidation of Partner A's interest in ABC Partnership. The distribution is a transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. As a result of the distribution, the basis of Land is increased to $15 million in Partner A's hands. Subsequently in the same taxable year 2025, Partner A contributes Land to another partnership, AX Partnership, in a transfer that is treated as a contribution of property under section 721(a). Partner A and AX Partnership are related within the meaning of paragraph (b)(8) of this section. ABC Partnership, Partner A and AX Partnership use the calendar year as their taxable year.


(ii) *Analysis.* Partner A is a participant during taxable year 2025 within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this section because it is a participating partner within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3) of this section since Partner A directly received a distribution of property during taxable year 2025 in a transaction described in paragraph (c) of this section. ABC Partnership is a participant during taxable year 2025 within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this section because it is a participating partnership within the meaning of paragraph (b)(4) of this section since it made a distribution of property to a participating partner during taxable year 2025 in a transaction described in paragraph (c) of this section. AX Partnership is a participant during taxable year 2025 within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this section because it is a related subsequent transferee within the meaning of paragraph (b)(10) of this section since it directly received in a nonrecognition transaction a transfer of property during taxable year 2025 that was subject to an increase in basis because of a transaction described in paragraph (c) of this section. As part of its disclosure requirements under paragraph (f) of this section and § 1.6011-4(d) and (e), Partner A must disclose the distribution as a transaction of interest under this section on Form 8886 (or successor form) and file the form with its tax return for taxable year 2025. Partner A must include the information described in paragraph (f) of this section. As part of its disclosure requirements under paragraph (f) of this section and § 1.6011-4(d) and (e), ABC Partnership must disclose the distribution as a transaction of interest under this section on Form 8886 (or successor form) and file the form with its tax return for taxable year 2025, including the information described in paragraph (f) of this section. Further, AX Partnership is subject to the disclosure requirements under paragraph (f) of this section and § 1.6011-4(d) and (e). AX Partnership must disclose that it is a related subsequent transferee within the meaning of paragraph (b)(10) of this section that received, in a nonrecognition transaction, a transfer of property that was distributed in a transaction of interest under this section on Form 8886 (or successor form) and file the form with its tax return for taxable year 2025. In addition, Partner A, ABC Partnership and AX Partnership must send a copy of their respective Form 8886 (or successor form) to the OTSA.


(4) *Example 4: Reporting of the Federal income tax consequences (reduced taxable gain) of the transaction in the taxable year of disposition of the property*—(i) *Facts.* Under the same facts as in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section (*Example 3),* in taxable year 2026, AX Partnership disposes of Land in a taxable sale for its fair market value of $15 million and recognizes no gain or loss.


(ii) *Analysis.* As part of its disclosure requirements under paragraph (f) of this section and § 1.6011-4(d) and (e), AX Partnership must disclose the taxable gain (zero) on the disposition of Land on Form 8886 (or successor form) for taxable year 2026 as the Federal income tax consequences of the transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. AX Partnership must file the form with its tax return for taxable year 2026. Partner A does not have a disclosure requirement with respect to AX Partnership's disposition of Land because the disposition is a subsequent realization of a tax benefit within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5) of this section with respect to AX Partnership.


(5) *Example 5. Reporting of a transaction of interest that occurred within the six-year lookback period*—(i) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section (*Example 1),* except that instead of ABC Partnership distributing Property X in taxable year 2025, the distribution is made in May of taxable year 2022, which is within the six-year lookback period described in paragraph (b)(11) of this section. That is, the distribution occurred within the seventy-two months immediately preceding January 2025, the first month of the taxpayer's most recent taxable year that began before January 14, 2025. Further, taxable year 2022 is an open taxable year subject to the special rule of § 1.6011-4(e)(2)(i). Additionally, neither Partner A nor ABC Partnership engages in any other transaction described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section for taxable year 2022.


(ii) *Analysis.* Because the transaction occurred within the six-year lookback period described in paragraph (b)(11) of this section, the applicable threshold described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section is $25 million as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. The distribution of Property X to Partner A is not a transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section with respect to either Partner A or ABC Partnership because the applicable threshold is not met for taxable year 2022. Had the applicable threshold for taxable year 2022 been met, all the information required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section must be reported in its disclosure for taxable year 2022 and for any subsequent taxable year for which the taxpayer's return reflected the tax consequences of the transaction.


(6) *Example 6. No reporting of a transaction of interest for transaction that occurred prior to the six-year lookback period*—(i) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section (*Example 1),* except that as a result of the distribution of Property X to Partner A, the basis of Property X is increased by $30 million, and the distribution occurred in December of taxable year 2018, which is prior to the six-year lookback period described in paragraph (b)(11) of this section. That is, the transaction occurred prior to January 2019, which is the beginning of the seventy-two-month period that ends in December 2024. In addition, taxable year 2018 is an open taxable year subject to the special rule of § 1.6011-4(e)(2)(i). Further, Partner A realized Federal income tax consequences (depreciation expense) in taxable year 2019 attributable to the $30 million increase to the basis of Property X and taxable year 2019 is an open taxable year subject to the special rule of § 1.6011-4(e)(2)(i).


(ii) *Analysis.* Because taxable year 2018 is not within the six-year lookback period, under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, neither the distribution of Property X to Partner A, nor any of the Federal income tax consequences arising in that taxable year or later taxable years (such as depreciation expense in taxable year 2019 or any later taxable year) from such distribution, is required to be disclosed under paragraph (f) of this section and §§ 1.6011-4(d) and (e).


(7) *Example 7. Corresponding basis decrease under section 734(b)(2)(B) shared by an unrelated partner*—(i) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section (*Example 1),* except Partner C is unrelated to Partners A and B and is not a tax-indifferent party. As a result of the distribution of Property X to Partner A, and the increase to the basis of Property X by $10 million in Partner A's hands, ABC Partnership is required to reduce the adjusted basis of its remaining properties under section 734(b)(2)(B) by $10 million. Partner B's and Partner C's share of ABC Partnership's basis decrease to its remaining properties is $5 million each. Neither Partner A nor ABC Partnership engages in any other transaction described in paragraph (c) of this section for taxable year 2025.


(ii) *Analysis.* For purposes of paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (c)(3)(i) of this section, under paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section, only $5 million of the $10 million basis increase to Property X counts toward the applicable threshold because $5 million of the basis increase corresponds to unrelated Partner C's share of the decrease to the basis of ABC Partnership's remaining properties under section 734(b)(2)(B) and thus, is excluded from the calculation of the applicable threshold. Thus, the distribution of Property X to Partner A is not a transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section with respect to either Partner A or ABC Partnership because the applicable threshold is not met for taxable year 2025.


(h) *Extension of time—(1) Taxpayer disclosures.* Taxpayers will be treated as having met their requirements to disclose timely under § 1.6011-4(e)(2)(i) if they file their disclosure with the OTSA by July 14, 2025.


(2) *Material advisor disclosures.* Material advisors who have made a tax statement before January 14, 2025 will be treated as having met their requirements to disclose timely under § 301.6111-3(e) of this chapter if they file their disclosure with the OTSA by the date that is an additional 90 days beyond the last day for filing specified in § 301.6111-3(e) of this chapter.


(i) *Applicability date*—(1) *In general.* This section's identification of transactions that are the same as or substantially similar (within the meaning of § 1.6011-4(c)(4)) to the transactions described in paragraph (c) of this section as transactions of interest for purposes of § 1.6011-4(b)(6) and sections 6111 and 6112 of the Code is effective January 14, 2025.


(2) *Material advisors.* Notwithstanding §  301.6111-3(b)(4)(i) and (iii) of this chapter, material advisors are required to disclose only if they have made a tax statement on or after January 14, 2019.
