# § 1.6011-9   Syndicated conservation easement listed transactions.

(a) *Identification as listed transaction.* Transactions that are the same as, or substantially similar to, a transaction described in paragraph (b) of this section are identified as listed transactions for purposes of § 1.6011-4(b)(2).


(b) *Syndicated conservation easement transaction.* The term *syndicated conservation easement transaction* means a transaction in which the following steps occur (regardless of the order in which they occur)—


(1) A taxpayer receives promotional materials that offer investors in a pass-through entity the possibility of being allocated a charitable contribution deduction the amount of which equals or exceeds an amount that is two and one-half times the amount of the taxpayer's investment, as determined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, in the pass-through entity, as determined under paragraph (d) of this section (2.5 times rule);


(2) The taxpayer acquires an interest, directly or indirectly through one or more tiers of pass-through entities, in the pass-through entity that owns or acquires real property (that is, becomes an investor in the entity);


(3) The pass-through entity that owns the real property contributes an easement on such real property, which it treats as a conservation easement, to a qualified organization and allocates, directly or through one or more tiers of pass-through entities, a charitable contribution deduction to the taxpayer; and


(4) The taxpayer claims a charitable contribution deduction with respect to the contribution of the real property interest on the taxpayer's Federal income tax return.


(c) *Definitions.* The following definitions apply for purposes of this section:


(1) *Charitable contribution deduction.* The term *charitable contribution deduction* means a deduction under section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), which includes a deduction arising from a qualified conservation contribution as defined in section 170(h)(1) of the Code.


(2) *Conservation easement.* The term *conservation easement* means a restriction (granted in perpetuity) on the use which may be made of the real property, within the meaning of section 170(h)(2)(C) of the Code, exclusively for conservation purposes, within the meaning of section 170(h)(1)(C) and (h)(4) of the Code.


(3) *Pass-through entity.* The term *pass-through entity* means a partnership, S corporation, or trust (other than a grantor trust within the meaning of subchapter J of chapter 1 of the Code).


(4) *Promotional materials.* The term *promotional materials* includes materials described in § 301.6112-1(b)(3)(iii)(B) of this chapter and any other written or oral communication regarding the transaction provided to investors, such as marketing materials, appraisals (including preliminary appraisals, draft appraisals, and the appraisal that is attached to the taxpayer's return), websites, transactional documents such as deeds of conveyance, private placement memoranda, tax opinions, operating agreements, subscription agreements, statements of the anticipated value of the conservation easement, and statements of the anticipated amount of the charitable contribution deduction.


(5) *Qualified organization.* The term *qualified organization* means an organization described in section 170(h)(3) of the Code.


(6) *Real property.* The term *real property* includes all land, structures, and buildings, including a certified historic structure defined in section 170(h)(4)(C) of the Code.


(7) *Substantially similar.* The term *substantially similar* is defined in § 1.6011-4(c)(4). For example, transactions that meet the elements of paragraph (b) of this section, except that the pass-through entity contributes a fee simple interest in real property or a real property interest described in section 170(h)(2)(A) or (B) of the Code rather than a conservation easement, are substantially similar to the listed transaction identified in this section.


(d) *Application of the 2.5 times rule*—(1) *Bright-line rule.* Transactions for which the promotional materials offer the taxpayer the possibility of being allocated a charitable contribution deduction of only an amount less than 2.5 times the taxpayer's investment and for which the taxpayer is actually allocated a charitable contribution deduction of an amount less than 2.5 times the taxpayer's investment (so that the rebuttable presumption in paragraph (d)(3) of this section does not apply) are generally not considered *substantially similar* to the listed transaction identified in this section. However, if a pass-through entity engages in a series of transactions with a principal purpose of avoiding the application of the bright-line rule in this paragraph (d)(1), the series of transactions may be disregarded or the arrangement may be recharacterized in accordance with its substance. Whether a series of transactions has a principal purpose of avoiding the application of this bright-line rule is determined based on all the facts and circumstances.


(2) *Multiple suggested contribution amounts.* If the promotional materials suggest or imply a range of possible charitable contribution deduction amounts that may be allocated to the taxpayer, the highest suggested or implied contribution amount determines whether the 2.5 times rule in this paragraph (d) is met. In addition, if one piece of promotional materials (for example, an appraisal or oral statement) states a higher charitable contribution deduction amount than stated by other promotional materials, then the highest stated charitable contribution deduction amount determines whether the 2.5 times rule is met.


(3) *Rebuttable presumption.* The 2.5 times rule in this paragraph (d) is deemed to be met if the pass-through entity donates a real property interest within three years following the taxpayer's investment in the pass-through entity, the pass-through entity allocates a charitable contribution deduction to the taxpayer the amount of which equals or exceeds two and one-half times the amount of the taxpayer's investment, and the taxpayer claims a charitable contribution deduction the amount of which equals or exceeds two and one-half times the amount of the taxpayer's investment. This presumption may be rebutted if the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that none of the promotional materials contained a suggestion or implication that investors might be allocated a charitable contribution deduction that equals or exceeds an amount that is two and one-half times the amount of their investment in the pass-through entity.


(4) *Determining the amount of the taxpayer's investment in the pass-through entity*—(i) *In general.* A taxpayer may determine the amount of the taxpayer's investment in the pass-through entity for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section using either the anti-stuffing method in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section or, for contributions made after December 29, 2022, the relevant basis method in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section. No other methods may be used.


(ii) *Anti-stuffing method.* Under the anti-stuffing method, the amount of a taxpayer's investment in the pass-through entity is the portion of the cash or fair market value of the assets the taxpayer uses to acquire its interest in the pass-through entity that is attributable to the real property on which a conservation easement is placed (or the portion thereof, if an easement is placed on a portion of the real property) that gives rise to the charitable contribution described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. For example, if a portion of the taxpayer's cost of acquiring the taxpayer's interest in the pass-through entity is attributable to property held directly or indirectly by the pass-through entity other than the real property on which a conservation easement is placed as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section (such other property may include other real property, cash, cash equivalents, digital assets, marketable securities, or other tangible or intangible assets), that portion of the taxpayer's acquisition cost is not considered part of the taxpayer's investment for purposes of this section because it is not attributable to the portion of the real property on which a conservation easement is placed as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(4)(ii), assets retained to pay for costs related to the operation and maintenance of the real property on which the conservation easement is placed, including costs that may be incurred in future years, are not attributable to the real property on which a conservation easement is placed as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. In the case of a substantially similar transaction described in paragraph (c)(7) of this section, the rules in this paragraph (d)(4)(ii) apply except that the relevant real property that gives rise to the charitable contribution deduction described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section is the real property donated.


(iii) *Relevant basis method.* For contributions made after December 29, 2022, taxpayers may use their relevant basis, as determined in accordance with section 170(h)(7)(B) of the Code and § 1.170A-14(k), as the amount of their investment for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section.


(5) *Examples.* For the examples in this paragraph (d)(5), assume that the partnerships are respected for Federal tax purposes, and that the partnership allocations comply with the rules of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Code.


(i) *Example 1*—(A) *Facts.* Individual A purchased an interest in P, a partnership that owns real property with a fair market value of $500,000 and marketable securities with a fair market value of $500,000. A is one of four equal investors in P, each of whom purchased its interest in P for $250,000 of cash. With respect to an investor's $250,000 payment for its interest in P, the promotional materials stated that P expected to allocate a $500,000 charitable contribution deduction to the investor (that is, a charitable contribution deduction that is two times the amount an investor paid for its interest in P). After all four investors have purchased their interests in P, P donates a conservation easement on all of its real property to a qualified organization as defined in section 170(h)(3) of the Code and reports a $2,000,000 charitable contribution on its Form 1065, *U.S. Return of Partnership Income,* based on P obtaining an appraisal indicating that the value of the conservation easement is $2,000,000. The Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) that P furnishes to A indicates that P allocated a charitable contribution deduction to A for the taxable year. A claims a charitable contribution deduction with respect to the charitable contribution on A's Federal income tax return.


(B) *Analysis.* A's cost of acquiring its interest in P is $250,000. The real property on which a conservation easement was placed and that gave rise to the charitable contribution deduction described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section was P's property valued at $500,000. P's only other asset was marketable securities worth $500,000. Accordingly, half of A's share of the value of the assets held by P was attributable to the real property on which P placed a conservation easement and that gave rise to the charitable contribution deduction described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the amount of A's investment in P is $125,000 (that is, half of A's $250,000 acquisition cost, which is the portion of A's acquisition cost that is attributable to the real property on which P placed a conservation easement and that gave rise to the charitable contribution deduction described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section). Because A's investment for purposes of the 2.5 times rule is $125,000 and A's expected charitable contribution deduction, based on the promotional materials, is $500,000 (that is, an expected deduction that is four times A's investment), the 2.5 times rule of paragraph (b)(1) of this section is met. The transaction also meets the other elements of a syndicated conservation easement within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section and therefore is a listed transaction for purposes of § 1.6011-4(b)(2).


(ii) *Example 2*—(A) *Facts.* Individual B acquires a ten percent interest in InvestCo, a partnership, by making a $250,000 cash contribution. Immediately after B's acquisition, InvestCo's only asset is $2,500,000 of cash. The promotional materials state that InvestCo expects to allocate a $500,000 charitable contribution deduction to B with respect to B's partnership interest. InvestCo pays $600,000 to purchase marketable securities. InvestCo also purchases an interest in another partnership, PropCo, for $1,900,000 from one of PropCo's partners. At the same time as the purchase, InvestCo also contributes $100,000 of its marketable securities to PropCo. Immediately after InvestCo's purchase and contribution, PropCo's only assets are real property worth $2,400,000 and the marketable securities worth $100,000. PropCo donates its entire interest in the real property (a fee simple interest) to a qualified organization as defined in section 170(h)(3) of the Code and reports a $6,250,000 charitable contribution on its Form 1065, *U.S. Return of Partnership Income,* based on PropCo obtaining an appraisal indicating that the value of the real property is $6,250,000. PropCo allocates a portion of the charitable contribution deduction to InvestCo. The Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) that InvestCo furnishes to B indicates that InvestCo allocated a charitable contribution deduction to B for the taxable year. B claims a charitable contribution deduction with respect to the contribution on B's Federal income tax return.


(B) *Analysis.* Immediately after InvestCo's acquisition of its interest in PropCo, InvestCo's only assets were its interest in PropCo and $500,000 in marketable securities. Accordingly, eighty percent of InvestCo's funds ($2,000,000/$2,500,000) were used to acquire its interest in PropCo. B's investment in InvestCo is $250,000; therefore, eighty percent of that amount, $200,000, is attributable to InvestCo's interest in PropCo. Immediately after InvestCo's acquisition of its interest in PropCo, PropCo had real property worth $2,400,000 and marketable securities worth $100,000. As such, ninety-six percent ($2,400,000/$2,500,000) of PropCo's assets were the real property that was subsequently donated. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the amount of B's investment in InvestCo that is attributable to the donated real property that gave rise to the charitable contribution deduction described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section is $200,000 multiplied by ninety-six percent, or $192,000. Because B's investment for purposes of the 2.5 times rule is $192,000 and B's expected charitable contribution deduction, based on the promotional materials, is $500,000 (that is, an expected deduction that is at least 2.5 times B's investment), the 2.5 times rule of paragraph (b)(1) of this section is met. The transaction also meets the other elements of a syndicated conservation easement within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section, except that PropCo contributed a fee simple interest in real property rather than a conservation easement. Under paragraph (c)(7) of this section, the transaction is substantially similar to the listed transaction described in paragraph (b) of this section and, therefore, under paragraph (a) of this section, the transaction in this example is a listed transaction for purposes of § 1.6011-4(b)(2).


(e) *Participation in a syndicated conservation easement transaction*—(1) *In general.* Whether a taxpayer has participated in a syndicated conservation easement transaction described in paragraph (b) of this section is determined under § 1.6011-4(c)(3)(i)(A).


(2) *Class of participants.* For purposes of § 1.6011-4(c)(3)(i)(A), participants in a transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar to, a syndicated conservation easement transaction described in paragraph (b) of this section include—


(i) An owner of a pass-through entity;


(ii) A pass-through entity; and


(iii) Any other taxpayer whose Federal income tax return reflects tax consequences or a tax strategy arising from a transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar to, the transaction described in paragraph (b) of this section.


(3) *Exclusion.* A qualified organization to which the conservation easement is donated is not treated as a participant under § 1.6011-4(c)(3)(i)(A) in a syndicated conservation easement transaction described in paragraph (b) of this section.


(f) *Application of section 4965.* A qualified organization to which the real property interest is donated is not treated under section 4965 of the Code as a party to the transaction described in paragraph (b) of this section.


(g) *Disclosures under Notice 2017-10.* A taxpayer who disclosed their participation in a transaction pursuant to Notice 2017-10 and in accordance with § 1.6011-4 before October 8, 2024, is treated as having made the disclosure required under this section and § 1.6011-4, for the years covered by that disclosure, as of the date of the disclosure under Notice 2017-10.


(h) *Applicability date*—(1) *In general.* This section's identification of transactions that are the same as, or substantially similar to, the transactions described in paragraph (b) of this section as listed transactions for purposes of § 1.6011-4(b)(2) and sections 6111 and 6112 of the Code is effective October 8, 2024.


(2) *Applicability date for material advisors.* Notwithstanding § 301.6111-3(b)(4)(i) and (iii) of this chapter, material advisors are required to disclose only if they have made a tax statement on or after October 8, 2018.
