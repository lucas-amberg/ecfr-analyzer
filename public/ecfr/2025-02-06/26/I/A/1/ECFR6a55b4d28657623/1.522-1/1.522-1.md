# § 1.522-1   Tax treatment of farmers' cooperative marketing and purchasing associations exempt under section 521.

(a) *In general.* (1) Section 522 is applicable to farmers', fruit growers', or like associations organized and operated on a cooperative basis in the manner prescribed in section 521. Although such an association is subject to both normal tax and surtax, as in the case of corporations generally, certain special rules for the computation of taxable income are provided in section 522(b) and § 1.522-2. For the purpose of any law which refers to organizations exempt from income taxes such an association shall, however, be considered as an organization exempt under section 501. Thus, the provisions of section 243, providing a credit for dividends received from a domestic corporation subject to taxation, are not applicable to dividends received from a cooperative association subject to section 522. The provisions of section 1501, relating to consolidated returns, are likewise not applicable.


(2) Rules governing the manner in which amounts allocated as patronage dividends, refunds, or rebates are to be taken into account in computing the taxable income of such an association are set forth in § 1.522-3. For the tax treatment, as to patrons, of amounts received during the taxable year as patronage dividends, rebates, or refunds, see section 61 and § 1.61-5.


(b) *Meaning of terms.* For purposes of §§ 1.522-1 to 1.522-3, inclusive, §§ 1.6044-1 and 1.61-5, the following terms shall have the meaning ascribed below:


(1) *Cooperative association.* The term *cooperative association* includes any corporation operating on a cooperative basis and allocating amounts to patrons on the basis of the business done with or for such patrons, except that the term does not include any cooperative or nonprofit corporation (including any cooperative or nonprofit corporation engaged in rural electrification) exempt from taxation under section 501(a) and described in section 501(c) (12) or (15) or any corporation subject to a tax imposed by subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code (relating to insurance companies).


(2) *Patron.* The term *patron* includes any person with whom or for whom the cooperative association does business on a cooperative basis, whether a member or a nonmember of the cooperative association, and whether an individual, a trust, estate, partnership, company, corporation, or cooperative association.


(3) *Allocation.* The term *allocation* includes distributions made by a cooperative association to a patron in cash, merchandise, capital stock, revolving fund certificates, retain certificates, certificates of indebtedness, letters of advice, similar documents, or in any other manner whereby there is disclosed to a patron the dollar amount apportioned on the books of the association for the account of such patron. Thus, a mere credit to the account of a patron on the books of the cooperative association, without disclosure to the patron, is not an allocation.


(4) *Patronage dividends, rebates, and refunds.* The term *patronage dividend, rebate, or refund* includes any amount allocated by a cooperative association, to the account of a patron on the basis of the business done with or for such patron. The following are not patronage dividends, rebates, or refunds:


(i) Amounts distributed in redemption of capital stock, or in redemption or satisfaction of certificates of indebtedness, revolving fund certificates, retain certificates, letters of advice, or other similar documents;


(ii) Amounts allocated (whether in cash, merchandise, capital stock, revolving fund certificates, retain certificates, certificates of indebtedness, letters of advice, or in some other manner that discloses to each patron the amount of such dividend, refund, or rebate) by the association for products of members or other patrons to the extent such amounts are fixed without reference to the earnings of the cooperative association. For this purpose, the term *earnings* includes the excess of amounts retained (or assessed) by the association to cover expenses or other items over the amount of such expenses or other items.


(c) *Examples.* The application of paragraph (b) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:


(d) *Returns of exempt cooperative associations.* For requirements of annual returns by exempt cooperative associations, see sections 6012 and 6072(d) and paragraph (f) of § 1.6012-2.
