# § 1.9300-1   Reduction in taxable income for housing displaced individuals.

(a) *In general.* For a taxable year beginning in the applicable taxable year (as defined in paragraph (f)(1) of this section), a taxpayer who is a natural person may reduce taxable income by $500 for each displaced individual (as defined in paragraph (f)(2) of this section) to whom the taxpayer provides housing free of charge in, or on the site of, the taxpayer's principal residence for a period of at least 60 consecutive days. A taxpayer may claim the reduction in taxable income for any applicable taxable year in which a consecutive 60-day period ends. A taxpayer may not claim the reduction in taxable income unless the taxpayer includes the taxpayer identification number of the displaced individual on the taxpayer's income tax return.


(b) *Provision of housing*—(1) *Principal residence.* For purposes of this section, the term principal residence has the same meaning as in section 121 and the associated regulations. *See* § 1.121-1(b)(1) and (b)(2).


(2) *Legal interest required.* A taxpayer is treated as providing housing for purposes of this section only if the taxpayer is an owner or lessee (including a co-owner or co-lessee) of the principal residence.


(3) *Compensation for providing housing.* No reduction in taxable income is allowed under this section to a taxpayer who receives rent or any reimbursement or compensation (whether in cash, services, or property) from any source for providing housing to the displaced individual. For this purpose, lodging, utilities, and other similar items are treated as housing, but telephone calls, food, clothing, transportation, and other similar items are not treated as housing.


(c) *Limitations*—(1) *Dollar limitation*—(i) *In general.* The reduction in taxable income under paragraph (a) of this section may not exceed the maximum dollar limitation, and must be reduced by the total amount of all reductions under this section for all prior taxable years (except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section). The maximum dollar limitation is—


(A) $2,000 in the case of an unmarried individual; or


(B) $2,000 in the case of a husband and wife, whether the husband and wife file a joint income tax return or separate income tax returns; married taxpayers filing separate income tax returns may allocate this amount in $500 increments between their respective returns, provided that each spouse is otherwise eligible to claim that reduction in taxable income.


(ii) *Married individuals with separate principal residences.* The limitation in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section applies whether or not the married individuals occupy the same principal residence. A person is treated as married for purposes of this section if the individual is treated as married under section 7703.


(2) *Spouse or dependent of the taxpayer.* No reduction of taxable income is allowed for a displaced individual who is the spouse or a dependent of the taxpayer.


(3) *One reduction per displaced individual.* Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, a taxpayer may not reduce taxable income under paragraph (a) of this section for a displaced individual for whom the taxpayer or any taxpayer residing in the same principal residence has reduced taxable income under this section for any prior taxable year.


(4) *Taxpayers occupying the same principal residence.* Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, for all taxable years, only one taxpayer occupying the same principal residence may reduce taxable income for a particular displaced individual.


(5) *Limitations applied separately to each disaster.* The limitations of this paragraph (c) apply separately to each disaster area. Thus, a taxpayer may reduce taxable income by $2,000 for providing housing to Midwestern disaster displaced individuals even though the taxpayer reduced taxable income for providing housing to one or more Hurricane Katrina displaced individuals. For this purpose, all areas within the Midwestern disaster area are treated as one disaster area.


(d) *Substantiation.* A taxpayer claiming a reduction of taxable income under this section must maintain records sufficient to show entitlement to the reduction as provided in forms, instructions, publications or other guidance published by the IRS.


(e) The Commissioner may apply this section in additional guidance of general applicability, see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter, to other disaster areas to which Congress extends relief under section 302 of the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005.
