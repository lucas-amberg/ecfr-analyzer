# § 1.401(a)(35)-1   Diversification requirements for certain defined contribution plans.

(a) *General rule*—(1) *Diversification requirements.* Section 401(a)(35) imposes diversification requirements on applicable defined contribution plans. A trust that is part of an applicable defined contribution plan is not a qualified trust under section 401(a) unless the plan—


(i) Satisfies the diversification election requirements for elective deferrals and employee contributions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section;


(ii) Satisfies the diversification election requirements for employer nonelective contributions set forth in paragraph (c) of this section;


(iii) Satisfies the investment option requirement set forth in paragraph (d) of this section; and


(iv) Does not apply any restrictions or conditions on investments in employer securities that violate the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.


(2) *Definitions, effective dates, and transition rules.* The definitions of applicable defined contribution plan, employer security, parent corporation, and publicly traded are set forth in paragraph (f) of this section. Applicability dates and transition rules are set forth in paragraph (g) of this section.


(b) *Diversification requirements for elective deferrals and employee contributions invested in employer securities*—(1) *General rule.* With respect to any individual described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if any portion of the individual's account under an applicable defined contribution plan attributable to elective deferrals (as described in section 402(g)(3)(A)), employee contributions, or rollover contributions is invested in employer securities, then the plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (b) if the individual may elect to divest those employer securities and reinvest an equivalent amount in other investment options. The plan may limit the time for divestment and reinvestment to periodic, reasonable opportunities occurring no less frequently than quarterly.


(2) *Applicable individual with respect to elective deferrals and employee contributions.* An individual is described in this paragraph (b)(2) if the individual is—


(i) A participant;


(ii) An alternate payee who has an account under the plan; or


(iii) A beneficiary of a deceased participant.


(c) *Diversification requirements for employer nonelective contributions invested in employer securities*—(1) *General rule.* With respect to any individual described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if a portion of the individual's account under an applicable defined contribution plan attributable to employer nonelective contributions is invested in employer securities, then the plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (c) if the individual may elect to divest those employer securities and reinvest an equivalent amount in other investment options. The plan may limit the time for divestment and reinvestment to periodic, reasonable opportunities occurring no less frequently than quarterly.


(2) *Applicable individual with respect to employer nonelective contributions.* An individual is described in this paragraph (c)(2) if the individual is—


(i) A participant who has completed at least three years of service;


(ii) An alternate payee who has an account under the plan with respect to a participant who has completed at least three years of service; or


(iii) A beneficiary of a deceased participant.


(3) *Completion of three years of service.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a participant completes three years of service on the last day of the vesting computation period provided for under the plan that constitutes the completion of the third year of service under section 411(a)(5). However, for a plan that uses the elapsed time method of crediting service for vesting purposes (or a plan that provides for immediate vesting without using a vesting computation period or the elapsed time method of determining vesting), a participant completes three years of service on the day immediately preceding the third anniversary of the participant's date of hire.


(d) *Investment options.* An applicable defined contribution plan must offer not less than three investment options, other than employer securities, to which an individual who has the right to divest under paragraph (b)(1) or (c)(1) of this section may direct the proceeds from the divestment of employer securities. Each of the three investment options must be diversified and have materially different risk and return characteristics. For this purpose, investment options that constitute a broad range of investment alternatives within the meaning of Department of Labor Regulation section 2550.404c-1(b)(3) are treated as being diversified and having materially different risk and return characteristics.


(e) *Restrictions or conditions on investments in employer securities*—(1) *Impermissible restrictions or conditions*—(i) *General rule.* Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, an applicable defined contribution plan violates the requirements of this paragraph (e) if the plan imposes restrictions or conditions with respect to the investment of employer securities that are not imposed on the investment of other assets of the plan. A restriction or condition with respect to employer securities means—


(A) A restriction on an individual's right to divest an investment in employer securities that is not imposed on an investment that is not employer securities; or


(B) A benefit that is conditioned on investment in employer securities.


(ii) *Indirect restrictions or conditions*—(A) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, a plan violates the requirements of this paragraph (e) if the plan imposes a restriction or condition described in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this section either directly or indirectly.


(B) A plan imposes an indirect restriction on an individual's right to divest an investment in employer securities if, for example, the plan provides that a participant who divests his or her account balance with respect to the investment in employer securities is not permitted for a period of time thereafter to reinvest in employer securities.


(C) A plan does not impose an indirect restriction or condition merely because there are tax consequences that result from an individual's divestment of an investment in employer securities. Thus, the loss of the special treatment for net unrealized appreciation provided under section 402(e)(4) with respect to employer securities is disregarded. Similarly, a plan does not impose an impermissible restriction or condition merely because it provides that an individual may not reinvest divested amounts in the same employer securities account but is permitted to invest such divested amounts in another employer securities account where the only relevant difference between the separate accounts is the section 402(e)(4) cost (or other basis) of the trust in the shares held in each account. (See § 1.402(a)-1(b) for rules regarding section 402(e)(4).)


(2) *Permitted restrictions or conditions*—(i) *In general.* An applicable defined contribution plan does not violate the requirements of this paragraph (e) merely because it imposes a restriction or a condition set forth in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) or (e)(2)(iii) of this section.


(ii) *Securities laws.* A plan is permitted to impose a restriction or condition on the divestiture of employer securities that is either required in order to ensure compliance with applicable securities laws or is reasonably designed to ensure compliance with applicable securities laws. For example, it is permissible for a plan to limit divestiture rights for participants who are subject to section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f) to a reasonable period (such as 3 to 12 days) following publication of the employer's quarterly earnings statements because it is reasonably designed to ensure compliance with Rule 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange Commission.


(iii) *Deferred application of the diversification requirements*—(A) *Becoming an applicable defined contribution plan.* An applicable defined contribution plan is permitted to restrict the application of the diversification requirements of section 401(a)(35) and this section for up to 90 days after the plan becomes an applicable defined contribution plan (for example, a plan becoming an applicable defined contribution plan because the employer securities held under the plan become publicly traded).


(B) *Loss of exception for indirect investments.* In the case where an investment fund described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section no longer meets the requirement in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section that the investment must be independent of the employer (including the situation where the fund no longer meets the percentage limitation rule in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(C) of this section), the plan does not fail to satisfy the diversification requirements of section 401(a)(35) and this section merely because it does not offer those rights with respect to that investment fund for up to 90 days after the investment fund ceases to meet those requirements.


(3) *Permitted indirect restrictions or conditions*—(i) *In general.* An applicable defined contribution plan does not violate the requirements of this paragraph (e) merely because it imposes an indirect restriction or condition set forth in this paragraph (e)(3).


(ii) *Limitation on investment in employer securities.* A plan is permitted to limit the extent to which an individual's account balance can be invested in employer securities, provided the limitation applies without regard to a prior exercise of rights to divest employer securities. For example, a plan does not impose a restriction that violates this paragraph (e) merely because the plan prohibits a participant from investing additional amounts in employer securities if more than 10 percent of that participant's account balance is invested in employer securities.


(iii) *Trading frequency.* A plan is permitted to impose reasonable restrictions on the timing and number of investment elections that an individual can make to invest in employer securities, provided that the restrictions are designed to limit short-term trading in the employer securities. For example, a plan could provide that a participant may not elect to invest in employer securities if the employee has elected to divest employer securities within a short period of time, such as seven days, prior to the election to invest in employer securities.


(iv) *Fees.* The plan has not provided an indirect benefit that is conditioned on investment in employer securities merely because the plan imposes fees on other investment options that are not imposed on the investment in employer securities. In addition, the plan has not provided a restriction on the right to divest an investment in employer securities merely because the plan imposes a reasonable fee for the divestment of employer securities.


(v) *Stable value or similar fund.* A plan is permitted to allow transfers to be made into or out of a stable value or similar fund more frequently than a fund invested in employer securities for purposes of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. Thus, a plan that includes a broad range of investment alternatives as described in paragraph (d) of this section, including a stable value or similar fund, does not impose an impermissible restriction under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section merely because it permits transfers into or out of that fund more frequently than other funds under the plan, provided that the plan would otherwise satisfy this paragraph (e) (taking into account any restrictions or conditions imposed with respect to the other investment options under the plan). For purposes of this section, a stable value fund or similar fund means an investment product or fund designed to preserve or guarantee principal and provide a reasonable rate of return, while providing liquidity for benefit distributions or transfers to other investment alternatives (such as a product or fund described in Department of Labor Regulation § 2550.404c-5(e)(4)(iv)(A) or (v)(A)).


(vi) *Transfers out of a qualified default investment alternative (QDIA).* A plan is permitted to provide for transfers out of a QDIA within the meaning of Department of Labor Regulation section 2550.404c-5(e) more frequently than a fund invested in employer securities.


(vii) *Frozen funds*—(A) *General rule.* A plan is permitted to prohibit any further investment in employer securities. Thus, a plan is not treated as imposing an indirect restriction merely because it provides that an employee that divests an investment in employer securities is not permitted to reinvest in employer securities, but only if the plan does not permit additional contributions or other investments to be invested in employer securities. For this purpose, a plan does not provide for further investment in employer securities merely because dividends paid on employer securities under the plan are reinvested in employer securities.


(B) *Transitional relief for certain leveraged employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs).* An employer stock fund does not fail to be a frozen fund under this paragraph (e)(3)(vii) merely because of the allocation of employer securities that are released as matching contributions from the plan's suspense account that holds employer securities acquired with an exempt loan under section 4975(d)(3). This paragraph (e)(3)(vii)(B) only applies to employer securities that were acquired in a plan year beginning before January 1, 2007, with the proceeds of an exempt loan within the meaning of section 4975(d)(3) which is not refinanced after the end of the last plan year beginning before January 1, 2007.


(4) *Delegation of authority to Commissioner.* The Commissioner may provide for additional permitted restrictions or conditions or permitted indirect restrictions or conditions in revenue rulings, notices, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.


(f) *Definitions*—(1) *Application of definitions.* This paragraph (f) contains definitions that are applicable for purposes of this section.


(2) *Applicable defined contribution plan*—(i) *General rule.* Except as provided in this paragraph (f)(2), an applicable defined contribution plan means any defined contribution plan which holds employer securities that are publicly traded. See paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section for a special rule that treats certain plans that hold employer securities that are not publicly traded as applicable defined contribution plans and paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section for a special rule that treats certain plans as not holding publicly traded employer securities for purposes of this section.


(ii) *Exception for certain ESOPs.* An employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), as defined in section 4975(e)(7), is not an applicable defined contribution plan if the plan is a separate plan for purposes of section 414(l) with respect to any other defined benefit plan or defined contribution plan maintained by the same employer or employers and holds no contributions (or earnings thereunder) that are (or were ever) subject to section 401(k) or 401(m). Thus, an ESOP is an applicable defined contribution plan if the ESOP is a portion of a larger plan (whether or not that larger plan includes contributions that are subject to section 401(k) or 401(m)). For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2)(ii), a plan is not considered to hold amounts ever subject to section 401(k) or 401(m) merely because the plan holds amounts attributable to rollover amounts in a separate account that were previously subject to section 401(k) or 401(m).


(iii) *Exception for one-participant plans.* A one-participant plan, as defined in section 401(a)(35)(E)(iv), is not an applicable defined contribution plan.


(iv) *Certain defined contribution plans treated as holding publicly traded employer securities*—(A) *General rule.* A defined contribution plan holding employer securities that are not publicly traded is treated as an applicable defined contribution plan if any employer maintaining the plan or any member of a controlled group of corporations that includes such employer has issued a class of stock which is publicly traded. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2)(iv), a controlled group of corporations has the meaning given such term by section 1563(a), except that “50 percent” is substituted for “80 percent” each place it appears.


(B) *Exception for certain plans.* Paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(A) of this section does not apply to a plan if—


(*1*) No employer maintaining the plan (or a parent corporation with respect to such employer) has issued stock that is publicly traded; and


(*2*) No employer maintaining the plan (or parent corporation with respect to such employer) has issued any special class of stock which grants to the holder or issuer particular rights, or bears particular risks for the holder or issuer, with respect to any employer maintaining the plan (or any member of a controlled group of corporations that includes such employer) which has issued any stock that is publicly traded.


(3) *Employer security*—(i) *General rule.* Employer security has the meaning given such term by section 407(d)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA).


(ii) *Certain defined contribution plans or investment funds not treated as holding employer securities*—(A) *Exception for certain indirect investments.* Subject to paragraphs (f)(3)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section, a plan (and an investment option described in paragraph (d) of this section) is not treated as holding employer securities for purposes of this section to the extent the employer securities are held indirectly as part of a broader fund that is—


(*1*) A regulated investment company described in section 851(a);


(*2*) A common or collective trust fund or pooled investment fund maintained by a bank or trust company supervised by a State or a Federal agency;


(*3*) A pooled investment fund of an insurance company that is qualified to do business in a State;


(*4*) An investment fund managed by an investment manager within the meaning of section 3(38) of ERISA for a multiemployer plan; or


(*5*) Any other investment fund designated by the Commissioner in revenue rulings, notices, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.


(B) *Investment must be independent.* The exception set forth in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section applies only if the investment in the employer securities is held in a fund under which—


(*1*) There are stated investment objectives of the fund; and


(*2*) The investment is independent of the employer (or employers) and any affiliate thereof.


(C) *Percentage limitation rule.* For purposes of paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B)(*2*) of this section, an investment in employer securities in a fund is not considered to be independent of the employer (or employers) and any affiliate thereof if the aggregate value of the employer securities held in the fund is in excess of 10 percent of the total value of all of the fund's investments for the plan year. The determination of whether the value of employer securities exceeds 10 percent of the total value of the fund's investments for the plan year is made as of the end of the preceding plan year. The determination can be based on the information in the latest disclosure of the fund's portfolio holdings that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in that preceding plan year.


(4) *Parent corporation.* Parent corporation has the meaning given such term by section 424(e).


(5) *Publicly traded*—(i) *In general.* A security is publicly traded if it is readily tradable on an established securities market.


(ii) *Readily tradable on an established securities market.* For purposes of this paragraph (f)(5), except as provided by the Commissioner in revenue rulings, notices, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, a security is readily tradable on an established securities market if—


(A) The security is traded on a national securities exchange that is registered under section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f); or


(B) The security is traded on a foreign national securities exchange that is officially recognized, sanctioned, or supervised by a governmental authority and the security is deemed by the SEC as having a “ready market” under SEC Rule 15c3-1 (17 CFR 240.15c3-1).


(g) *Applicability date and transition rules*—(1) *Statutory effective date*—(i) *General rule.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (g) and section 901(c)(3)(A) and (B) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, Public Law 109-280 (120 Stat. 780 (2006)) (PPA '06), section 401(a)(35) is effective for plan years beginning after December 31, 2006.


(ii) *Collectively bargained plans*—(A) *Delayed statutory effective date.* In the case of a plan maintained pursuant to one or more collective bargaining agreements between employee representatives and one or more employers ratified on or before August 17, 2006, section 401(a)(35) is effective for plan years beginning after the earlier of—


(*1*) The later of—


(*i*) December 31, 2007; or


(*ii*) The date on which the last such collective bargaining agreement terminates (determined without regard to any extension thereof); or


(*2*) December 31, 2008.


(B) *Treatment of plans with both collectively bargained and non-collectively bargained employees.* If a collective bargaining agreement applies to some, but not all, of the plan participants, the definition of whether the plan is considered a collectively bargained plan for purposes of this paragraph (g)(1)(ii) is made in the same manner as the definition of whether a plan is collectively bargained under section 436(f)(3).


(2) *Regulatory effective/applicability date.* This section is effective and applicable for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2011.


(3) *Statutory transition rules*—(i) *General rule.* Pursuant to section 401(a)(35)(H), in the case of the portion of an account to which paragraph (c) of this section applies and that consists of employer securities acquired in a plan year beginning before January 1, 2007, the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section only apply to the applicable percentage of such securities.


(ii) *Applicable percentage*—(A) *Phase-in percentage.* For purposes of this paragraph (g)(3), the applicable percentage is determined as follows—


(B) *Special rule.* For a plan for which the special effective date under section 901(c)(3) of PPA '06 applies, the applicable percentage under this paragraph (g)(3)(ii) is determined without regard to the delayed effective date in section 901(c)(3)(A) and (B) of PPA '06.


(iii) *Nonapplication for participants age 55 with three years of service.* Paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section does not apply to an individual who is a participant who attained age 55 and had completed at least three years of service (as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section) before the first day of the first plan year beginning after December 31, 2005.


(iv) *Separate application by class of securities.* This paragraph (g)(3) applies separately with respect to each class of securities.
