# § 1.401(a)-19   Nonforfeitability in case of certain withdrawals.

(a) *Application of section.* Section 401(a)(19) and this section apply to a plan to which section 411(a) applies. (See section 411(e) and § 1.411(a)-2 for applicability of section 411). 


(b) *Prohibited forfeitures*—(1) *General rule.* A plan to which this section applies is not a qualified plan (and a trust forming a part of such plan is not a qualified trust) if, under such plan, any part of a participant's accrued benefit derived from employer contributions is forfeitable solely because a benefit derived from the participant's contributions under the plan is voluntarily withdrawn by him after he has become a 50 percent vested participant. 


(2) *50 percent vested participant.* For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, a participant is a 50 percent vested participant when he has a nonforfeitable right (within the meaning of section 411 and the regulations thereunder) to at least 50 percent of his accrued benefit derived from employer contributions. Whether or not a participant is 50 percent vested shall be determined by the ratio of the participant's total nonforfeitable employer-derived accrued benefit under the plan to his total employer-derived accrued benefit under the plan. 


(3) *Certain forfeitures.* Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply in the case of a forfeiture permitted by section 411(a)(3)(D)(iii) and § 1.411(a)-7(d)(3) (relating to forfeitures of certain benefits accrued before September 2, 1974). 


(c) *Supersession.* Section 11.401(a)-(19) of the Temporary Income Tax Regulations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is superseded by this section.
