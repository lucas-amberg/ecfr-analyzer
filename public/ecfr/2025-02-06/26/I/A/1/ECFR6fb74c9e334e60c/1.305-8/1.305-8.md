# § 1.305-8   Effective dates.

(a) *In general.* Section 421(b) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 (83 Stat. 615) provides as follows: 


(b) *Rules of application.* (1) The rules contained in section 421(b)(2) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 (83 Stat. 615), hereinafter called “the Act”, shall apply with respect to the application of section 305(b)(2), section 305(b)(3), and section 305(b)(5). Thus, for example, section 305(b)(5) of the Code will not apply to a distribution of convertible preferred stock made before January 1, 1991, with respect to stock outstanding on January 10, 1969 (or which was issued pursuant to a contract binding on the distributing corporation on January 10, 1969), provided the distribution is pursuant to the terms relating to the issuance of such stock which were in effect on January 10, 1969. 


(2)(i) For purposes of section 421(b)(2)(A), (B)(i), and (C) of the Act, stock is considered as outstanding on January 10, 1969, if it could be acquired on such date or some future date by the exercise of a right or conversion privilege in existence on such date (including a right or conversion privilege with respect to stock issued pursuant to a contract binding, on January 10, 1969, on the distributing corporation). Thus, if on January 10, 1969, corporation X has outstanding 1,000 shares of class A common stock and 3,000 shares of class B common stock which are convertible on a one-to-one basis into class A stock, corporation X is considered for purposes of section 421(b)(2)(A), (B)(i), and (C) of the Act to have outstanding on January 10, 1969, 4,000 shares of class A stock (1,000 shares actually outstanding and 3,000 shares that could be acquired by the exercise of the conversion privilege contained in the class B stock) and 3,000 shares of class B stock. 


(ii) For the purposes of section 421(b)(2)(A) (other than for the purpose of determining under section 421(b)(2)(A)(iii) that class of stock which as of January 10, 1969, had the largest fair market value of all classes of stock of the corporation), (B)(i), and (C) of the Act, stock will be considered as outstanding on January 10, 1969, if it is issued pursuant to a conversion privilege contained in stock issued, mediately or immediately, as a stock dividend with respect to stock outstanding on January 10, 1969. 


(3) If, after applying subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the class of stock which as of January 10, 1969, had the largest fair market value of all classes of stock of the corporation is a class of stock which is convertible into another class of nonconvertible stock, then for purposes of section 421(b)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act stock issued upon conversion of any such convertible stock (whether or not outstanding on January 10, 1969) into stock of such other class shall be deemed to be stock which meets the requirements of section 421(b)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act. 


(4) For purposes of section 421(b) of the Act, stock of a corporation held in its treasury will not be considered as outstanding and a distribution of such stock will be considered to be an issuance of such stock on the date of distribution. Stock of a parent corporation held by its subsidiary is not considered treasury stock. 


(5) The following stock shall not be taken into account for purposes of applying section 421(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Act: (i) Stock issued after January 10, 1969, and before October 10, 1969 (other than stock which was issued pursuant to a contract binding on January 10, 1969, on the distributing corporation); (ii) stock described in section 421(b)(2)(C)(i), (ii), or (iii) of the Act; and (iii) stock issued, mediately or immediately, as a stock dividend with respect to stock of the same class outstanding on January 10, 1969. For example, if on June 1, 1970, corporation Y issues additional stock of that class of stock which as of January 10, 1969, had the largest fair market value of all classes of stock of the corporation, such additional stock will not be taken into account for the purpose of meeting the requirement under section 421(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Act that the stock as to which there is a receipt of property must have been outstanding on January 10, 1969, and thus subparagraph (A) of section 421(b)(2) of the Act will not, where otherwise applicable, cease to apply. 


(6) Section 421(b)(2)(A) of the Act, if otherwise applicable, will not cease to apply if the distributing corporation issues after October 9, 1969, securities which are convertible into stock that meets the requirements of section 421(b)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act at a fixed conversion ratio which takes account of all stock dividends and stock splits with respect to the stock into which the securities are convertible. 


(7) Under section 421(b)(4) of the Act, section 305(b)(4) does not apply to any distribution (or deemed distribution) by a corporation with respect to preferred stock made before January 1, 1991, if such distribution is pursuant to the terms relating to the issuance of such stock which were in effect on January 10, 1969. For example, if as of January 10, 1969, a corporation had followed the practice of paying stock dividends on preferred stock (or of periodically increasing the conversion ratio of convertible preferred stock) or if the preferred stock provided for a redemption price in excess of the issue price, then section 305(b)(4) would not apply to any distribution of stock made (or which would be considered made if section 305(b)(4) applied) before January 1, 1991, pursuant to such practice. 


(8) If section 421(b)(2) is not applicable and, for that reason, a distribution (or deemed distribution) is treated as a distribution to which section 301 applies by virtue of the application of section 305(b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(5), it is irrelevant that, by reason of the application of section 421(b)(4) of such Act, section 305(b)(4) is not applicable to the distribution.
