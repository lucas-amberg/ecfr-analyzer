# § 1.336-2   Availability, mechanics, and consequences of section 336(e) election.

(a) *Availability of election.* A section 336(e) election is available if seller or S corporation shareholder(s) dispose of stock of another corporation (target) in a qualified stock disposition (as defined in § 1.336-1(b)(6)). A section 336(e) election is irrevocable. A section 336(e) election is not available for transactions described in section 336(e) that do not constitute qualified stock dispositions.


(b) *Deemed transaction*—(1) *Dispositions not described in section 355(d)(2) or (e)(2)*—(i) *Old target—deemed asset disposition*—(A) *In general.* This paragraph (b)(1) provides the Federal income tax consequences of a section 336(e) election made with respect to a qualified stock disposition not described, in whole or in part, in section 355(d)(2) or (e)(2). For the Federal income tax consequences of a section 336(e) election made with respect to a qualified stock disposition described, in whole or in part, in section 355(d)(2) or (e)(2), see paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In general, if a section 336(e) election is made, seller (or S corporation shareholders) are treated as not having sold, exchanged, or distributed the stock disposed of in the qualified stock disposition. Instead, old target is treated as selling its assets to an unrelated person in a single transaction at the close of the disposition date (but before the deemed liquidation described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section) in exchange for the aggregate deemed asset disposition price (ADADP) as determined under § 1.336-3. ADADP is allocated among the disposition date assets in the same manner as the aggregate deemed sale price (ADSP) is allocated under §§ 1.338-6 and 1.338-7 in order to determine the amount realized from each of the sold assets. Old target realizes the deemed disposition tax consequences from the deemed asset disposition before the close of the disposition date while old target is owned by seller or the S corporation shareholders. If old target is an S corporation target, old target's S election continues in effect through the close of the disposition date (including the time of the deemed asset disposition and the deemed liquidation) notwithstanding section 1362(d)(2)(B). Also, if old target is an S corporation target (but not a qualified subchapter S subsidiary), any direct or indirect subsidiaries of old target that old target has elected to treat as qualified subchapter S subsidiaries under section 1361(b)(3) remain qualified subchapter S subsidiaries through the close of the disposition date.


(B) *Gains and losses*—(*1*) *Gains.* Except as provided in § 1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(8) (regarding the installment method), old target shall recognize all of the gains realized on the deemed asset disposition.


(*2*) *Losses*—(*i*) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(B)(*2*)(*ii*), (*iii*), and (*iv*) of this section, old target shall recognize all of the losses realized on the deemed asset disposition.


(*ii*) *Stock distributions.* Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) and (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, for purposes of determining the amount of target's losses that are disallowed on the deemed asset disposition, seller is still treated as selling, exchanging, or distributing its target stock disposed of in the 12-month disposition period. If target's losses realized on the deemed sale of all of its assets exceed target's gains realized (a net loss), the portion of such net loss attributable to a distribution of target stock during the 12-month disposition period is disallowed. The total amount of disallowed loss and the allocation of disallowed loss is determined in the manner provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(B)(*2*)(*iii*) and (*iv*) of this section.


(*iii*) *Amount and allocation of disallowed loss.* The total disallowed loss pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B)(*2*)(*ii*) of this section shall be determined by multiplying the net loss realized on the deemed asset disposition by the disallowed loss fraction. The numerator of the disallowed loss fraction is the value of target stock, determined on the disposition date, distributed by seller during the 12-month disposition period, whether or not a part of the qualified stock disposition (for example, stock distributed to a related person), and the denominator of the disallowed loss fraction is the sum of the value of target stock, determined on the disposition date, disposed of by sale or exchange in the qualified stock disposition during the 12-month disposition period and the value of target stock, determined on the disposition date, distributed by seller during the 12-month disposition period, whether or not a part of the qualified stock disposition. The amount of the disallowed loss allocated to each asset disposed of in the deemed asset disposition is determined by multiplying the total amount of the disallowed loss by the loss allocation fraction. The numerator of the loss allocation fraction is the amount of loss realized with respect to the asset and the denominator of the loss allocation fraction is the sum of the amount of losses realized with respect to each loss asset disposed of in the deemed asset disposition. To the extent old target's losses from the deemed asset disposition are not disallowed under this paragraph, such losses may be disallowed under other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or general principles of tax law, in the same manner as if such assets were actually sold to an unrelated person.


(*iv*) *Tiered targets.* If an asset of target is the stock of a subsidiary corporation of target for which a section 336(e) election is made, any gain or loss realized on the deemed sale of the stock of the subsidiary corporation is disregarded in determining the amount of disallowed loss. For purposes of determining the amount of disallowed loss on the deemed asset disposition by a subsidiary of target for which a section 336(e) election is made, the amount of subsidiary stock deemed sold in the deemed asset disposition of target's assets multiplied by the disallowed loss fraction with respect to the corporation that is deemed to have disposed of stock of the subsidiary is considered to have been distributed. In determining the disallowed loss fraction with respect to the deemed asset disposition of any subsidiary of target, disregard any sale, exchange, or distribution of its stock that was made after the disposition date if such stock was included in the deemed asset disposition of the corporation deemed to have disposed of the subsidiary stock.


(*3*) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate this paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B).


(C) *Tiered targets.* In the case of parent-subsidiary chains of corporations making section 336(e) elections, the deemed asset disposition of a higher-tier subsidiary is considered to precede the deemed asset disposition of a lower-subsidiary.


(ii) *New target—deemed purchase.* New target is treated as acquiring all of its assets from an unrelated person in a single transaction at the close of the disposition date (but before the deemed liquidation) in exchange for an amount equal to the adjusted grossed-up basis (AGUB) as determined under § 1.336-4. New target allocates the consideration deemed paid in the transaction in the same manner as new target would under §§ 1.338-6 and 1.338-7 in order to determine the basis in each of the purchased assets. If new target qualifies as a small business corporation within the meaning of section 1361(b) and wants to be an S corporation, a new election under section 1362(a) must be made. Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section (deemed liquidation of old target), new target remains liable for the tax liabilities of old target (including the tax liability for the deemed disposition tax consequences). For example, new target remains liable for the tax liabilities of the members of any consolidated group that are attributable to taxable years in which those corporations and old target joined in the same consolidated return. See § 1.1502-6(a).


(iii) *Old target and seller—deemed liquidation*—(A) *In general.* If old target is an S corporation, S corporation shareholders (whether or not they sell or exchange their stock) take their pro rata share of the deemed disposition tax consequences into account under section 1366 and increase or decrease their basis in target stock under section 1367. Old target and seller (or S corporation shareholders) are treated as if, before the close of the disposition date, after the deemed asset disposition described in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section, and while target is owned by seller or S corporation shareholders, old target transferred all of the consideration deemed received from new target in the deemed asset disposition to seller or S corporation shareholders, any S corporation election for old target terminated, and old target ceased to exist. The transfer from old target to seller or S corporation shareholders is characterized for Federal income tax purposes in the same manner as if the parties had actually engaged in the transactions deemed to occur because of this section and taking into account other transactions that actually occurred or are deemed to occur. For example, the transfer may be treated as a distribution in pursuance of a plan of reorganization, a distribution in complete cancellation or redemption of all of its stock, one of a series of distributions in complete cancellation or redemption of all of its stock in accordance with a plan of liquidation, or part of a circular flow of cash. In most cases, the transfer will be treated as a distribution in complete liquidation to which sections 331 or 332 and sections 336 or 337 apply.


(B) *Tiered targets.* In the case of parent-subsidiary chains of corporations making section 336(e) elections, the deemed liquidation of a lower-tier subsidiary corporation is considered to precede the deemed liquidation of a higher-tier subsidiary.


(iv) *Seller—distribution of target stock.* In the case of a distribution of target stock in a qualified stock disposition, seller (the distributor) is deemed to purchase from an unrelated person, on the disposition date, immediately after the deemed liquidation of old target, the amount of stock distributed in the qualified stock disposition (new target stock) and to have distributed such new target stock to its shareholders. Seller recognizes no gain or loss on the distribution of such stock.


(v) *Seller—retention of target stock.* If seller or an S corporation shareholder retains any target stock after the disposition date, seller or the S corporation shareholder is treated as purchasing the stock so retained from an unrelated person (new target stock) on the day after the disposition date for its fair market value. The holding period for the retained stock starts on the day after the disposition date. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1)(v), the fair market value of all of the target stock equals the grossed-up amount realized on the sale, exchange, or distribution of recently disposed stock of target (see § 1.336-3(c)).


(2) *Dispositions described in section 355(d)(2) or (e)(2)*—(i) *Old target—deemed asset disposition*—(A) *In general.* This paragraph (b)(2) provides the Federal income tax consequences of a section 336(e) election made with respect to a qualified stock disposition resulting, in whole or in part, from a disposition described in section 355(d)(2) or (e)(2). Old target is treated as selling its assets to an unrelated person in a single transaction at the close of the disposition date in exchange for the ADADP as determined under § 1.336-3. ADADP is allocated among the disposition date assets in the same manner as ADSP is allocated under §§ 1.338-6 and 1.338-7 in order to determine the amount realized from each of the sold assets. Old target realizes the deemed disposition tax consequences from the deemed asset disposition before the close of the disposition date while old target is owned by seller.


(*1*) *Old target not deemed to liquidate.* In general, unlike a section 338(h)(10) election or a section 336(e) election made with respect to a qualified stock disposition not described, in whole or in part, in section 355(d)(2) or (e)(2), old target is not deemed to liquidate after the deemed asset disposition.


(*2*) *Exception.* If an election is made under § 1.1502-13(f)(5)(ii)(E), then solely for purposes of § 1.1502-13(f)(5)(ii)(C), immediately after the deemed asset disposition of old target, old target is deemed to liquidate into seller.


(B) *Gains and losses*—(*1*) *Gains.* Except as provided in § 1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(8) (regarding the installment method), old target shall recognize all of the gains realized on the deemed asset disposition.


(*2*) *Losses*—(*i*) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(B)(*2*)(*ii*), (*iii*), and (*iv*) of this section, old target shall recognize all of the losses realized on the deemed asset disposition.


(*ii*) *Stock distributions.* If target's losses realized on the deemed sale of all of its assets exceed target's gains realized (a net loss), the portion of such net loss attributable to a distribution of target stock during the 12-month disposition period is disallowed. The total amount of disallowed loss and the allocation of disallowed loss is determined in the manner provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(B)(*2*)(*iii*) and (*iv*) of this section.


(*iii*) *Amount and allocation of disallowed loss.* The total disallowed loss pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B)(*2*)(*ii*) of this section shall be determined by multiplying the net loss realized on the deemed asset disposition by the disallowed loss fraction. The numerator of the disallowed loss fraction is the value of target stock, determined on the disposition date, distributed by seller during the 12-month disposition period, whether or not a part of the qualified stock disposition (for example, stock distributed to a related person), and the denominator of the disallowed loss fraction is the sum of the value of target stock, determined on the disposition date, disposed of by sale or exchange in the qualified stock disposition during the 12-month disposition period and the value of target stock, determined on the disposition date, distributed by seller during the 12-month disposition period, whether or not a part of the qualified stock disposition. The amount of the disallowed loss allocated to each asset disposed of in the deemed asset disposition is determined by multiplying the total amount of the disallowed loss by the loss allocation fraction. The numerator of the loss allocation fraction is the amount of loss realized with respect to the asset and the denominator of the loss allocation fraction is the sum of the amount of losses realized with respect to each loss asset disposed of in the deemed asset disposition. To the extent old target's losses from the deemed asset disposition are not disallowed under this paragraph, such losses may be disallowed under other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or general principles of tax law, in the same manner as if such assets were actually sold to an unrelated person.


(*iv*) *Tiered targets.* If an asset of target is the stock of a subsidiary corporation of target for which a section 336(e) election is made, any gain or loss realized on the deemed sale of the stock of the subsidiary corporation is disregarded in determining the amount of disallowed loss. For purposes of determining the amount of disallowed loss on the deemed asset disposition by a subsidiary of target for which a section 336(e) election is made, see paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B)(*2*) of this section.


(*3*) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B).


(C) *Tiered targets.* In the case of parent-subsidiary chains of corporations making section 336(e) elections, the deemed asset disposition of a higher-tier subsidiary is considered to precede the deemed asset disposition of a lower-tier subsidiary.


(ii) *Old target—deemed purchase*—(A) *In general.* Immediately after the deemed asset disposition described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section, old target is treated as acquiring all of its assets from an unrelated person in a single, separate transaction at the close of the disposition date (but before the distribution described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section) in exchange for an amount equal to the AGUB as determined under § 1.336-4. Old target allocates the consideration deemed paid in the transaction in the same manner as new target would under §§ 1.338-6 and 1.338-7 in order to determine the basis in each of the purchased assets.


(B) *Tiered targets.* In the case of parent-subsidiary chains of corporations making section 336(e) elections with respect to a qualified stock disposition described, in whole or in part, in section 355(d)(2) or (e)(2), old target's deemed purchase of all its assets is considered to precede the deemed asset disposition of a lower-tier subsidiary.


(C) *Application of section 197(f)(9), section 1091, and other provisions to old target.* Solely for purposes of section 197(f)(9), section 1091, and any other provision designated in the Internal Revenue Bulletin by the Internal Revenue Service (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter), old target, in its capacity as seller of assets in the deemed asset disposition described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section, shall be treated as a separate and distinct taxpayer from, and unrelated to, old target in its capacity as acquirer of assets in the deemed purchase described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section and for subsequent periods.


(iii) *Seller—distribution of target stock*—(A) *In general.* Immediately after old target's deemed purchase of its assets described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, seller is treated as distributing the stock of old target actually distributed to its shareholders in the qualified stock disposition. No gain or loss is recognized by seller on the distribution. Additionally, if stock of target is sold, exchanged, or distributed outside of the section 355 transaction but still as part of a qualified stock disposition described, in whole or in part, in section 355(d)(2) or (e)(2), no gain or loss is recognized by seller on such sale, exchange, or distribution.


(B) *Tiered targets.* In the case of parent-subsidiary chains of corporations making section 336(e) elections with respect to a qualified stock disposition described, in whole or in part, in section 355(d)(2) or (e)(2), the Federal income tax consequences of the section 336(e) election for a subsidiary of target shall be determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section unless the stock of the subsidiary of target is actually disposed of in a qualified stock disposition described, in whole or in part, in section 355(d)(2) or (e)(2). The deemed liquidation of a lower-tier subsidiary pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section is considered to precede the deemed liquidation of a higher-tier subsidiary. The deemed liquidation of the highest tier subsidiary of target is considered to precede the distribution of old target stock described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section.


(iv) *Seller—retention of target stock.* If seller retains any target stock after the disposition date, seller is treated as having disposed of the old target stock so retained, on the disposition date, in a transaction in which no gain or loss is recognized, and then, on the day after the disposition date, purchasing the stock so retained from an unrelated person for its fair market value. The holding period for the retained stock starts on the day after the disposition date. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iv), the fair market value of all of the target stock equals the grossed-up amount realized on the sale, exchange, or distribution of recently disposed stock of target (see § 1.336-3(c)).


(v) *Qualification under section 355.* Old target's deemed sale of all its assets to an unrelated person and old target's deemed purchase of all its assets from an unrelated person will not cause the distribution of old target to fail to satisfy the requirements of section 355. Similarly, any deemed transactions under paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section that a subsidiary of target is treated as engaging in will not cause the distribution of old target to fail to satisfy the requirements of section 355. For purposes of applying section 355(a)(1)(D), seller is treated as having disposed of any stock disposed of in the qualified stock disposition on the date seller actually sold, exchanged, or distributed such stock. Further, seller's deemed disposition of retained old target stock under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section is disregarded for purposes of applying section 355(a)(1)(D).


(vi) *Earnings and profits.* The earnings and profits of seller and target shall be determined pursuant to § 1.312-10 and, if applicable, § 1.1502-33(e). For this purpose, target will not be treated as a newly created controlled corporation and any increase or decrease in target's earnings and profits pursuant to the deemed asset disposition will increase or decrease, as the case may be, target's earnings and profits immediately before the allocation described in § 1.312-10.


(c) *Purchaser.* Generally, the making of a section 336(e) election will not affect the Federal income tax consequences to which purchaser would have been subject with respect to the acquisition of target stock if a section 336(e) election was not made. Thus, notwithstanding §§ 1.336-2(b)(1)(i)(A), 1.336-2(b)(1)(iv), and 1.336-2(b)(2)(iii)(A), purchaser will still be treated as having purchased, received in an exchange, or received in a distribution, the stock of target so acquired on the date actually acquired. However, see section 1223(1)(B) with respect to the holding period for stock acquired pursuant to a distribution qualifying under section 355 (or so much of section 356 that relates to section 355). The Federal income tax consequences of the deemed asset disposition and liquidation of target may affect purchaser's consequences. For example, if seller distributes the stock of target to its shareholders in a qualified stock disposition for which a section 336(e) election is made, any increase in seller's earnings and profits as a result of old target's deemed asset disposition and liquidation into seller may increase the amount of a distribution to the shareholders constituting a dividend under section 301(c)(1).


(d) *Minority shareholders*—(1) *In general.* This paragraph (d) describes the treatment of shareholders of old target other than seller, a member of seller's consolidated group, and S corporation shareholders (whether or not they sell or exchange their stock of target). A shareholder to which this paragraph (d) applies is referred to as a minority shareholder.


(2) *Sale, exchange, or distribution of target stock by a minority shareholder.* A minority shareholder recognizes gain or loss (as permitted under the general principles of tax law) on its sale, exchange, or distribution of target stock.


(3) *Retention of target stock by a minority shareholder.* A minority shareholder who retains its target stock does not recognize gain or loss under this section with respect to its shares of target stock. The minority shareholder's basis and holding period for that target stock are not affected by the section 336(e) election. Notwithstanding this treatment of the minority shareholder, if a section 336(e) election is made, target will still be treated as disposing of all of its assets in the deemed asset disposition.


(e) *Treatment consistent with an actual asset disposition.* Except as otherwise provided, no provision in this section shall produce a Federal income tax result under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code that would not occur if the parties had actually engaged in the transactions deemed to occur because of this section, taking into account other transactions that actually occurred or are deemed to occur. See § 1.338-1(a)(2) regarding the application of other rules of law.


(f) *Treatment of target under other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.* The provisions § 1.338-1(b) apply with respect to the treatment of new target after a section 336(e) election, treating any reference to section 338 or 338(h)(10) as a reference to section 336(e).


(g) *Special rules*—(1) *Target as two corporations.* Although target is a single corporation under corporate law, if a section 336(e) election is made, then, except with respect to a distribution described in section 355(d)(2) or (e)(2) and as provided in § 1.338-1(b)(2), two separate corporations, old target and new target, generally are considered to exist for purposes of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code.


(2) *Treatment of members of a consolidated group.* For purposes of §§ 1.336-1 through 1.336-5, all members of seller's consolidated group are treated as a single seller, regardless of which member or members actually dispose of any stock. Accordingly, any dispositions of stock made by members of the same consolidated group shall be treated as made by one corporation, and any stock owned by members of the same consolidated group and not disposed of will be treated as stock retained by seller.


(3) *International provisions*—(i) *Source and foreign tax credit.* The principles of section 338(h)(16) apply to section 336(e) elections for targets with foreign operations to ensure that the source and foreign tax credit limitation are properly determined.


(ii) *Allocation of foreign income taxes*—(A) *General rule.* Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, if a section 336(e) election is made for target and target's taxable year under foreign law (if any) does not close at the end of the disposition date, foreign income tax as defined in § 1.960-1(b) (other than a withholding tax as defined in section 901(k)(1)(B)) paid or accrued by new target with respect to such foreign taxable year is allocated between old target and new target. If there is more than one section 336(e) election with respect to target during target's foreign taxable year, foreign income tax paid or accrued with respect to that foreign taxable year is allocated among all old targets and new targets. The allocation is made based on the respective portions of the taxable income (as determined under foreign law) for the foreign taxable year that are attributable under the principles of § 1.1502-76(b) to the period of existence of each old target and new target during the foreign taxable year.


(B) *Foreign income taxes imposed on partnerships and disregarded entities.* If a section 336(e) election is made for target and target holds an interest in a disregarded entity (as described in § 301.7701-2(c)(2)(i) of this chapter) or partnership, the rules of § 1.901-2(f)(4) and (5) apply to determine the person who is considered for Federal income tax purposes to pay foreign income tax imposed at the entity level on the income of the disregarded entity or partnership.


(iii) *Disallowance of foreign tax credits under section 901(m).* For rules that may apply to disallow foreign tax credits by reason of a section 336(e) election, see section 901(m) and §§ 1.901(m)-1 through 1.901(m)-8.


(h) *Making the section 336(e) election*—(1) *Consolidated group.* If seller(s) and target are members of the same consolidated group, a section 336(e) election is made by completing the following requirements:


(i) Seller(s) and target must enter into a written, binding agreement, on or before the due date (including extensions) of the consolidated group's consolidated Federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the disposition date, to make a section 336(e) election;


(ii) The common parent of the consolidated group must retain a copy of the written agreement;


(iii) The common parent of the consolidated group must attach the section 336(e) election statement, described in paragraphs (h)(5) and (6) of this section, to the group's timely filed (including extensions) consolidated Federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the disposition date; and


(iv) The common parent of the consolidated group must provide a copy of the section 336(e) election statement to target on or before the due date (including extensions) of the consolidated group's consolidated Federal income tax return.


(2) *Non-consolidated/non-S corporation target.* If target is neither a member of the same consolidated group as seller nor an S corporation, a section 336(e) election is made by completing the following requirements:


(i) Seller and target must enter into a written, binding agreement, on or before the due date (including extensions) of seller's or target's Federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the disposition date, whichever is earlier, to make a section 336(e) election;


(ii) Seller and target each must retain a copy of the written agreement; and


(iii) Seller and target each must attach the section 336(e) election statement, described in paragraphs (h)(5) and (6) of this section, to its timely filed (including extensions) Federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the disposition date. However, seller's section 336(e) election statement may disregard paragraph (h)(6)(xii) of this section (concerning a gain recognition election).


(3) *S corporation target.* A section 336(e) election for an S corporation target is made by completing the following requirements:


(i) All of the S corporation shareholders, including those who do not dispose of any stock in the qualified stock disposition, and the S corporation target must enter into a written, binding agreement, on or before the due date (including extensions) of the Federal income tax return of the S corporation target for the taxable year that includes the disposition date, to make a section 336(e) election;


(ii) S corporation target must retain a copy of the written agreement; and


(iii) S corporation target must attach the section 336(e) election statement, described in paragraphs (h)(5) and (6) of this section, to its timely filed (including extensions) Federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the disposition date.


(4) *Tiered targets.* In the case of parent-subsidiary chains of corporations making section 336(e) elections, in order to make a section 336(e) election for a lower-tier target (target subsidiary), the requirements described in paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2), of this section, whichever is applicable to the qualified stock disposition of target subsidiary, must be satisfied. The written agreement described in paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section for the section 336(e) election with respect to target subsidiary may be either a separate written agreement between target subsidiary and the corporation deemed to dispose of the stock of target subsidiary or may be included in the written agreement between seller(s) (or the S corporation shareholders) and target.


(5) *Section 336(e) election statement*—(i) *In general.* The section 336(e) election statement must be entitled “THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER SECTION 336(e) TO TREAT THE DISPOSITION OF THE STOCK OF [insert name and employer identification number of target] AS A DEEMED SALE OF SUCH CORPORATION'S ASSETS.” The section 336(e) election statement must include the information described in paragraph (h)(6) of this section. The relevant information for each S corporation shareholder and, notwithstanding paragraph (g)(2) of this section, each consolidated group member that disposes of or retains target stock must be set forth individually, not in the aggregate.


(ii) *Target subsidiaries.* In the case of a section 336(e) election for a target subsidiary, a separate statement must be filed for each target subsidiary. In preparing the section 336(e) election statement with respect to a target subsidiary, any reference to seller in paragraph (h)(6) of this section should be considered a reference to the corporation deemed to dispose of the stock of the target subsidiary and any reference to target in paragraphs (h)(5)(i) and (h)(6) of this section should be considered a reference to the target subsidiary.


(6) *Contents of section 336(e) election statement.* The section 336(e) election statement must include:


(i) The name, address, taxpayer identifying number (TIN), taxable year, and state of incorporation (if any) of the seller(s) or the S corporation shareholder(s);


(ii) The name, address, employer identification number (EIN), taxable year, and state of incorporation of the common parent, if any, of seller(s);


(iii) The name, address, EIN, taxable year, and state of incorporation of target;


(iv) The name, address, TIN, taxable year, and state of incorporation (if any) of any 80-percent purchaser;


(v) The name, address, TIN, taxable year, and state of incorporation (if any) of any purchaser that holds nonrecently disposed stock within the meaning of § 1.336-1(b)(18);


(vi) The disposition date;


(vii) The percentage of target stock that was disposed of by each seller or S corporation shareholder in the qualified stock disposition;


(viii) The percentage of target stock that was disposed of by each seller or S corporation shareholder in the qualified stock disposition on or before the disposition date;


(ix) A statement regarding whether target realized a net loss on the deemed asset disposition;


(x) If target realized a net loss on the deemed asset disposition, a statement regarding whether any stock of target or that of any higher-tier corporation up through the highest-tier corporation for which a section 336(e) election was made by any seller(s) or S corporation shareholder(s) was distributed during the 12-month disposition period. If so, also provide a statement regarding whether any stock of target or that of any higher-tier corporation up through the highest-tier corporation for which a section 336(e) election was made was actually sold or exchanged (rather than deemed sold in a deemed asset disposition) by any seller(s) or S corporation shareholder(s) in a qualified stock disposition;
