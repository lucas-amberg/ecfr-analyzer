# § 1.336-3   Aggregate deemed asset disposition price; various aspects of taxation of the deemed asset disposition.

(a) *Scope.* This section provides rules under section 336(e) to determine the aggregate deemed asset disposition price (ADADP) for Target. ADADP is the amount for which old Target is deemed to have sold all of its assets in the deemed asset disposition. ADADP is allocated among Target's assets in the same manner as the aggregate deemed sale price (ADSP) is allocated under § 1.338-6 to determine the amount for which each asset is deemed to have been sold. If a subsequent increase or decrease is required under general principles of tax law with respect to an element of ADADP, the redetermined ADADP is allocated among Target's assets in the same manner as redetermined ADSP is allocated under § 1.338-7.


(b) *Determination of ADADP*—(1) *General rule.* ADADP is the sum of—


(i) The grossed-up amount realized on the sale, exchange, or distribution of recently disposed stock of Target; and


(ii) The liabilities of old Target.


(2) *Time and amount of ADADP*—(i) *Original determination.* ADADP is initially determined at the beginning of the day after the disposition date of Target. General principles of tax law apply in determining the timing and amount of the elements of ADADP.


(ii) *Redetermination of ADADP.* ADADP is redetermined at such time and in such amount as an increase or decrease would be required, under general principles of tax law, for the elements of ADADP. For example, ADADP is redetermined because of an increase or decrease in the amount realized on the sale or exchange of recently disposed stock of Target or because liabilities not originally taken into account in determining ADADP are subsequently taken into account. Increases or decreases with respect to the elements of ADADP result in the reallocation of ADADP among Target's assets in the same manner as ADSP under § 1.338-7.


(c) *Grossed-up amount realized on the disposition of recently disposed stock of Target*—(1) *Determination of amount.* The grossed-up amount realized on the disposition of recently disposed stock of Target is an amount equal to—


(i) The sum of —


(A) With respect to recently disposed of stock of Target that is not distributed in the qualified stock disposition, the amount realized on the sale or exchange of such recently disposed stock of Target, determined as if seller or S corporation shareholders were required to use old Target's accounting methods and characteristics and the installment method were not available and determined without regard to the selling costs taken into account under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, and


(B) With respect to recently disposed of stock of Target that is distributed in the qualified stock disposition, the fair market value of such recently disposed stock of Target determined on the date of each distribution;


(ii) Divided by the percentage of Target stock (by value, determined on the disposition date) attributable to the recently disposed stock;


(iii) Less the selling costs incurred by seller or S corporation shareholders in connection with the sale or exchange of recently disposed stock that reduce its amount realized on the sale or exchange of the stock (for example, brokerage commissions and any similar costs to sell the stock).


(2) *Example.* The following example illustrates this paragraph (c):


(d) *Liabilities of old Target*—(1) *In general.* In general, the liabilities of old Target are measured as of the beginning of the day after the disposition date. However, if a Target for which a section 336(e) election is made engages in a transaction outside the ordinary course of business on the disposition date after the event resulting in the qualified stock disposition of Target or a higher-tier corporation, Target and all persons related thereto (either before or after the qualified stock disposition) under section 267(b) or section 707 must treat the transaction for all Federal income tax purposes as occurring at the beginning of the day following the transaction and after the deemed disposition by old Target. In order to be taken into account in ADADP, a liability must be a liability of Target that is properly taken into account in amount realized under general principles of tax law that would apply if old Target had sold its assets to an unrelated person for consideration that included the discharge of its liabilities. See § 1.1001-2(a). Such liabilities may include liabilities for the tax consequences resulting from the deemed asset disposition.


(2) *Time and amount of liabilities.* The time for taking into account liabilities of old Target in determining ADADP and the amount of the liabilities taken into account is determined as if old Target had sold its assets to an unrelated person for consideration that included the discharge of the liabilities by the unrelated person. For example, if no amount of a Target liability is properly taken into account in amount realized as of the beginning of the day after the disposition date, the liability is not initially taken into account in determining ADADP, but it may be taken into account at some later date.


(e) *Deemed disposition tax consequences.* Gain or loss on each asset in the deemed asset disposition is computed by reference to the ADADP allocated to that asset. ADADP is allocated in the same manner as is ADSP under § 1.338-6. Although deemed disposition tax consequences may increase or decrease ADADP by creating or reducing a tax liability, the amount of the tax liability itself may be a function of the size of the deemed disposition tax consequences. Thus, these determinations may require trial and error computations.


(f) *Other rules apply in determining ADADP.* ADADP may not be applied in such a way as to contravene other applicable rules. For example, a capital loss cannot be applied to reduce ordinary income in calculating the tax liability on the deemed asset disposition for purposes of determining ADADP.


(g) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate this section.
