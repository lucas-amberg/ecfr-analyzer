# § 1.336-4   Adjusted grossed-up basis.

(a) *Scope.* Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section or as the context otherwise requires, the principles of paragraphs (b) through (g) of § 1.338-5 apply in determining the adjusted grossed-up basis (AGUB) for target and the consequences of a gain recognition election. AGUB is the amount for which new target is deemed to have purchased all of its assets in the deemed purchase under § 1.336-2(b)(1)(ii) or the amount for which old target is deemed to have purchased all of its assets in the deemed purchase under § 1.336-2(b)(2)(ii). AGUB is allocated among target's assets in accordance with § 1.338-6 to determine the price at which the assets are deemed to have been purchased. If a subsequent increase or decrease with respect to an element of AGUB is required under general principles of tax law, redetermined AGUB is allocated among target's assets in accordance with § 1.338-7.


(b) *Modifications to the principles in § 1.338-5.* Solely for purposes of applying §§ 1.336-1 through 1.336-4, the principles of § 1.338-5 are modified as follows—


(1) *Purchasing corporation; purchaser.* Any reference to the *purchasing corporation* shall be treated as a reference to a purchaser, as defined in § 1.336-1(b)(2).


(2) *Acquisition date; disposition date.* Any reference to the *acquisition date* shall be treated as a reference to the disposition date, as defined in § 1.336-1(b)(8).


(3) *Section 338 election; section 338(h)(10) election; section 336(e) election.* Any reference to a *section 338 election* or a *section 338(h)(10) election* shall be treated as a reference to a section 336(e) election, as defined in § 1.336-1(b)(11).


(4) *New target; old target.* In the case of a disposition described in section 355(d)(2) or (e)(2), any reference to *new target* shall be treated as a reference to *old target* in its capacity as the purchaser of assets pursuant to the section 336(e) election.


(5) *Recently purchased stock; recently disposed stock.* Any reference to *recently purchased stock* shall be treated as a reference to recently disposed stock, as defined in § 1.336-1(b)(17). In the case of a distribution of stock, for purposes of determining the purchaser's grossed-up basis of recently disposed stock, the purchaser's basis in recently disposed stock shall be deemed to be such stock's fair market value on the date it was acquired.


(6) *Nonrecently purchased stock; nonrecently disposed stock.* Any reference to *nonrecently purchased stock* shall be treated as a reference to nonrecently disposed stock, as defined in § 1.336-1(b)(18).


(c) *Gain recognition election*—(1) *In general.* Any holder of nonrecently disposed stock of target may make a gain recognition election. The gain recognition election is irrevocable. Each owner of nonrecently disposed stock determines its basis amount, and therefore the gain recognized pursuant to the gain recognition election, by applying §§ 1.338-5(c) and 1.338-5(d)(3)(ii) by reference to its own recently disposed stock and nonrecently disposed stock, and not by reference to all recently disposed stock and nonrecently disposed stock.


(2) *80-percent purchaser.* If a section 336(e) election is made for target, any 80-percent purchaser and all persons related to the 80-percent purchaser are automatically deemed to have made a gain recognition election for its nonrecently disposed target stock.


(3) *Non-80-percent purchaser.* If not automatically deemed made under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a gain recognition election is made by a non-80-percent purchaser providing, on or before the due date for filing the section 336(e) election statement by the appropriate party, a gain recognition election statement, as described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, to the appropriate party. If seller and target are members of the same consolidated group, seller is the appropriate party and the common parent of the consolidated group must retain the gain recognition election statement. If seller and target are members of the same affiliated group but do not join in the filing of a consolidated Federal income tax return, or if target is an S corporation, target is the appropriate party and target must retain the gain recognition election statement. If a non-80-percent purchaser makes a gain recognition election, all related persons to the non-80-percent purchaser must also make a gain recognition election. Otherwise, the gain recognition election for the non-80-percent purchaser will have no effect.


(4) *Gain recognition election statement.* A gain recognition election statement must include the following declarations (or substantially similar declarations):


(i) [Insert name, address, and taxpayer identifying number of person for whom gain recognition election is actually being made] has elected to recognize gain under § 1.336-4(c) with respect to [his, hers, or its] nonrecently disposed stock.


(ii) [Insert name of person for whom gain recognition election is actually being made] agrees to report any gain under the gain recognition election on [his, hers, or its] Federal income tax return (including an amended return, if necessary) for the taxable year that includes the disposition date of [insert name and employer identification number of target].


(d) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section.
