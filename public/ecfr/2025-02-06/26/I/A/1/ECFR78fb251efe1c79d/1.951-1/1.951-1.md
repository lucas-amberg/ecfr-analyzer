# § 1.951-1   Amounts included in gross income of United States shareholders.

(a) *In general.* If a foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 957) at any time during any taxable year of such corporation, every person—


(1) Who is a United States shareholder (as defined in section 951(b) and paragraph (g) of this section) of such corporation at any time during such taxable year, and


(2) Who owns (within the meaning of section 958(a)) stock in such corporation on the last day, in such year, on which such corporation is a controlled foreign corporation shall include in his gross income for his taxable year in which or with which such taxable year of the corporation ends, the sum of—


(i) Such shareholder's pro rata share (determined under paragraph (b) of this section) of the corporation's subpart F income (as defined in section 952) for such taxable year of the corporation, 


(ii) Such shareholder's pro rata share (determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section) of the corporation's previously excluded subpart F income withdrawn from investment in less developed countries for such taxable year of the corporation,


(iii) Such shareholder's pro rata share (determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) of the corporation's previously excluded subpart F income withdrawn from investment in foreign base company shipping operations for such taxable year of the corporation, and 


(iv) The amount determined under section 956 with respect to such shareholder for such taxable year of the corporation (but only to the extent not excluded from gross income under section 959(a)(2)).


(3) For purposes of determining whether a United States shareholder which is a domestic corporation is a personal holding company under section 542 and § 1.542-1, the character of the amount includible in gross income of such domestic corporation under this paragraph shall be determined as if such amount were realized directly by such corporation from the source from which it is realized by the controlled foreign corporation. See paragraph (a) of § 1.957-2 for special limitation on the amount of subpart F income in the case of a controlled foreign corporation described in section 957(b). See section 970(a) and § 1.970-1 which provides for the reduction of subpart F income of export trade corporations.




(4) See § 1.958-1(d) for rules regarding the ownership of stock of a foreign corporation through a domestic partnership for purposes of section 951 and for purposes of any provision that specifically applies by reference to section 951 or the regulations in this part under section 951.








(b) *Limitation on a United States shareholder's pro rata share of subpart F income*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, a United States shareholder's pro rata share (determined in accordance with the rules of paragraph (e) of this section) of the foreign corporation's subpart F income for the taxable year of such corporation is—


(i) The amount which would have been distributed with respect to the stock which such shareholder owns (within the meaning of section 958(a)) in such corporation if on the last day, in such corporation's taxable year, on which such corporation is a controlled foreign corporation it had distributed pro rata to its shareholders an amount which bears the same ratio to its subpart F income for such taxable year as the part of such year during which such corporation is a controlled foreign corporation bears to the entire taxable year, reduced by—


(ii) The lesser of—


(A) The amount of distributions received by any other person during such taxable year as a dividend with respect to such stock multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the subpart F income of such corporation for the taxable year and the denominator of which is the sum of the subpart F income and the tested income (as defined in section 951A(c)(2)(A) and § 1.951A-2(b)(1)) of such corporation for the taxable year, and


(B) The dividend which would have been received by such other person if the distributions by such corporation to all its shareholders had been the amount which bears the same ratio to the subpart F income of such corporation for the taxable year as the part of such year during which such shareholder did not own (within the meaning of section 958(a)) such stock bears to the entire taxable year.


(2) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (b).


(i) *Facts.* The following facts are assumed for purposes of the examples.


(A) A is a United States shareholder.


(B) M is a foreign corporation that has only one class of stock outstanding.


(C) B is a nonresident alien individual, and stock owned by B is not considered owned by a domestic entity under section 958(b).


(D) P and R are foreign corporations.


(E) All persons use the calendar year as their taxable year.


(F) Year 1 ends on or after October 3, 2018, and has 365 days.


(ii) *Example 1*—(A) *Facts.* A owns 100% of the stock of M throughout Year 1. For Year 1, M derives $100x of subpart F income, has $100x of earnings and profits, and makes no distributions.


(B) *Analysis.* Under section 951(a)(2) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section, A's pro rata share of the subpart F income of M for Year 1 is $100x.


(iii) *Example 2*—(A) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section (the facts in *Example 1*), except that instead of holding 100% of the stock of M for the entire year, A sells 60% of such stock to B on May 26, Year 1. Thus, M is a controlled foreign corporation for the period January 1, Year 1, through May 26, Year 1.


(B) *Analysis.* Under section 951(a)(2)(A) and paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, A's pro rata share of the subpart F income of M is limited to the subpart F income of M which bears the same ratio to its subpart F income for such taxable year ($100x) as the part of such year during which M is a controlled foreign corporation bears to the entire taxable year (146/365). Accordingly, under section 951(a)(2) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section, A's pro rata share of the subpart F income of M for Year 1 is $40x ($100x × 146/365).


(iv) *Example 3*—(A) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section (the facts in *Example 1*), except that instead of holding 100% of the stock of M for the entire year, A holds 60% of such stock on December 31, Year 1, having acquired such stock on May 26, Year 1, from B, who owned such stock from January 1, Year 1. Before A's acquisition of the stock, M had distributed a dividend of $15x to B in Year 1 with respect to the stock so acquired by A. M has no tested income for Year 1.


(B) *Analysis.* Under section 951(a)(2) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section, A's pro rata share of the subpart F income of M for Year 1 is $21x, such amount being determined as follows:


(v) *Example 4*—(A) *Facts.* A owns 100% of the only class of stock of P throughout Year 1, and P owns 100% of the only class of stock of R throughout Year 1. For Year 1, R derives $100x of subpart F income, has $100x of earnings and profits, and distributes a dividend of $20x to P. R has no gross tested income. P has no income for Year 1 other than the dividend received from R.


(B) *Analysis.* Under section 951(a)(2) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section, A's pro rata share of the subpart F income of R for Year 1 is $100x. A's pro rata share of the subpart F income of R is not reduced under section 951(a)(2)(B) and paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section for the dividend of $20x paid to P because there was no part of Year 1 during which A did not own (within the meaning of section 958(a)) the stock of R. Under section 959(b), the $20x distribution from R to P is not again includible in the gross income of A under section 951(a). The $20x distribution from R to P is not includible in the gross tested income of P.


(vi) *Example 5*—(A) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(2)(v)(A) of this section (the facts in *Example 4*), except that instead of holding 100% of the stock of R for the entire year, P holds 60% of such stock on December 31, Year 1, having acquired such stock on March 14, Year 1, from B. Before P's acquisition of the stock, R had distributed a dividend of $100x to B in Year 1 with respect to the stock so acquired by P. The stock interest so acquired by P was owned by B from January 1, Year 1, until acquired by P. R also has $300x of tested income for Year 1.


(B) *Analysis*—(*1*) *Limitation of pro rata share of subpart F income.* Under section 951(a)(2) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section, A's pro rata share of the subpart F income of M for Year 1 is $28x, such amount being determined as follows:


(*2*) *Limitation of pro rata share of tested income.* Under section 951A(e)(1) and § 1.951A-1(d)(2), A's pro rata share of the tested income of M for Year 1 is $108x, such amount being determined as follows:


(c)-(d) [Reserved]


(e) *Pro rata share of subpart F income defined*—(1) *In general*—(i) *Hypothetical distribution.* For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, a United States shareholder's pro rata share of a controlled foreign corporation's subpart F income for a taxable year is the amount that bears the same ratio to the corporation's subpart F income for the taxable year as the amount of the corporation's allocable earnings and profits that would be distributed with respect to the stock of the corporation which the United States shareholder owns (within the meaning of section 958(a)) for the taxable year bears to the total amount of the corporation's allocable earnings and profits that would be distributed with respect to the stock owned by all the shareholders of the corporation if all the allocable earnings and profits of the corporation for the taxable year (not reduced by actual distributions during the year) were distributed (*hypothetical distribution*) on the last day of the corporation's taxable year on which such corporation is a controlled foreign corporation (*hypothetical distribution date*).


(ii) *Definition of allocable earnings and profits.* For purposes of this paragraph (e), the term *allocable earnings and profits* means, with respect to a controlled foreign corporation for a taxable year, the amount that is the greater of—


(A) The earnings and profits of the corporation for the taxable year determined under section 964; and


(B) The sum of the subpart F income (as determined under section 952 after the application of section 951A(c)(2)(B)(ii) and § 1.951A-6(b)) of the corporation for the taxable year and the tested income (as defined in section 951A(c)(2)(A) and § 1.951A-2(b)(1)) of the corporation for the taxable year.


(2) *One class of stock.* If a controlled foreign corporation for a taxable year has only one class of stock outstanding on the hypothetical distribution date, the amount of the corporation's allocable earnings and profits distributed in the hypothetical distribution with respect to each share in the class of stock is determined as if the hypothetical distribution were made pro rata with respect to each share in the class of stock.


(3) *More than one class of stock.* If a controlled foreign corporation for a taxable year has more than one class of stock outstanding on the hypothetical distribution date, the amount of the corporation's allocable earnings and profits distributed in the hypothetical distribution with respect to each class of stock is determined based on the distribution rights of each class of stock on the hypothetical distribution date, which amount is then further distributed pro rata with respect to each share in the class of stock. Subject to paragraphs (e)(4) through (6) of this section, the distribution rights of a class of stock are determined taking into account all facts and circumstances related to the economic rights and interest in the allocable earnings and profits of the corporation of each class, including the terms of the class of stock, any agreement among the shareholders and, if and to the extent appropriate, the relative fair market value of shares of stock. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), facts and circumstances do not include actual distributions (including distributions by redemption) or any amount treated as a dividend under any other provision of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code (for example, under section 78, 356(a)(2), 367(b), or 1248) made during the taxable year that includes the hypothetical distribution date.


(4) *Special rules*—(i) *Redemptions, liquidations, and returns of capital.* No amount of allocable earnings and profits is distributed in the hypothetical distribution with respect to a particular class of stock based on the terms of the class of stock of the controlled foreign corporation or any agreement or arrangement with respect thereto that would result in a redemption (even if such redemption would be treated as a distribution of property to which section 301 applies pursuant to section 302(d)), a distribution in liquidation, or a return of capital.


(ii) *Certain cumulative preferred stock.* If a controlled foreign corporation has outstanding a class of redeemable preferred stock with cumulative dividend rights and dividend arrearages on such stock do not compound at least annually at a rate that equals or exceeds the applicable Federal rate (as defined in section 1274(d)(1)) that applies on the date the stock is issued for the term from such issue date to the mandatory redemption date based on a comparable compounding assumption (the *relevant AFR*), the amount of the corporation's allocable earnings and profits distributed in the hypothetical distribution with respect to the class of stock may not exceed the amount of dividends actually paid during the taxable year with respect to the class of stock plus the present value at the end of the controlled foreign corporation's taxable year of the unpaid current dividends with respect to the class determined using the relevant AFR and assuming the dividends will be paid at the mandatory redemption date. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4)(ii), if the class of preferred stock does not have a mandatory redemption date, the mandatory redemption date is the date that the class of preferred stock is expected to be redeemed based on all facts and circumstances.


(iii) *Dividend arrearages.* If there is an arrearage in dividends for prior taxable years with respect to a class of preferred stock of a controlled foreign corporation, an amount of the corporation's allocable earnings and profits is distributed in the hypothetical distribution to the class of preferred stock by reason of the arrearage only to the extent the arrearage exceeds the accumulated earnings and profits of the controlled foreign corporation remaining from prior taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962, as of the beginning of the taxable year, or the date on which such stock was issued, whichever is later (the *applicable date*). If there is an arrearage in dividends for prior taxable years with respect to more than one class of preferred stock, the previous sentence is applied to each class in order of priority, except that the accumulated earnings and profits remaining after the applicable date are reduced by the allocable earnings and profits necessary to satisfy arrearages with respect to classes of stock with a higher priority. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4)(iii), the amount of any arrearage with respect to stock described in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section is determined in the same manner as the present value of unpaid current dividends on such stock under paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section.


(5) *Restrictions or other limitations on distributions*—(i) *In general.* A restriction or other limitation on distributions of an amount of earnings and profits by a controlled foreign corporation is not taken into account in determining the amount of the corporation's allocable earnings and profits distributed in a hypothetical distribution to a class of stock of the controlled foreign corporation.


(ii) *Definition.* For purposes of paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section, a restriction or other limitation on distributions includes any limitation that has the effect of limiting the distribution of an amount of earnings and profits by a controlled foreign corporation with respect to a class of stock of the corporation, other than currency or other restrictions or limitations imposed under the laws of any foreign country as provided in section 964(b).


(iii) *Exception for certain preferred distributions.* For purposes of paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section, the right to receive periodically a fixed amount (whether determined by a percentage of par value, a reference to a floating coupon rate, a stated return expressed in terms of a certain amount of U.S. dollars or foreign currency, or otherwise) with respect to a class of stock the distribution of which is a condition precedent to a further distribution of earnings and profits that year with respect to any class of stock (not including a distribution in partial or complete liquidation) is not a restriction or other limitation on the distribution of earnings and profits by a controlled foreign corporation.


(iv) *Illustrative list of restrictions and limitations.* Except as provided in paragraph (e)(5)(iii) of this section, restrictions or other limitations on distributions include, but are not limited to—


(A) An arrangement that restricts the ability of a controlled foreign corporation to pay dividends on a class of stock of the corporation until a condition or conditions are satisfied (for example, until another class of stock is redeemed);


(B) A loan agreement entered into by a controlled foreign corporation that restricts or otherwise affects the ability to make distributions on its stock until certain requirements are satisfied; or


(C) An arrangement that conditions the ability of a controlled foreign corporation to pay dividends to its shareholders on the financial condition of the corporation.


(6) *Transactions and arrangements with a principal purpose of changing pro rata shares.* Appropriate adjustments must be made to the allocation of allocable earnings and profits that would be distributed (without regard to this paragraph (e)(6)) in a hypothetical distribution with respect to any share of stock outstanding as of the hypothetical distribution date to disregard the effect on the hypothetical distribution of any transaction or arrangement that is undertaken as part of a plan a principal purpose of which is the avoidance of Federal income taxation by changing the amount of allocable earnings and profits distributed in any hypothetical distribution with respect to such share. This paragraph (e)(6) also applies for purposes of the pro rata share rules described in § 1.951A-1(d) that reference this paragraph (e), including the rules in § 1.951A-1(d)(3) that determine the pro rata share of qualified business asset investment based on the pro rata share of tested income.


(7) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e).


(i) *Facts.* Except as otherwise stated, the following facts are assumed for purposes of the examples:


(A) FC1 is a controlled foreign corporation.


(B) USP1 and USP2 are domestic corporations.


(C) Individual A is a foreign individual, and FC2 is a foreign corporation that is not a controlled foreign corporation.


(D) All persons use the calendar year as their taxable year.


(E) Any ownership of FC1 by any shareholder is for all of Year 1.


(F) The common shareholders of FC1 are entitled to dividends when declared by FC1's board of directors.


(G) There are no accrued but unpaid dividends with respect to preferred shares, the preferred stock is not described in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, and common shares have positive liquidation value.


(H) There are no other facts and circumstances related to the economic rights and interest of any class of stock in the allocable earnings and profits of a foreign corporation, and no transaction or arrangement was entered into as part of a plan a principal purpose of which is the avoidance of Federal income taxation.


(I) FC1 has neither tested income within the meaning of section 951A(c)(2)(A) and § 1.951A-2(b)(1) nor tested loss within the meaning of section 951A(c)(2)(B)(i) and § 1.951A-2(b)(2).


(ii) *Example 1:**Single class of stock*—(A) *Facts.* FC1 has outstanding 100 shares of one class of stock. USP1 owns 60 shares of FC1. USP2 owns 40 shares of FC1. For Year 1, FC1 has $1,000x of earnings and profits and $100x of subpart F income within the meaning of section 952.


(B) *Analysis.* FC1 has one class of stock. Therefore, under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, FC1's allocable earnings and profits of $1,000x are distributed in the hypothetical distribution pro rata to each share of stock. Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, for Year 1, USP1's pro rata share of FC1's subpart F income is $60x ($100x × $600x/$1,000x) and USP2's pro rata share of FC1's subpart F income is $40x ($100x × $400x/$1,000x).


(iii) *Example 2: Common and preferred stock*—(A) *Facts.* FC1 has outstanding 70 shares of common stock and 30 shares of 4% nonparticipating, voting preferred stock with a par value of $10x per share. USP1 owns all of the common shares. Individual A owns all of the preferred shares. For Year 1, FC1 has $100x of earnings and profits and $50x of subpart F income within the meaning of section 952.


(B) *Analysis.* The distribution rights of the preferred shares are not a restriction or other limitation within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5) of this section. Under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the amount of FC1's allocable earnings and profits distributed in the hypothetical distribution with respect to Individual A's preferred shares is $12x (0.04 × $10x × 30) and with respect to USP1's common shares is $88x ($100x−$12x). Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, USP1's pro rata share of FC1's subpart F income is $44x ($50x − $88x/$100x) for Year 1.


(iv) *Example 3: Restriction based on cumulative income*—(A) *Facts.* FC1 has outstanding 10 shares of common stock and 400 shares of 2% nonparticipating, voting preferred stock with a par value of $1x per share. USP1 owns all of the common shares. FC2 owns all of the preferred shares. USP1 and FC2 cause the governing documents of FC1 to provide that no dividends may be paid to the common shareholders until FC1 cumulatively earns $100,000x of income. For Year 1, FC1 has $50x of earnings and profits and $50x of subpart F income within the meaning of section 952.


(B) *Analysis.* The agreement restricting FC1's ability to pay dividends to common shareholders until FC1 cumulatively earns $100,000x of income is a restriction or other limitation within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5) of this section. Therefore, the restriction is disregarded for purposes of determining the amount of FC1's allocable earnings and profits distributed in the hypothetical distribution to a class of stock. The distribution rights of the preferred shares are not a restriction or other limitation within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5) of this section. Under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the amount of FC1's allocable earnings and profits distributed in the hypothetical distribution with respect to FC2's preferred shares is $8x (0.02 × $1x × 400) and with respect to USP1's common shares is $42x ($50x − $8x). Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, USP1's pro rata share of FC1's subpart F income is $42x for Year 1.


(v) *Example 4: Redemption rights*—(A) *Facts.* FC1 has outstanding 40 shares of common stock and 10 shares of 4% nonparticipating, preferred stock with a par value of $50x per share. Pursuant to the terms of the preferred stock, FC1 has the right to redeem at any time, in whole or in part, the preferred stock. FC2 owns all of the preferred shares. USP1, wholly owned by FC2, owns all of the common shares. Pursuant to the governing documents of FC1, no dividends may be paid to the common shareholders while the preferred stock is outstanding. For Year 1, FC1 has $100x of earnings and profits and $100x of subpart F income within the meaning of section 952.


(B) *Analysis.* The agreement restricting FC1's ability to pay dividends to common shareholders while the preferred stock is outstanding is a restriction or other limitation within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5) of this section. Therefore, the restriction is disregarded for purposes of determining the amount of FC1's allocable earnings and profits distributed in the hypothetical distribution to a class of stock. Under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, no amount of allocable earnings and profits is distributed in the hypothetical distribution to the preferred shareholders on the hypothetical distribution date as a result of FC1's right to redeem the preferred shares. This is the case regardless of the restriction on paying dividends to the common shareholders while the preferred stock is outstanding, and regardless of the fact that a redemption of FC2's preferred shares would be treated as a distribution to which section 301 applies under section 302(d) (due to FC2's constructive ownership of the common shares). Thus, neither the restriction on paying dividends to the common shareholders while the preferred stock is outstanding nor FC1's redemption rights with respect to the preferred shares affects the distribution of allocable earnings and profits in the hypothetical distribution to FC1's shareholders. However, the distribution rights of the preferred shares are not a restriction or other limitation within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5) of this section. As a result, the amount of FC1's allocable earnings and profits distributed in the hypothetical distribution with respect to FC2's preferred shares is $20x (0.04 × $50x × 10) and with respect to USP1's common shares is $80x ($100x−$20x). Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, USP1's pro rata share of FC1's subpart F income is $80x for Year 1.


(vi) *Example 5: Shareholder owns common and preferred stock*—(A) *Facts.* FC1 has outstanding 40 shares of common stock and 60 shares of 6% nonparticipating, nonvoting preferred stock with a par value of $100x per share. USP1 owns 30 shares of the common stock and 15 shares of the preferred stock during Year 1. The remaining 10 shares of common stock and 45 shares of preferred stock of FC1 are owned by Individual A. For Year 1, FC1 has $1,000x of earnings and profits and $500x of subpart F income within the meaning of section 952.


(B) *Analysis.* The right of the holder of the preferred stock to receive 6% of par value is not a restriction or other limitation within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5) of this section. The amount of FC1's allocable earnings and profits distributed in the hypothetical distribution with respect to FC1's preferred shares is $360x (0.06 × $100x × 60) and with respect to its common shares is $640x ($1,000x−$360x). As a result, the amount of FC1's allocable earnings and profits distributed in the hypothetical distribution to USP1 is $570x, the sum of $90x ($360x × 15/60) with respect to its preferred shares and $480x ($640x × 30/40) with respect to its common shares. Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, USP1's pro rata share of the subpart F income of FC1 is $285x ($500x × $570x/$1,000x).


(vii) *Example 6: Subpart F income and tested income*—(A) *Facts.* FC1 has outstanding 700 shares of common stock and 300 shares of 4% nonparticipating, voting preferred stock with a par value of $100x per share. USP1 owns all of the common shares. USP2 owns all of the preferred shares. For Year 1, FC1 has $10,000x of earnings and profits, $2,000x of subpart F income within the meaning of section 952, and $9,000x of tested income within the meaning of section 951A(c)(2)(A) and § 1.951A-2(b)(1).


(B) *Analysis*—(*1*) *Hypothetical distribution.* The allocable earnings and profits of FC1 determined under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section are $11,000x, the greater of FC1's earnings and profits as determined under section 964 ($10,000x) or the sum of FC1's subpart F income and tested income ($2,000x + $9,000x). The amount of FC1's allocable earnings and profits distributed in the hypothetical distribution with respect to USP2's preferred shares is $1,200x (0.04 × $100x × 300) and with respect to USP1's common shares is $9,800x ($11,000x−$1,200x).


(*2*) *Pro rata share of subpart F income.* Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, USP1's pro rata share of FC1's subpart F income is $1,782x ($2,000x × $9,800x/$11,000x), and USP2's pro rata share of FC1's subpart F income is $218x ($2,000x × $1,200x/$11,000x).


(*3*) *Pro rata share of tested income.* Accordingly, under § 1.951A-1(d)(2), USP1's pro rata share of FC1's tested income is $8,018x ($9,000x × $9,800x/$11,000x), and USP2's pro rata share of FC1's tested income is $982x ($9,000x × $1,200x/$11,000x) for Year 1.


(viii) *Example 7: Subpart F income and tested loss*—(A) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (e)(7)(vii)(A) of this section (the facts in *Example 6*), except that for Year 1, FC1 has $8,000x of earnings and profits, $10,000x of subpart F income within the meaning of section 952 (but without regard to the limitation in section 952(c)(1)(A)), and $2,000x of tested loss within the meaning of section 951A(c)(2)(B)(i) and § 1.951A-2(b)(2). Under section 951A(c)(2)(B)(ii) and § 1.951A-6(b), the earnings and profits of FC1 are increased for purposes of section 952(c)(1)(A) by the amount of FC1's tested loss. Accordingly, after the application of section 951A(c)(2)(B)(ii) and § 1.951A-6(b), the subpart F income of FC1 is $10,000x.


(B) *Analysis*—(*1*) *Pro rata share of subpart F income.* The allocable earnings and profits determined under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section are $10,000x, the greater of the earnings and profits of FC1 determined under section 964 ($8,000x) or the sum of FC1's subpart F income and tested income ($10,000x + $0). The amount of FC1's allocable earnings and profits distributed in the hypothetical distribution with respect to USP2's preferred shares is $1,200x (.04 × $100x × 300) and with respect to USP1's common shares is $8,800x ($10,000x−$1,200x). Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, for Year 1, USP1's pro rata share of FC1's subpart F income is $8,800x and USP2's pro rata share of FC1's subpart F income is $1,200x.


(*2*) *Pro rata share of tested loss.* The allocable earnings and profits determined under § 1.951A-1(d)(4)(i)(B) are $2,000x, the amount of FC1's tested loss. Under § 1.951A-1(d)(4)(i)(C), the entire $2,000x of tested loss is allocated in the hypothetical distribution to USP1's common shares. Accordingly, USP1's pro rata share of the tested loss is $2,000x.


(f) *Determination of holding period.* For purposes of sections 951 through 964, the holding period of an asset (including stock of a controlled foreign corporation) shall be determined by excluding the day on which such asset is acquired and including the day on which such asset is disposed of. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:


(g) *United States shareholder defined*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of sections 951 through 964, the term *United States shareholder* means, with respect to a foreign corporation, a United States person (as defined in section 957(c)) who owns within the meaning of section 958(a), or is considered as owning by applying the rules of ownership of section 958(b), 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of such foreign corporation, or 10 percent or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of such foreign corporation.


(2) *Percentage of total combined voting power owned by United States person*—(i) *Meaning of combined voting power.* In determining for purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph whether a United States person owns the requisite percentage of voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, consideration will be given to all the facts and circumstances in each case. In any case where—


(*a*) A foreign corporation has more than one class of stock outstanding, and


(*b*) One or more United States persons own (within the meaning of section 958) shares of any one class of stock which possesses the power to elect, appoint, or replace a person, or persons, who with respect to such corporation, exercise the powers ordinarily exercised by a member of the board of directors of a domestic corporation, the percentage of the total combined voting power with respect to such corporation owned by any such United States person shall be his proportionate share of the percentage of the persons exercising the powers ordinarily exercised by members of the board of directors of a domestic corporation (described in (*b*) of this subdivision) which such class of stock (as a class) possesses the power to elect, appoint, or replace. In all cases, however, a United States person will be deemed to own 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power with respect to a foreign corporation if such person owns (within the meaning of section 958) 20 percent or more of the total number of shares of a class of stock of such corporation possessing one or more powers enumerated in paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.957-1. Whether a foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation for purposes of sections 951 through 964 shall be determined by applying the rules of section 957 and §§ 1.957-1 through 1.957-4.


(ii) *Illustration.* The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(h) *Applicability dates.* Paragraphs (a), (b)(1)(ii), (b)(2), (e)(1)(ii)(B), and (g)(1) of this section apply to taxable years of foreign corporations beginning after December 31, 2017, and to taxable years of United States shareholders in which or with which such taxable years of foreign corporations end. Except for paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, paragraph (e) of this section applies to taxable years of United States shareholders ending on or after October 3, 2018.
