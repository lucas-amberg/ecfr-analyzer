# § 1.953-2   Actual United States risks.

(a) *In general.* For purposes of paragraph (a) of § 1.953-1, the term “United States risks” means risks described in section 953(a)(1)(A)—


(1) In connection with property in the United States (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section),


(2) In connection with liability arising out of activity in the United States (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section), or


(3) In connection with the lives or health of residents of the United States (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section).


(b) *Property in the United States.* The term “property in the United States” means property, as defined in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, which is in the United States, within the meaning of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.


(1) *Property defined.* The term “property” means any interest of an insured in tangible (including real and personal) or intangible property. Such interests include, but are not limited to, those of an owner, landlord, tenant, mortgagor, mortgagee, trustee, beneficiary, or partner. Thus, for example, if insurance is issued against loss from fire and theft with respect to an insured's home and its contents, such risks are risks in connection with property, whether the insured is the owner or lessee and whether the contents include furniture or cash and securities. Furthermore, if insurance is issued against all risks of damage or loss with respect to the automobile of an insured, such risks are risks in connection with property, whether the risks insured against may be caused by the insured, another person, or natural forces.


(2) *United States location*—(i) *In general.* Property will be considered property in the United States when it is exclusively located in the United States. Conversely, property will be considered property not in the United States when it is exclusively located outside the United States. In addition, property which is ordinarily located in, but temporarily located outside, the United States will be considered property in the United States both when it is ordinarily located in, and when it is temporarily located outside, the United States if the premium which is attributable to the reinsuring or issuing of any insurance contract in connection with such property cannot be allocated to, or apportioned between, risks incurred when such property is actually located in the United States and risks incurred when it is actually located outside the United States. If such premium can be so allocated or apportioned on a reasonable basis, however, such property will be considered property not in the United States when it is actually located outside the United States. However, property will not be considered property in the United States if it is neither property which is exclusively located in the United States nor property which is ordinarily located in, but temporarily located outside, the United States. The rules prescribed in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph shall apply in determining whether a premium can be allocated or apportioned on a reasonable basis to or between risks incurred when property is actually located in the United States and risks incurred when such property is actually located outside the United States. The rules prescribed in subdivisions (iii) through (x) of this subparagraph shall apply in determining whether property is, or will be considered, exclusively located in or outside the United States and whether property is, or will be considered, ordinarily located in the United States; such rules also limit the rule of premium allocation and apportionment prescribed in this subdivision and subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. The determinations required by this subparagraph shall be made with respect to the location of property during the policy period applicable to the taxable year of the insuring or reinsuring corporation, or, if more than one policy period exists with respect to such taxable year, such determinations shall be made separately with respect to the location of property during each such policy period.


(ii) *Premium allocation or apportionment.* Whether a premium can be allocated or apportioned on a reasonable basis to or between risks incurred when property is actually located in the United States and risks incurred when such property is actually located outside the United States shall depend on the intention of the parties to the insurance contract, as determined from its provisions and the facts and circumstances preceding its execution. Contract provisions on the basis of which the premium reasonably may be so allocated or apportioned include, but are not limited to, provisions which separately describe each risk covered, the period of coverage of each risk, the special warranties for each risk, the premium for each risk (or the basis for determining such premium), and the conditions of paying the premium for each risk. For purposes of this subdivision, it shall be unnecessary formally to make a separate policy with respect to each risk covered or with respect to each clause attached to the policy, provided that the intention of the parties to the contract is reasonably clear. For example, if in the ordinary course of carrying on an insurance business an insurance policy is issued which covers fire, theft, and water damage risks incurred when property is actually located in the United States and marine risks incurred when such property is actually located outside the United States and which, pursuant to accepted insurance principles, properly describes the premium rates as percentages of the amount of coverage as “.825% plus .3% fire, etc. risks plus .12% water risks = 1.245%”, a reasonable basis exists to allocate a $124.50 premium paid for $10,000 of such coverage to $82.50 for foreign risks and $42.00 ($30.00 + $12.00) to United States risks.


(iii) *Property in general—(a) Ordinary and temporary location.* Except as otherwise provided in subdivisions (iv) through (x) of this subparagraph, the determination of whether property is ordinarily located in the United States will depend on all the facts and circumstances in each case. Property is ordinarily located in the United States if its location in the United States is regular, usual, or often occurring. However, in all cases property will be considered ordinarily located in the United States if it is actually located in the United States for an aggregate of more than 50 percent of the days in the applicable policy period whereas property will, under no circumstances, be considered ordinarily located in the United States if it is actually located in the United States for an aggregate of not more than 30 percent of the days in the applicable policy period. Property which is ordinarily located in the United States is temporarily located outside the United States when it is actually located outside the United States. For purposes of determining the number and percent of the days in an applicable policy period, the term “day” means, not any 24-consecutive-hour period, but a continuous period of twenty-four hours commencing from midnight and ending with the following midnight; in determining the location of property for such purposes, an amount of time which is at least one-half of such a day, but less than the entire day, shall be considered a day, and an amount of time which is less than one-half of such a day shall not be considered a day.


(*b*) *Illustrations.* The application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:


(iv) *Commercial motor vehicles, ships, aircraft, railroad rolling stock, and containers.* Any motor vehicle, ship, aircraft, railroad rolling stock, or any container transported thereby, which is used exclusively in the commercial transportation of persons or property to or from the United States (including such transportation from one place to another in the United States) and is ordinarily located in the United States will be considered property in the United States both when such property is ordinarily located in, and when such property is temporarily located outside, the United States. Whether such property is used in the transportation of persons or property to or from the United States and is ordinarily located in the United States are issues to be determined from all the facts and circumstances in each case. However, in all cases such transportation property will be considered ordinarily located in the United States if either more than 50 percent of the miles traversed during the applicable policy period in the use of such property are traversed within the United States or such property is located in the United States more than 50 percent of the time during such period. Further, such transportation property will not at any time be considered property in the United States if either not more than 30 percent of the miles traversed during the applicable policy period in the use of such property are traversed within the United States or such property is located in the United States for not more than 30 percent of the time during such period. Nevertheless, if not more than 30 percent of the miles traversed during the applicable policy period in the use of such transportation property are traversed within the United States, such property will be considered ordinarily located in the United States if it is located in the United States more than 50 percent of the time during such period Moreover, if such transportation property is located in the United States for not more than 30 percent of the time during the applicable policy period, such property will be considered ordinarily located in the United States if more than 50 percent of the miles traversed during such period in the use of such property are traversed within the United States. If such transportation property is considered property in the United States because more than 50 percent of the miles traversed during the applicable policy period in the use of such property are traversed within the United States, the apportionment of premium provided in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be made on a mileage basis. If, however, such property is considered property in the United States because such property is located in the United States more than 50 percent of the time during the applicable policy period, the apportionment of premium provided in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be made on a time basis.


(v) *Noncommercial motor vehicles, ships, aircraft, and railroad rolling stock.* Except as provided in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph, any motor vehicle, ship or boat, aircraft, or railroad rolling stock which at any time is actually located in the United States and which either (*a*) is registered with the United States, a State (including any political subdivision thereof), or any agency thereof or (*b*), if not so registered, is owned by a citizen, resident, or corporation of the United States will be considered property which is ordinarily located in the United States. Unless the premium which is attributable to the reinsuring or issuing of any insurance contract in connection with such property considered ordinarily located in the United States is specifically allocated under the contract to risks incurred when such property is actually located in the United States and to risks incurred when it is actually located outside the United States, such property will be considered property in the United States both when it is ordinarily located in, and when it is temporarily located outside, the United States; under no circumstances will such property be considered outside the United States on the basis of any apportionment of such premium.


(vi) *Property exported or imported by railroad or motor vehicle.* Any property which is exported from, or imported to, the United States by railroad or motor vehicle will be considered property ordinarily located in the United States which, when such property is not actually located in the United States, is temporarily located outside the United States. For example, if an insurance contract reinsured or issued in connection with property exported from the United States by motor vehicle covers risks commencing when such property is loaded on the motor vehicle at the United States warehouse and terminating when such property is unloaded at the foreign warehouse, and if the premium payable with respect to risks incurred when the property is in the United States and risks incurred when the property is in the foreign country is not separately stated, such property will be considered property in the United States only until such property is actually located outside the United States, provided that the premium can be properly apportioned (for example) on the basis of time or mileage, between risks incurred when the property is actually located in the United States and risks incurred when it is actually located outside the United States. If in such case the premium is not so apportionable, such property will be considered property in the United States both when such property is ordinarily located in, and when it is temporarily located outside, the United States.


(vii) *Property exported by ship or aircraft.* If an insurance contract which is reinsured or issued in connection with property which is exported from the United States by ship or aircraft covers risks all of which terminate when such property is placed aboard a ship or aircraft at the United States port of exit for shipment from the United States, such property will be considered property in the United States. If such insurance contract covers risks all of which commence when such property is placed aboard a ship or aircraft at the United States port of exit for shipment from the United States, such property will be considered property not in the United States. If such insurance contract covers risks commencing before, and terminating after, such property is placed aboard a ship or aircraft at the United States port of exit for shipment from the United States, such property will be considered property ordinarily located in the United States which, after such property is placed aboard such ship or aircraft at the United States port of exit, is temporarily located outside the United States. The application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:


(viii) *Property imported by ship or aircraft.* If an insurance contract which is reinsured or issued in connection with property which is imported to the United States by ship or aircraft covers risks all of which terminate when such property is unloaded at the United States port of entry, such property will be considered property not in the United States. If such insurance contract covers risks all of which commence after such property is unloaded at the United States port of entry, such property will be considered property in the United States. If such insurance contract covers risks commencing before, and terminating after, such property is unloaded at the United States port of entry, such property will be considered property ordinarily located in the United States which, before such property is unloaded at the United States port of entry, is temporarily located outside the United States. For an illustration pertaining to the allocation or apportionment of the premium, see the example in subdivision (vii) of this subparagraph.


(ix) *Shipments originating and terminating in the United States.* Any property which is shipped from one place in the United States to another place in the United States, on or over a foreign country, the high seas, or the coastal waters of the United States will be considered property actually located at all times in the United States. For example, property which is shipped from New York City to Los Angeles via the Panama Canal or from San Francisco to Hawaii or Alaska will be considered property actually located at all times in the United States.


(x) *Shipments originating and terminating in a foreign country.* Any property which is shipped by any means, or a combination of means, of transportation from one foreign country to another foreign country, or from a contiguous foreign country to the same contiguous foreign country, on or over the United States will be considered property exclusively located outside the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any property which is shipped by any means, or a combination of means, of transportation from one contiguous foreign country to another contiguous foreign country on or over the United States will be considered property ordinarily located in the United States which, when such property is not actually located in the United States, is temporarily located outside the United States.


(c) *Liability from United States activity.* The term “liability arising out of activity in the United States” means a loss, as described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, or a liability, as described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, which could arise from activity performed in the United States, as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.


(1) *Loss described.* The term “loss” includes all loss of an insured which could arise from the occurrence of the event insured against except that such term does not include any loss in connection with property described in paragraph (b) of this section. For example, such term includes, in the case of a promoter of outdoor sporting events, the loss which could arise from the cancellation of such an event because of inclement weather.


(2) *Liability described.* The term “liability” includes all liability of an insured in tort, contract, property, or otherwise. It includes, for example, the liability of a principal for the acts of his agent, of a husband for the acts of his spouse, and of a parent for the acts of his child. The term not only includes the direct liability which may be incurred, for example, by a tortfeasor to the person harmed, but also the indirect liability which may be incurred, for example, by a manufacturer to the purchaser at retail for a breach of warranty.


(3) *Activity in the United States*—(i) *In general.* A loss or liability will be considered a loss or liability which could arise from activity performed in the United States if the loss or liability would result, if at all, from an activity exclusively carried on in the United States. Conversely, a loss or liability will be considered a loss or liability which could not arise from activity performed in the United States if the loss or liability would result, if at all, from an activity exclusively carried on outside the United States. In addition, a loss or liability will be considered a loss or liability which could arise from activity performed in the United States if the loss or liability would result, if at all, from an activity ordinarily carried on in, but partly carried on outside, the United States. If the premium which is attributable to the reinsuring or issuing of any insurance contract in connection with an activity ordinarily carried on in, but partly carried on outside, the United States can, on a reasonable basis, be allocated to, or apportioned between, the risks incurred with respect to the activity carried on in, and the risks incurred with respect to the activity carried on outside, the United States, such loss or liability will be considered a loss or liability which could not arise from activity performed in the United States to the extent the loss or liability would result, if at all, from that activity carried on outside the United States. However, a loss or liability will not be considered a loss or liability which could arise from an activity performed in the United States if such loss or liability would result, if at all, from an activity which is neither exclusively carried on in the United States nor ordinarily carried on in, but partly carried on outside, the United States. The principles of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section for allocating or apportioning a premium on a reasonable basis to or between risks incurred when property is actually located in the United States and risks incurred when such property is actually located outside the United States shall apply for allocating or apportioning a premium on a reasonable basis to or between the risks incurred with respect to the activity carried on in, and the risks incurred with respect to the activity carried on outside, the United States. The rules prescribed in subdivisions (ii) through (vi) of this subparagraph shall apply in determining whether an activity is, or will be considered, exclusively carried on in or outside the United States and whether an activity is, or will be considered, ordinarily carried on in the United States and in determining what is the activity which is performed by the insured from which a loss or liability results or could result; such rules also limit the rule of premium allocation and apportionment prescribed in this subdivision. The determinations required by this subparagraph shall be made with respect to the location of an activity of the insured performed during the policy period applicable to the taxable year of the insuring or reinsuring corporation, or, if more than one policy period exists with respect to such taxable year, such determinations shall be made separately with respect to the location of the activity during each such policy period.


(ii) *Substantial activity carried on in the United States.* The term “activity” is used in its broadest sense and includes the performance of an act unlawfully undertaken, the wrongful performance of an act lawfully undertaken, and the wrongful failure to perform an act lawfully required to be undertaken. With respect to a loss described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the term “activity” includes the occurrence of the event insured against. The determination of whether an activity ordinarily is carried on in, but is partly carried on outside, the United States will depend on all the facts and circumstances in each case. An activity ordinarily is carried on in the United States if a substantial amount of such activity is carried on in the United States. Factors which will be taken into account in determining whether a substantial amount of activity is carried on in the United States are those which are connected with the activity and include, but are not limited to, the location of the insured's assets, the place where personal services are performed, and the place where sales occur, but only if such assets, services, and sales are connected with the activity. In all cases an activity will be considered substantially carried on in the United States if more than 50 percent of the insured's total assets, personal services, and sales, if any, connected with such activity are located, performed, or occur in the United States. On the other hand, an activity will, under no circumstances, be considered substantially carried on in the United States if not more than 30 percent of the insured's total assets, personal services, and sales, if any, connected with such activity are located, performed, or occur in the United States. For this purpose, the mean of the value of the total assets at the beginning and end of the policy period shall be used, determined by taking assets into account at their actual value (not reduced by liabilities), which, in the absence of affirmative evidence to the contrary, shall be deemed to be (*a*) face value in the case of bills receivable, accounts receivable, notes receivable, and open accounts held by an insured using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and (*b*) adjusted basis in the case of all other assets. Personal services shall be measured by the amount of compensation paid or accrued for such services, and sales shall be measured by the volume of gross sales. An activity is carried on partly outside the United States if it is carried on, whether substantially or in substantially, outside the United States.


(iii) *Manufacturing, producing, constructing, or assembling activity.* If a person who manufactures, produces, constructs, or assembles property is liable with regard to the consumption or use of such property, such liability will be considered to result from the activity performed of manufacturing, producing, constructing, or assembling such property. If such person manufactures, produces, constructs, or assembles more than one type of product, the liability with regard to the consumption or use of one of such products will be considered to result from the activity performed of manufacturing, producing, constructing, or assembling that particular product. For example, the liability of a building contractor, which constructs apartment buildings only in the United States, for the improper construction of, or the failure to construct, an apartment building, will be considered to result from an activity exclusively carried on in the United States and will be considered a liability which could arise from activity performed in the United States. In further illustration, the liability (which is covered by a single policy of insurance) of a domestic corporation, which assembles refrigerators exclusively in the United States and manufactures automobiles both in a foreign country and in the United States through substantial activity carried on in each of such countries, for the negligent manufacturing of a part for one of the automobiles by the foreign branch, will be considered to result from an activity ordinarily carried on in, but partly carried on outside, the United States and will be considered a liability which could arise from activity performed in the United States.


(iv) *Selling activity.* If a person is liable with regard to selling activity performed, such liability will be considered, except as provided in subdivisions (iii), (v), and (vi) of this subparagraph, to result from such selling activity. A person will be considered to be engaged in selling activity if such person engages in an activity resulting in the sale of property. Thus, it is immaterial that, under the Code, such activity would not constitute engaging in or carrying on a trade or business in the country in which such activity is carried on, the property in the goods does not pass in such country, or delivery of the property is not made in such country. For example, if a foreign wholesale distributor, which manages its entire business operations in a foreign country and sells its inventory exclusively in the United States—its only contact in the United States being the promotion of such sales to United States retail outlets by advertising in trade publications and distributing sales catalogues—is liable for a breach of warranty with regard to the sale of property to a United States retail outlet, such liability will be considered to result from an activity exclusively carried on in the United States and will be considered a liability which could arise from activity performed in the United States.


(v) *Liability from service or driving activity—(a) In general.* If a person is liable with regard to any service activity performed, or is liable with regard to driving activity performed in connection with a motor vehicle, ship or boat, aircraft, or railroad rolling stock, whether or not exclusively used in the commercial transportation of persons or property, such liability will be considered to result from such service or driving activity. For example, if an oil company which drills for oil exclusively in a foreign country is liable with regard to the negligent handling by its employees of explosives in the course of such drilling there, such liability will be considered to result from an activity exclusively carried on outside the United States and will be considered a liability which could not arise from activity performed in the United States. In further illustration, if a corporation which services machinery exclusively in a foreign country under servicing contracts is liable with regard to the negligent repairing of a machine under such a contract, such liability will be considered to result from an activity exclusively carried on outside the United States and will be considered a liability which could not arise from activity performed in the United States.


(*b*) *Location of activities in connection with transportation property.* For purposes of (*a*) of this subdivision, service or driving activity performed in connection with a motor vehicle, ship or boat, aircraft, or railroad rolling stock, whether or not exclusively used in the commercial transportation of persons or property, will be considered activity performed in the United States if the activity is carried on at a time when such property is or will be considered, in accordance with subdivision (iv) or (v) of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, actually in the United States or ordinarily located in the United States. However, if the premium which is attributable to the reinsuring or issuing of any insurance contract in connection with such service or driving activity which is carried on at a time when such property is, or will be considered, ordinarily located in the United States can be allocated to, or apportioned between, the risks incurred when such property is actually located in the United States and risks incurred when it is actually located outside the United States, such liability will be considered a liability which could arise from activity performed in the United States only when such property is actually located in the United States. Any allocation or apportionment of premium under the preceding sentence shall be made in accordance with the rules of allocation and apportionment provided in subdivision (iv) or (v) of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. For example, if a person is liable with regard to the performance of services outside the United States in the operation of a motor vehicle which is used exclusively in the commercial transportation of persons to and from the United States and which, because more than 50 percent of the miles traversed during the applicable policy period in the use of such property are traversed within the United States, is considered ordinarily located in the United States, such liability will be considered to be a liability which could not arise from activity performed in the United States only to the extent that the premium which is attributable to the reinsuring or issuing of any insurance contract in connection with such service activity is apportioned on a mileage basis between the risks incurred when such motor vehicle is actually located in the United States and when such vehicle is actually located outside the United States. See paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section. In further illustration, if a person is liable with regard to his negligent driving of a motor vehicle which is not used exclusively in the commercial transportation of persons or property, which is registered with any State, and which is driven both in the United States and a foreign country, such liability will be considered a liability which could arise from activity performed in the United States, unless the premium which is attributable to the reinsuring or issuing of an insurance contract in connection with such driving performed in such motor vehicle ordinarily located in the United States is specifically allocated under the contract to risks incurred with respect to driving performed in, and to risks incurred with respect to driving performed outside, the United States. See paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section.


(*c*) *Illustration.* The application of this subdivision may be further illustrated by the following example:


(vi) *Liability from delivery of property.* If the person who is obligated to deliver property is liable with regard to such delivery, such liability will be considered to result from the activity performed of delivering such property. For example, if a corporation which exports all of its inventory from the United States to foreign countries or possessions of the United States is liable with regard to its failure to make delivery outside the United States of inventory it has sold, such liability will be considered to result from an activity exclusively carried on outside the United States and will be considered a liability which could not arise from activity performed in the United States. In further illustration, if a corporation which exports all of its inventory from a foreign country to the United States is liable with regard to its improper delivery in the United States of inventory it has sold, such liability will be considered to result from an activity exclusively carried on in the United States and will be considered a liability which could arise from activity performed in the United States.


(d) *Lives or health of United States residents.* Risks in connection with the lives or health of residents of the United States include those risks which are the subject of insurance contracts referred to in section 801(a), relating to the definition of a life insurance company. If the insured is a resident of the United States at the time the insurance contract is approved, the risk is in connection with the life or health of a resident of the United States for the period of coverage under the contract. However, if during such period of coverage the insured notifies the insurer, or circumstances known to the insurer indicate, that the insured is no longer a resident of the United States, the risk shall cease to be a risk in connection with the life or health of a resident of the United States for the policy period in which the insured gives such notice or such circumstances are known to the insurer, and for each subsequent policy period. Conversely, if the insured is a resident of a particular foreign country at the time the insurance contract is approved, the risk is in connection with the life or health of a resident of such foreign country for the period of coverage under the contract. However, if during such period of coverage the insured notifies the insurer, or circumstances known to the insurer indicate, that the insured is no longer a resident of such foreign country, the risk shall cease to be a risk in connection with the life or health of a resident of such particular foreign country for the policy period in which the insured gives such notice or such circumstances are known to the insurer, and for each subsequent policy period. In determining the country of residence of an insured, the principles of §§ 301.7701(b)-1 through 301.7701(b)-9 of this chapter, relating to the determination of residence and nonresidence in the United States and of foreign residence, shall apply. Citizens of the United States are not residents of the United States merely because of their citizenship. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:
