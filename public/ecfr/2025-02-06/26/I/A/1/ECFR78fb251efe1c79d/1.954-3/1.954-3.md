# § 1.954-3   Foreign base company sales income.

(a) *Income included*—(1) *In general*—(i) *General rules.* Foreign base company sales income of a controlled foreign corporation shall, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section, consist of gross income (whether in the form of profits, commissions, fees or otherwise) derived in connection with the purchase of personal property from a related person and its sale to any person, the sale of personal property to any person on behalf of a related person, the purchase of personal property from any person and its sale to a related person, or the purchase of personal property from any person on behalf of a related person. See section 954(d)(1). For purposes of the preceding sentence, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(4) of this section, personal property sold by a controlled foreign corporation will be considered to be the same property that was purchased by the controlled foreign corporation regardless of whether the personal property is sold in the same form in which it was purchased, in a different form than the form in which it was purchased, or as a component part of a manufactured product. This section shall apply to the purchase and/or sale of personal property, whether or not such property was purchased and/or sold in the ordinary course of trade or business, except that income derived in connection with the sale of tangible personal property will not be considered to be foreign base company sales income if such property is sold to a person that is not a related person, as defined in § 1.954-1(f), after substantial use has been made of the property by the controlled foreign corporation in its trade or business. This section shall not apply to the excess of gains over losses from sales or exchanges of securities or from futures transactions, to the extent such excess gains are includible in foreign personal holding company income of the controlled foreign corporation under § 1.954-2; nor shall it apply to the sale of the controlled foreign corporation's property (other than its stock in trade or other property of a kind which would properly be included in its inventory if on hand at the close of the taxable year, or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its business) if substantially all the property of such corporation is sold pursuant to the discontinuation of the trade or business previously carried on by such corporation. The term “any person” as used in this paragraph (a)(1)(i) includes a related person as defined in § 1.954-1(f).


(ii) *Special rule—(a) In general.* The term “personal property” as used in section 954(d) and this section shall not include agricultural commodities which are not grown in the United States (within the meaning of section 7701(a)(9)) in commercially marketable quantities. All of the agricultural commodities listed in table I shall be considered grown in the United States in commercially marketable quantities. Bananas, black pepper, cocoa, coconut, coffee, crude rubber, and tea shall not be considered grown in the United States in commercially marketable quantities. All other agricultural commodities shall not be considered grown in the United States in commercially marketable quantities when, in consideration of all of the facts and circumstances of the individual case, such commodities are shown to be produced in the United States in insufficient quantity and quality to be marketed commercially. The term “agricultural commodities” includes, but is not limited to, livestock, poultry, fish produced in fish farms, fruit, furbearing animals as well as the products of truck farms, ranches, nurseries, ranges, and orchards. A fish farm is an area where fish are grown or raised (artificially protected and cared for), as opposed to merely caught or harvested. However, the term “agricultural commodities” shall not include timber (either standing or felled), or any commodity at least 50 percent of the fair market value of which is attributable to manufacturing or processing, determined in a manner consistent with the regulations under section 993(c) (relating to the definition of export property). For purposes of applying such regulations, the term “processing” shall be deemed not to include handling, packing, packaging, grading, storing, transporting, slaughtering, and harvesting. Subdivision (ii) shall apply in the computation of foreign base company sales income for taxable years of controlled foreign corporations beginning after December 31, 1975, and to taxable years of U.S. shareholders (within the meaning of section 951(b)) within which or with which such taxable years of such foreign corporations end.


(*b*) *Table.*

(iii) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(2) *Property manufactured, produced, constructed, grown, or extracted within the country in which the controlled foreign corporation is created or organized.* Foreign base company sales income does not include income derived in connection with the purchase and sale of personal property (or purchase or sale of personal property on behalf of a related person) in a transaction described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section if the property is manufactured, produced, constructed, grown, or extracted in the country under the laws of which the controlled foreign corporation which purchases and sells the property (or acts on behalf of a related person) is created or organized. See section 954(d)(1)(A). The principles set forth in paragraphs (a)(4)(ii) and (a)(4)(iii) of this section apply under this paragraph (a)(2) in determining what constitutes the manufacture, production, or construction of personal property, excluding the requirement set forth in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section that the provisions of paragraphs (a)(4)(ii) and (a)(4)(iii) of this section may only be satisfied through the activities of employees of the corporation manufacturing, producing, or constructing the personal property. The principles of paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section apply under this paragraph (a)(2) in determining what constitutes the manufacture, production, or construction of personal property but only when the personal property is manufactured, produced, or constructed by a person related to the controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of § 1.954-1(f). The application of this paragraph (a)(2) may be illustrated by the following examples:


(3) *Property sold for use, consumption, or disposition within the country in which the controlled foreign corporation is created or organized*—(i) *In general.* Foreign base company sales income does not include income derived in connection with the purchase and sale of personal property (or purchase or sale of personal property on behalf of a related person) in a transaction described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, (*a*) if the property is sold for use, consumption, or disposition in the country under the laws of which the controlled foreign corporation which purchases and sells the property (or sells on behalf of a related person) is created or organized or (*b*), where the property is purchased by the controlled foreign corporation on behalf of a related person, if such property is purchased for use, consumption, or disposition in the country under the laws of which such controlled foreign corporation is created or organized. See section 954(d)(1)(B).


(ii) *Rules for determining country of use, consumption, or disposition.* As a general rule, personal property which is sold to an unrelated person will be presumed for purposes of this subparagraph to have been sold for use, consumption, or disposition in the country of destination of the property sold; for such purpose, the occurrence in a country of a temporary interruption in shipment of goods shall not constitute such country the country of destination. However, if at the time of a sale of personal property to an unrelated person the controlled foreign corporation knew, or should have known from the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction, that the property probably would not be used, consumed, or disposed of in the country of destination, the controlled foreign corporation must determine the country of ultimate use, consumption, or disposition of the property or the property will be presumed to have been used, consumed, or disposed of outside the country under the laws of which the controlled foreign corporation is created or organized. A controlled foreign corporation which sells personal property to a related person is presumed to sell such property for use, consumption, or disposition outside the country under the laws of which the controlled foreign corporation is created or organized unless such corporation establishes the use made of the property by the related person; once it has established that the related person has disposed of the property, the rules in the two preceding sentences relating to sales by a controlled foreign corporation to an unrelated person will apply at the first stage in the chain of distribution at which a sale is made by a related person to an unrelated person. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subdivision, a controlled foreign corporation which sells personal property to any person all of whose business except for an insubstantial part consists of selling from inventory to retail customers at retail outlets all within one country may assume at the time of such sale to such person that such property will be used, consumed, or disposed of within such country.


(iii) *Fungible goods.* For purposes of this subparagraph, a controlled foreign corporation which sells to a purchaser personal property which because of its fungible nature cannot reasonable be specifically traced to other purchasers and to the countries of ultimate use, consumption, or disposition shall, unless such corporation establishes a different disposition as being proper, treat such property as being sold, for ultimate use, consumption, or disposition in those countries, and to those other purchasers, in the same proportions in which property from the fungible mass of the first purchaser is sold in the regular course of business by such first purchaser. No apportionment need be made, however, on the basis of sporadic sales by the first purchaser. This subdivision shall apply only in a case where the controlled foreign corporation knew, or should have known from the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction, the manner in which the first purchaser disposes of goods from the fungible mass.


(iv) *Illustrations.* The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(4) *Property manufactured, produced, or constructed by the controlled foreign corporation*—(i) *In general.* Foreign base company sales income does not include income of a controlled foreign corporation derived in connection with the sale of personal property manufactured, produced, or constructed by such corporation. A controlled foreign corporation will have manufactured, produced, or constructed personal property which the corporation sells only if such corporation satisfies the provisions of paragraph (a)(4)(ii), (a)(4)(iii), or (a)(4)(iv) of this section through the activities of its employees (as defined in § 31.3121(d)-1(c) of this chapter) with respect to such property. A controlled foreign corporation will not be treated as having manufactured, produced, or constructed personal property which the corporation sells merely because the property is sold in a different form than the form in which it was purchased. For rules of apportionment in determining foreign base company sales income derived from the sale of personal property purchased and used as a component part of property which is not manufactured, produced, or constructed, see paragraph (a)(5) of this section.


(ii) *Substantial transformation of property.* If personal property purchased by a foreign corporation is substantially transformed by such foreign corporation prior to sale, the property sold by the selling corporation is manufactured, produced, or constructed by such selling corporation. The application of this paragraph (a)(4)(ii) may be illustrated by the following examples:


(iii) *Manufacture of a product when purchased components constitute part of the property sold.* If purchased property is used as a component part of personal property which is sold, the sale of the property will be treated as the sale of a manufactured product, rather than the sale of component parts, if the assembly or conversion of the component parts into the final product by the selling corporation involves activities that are substantial in nature and generally considered to constitute the manufacture, production, or construction of property. Without limiting this substantive test, which is dependent on the facts and circumstances of each case, the operations of the selling corporation in connection with the use of the purchased property as a component part of the personal property which is sold will be considered to constitute the manufacture of a product if in connection with such property conversion costs (direct labor and factory burden) of such corporation account for 20 percent or more of the total cost of goods sold. In no event, however, will packaging, repackaging, labeling, or minor assembly operations constitute the manufacture, production, or construction of property for purposes of section 954(d)(1). The application of this paragraph (a)(4)(iii) may be illustrated by the following examples:


(iv) *Substantial contribution to manufacturing of personal property*—(*a*) *In general.* If an item of personal property would be considered manufactured, produced, or constructed (under the principles of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) or (a)(4)(iii) of this section) prior to sale by the controlled foreign corporation had all of the manufacturing, producing, and constructing activities undertaken with respect to that property prior to sale been undertaken by the controlled foreign corporation through the activities of its employees, then this paragraph (a)(4)(iv) applies. If this paragraph (a)(4)(iv) applies and if the facts and circumstances evince that the controlled foreign corporation makes a substantial contribution through the activities of its employees to the manufacture, production, or construction of the personal property sold, then the personal property sold by the controlled foreign corporation is manufactured, produced, or constructed by such controlled foreign corporation.


(*b*) *Activities.* The determination of whether a controlled foreign corporation makes a substantial contribution through the activities of its employees to the manufacture, production, or construction of the personal property sold involves, but will not necessarily be limited to, consideration of the following activities:


(*1*) Oversight and direction of the activities or process pursuant to which the property is manufactured, produced, or constructed (under the principles of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) or (a)(4)(iii) of this section).


(*2*) Activities that are considered in, but that are insufficient to satisfy, the tests provided in paragraphs (a)(4)(ii) and (a)(4)(iii) of this section.


(*3*) Material selection, vendor selection, or control of the raw materials, work-in-process or finished goods.


(*4*) Management of manufacturing costs or capacities (for example, managing the risk of loss, cost reduction or efficiency initiatives associated with the manufacturing process, demand planning, production scheduling, or hedging raw material costs).


(*5*) Control of manufacturing related logistics.


(*6*) Quality control (for example, sample testing or establishment of quality control standards).


(*7*) Developing, or directing the use or development of, product design and design specifications, as well as trade secrets, technology, or other intellectual property for the purpose of manufacturing, producing, or constructing the personal property.


(*c*) *Application of substantial contribution test.* When considering whether a controlled foreign corporation makes a substantial contribution to the manufacture, production, or construction of the personal property, the performance of any activity in paragraph (a)(4)(iv)(*b*) of this section will be taken into account. The performance or lack of performance of any particular activity in paragraph (a)(4)(iv)(*b*) of this section, or of a particular number of activities in (a)(4)(iv)(*b*) of this section, is not determinative. The weight accorded to the performance of any quantum of any activity (whether or not specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iv)(*b*) of this section) will vary with the facts and circumstances of the particular business. See paragraph (a)(4)(iv)(*d*) *Examples 8, 10* and *11* of this section. In determining whether the activities of the controlled foreign corporation constitute a substantial contribution, there is no minimum performance threshold before an activity can be considered. The fact that other persons make a substantial contribution to the manufacture, production, or construction of the personal property prior to sale does not preclude the controlled foreign corporation from making a substantial contribution to the manufacture, construction, or production of that property through the activities of its employees. See paragraph (a)(4)(iv)(*d*) *Example 9* of this section.


(*d*) *Examples.* The rules of this paragraph (a)(4)(iv) are illustrated by the following examples:


(5) *Rules for apportionment of income derived from the sale of purchased components used in property not manufactured, produced, or constructed.* The foreign base company sales income derived by a controlled foreign corporation for the taxable year from sales of personal property purchased and used as a component part of property which is not manufactured, produced, or constructed by such corporation within the meaning of subparagraph (4) of this paragraph shall, unless the records of the controlled foreign corporation show that a different apportionment of income is proper or unless all the income from such sales is treated as foreign base company sales income, be determined by first making for such year the following separate classifications and subclassifications with respect to the property which is sold and then by apportioning the income for such year from such sales in accordance with the rules of this subparagraph:


(i) A classification of the cost of components used in the property which is sold into two classes consisting of the cost of components manufactured, produced, constructed, grown, or extracted—


(*a*) Within the country under the laws of which the controlled foreign corporation is created or organized, and


(*b*) Outside such country;


(ii) A subclassification of the class described in subdivision (i) (*b*) of this subparagraph into—


(*a*) The cost of such components purchased from unrelated persons, and


(*b*) The cost of such components purchased from related persons;


(iii) A classification of the income derived from such sales into two classes consisting of income derived from sales for use, consumption, or disposition—


(*a*) Within the country under the laws of which the controlled foreign corporation is created or organized, and


(*b*) Outside such country; and


(iv) A subclassification of the class described in subdivision (iii) (*b*) of this subparagraph into income from—


(*a*) Sales to unrelated persons, and


(*b*) Sales to related persons.


(6) *Special rule applicable to distributive share of partnership income*—(i) *In general.* To determine the extent to which a controlled foreign corporation's distributive share of any item of gross income of a partnership would have been foreign base company sales income if received by it directly, under § 1.952-1(g), the property sold will be considered to be manufactured, produced, or constructed by the controlled foreign corporation, within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, only if the manufacturing exception of paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section would have applied to exclude the income from foreign base company sales income if the controlled foreign corporation had earned the income directly, determined by taking into account only the activities of the employees of, and property owned by, the partnership.


(ii) *Example.* The application of paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section is illustrated by the following example: 


(iii) *Effective date.* This paragraph (a)(6) applies to taxable years of a controlled foreign corporation beginning on or after July 23, 2002. 


(b) *Branches of controlled foreign corporation treated as separate corporations*—(1) *General rules for determining when to apply separate treatment*—(i) *Sales or purchase branch—(a) In general.* If a controlled foreign corporation carries on purchasing or selling activities by or through a branch or similar establishment located outside the country under the laws of which such corporation is created or organized and the use of the branch or similar establishment for such activities has substantially the same tax effect as if the branch or similar establishment were a wholly owned subsidiary corporation of such controlled foreign corporation, the branch or similar establishment and the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation will be treated as separate corporations for purposes of determining foreign base company sales income of such corporation. See section 954(d)(2).


(*b*) *Allocation of income and comparison of effective rates of tax.* The determination as to whether such use of the branch or similar establishment has the same tax effect as if it were a wholly owned subsidiary corporation of the controlled foreign corporation shall be made by allocating to such branch or similar establishment only that income derived by the branch or establishment which, when the special rules of subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph are applied, is described in paragraph (a) of this section (but determined without applying subparagraphs (2), (3), and (4) of such paragraph). The use of the branch or similar establishment for such activities will be considered to have substantially the same tax effect as if it were a wholly owned subsidiary corporation of the controlled foreign corporation if the income allocated to the branch or similar establishment under the immediately preceding sentence is, by statute, treaty obligation, or otherwise, taxed in the year when earned at an effective rate of tax that is less than 90 percent of, and at least 5 percentage points less than, the effective rate of tax which would apply to such income under the laws of the country in which the controlled foreign corporation is created or organized, if, under the laws of such country, the entire income of the controlled foreign corporation were considered derived by the corporation from sources within such country from doing business through a permanent establishment therein, received in such country, and allocable to such permanent establishment, and the corporation were managed and controlled in such country.


(*c*) *Use of more than one branch.* If a controlled foreign corporation carries on purchasing or selling activities by or through more than one branch or similar establishment located outside the country under the laws of which such corporation is created or organized, then paragraph (b)(1)(i)(*b*) of this section shall be applied separately to the income derived by each such branch or similar establishment (by treating such purchasing or selling branch or similar establishment as if it were the only branch or similar establishment of the controlled foreign corporation and as if any such other branches or similar establishments were separate corporations) in determining whether the use of such branch or similar establishment has substantially the same tax effect as if such branch or similar establishment were a wholly owned subsidiary corporation of the controlled foreign corporation. See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(*c*)(*1*) of this section for rules applicable to a controlled foreign corporation that carries on purchase or sales activities by or through one or more branches or similar establishments in addition to carrying on manufacturing activities by or through one or more branches or similar establishments.


(ii) *Manufacturing branch*—(*a*) *In general.* If a controlled foreign corporation carries on manufacturing, producing, constructing, growing, or extracting activities by or through a branch or similar establishment located outside the country under the laws of which such corporation is created or organized and the use of the branch or similar establishment for such activities with respect to personal property purchased or sold by or through the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation has substantially the same tax effect as if the branch or similar establishment were a wholly owned subsidiary corporation of such controlled foreign corporation, the branch or similar establishment and the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation will be treated as separate corporations for purposes of determining the foreign base company sales income of such corporation. See section 954(d)(2). The provisions of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii) will apply only if the controlled foreign corporation (including any branches or similar establishments of such controlled foreign corporation) manufactures, produces, or constructs such personal property within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, or carries on growing or extracting activities with respect to such personal property.


(*b*) *Allocation of income and comparison of effective rates of tax.* The determination as to whether such use of the branch or similar establishment has substantially the same tax effect as if the branch or similar establishment were a wholly owned subsidiary corporation of the controlled foreign corporation shall be made by allocating to the remainder of such controlled foreign corporation only that income derived by the remainder of such corporation, which, when the special rules of subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph are applied, is described in paragraph (a) of this section (but determined without applying subparagraphs (2), (3), and (4) of such paragraph). The use of the branch or similar establishment for such activities will be considered to have substantially the same tax effect as if it were a wholly owned subsidiary corporation of the controlled foreign corporation if income allocated to the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation under the immediately preceding sentence is, by statute, treaty obligation, or otherwise, taxed in the year when earned at an effective rate of tax that is less than 90 percent of, and at least 5 percentage points less than, the effective rate of tax which would apply to such income under the laws of the country in which the branch or similar establishment is located, if, under the laws of such country, the entire income of the controlled foreign corporation were considered derived by such corporation from sources within such country from doing business through a permanent establishment therein, received in such country, and allocable to such permanent establishment, and the corporation were created or organized under the laws of, and managed and controlled in, such country.


(*c*) *Use of more than one branch*—(*1*) *Use of one or more sales or purchase branches in addition to a manufacturing branch.* If, with respect to personal property manufactured, produced, constructed, grown, or extracted by or through a branch or similar establishment located outside the country under the laws of which the controlled foreign corporation is created or organized, purchasing or selling activities are carried on by or through more than one branch or similar establishment, or by or through one or more branches or similar establishments located outside such country, of such corporation, then paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(*b*) of this section shall be applied separately to the income derived by each such purchasing or selling branch or similar establishment (by treating such purchasing or selling branch or similar establishment as though it alone were the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation) for purposes of determining whether the use of such manufacturing, producing, constructing, growing, or extracting branch or similar establishment has substantially the same tax effect as if such branch or similar establishment were a wholly owned subsidiary corporation of the controlled foreign corporation. If this rule applies, the sales or purchase branch rules contained in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section do not apply. The application of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(*c*)(*1*) is illustrated by the following example:


(*2*) *Use of more than one branch to manufacture, produce, construct, grow, or extract separate items of personal property.* If a controlled foreign corporation carries on manufacturing, producing, constructing, growing, or extracting activities with respect to separate items of personal property by or through more than one branch or similar establishment located outside the country under the laws of which such corporation is created or organized, then paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(*b*) and (*c*) of this section will be applied separately to each such branch or similar establishment (by treating such manufacturing branch or similar establishment as if it were the only such branch or similar establishment of the controlled foreign corporation and as if any other such branches or similar establishments were separate corporations) for purposes of determining whether the use of such branch or similar establishment has substantially the same tax effect as if such branch or similar establishment were a wholly owned subsidiary corporation of the controlled foreign corporation. The application of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(*c*)(*2*) is illustrated by the following example:


(*3*) *Use of more than one manufacturing branch, or one or more manufacturing branches and the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation, to manufacture, produce, or construct the same item of personal property*—(*i*) *In general.* This paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(*c*)(*3*) applies to determine the location of manufacture, production, or construction of personal property for purposes of applying paragraph (b)(1)(i)(*b*) or (b)(1)(ii)(*b*) of this section where more than one branch or similar establishment of a controlled foreign corporation, or one or more branches or similar establishments of a controlled foreign corporation and the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation, each engage in manufacturing, producing, or constructing activities with respect to the same item of personal property which is then sold by the controlled foreign corporation. This paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(*c*)(*3*) is applied separately with respect to the income derived by each purchasing or selling branch or similar establishment or purchasing or selling remainder of the controlled foreign corporation as provided under paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii) of this section. The location of manufacture, production, or construction is determined under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(*c*)(*3*)(*ii*) of this section if one or more branches or similar establishments or the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation independently satisfies paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section with respect to an item of personal property. The location of manufacture, production, or construction is determined under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(*c*)(*3*)(*iii*) of this section if none of the branches or similar establishments or the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation independently satisfies paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section with respect to an item of personal property, but the controlled foreign corporation as a whole makes a substantial contribution to the manufacture, production or construction of that property within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(*c*)(*3*), the location of any activity with respect to the manufacture, production, or construction of an item of personal property is determined under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(*c*)(*3*)(*iv*) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(*c*)(*3*), if multiple branches or similar establishments are located in a single jurisdiction, then the activities of those branches will be aggregated for purposes of determining whether a branch or remainder of the controlled foreign corporation satisfies paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section.


(*ii*) *Manufacture, production, or construction in one or more locations.* If only one branch or similar establishment or only the remainder of a controlled foreign corporation independently satisfies paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section with respect to an item of personal property, then that branch or similar establishment or the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation will be the location of manufacture, production, or construction of that property for purposes of applying paragraph (b)(1)(i)(*b*) or (b)(1)(ii)(*b*) of this section to the income from the sale of that property. See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(*c*)(*3*)(*v*) *Example 1* of this section. If more than one branch or similar establishment or one or more branches or similar establishments and the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation, each independently satisfy paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section with respect to an item of personal property, then the location of manufacture, production, or construction of that property for purposes of applying paragraph (b)(1)(i)(*b*) or (b)(1)(ii)(*b*) of this section will be the location of that branch or similar establishment or the jurisdiction under the laws of which the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation is organized that satisfies paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section and that would, after applying paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(*b*) of this section to such branch or similar establishment or paragraph (b)(1)(i)(*b*) of this section to the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation, impose the lowest effective rate of tax on the income allocated to such branch or the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation under such section (that is, either paragraph (b)(1)(i)(*b*) or (b)(1)(ii)(*b*) of this section). See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(*c*)(*3*)(*v*) *Example 2* of this section.


(*iii*) *No location independently satisfies manufacturing test.* If no branch or similar establishment or the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation independently satisfies paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section with respect to an item of personal property but the controlled foreign corporation as a whole makes a substantial contribution to the manufacture, production, or construction of that property within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section, then for purposes of applying paragraph (b)(1)(i)(*b*) or (b)(1)(ii)(*b*) of this section, the location of manufacture, production, or construction with respect to the income derived by a purchasing or selling branch or similar establishment or the purchasing or selling remainder of the controlled foreign corporation in connection with the purchase or sale of that property will be the “tested manufacturing location” unless the “tested sales location” provides a greater contribution to the manufacture, production, or construction of the property. The tested manufacturing location is the location of any branch or similar establishment or remainder of the controlled foreign corporation that contributes to the manufacture, production, or construction of the personal property, if any, that would, after applying paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(*b*) of this section to such branch or similar establishment or paragraph (b)(1)(i)(*b*) of this section to the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation, be treated as a separate corporation and would impose the lowest effective rate of tax on the income allocated to such branch or similar establishment or to the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation under such section (that is, either paragraph (b)(1)(i)(*b*) or (b)(1)(ii)(*b*) of this section). The tested sales location is the location of the purchasing or selling branch or similar establishment or the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation by or through which the purchasing or selling activities are carried on with respect to the personal property. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(*c*)(*3*)(*iii*), the contribution to the manufacture, production, or construction of the personal property by the tested sales location will be deemed to include the activities of any branch or similar establishment or remainder of the controlled foreign corporation that would not be treated as a corporation separate from the tested sales location after the application of paragraph (b)(1)(i)(*b*) or (b)(1)(ii)(*b*) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(*c*)(*3*)(*iii*), the contribution of the tested manufacturing location to the manufacture, production, or construction of the personal property will be deemed to include any activities of any branch or similar establishment or remainder of the controlled foreign corporation that would be treated as a corporation separate from the tested sales location after the application of paragraph (b)(1)(i)(*b*) or (b)(1)(ii)(*b*) of this section. Whether the tested sales location provides a greater contribution to the manufacture, production, or construction of the personal property is determined by weighing the relative contributions to the manufacture, production, or construction of that property by the tested sales location and the tested manufacturing location under the facts and circumstances test provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section. See paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(*c*)(*3*)(*v*) *Examples 3,**4, 5,* and *6* of this section. If the tested sales location provides a greater contribution to the manufacture, production, or construction of the personal property than the tested manufacturing location or if there is no tested manufacturing location, then the tested sales location is the location of manufacture, production, or construction of that property and the rules of paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(*a*) and (b)(1)(ii)(*a*) of this section will not apply with respect to the income derived by the tested sales location in connection with the purchase or sale of that property and the use of that purchasing or selling branch or similar establishment or the purchasing or selling remainder will not result in a branch being treated as a separate corporation for purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.


(*iv*) *Location of activity.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(*c*)(*3*) of this section, the location of any activity with respect to the manufacture, production, or construction of an item of personal property is the location where the employees of the controlled foreign corporation perform such activity. For example, the location of any activity concerning intellectual property is determined based on where employees of the controlled foreign corporation develop or direct the use or development of the intellectual property, not on the formal assignment of that intellectual property.


(*v*) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(*c*)(*3*):


(*4*) *Use of more than one branch to manufacture, produce, construct, grow, or extract separate items of personal property.* For purposes of paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(*c*)(*2*) and (b)(1)(ii)(*c*)(*3*) of this section, an item of personal property refers to an individual unit of personal property rather than a type or class of personal property.


(2) *Special rules*—(i) *Determination of treatment as a wholly owned subsidiary corporation.* For purposes of determining under this paragraph whether the use of a branch or similar establishment which is treated as a separate corporation has substantially the same tax effect as if the branch or similar establishment were a wholly owned subsidiary corporation of a controlled foreign corporation—


(*a*) *Treatment as separate corporations.* The branch or similar establishment will be treated as a wholly owned subsidiary corporation of the controlled foreign corporation, and such branch or similar establishment will be deemed to be incorporated in the country in which it is located.


(*b*) *Activities treated as performed on behalf of the remainder of corporation.* (*1*) With respect to purchasing or selling activities performed by or through the branch or similar establishment, such purchasing or selling activities will, with respect to personal property manufactured, produced, constructed, grown, or extracted by the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation, be treated as performed on behalf of the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation.


(*2*) With respect to purchasing or selling activities performed by or through the branch or similar establishment, such purchasing or selling activities will, with respect to personal property (other than property described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(*b*)(*1*) of this section) purchased or sold, or purchased and sold, by the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation (or any branch treated as the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation), be treated as performed on behalf of the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation.


(*c*) *Activities treated as performed on behalf of branch.* With respect to manufacturing, producing, constructing, growing, or extracting activities performed by or through the branch or similar establishment, purchasing or selling activities performed by or through the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation with respect to the personal property manufactured, produced, constructed, grown, or extracted by or through the branch or similar establishment shall be treated as performed on behalf of the branch or similar establishment.


(*d*) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.954-3T(b)(2)(i)(*d*).


(*e*) *Tax laws to be taken into account.* Tax determinations shall be made by taking into account only the income, war profits, excess profits, or similar tax laws (or the absence of such laws) of the countries involved.


(ii) *Determination of foreign base company sales income.* Once it has been determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph that a branch or similar establishment and the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation are to be treated as separate corporations, the determination of whether such branch or similar establishment, or the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation, as the case may be, has foreign base company sales income shall be made by applying the following rules:


(*a*) *Treatment as separate corporations.* The branch or similar establishment will be treated as a wholly owned subsidiary corporation of the controlled foreign corporation, and such branch or similar establishment will be deemed to be incorporated in the country in which it is located. For purposes of applying the rules of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii), a branch or similar establishment of a controlled foreign corporation treated as a separate corporation purchasing or selling on behalf of the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(*b*) of this section, or the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation treated as a separate corporation purchasing or selling on behalf of a branch or similar establishment of the controlled foreign corporation under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(*c*) of this section, will include the activities of any other branch or similar establishment or remainder of the controlled foreign corporation that would not be treated as a separate corporation (apart from the branch or similar establishment of a controlled foreign corporation that is treated as performing purchasing or selling activities on behalf of the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(*b*) of this section or the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation that is treated as performing purchasing or selling activities on behalf of the branch or similar establishment under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(*c*) of this section) if the effective rate of tax imposed on the income of the purchasing or selling branch or similar establishment, or purchasing or selling remainder of the controlled foreign corporation, were tested under the principles of paragraph (b)(1)(i)(*b*) or (b)(1)(ii)(*b*) of this section against the effective rate of tax that would apply to such income if it were considered derived by such other branch or similar establishment or the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation.


(*b*) *Activities treated as performed on behalf of the remainder of corporation.* (*1*) With respect to purchasing or selling activities performed by or through the branch or similar establishment, such purchasing or selling activities will, with respect to personal property manufactured, produced, constructed, grown, or extracted by the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation, be treated as performed on behalf of the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation.


(*2*) With respect to purchasing or selling activities performed by or through the branch or similar establishment, such purchasing or selling activities will, with respect to personal property (other than property described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(*b*)(*1*) of this section) purchased or sold, or purchased and sold, by the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation (or any branch treated as the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation), be treated as performed on behalf of the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation.


(*c*) *Activities treated as performed on behalf of branch.* With respect to manufacturing, producing, constructing, growing, or extracting activities performed by or through the branch or similar establishment, purchasing or selling activities performed by or through the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation with respect to the personal property manufactured, produced, constructed, grown, or extracted by or through the branch or similar establishment shall be treated as performed on behalf of the branch or similar establishment.


(*d*) [Reserved]


(*e*) *Comparison with ordinary treatment.* Income derived by a branch or similar establishment, or by the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation, will not be foreign base company sales income under paragraph (b) of this section if the income would not be foreign base company sales income if it were derived by a separate controlled foreign corporation under like circumstances.


(*f*) *Priority of application.* If income derived by the branch or similar establishment, or by the remainder of the controlled foreign corporation, from a transaction would be classified as foreign base company sales income of such controlled foreign corporation under section 954(d)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section, the income shall, notwithstanding this paragraph, be treated as foreign base company sales income under paragraph (a) of this section and the branch or similar establishment shall not be treated as a separate corporation with respect to such income.


(3) *Inclusion of amounts in gross income of United States shareholders.* A branch or similar establishment of a controlled foreign corporation and the remainder of such corporation shall be treated as separate corporations under this paragraph solely for purposes of determining the foreign base company sales income of each such corporation and for purposes of including an amount in subpart F income of the controlled foreign corporation under section 953(a). See section 954(b)(3) and paragraph (d)(4) of § 1.954-1 for rules relating to the treatment of a branch or similar establishment of a controlled foreign corporation and the remainder of such corporation as separate corporations for purposes of independently determining if the foreign base company income of each such corporation is less than 10 percent, or more than 70 percent, of its gross income. For all other purposes, however, a branch or similar establishment of a controlled foreign corporation and the remainder of such corporation shall not be treated as separate corporations. For example, if the controlled foreign corporation has a deficit in earnings and profits to which section 952(c) applies, the limitation of such section on the amount includable in the subpart F income of such corporation will apply. Moreover, income, war profits, or excess profits taxes paid by a branch or similar establishment to a foreign country will be treated as having been paid by the controlled foreign corporation for purposes of section 960 (relating to special rules for foreign tax credit) and the regulations thereunder. Also, income of a branch or similar establishment, treated as a separate corporation under this paragraph, will not be treated as dividend income of the controlled foreign corporation of which it is a branch or similar establishment.


(4) *Illustrations.* The application of this paragraph (b) may be illustrated by the following examples:


(c) *Effective/applicability date.* Paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(iii) *Example 1,* (a)(1)(iii) *Example 2,* (a)(2), (a)(4)(i), (a)(4)(ii), (a)(4)(iii), (a)(4)(iv), (a)(6)(i), (b)(1)(i)(*c*), (b)(1)(ii)(*a*), (b)(1)(ii)(*c*), (b)(2)(i)(*b*), (b)(2)(ii)(*a*), (b)(2)(ii)(*b*), (b)(2)(ii)(*e*), and (b)(4) *Example 3,* (b)(4) *Example 8,* and (b)(4) *Example 9* of this section shall apply to taxable years of controlled foreign corporations beginning after June 30, 2009, and for taxable years of United States shareholders in which or with which such taxable years of the controlled foreign corporations end.


(d) *Application of regulations to earlier taxable years.* A taxpayer may choose to apply these regulations retroactively with respect to its open taxable years that began prior to July 1, 2009. The taxpayer may so choose if and only if the taxpayer and all members of the taxpayer's affiliated group (within the meaning of section 1504(a)) apply these regulations, in their entirety, to the earliest taxable year of each controlled foreign corporation that ends with or within an open taxable year of the taxpayer and to all subsequent taxable years.
