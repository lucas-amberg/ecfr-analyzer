# § 1.955-1   Shareholder's pro rata share of amount of previously excluded subpart F income withdrawn from investment in less developed countries.

(a) *In general.* Pursuant to section 951(a)(1)(A)(ii) and the regulations thereunder, a United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation must include in its gross income its pro rata share (as determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section) of the amount of such controlled foreign corporation's previously excluded subpart F income which is withdrawn for any taxable year from investment in less developed countries. Section 955 provides rules for determining the amount of a controlled foreign corporation's previously excluded subpart F income for any taxable year of the corporation beginning after December 31, 1962, that is withdrawn from investment in less developed countries for any taxable year of the corporation beginning before January 1, 1976. Except for investment in less developed country shipping companies, section 955 also provides rules for determining the amount of a controlled foreign corporation's previously excluded subpart F income for any taxable year of the corporation beginning after December 31, 1962, which is withdrawn from investment in less developed countries in taxable years of the corporation beginning after December 31, 1975. To determine the amount of a controlled foreign corporation's previously excluded subpart F income withdrawn from investment in less developed country shipping companies described in section 955(c)(2) in taxable years of a controlled foreign corporation beginning after December 31, 1975, see section 955(b)(5) (as in effect after amendment by the Tax Reduction Act of 1975) and §§ 1.955A-1 through 1.955A-4. For effective dates, see § 1.955-0.


(b) *Amount withdrawn by controlled foreign corporation*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of sections 951 through 964, the amount of a controlled foreign corporation's previously excluded subpart F income which is withdrawn for any taxable year from investment in less developed countries is an amount equal to the decrease for such year in such corporation's qualified investments in less developed countries. Such decrease is, except as provided in § 1.955-3—


(i) An amount equal to the excess of the amount of its qualified investments in less developed countries at the close of the preceding taxable year over the amount of its qualified investments in less developed countries at the close of the taxable year, minus


(ii) The amount (if any) by which recognized losses on sales or exchanges by such corporation during the taxable year of qualified investments in less developed countries exceed its recognized gains on sales or exchanges during such year of qualified investments in less developed countries,


(2) *Limitations applicable in determining decreases*—(i) *General.* The limitation referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph for any taxable year of a controlled foreign corporation shall be the lesser of the following two limitations:


(*a*) The sum of the controlled foreign corporation's earnings and profits (or deficit in earnings and profits) for the taxable year, computed as of the close of the taxable year without diminution by reason of any distributions made during the taxable year, plus the sum of its earnings and profits (or deficits in earnings and profits) accumulated for prior taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962, (including prior taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975) or,


(*b*) The sum of the amounts excluded under section 954(b)(1) and paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.954-1 from the foreign base company income of such corporation for all prior taxable years, minus the sum of the amounts (determined under this paragraph) of its previously excluded subpart F income withdrawn from investment in less developed countries for all prior taxable years.


(ii) *Treatment of earnings and profits.* For purposes of determining earnings and profits of a controlled foreign corporation under subdivision (i)(*a*) of this subparagraph, such earnings and profits shall be considered not to include any amounts which are attributable to—


(*a*)(*1*) Amounts which, for the current taxable year, are included in the gross income of a United States shareholder of such controlled foreign corporation under section 951(a)(1)(A)(i) or (iii), or


(*2*) Amounts which, for any prior taxable year, have been included in the gross income of a United States shareholder of such controlled foreign corporation under section 951(a) and have not been distributed; or


(*b*)(*1*) Amounts which, for the current taxable year, are included in the gross income of a United States shareholder of such controlled foreign corporation under section 551(b) or would be so included under such section but for the fact that such amounts were distributed to such shareholder during the taxable year, or


(*2*) Amounts which, for any prior taxable year, have been included in the gross income of a United States shareholder of such controlled foreign corporation under section 551(b) and have not been distributed.


(3) *Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975.* (i) In the case of a taxable year of a controlled foreign corporation beginning after December 31, 1975, § 1.955-2(b)(5) must be applied in determining the amount of its qualified investments in less developed countries on both of the determination dates applicable to such taxable year.


(ii) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(c) *Shareholder's pro rata share of amount withdrawn by controlled foreign corporation*—(1) *In general.* A United States shareholder's pro rata share of a controlled foreign corporation's previously excluded subpart F income withdrawn for any taxable year from investment in less developed countries is his pro rata share of the amount withdrawn for such year by such corporation, as determined under paragraph (b) of this section. See section 955(a)(3).


(2) *Special rule.* A United States shareholder's pro rata share of the net amount determined under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(*b*) of this section with respect to any stock of the controlled foreign corporation owned by such shareholder shall be determined without taking into account any amount attributable to a period prior to the date on which such shareholder acquired such stock. See section 1248 and the regulations thereunder for rules governing treatment of gain from sales or exchanges of stock in certain foreign corporations.


(d) *Illustrations.* The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:
