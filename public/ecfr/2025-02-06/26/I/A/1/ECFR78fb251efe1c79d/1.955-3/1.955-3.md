(b) *Time and manner of making election*—(1) *Without consent.* An election under this section with respect to a controlled foreign corporation shall be made without the consent of the Commissioner by a United States shareholder's filing a statement to such effect with his return for his taxable year in which or with which ends the first taxable year of such controlled foreign corporation in which—


(i) Such shareholder owns, within the meaning of section 958(a), or is considered as owning by applying the rules of ownership of section 958(b), 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of such controlled foreign corporation, and


(ii) Such controlled foreign corporation realizes foreign base company income from which amounts are excluded under section 954(b)(1) and paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.954-1.


(2) *With consent.* An election under this section with respect to a controlled foreign corporation may be made by a United States shareholder at any time with the consent of the Commissioner. Consent will not be granted unless the United States shareholder and the Commissioner agree to the terms, conditions, and adjustments under which the election will be effected. Consent will not be granted if the first taxable year of the controlled foreign corporation with respect to which the shareholder desires to compute an amount described in section 954(b)(1) in accordance with the election provided in this section begins after December 31, 1975. The application for consent to elect shall be made by the United States shareholder's mailing a letter for such purpose to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC 20224. The application shall be mailed before the close of the first taxable year of the controlled foreign corporation with respect to which the shareholder desires to compute an amount described in section 954(b)(1) in accordance with the election provided in this section. The application shall include the following information:


(i) The name, address, and taxable year of the United States shareholder;


(ii) The name and address of the controlled foreign corporation;


(iii) The first taxable year of the controlled foreign corporation for which income is to be computed under the election;


(iv) The amount of the controlled foreign corporation's qualified investments in less developed countries at the close of its preceding taxable year; and


(v) The sum of the amounts excluded under section 954(b)(1) and paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.954-1 from the foreign base company income of the controlled foreign corporation for all prior taxable years during which such shareholder was a United States shareholder of such corporation and the sum of the amounts of its previously excluded subpart F income withdrawn from investment in less developed countries for all prior taxable years during which such shareholder was a United States shareholder of such corporation.


(c) *Effect of election*—(1) *General.* Except as provided in subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph, an election under this section with respect to a controlled foreign corporation shall be binding on the United States shareholder and shall apply to all qualified investments in less developed countries acquired, or disposed of, by such controlled foreign corporation during the taxable year following its taxable year for which income is first computed under the election and during all succeeding taxable years of such corporation.


(2) *Returns.* Any return of a United States shareholder required to be filed before the completion of a period with respect to which determinations are to be made as to a controlled foreign corporation's qualified investments in less developed countries for purposes of computing such shareholder's taxable income shall be filed on the basis of an estimate of the amount of the controlled foreign corporation's qualified investments in less developed countries at the close of the period. If the actual amount of such investments is not the same as the amount of the estimate, the United States shareholder shall immediately notify the Commissioner. The Commissioner will thereupon redetermine the amount of tax of such United States shareholder for the year or years with respect to which the incorrect amount was taken into account. The amount of tax, if any, due upon such redetermination shall be paid by the United States shareholder upon notice and demand by the district director. The amount of tax, if any, shown by such redetermination to have been overpaid shall be credited or refunded to the United States shareholder in accordance with the provisions of sections 6402 and 6511 and the regulations thereunder.


(3) *Revocation.* Upon application by the United States shareholder, the election made under this section may, subject to the approval of the Commissioner, be revoked. Approval will not be granted unless the United States shareholder and the Commissioner agree to the terms, conditions, and adjustments under which the rev- ocation will be effected. Unless such agreement provides otherwise, the change in the controlled foreign corporation's qualified investments in less developed countries for its first taxable year for which income is computed without regard to the election previously made will be considered to be zero for purposes of effectuating the revocation. The application for consent to revocation shall be made by the United States shareholder's mailing a letter for such purpose to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC 20224. The application shall be mailed before the close of the first taxable year of the controlled foreign corporation with respect to which the shareholder desires to compute the amounts described in section 954(b)(1) or 955(a) without regard to the election provided in this section.
