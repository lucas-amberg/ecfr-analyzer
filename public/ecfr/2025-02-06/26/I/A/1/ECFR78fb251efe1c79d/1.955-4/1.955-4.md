# § 1.955-4   Definition of less developed country.

(a) *Designation by Executive order.* For purposes of sections 951 through 964, the term “less developed country” means any foreign country (other than an area within the Sino-Soviet bloc) or any possession of the United States with respect to which, on the first day of the foreign corporation's taxable year, there is in effect an Executive order by the President of the United States designating such country or possession as an economically less developed country for purposes of such sections. Each territory, department, province, or possession of any foreign country other than a country within the Sino-Soviet bloc may be treated as a separate foreign country for purposes of such designation if the territory, department, province, or possession is overseas from the country of which it is a territory, department, province, or possession. Thus, for example, an overseas possession of a foreign country may be designated by Executive order as an economically less developed country even though the foreign country itself has not been designated as an economically less developed country; or the foreign country may be so designated even though the overseas possessions of such country have not been designated as economically less developed countries. The term “possession of the United States”, for purposes of section 955(c)(3) and this section, shall be construed to have the same meaning as that contained in paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.957-3.


(b) *Countries not eligible for designation.* Section 955(c)(3) provides that no designation by Executive order may be made under section 955(c)(3) and paragraph (a) of this section with respect to—


(c) *Termination of designation.* Section 955(c)(3) provides that, after the President has designated any foreign country or possession of the United States as an economically less developed country for purposes of sections 951 through 964, he may not terminate such designation (either by issuing an Executive order for the purpose of terminating such designation or by issuing an Executive order which has the effect of terminating such designation) unless, at least 30 days prior to such termination, he has notified the Senate and the House of Representatives of his intention to terminate such designation. If such 30-day notice is given, no action by the Congress of the United States is necessary to effectuate the termination. The requirement for giving 30-day notice to the Senate and House of Representatives applies also to the termination of a designation with respect to an overseas territory, department, province, or possession of a foreign country. See paragraph (c) of § 1.955-2 for the effect of a termination of a Presidential designation upon property which would be a qualified investment in a less developed country but for the fact of such termination.
