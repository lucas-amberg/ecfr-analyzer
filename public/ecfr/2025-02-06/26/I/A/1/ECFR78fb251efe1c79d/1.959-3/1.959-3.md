# § 1.959-3   Allocation of distributions to earnings and profits of foreign corporations.

(a) *In general.* For purposes of §§ 1.959-1 and 1.959-2, the source of the earnings and profits from which distributions are made by a foreign corporation as between earnings and profits attributable to increases in earnings invested in United States property, previously taxed subpart F income, previously excluded subpart F income withdrawn from investment in less developed countries, previously excluded subpart F income withdrawn from investment in foreign base company shipping operations, and other amounts shall be determined in accordance with section 959(c) and paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.


(b) *Applicability of section 316(a).* For purposes of this section, section 316(a) shall be applied, in determining the source of distributions from the earnings and profits of a foreign corporation, by first applying section 316(a)(2) and then by applying section 316(a)(1)—


(1) First, as provided by section 959 (c)(1), to earnings and profits attributable to amounts included in gross income of a United States shareholder under section 951(a)(1)(B) (or which would have been so included but for section 959(a)(2) and paragraph (c) of § 1.959-1), 


(2) Secondly, as provided by section 959(c)(2), to earnings and profits attributable to amounts included in gross income of a United States shareholder under section 951(a)(1)(A) (but reduced by amounts not included in such gross income under section 951(a)(1)(B) because of the exclusion provided by section 959(a)(2) and paragraph (c) of § 1.959-1), and


(3) Finally, as provided by section 959(c)(3), to other earnings and profits. Thus, distributions shall be considered first attributable to amounts, if any, described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (first for the current taxable year and then for prior taxable years beginning with the most recent prior taxable year), secondly to amounts, if any, described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (first for the current taxable year and then for prior taxable years beginning with the most recent prior taxable year), and finally to the amounts, if any, described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (first for the current taxable year and then for prior taxable years beginning with the most recent prior taxable year). See, however, paragraph (e) of § 1.963-3 (applied as if section 963 had not been repealed by the Tax Reduction Act of 1975) for a special rule for determination of the source of distributions counting as minimum distributions. Earnings and profits are classified as to year and as to section 959(c) amount in the year in which such amounts are included in gross income of a United States shareholder under section 951(a) and are reclassified as to section 959(c) amount in the year in which such amounts would be so included but for the provisions of section 959(a)(2); any subsequent distribution of such amounts to a higher tier in a chain of ownership described in section 958(a) does not of itself change such classifications. For example, earnings and profits of a foreign corporation attributable to amounts of previously excluded subpart F income withdrawn from investment in less developed countries (or from investments in export trade assets or foreign base company shipping operations) shall be reclassified as amounts to which subparagraph (2), rather than subparagraph (3), of this paragraph applies for purposes of determining priority of distribution, and such earnings and profits shall be considered attributable to the taxable year in which the withdrawal occurs. This paragraph shall apply to distributions by one foreign corporation to another foreign corporation and by a foreign corporation to a United States person. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:


(c) *Treatment of deficits in earnings and profits.* For purposes of this section, a United States shareholder's pro rata share (determined in accordance with the principles of paragraph (e) of § 1.951-1) of a foreign corporation's deficit in earnings and profits, determined under section 964(a) and § 1.964-1, for any taxable year shall be applied only to earnings and profits described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.


(d) *Treatment of certain foreign taxes.* For purposes of this section, any amount described in subparagraph (1), (2), or (3) of paragraph (b) of this section which is distributed by a foreign corporation through a chain of ownership described in section 958(a)(2) shall be reduced by any income, war profits, or excess profits taxes imposed on or with respect to such distribution by any foreign country or possession of the United States.


(e) *Determination of foreign tax credit.* For purposes of applying section 902 and section 960 in determining the foreign tax credit allowable under section 901 in a case in which distributions are made by a second-tier corporation or a first-tier corporation, as the case may be, from its earnings and profits for a taxable year which are attributable to an amount included in the gross income of a U.S. shareholder under section 951(a) or which are attributable to amounts excluded from the gross income of such foreign corporation under section 959(b) and § 1.959-2 with respect to a U.S. shareholder, the rules of paragraph (b) of this section shall apply except that in applying subparagraph (1) or (2) of such paragraph—


(1) Distributions from the earnings and profits for such taxable year of the second-tier corporation shall be considered first attributable to its earnings and profits attributable to distributions from the earnings and profits of the foreign corporation, if any, next lower in the chain of ownership described in section 958(a), to the extent of such earnings and profits of the second-tier corporation, and then to the other earnings and profits of such second-tier corporation, and


(2) Distributions from the earnings and profits for such taxable year of the first-tier corporation shall be considered first attributable to its earnings and profits attributable to distributions from the earnings and profits of the second-tier corporation, to the extent of such earnings and profits of the first-tier corporation, and then to the other earnings and profits of such first-tier corporation. For purposes of this paragraph, a second-tier corporation is a foreign corporation referred to in section 960(a)(1)(B), and a first-tier corporation is a foreign corporation referred to in section 960 (a)(1)(A). The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(f) *Illustration.* The application of this section may be illustrated by the following example:
