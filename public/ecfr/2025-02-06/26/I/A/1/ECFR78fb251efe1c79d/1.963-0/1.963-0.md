(i) It has a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1976, which ends within such taxable year of the United States shareholder, and


(ii) It is either—


(A) A controlled foreign corporation or


(B) A foreign corporation by reason of ownership of stock in which such shareholder indirectly owns (within the meaning of section 958(a)(2)) stock in a controlled foreign corporation to which this subparagraph applies.


(2) *Series rule.* If any foreign corporation in a series of foreign corporations is excluded by subparagraph (i) of this paragraph from a chain or group election of a United States shareholder for its taxable year, then any foreign corporation in which the United States shareholder owns stock indirectly by reason of ownership of stock in such excluded corporation shall also be excluded from such election to the extent of such indirect ownership regardless of when its taxable year begins.


(3) *Illustration.* The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:


(c) *Deficiency distributions.* The rules relating to deficiency distributions under section 963(e)(2) and § 1.963-6 shall continue to apply to a taxable year beginning after the effective date of the repeal of section 963 in which it is determined that a deficiency distribution must be made for an earlier taxable year for which a United States shareholder made an election to secure the exclusion under section 963 but failed to receive a minimum distribution.


(d) *Special adjustments pursuant to section 963 to be taken into account for taxable years subsequent to the repeal of section 963.* If a United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation elects to receive a minimum distribution under section 963 for a taxable year, section 963 and the regulations thereunder may require certain elections and adjustments to be made in subsequent taxable years. These elections and adjustments shall be taken into account for subsequent taxable years as if section 963 were still in effect and no election to receive a minimum distribution were made after the effective date of the repeal of section 963. Examples of these elections and special adjustments include, but are not limited to, the election which may be made pursuant to § 1.963-3(g)(2), relating to the special extended distribution period, and the special adjustments to be made pursuant to § 1.963-4, relating to the minimum overall tax burden test.
