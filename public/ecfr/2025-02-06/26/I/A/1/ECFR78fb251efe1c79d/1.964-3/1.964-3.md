# § 1.964-3   Records to be provided by United States shareholders.

(a) *Shareholder's responsibility for providing records.* For purposes of verifying his income tax liability in respect of amounts includible in income under section 951 for the taxable year of a controlled foreign corporation each United State shareholder (as defined in section 951(b)) who owns (within the meaning of section 958(a)) stock of such corporation shall, within a reasonable time after demand by the district director, provide the district director—


(1) Such permanent books of account or records as are sufficient to satisfy the requirements of section 6001 and section 964(c), or true copies thereof, as are reasonably demanded, and


(2) If such books or records are not maintained in the English language, either (i) an accurate English translation of such books or records or (ii) the services of a qualified interpreter satisfactory to the district director.


(b) *Records to be provided.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the requirements of section 6001 and section 964(c) for record keeping shall be considered satisfied if the books or records produced are sufficient to verify for the taxable year—


(1) The subpart F income of the controlled foreign corporation and, if any part of such income is excluded from the income of the United States shareholder under section 963 or section 970(a), the application of such exclusion,


(2) The previously excluded subpart F income of such corporation withdrawn from investment in less developed countries,


(3) The previously excluded subpart F income of such corporation withdrawn from investment in foreign base company shipping operations,


(4) The previously excluded export trade income of such corporation withdrawn from investment, and


(5) The increase in earnings invested by such corporation in United States property.


(c) *Special rules.* Verification of the subpart F income of the controlled foreign corporation for the taxable year shall not be required if—


(1) It can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the district director that—


(i) The locus and nature of such corporation's activities were such as to make it unlikely that the foreign base company income of such corporation (determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of § 1.952-3) exceeded 5 percent of its gross income (determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.952-3) for the taxable year. (For taxable years to which § 1.952-3 does not apply, such amounts shall be determined under 26 CFR § 1.954-1(d)(3)(i) and (ii) (Revised as of April 1, 1975))), and


(ii) If such corporation reinsures or issues insurance or annuity contracts in connection with United States risks, the 5-percent minimum premium requirement prescribed in paragraph (b) of § 1.953-1 has not been exceeded for the taxable year, or


(2) The United States shareholder's pro rata share of such subpart F income is excluded in full from his income under section 963 and the books or records verify the application of such exclusion.
