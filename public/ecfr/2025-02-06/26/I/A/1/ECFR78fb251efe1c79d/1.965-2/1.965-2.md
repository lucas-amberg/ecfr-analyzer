(b) *Determination of and adjustments to earnings and profits of a specified foreign corporation for purposes of applying sections 902, 959, 960, and 965.* For the taxable year of a specified foreign corporation in which an E&P measurement date occurs, and the last taxable year of a specified foreign corporation that begins before January 1, 2018, and the taxable year of a section 958(a) U.S. shareholder in which or with which any such year ends, the adjustments to earnings and profits described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section apply in sequence. For purposes of determining the consequences under sections 902 and 960 of a distribution or an inclusion under section 951(a)(1), after the application of those paragraphs, the ordering rule in § 1.960-1(i)(2) applies except that section 902 is applied with respect to any distributions from the specified foreign corporation described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section that are not disregarded under § 1.965-4 before section 960 is applied with respect to an inclusion or distribution described in paragraph (b)(3), (b)(4), or (b)(5) of this section.


(1) Each of the subpart F income of the specified foreign corporation and the amount required to be included in income under section 1248, if any, are determined without regard to section 965(a), but taking into account any relevant distributions, and earnings and profits of the specified foreign corporation that are described in section 959(c)(2) with respect to the section 958(a) U.S. shareholder are increased to the extent of the section 958(a) U.S. shareholder's inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A) without regard to section 965(a) (including to the extent provided in section 959(e)).


(2) The treatment of a distribution by the specified foreign corporation to another specified foreign corporation that is made before January 1, 2018, and, in the case of a taxable year of a specified foreign corporation before its last taxable year that begins before January 1, 2018, any other distribution from the specified foreign corporation made before the relevant E&P measurement date, is determined under section 959.


(3) Each of the post-1986 earnings and profits (including a deficit) of the specified foreign corporation, the accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income of the specified foreign corporation, the section 965(a) earnings amount of the specified foreign corporation, and the section 965(a) inclusion amount with respect to the specified foreign corporation, if any, is determined, taking into account the rules of § 1.965-4, and the earnings and profits (including a deficit) of the specified foreign corporation are adjusted as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. For a rule disregarding subpart F income earned after an E&P measurement date for purposes of calculating accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income as of the E&P measurement date, see § 1.965-1(f)(7)(ii).


(4) The treatment of distributions described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section that are disregarded under § 1.965-4 is redetermined (if necessary) and the treatment of all distributions from the specified foreign corporation other than those described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is determined under section 959.


(5) An amount is determined under section 956 with respect to the specified foreign corporation and the section 958(a) U.S. shareholder; earnings and profits of the specified foreign corporation described in section 959(c)(2) with respect to the section 958(a) U.S. shareholder are reclassified as earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1) with respect to the section 958(a) U.S. shareholder to the extent the amount determined under section 956 would, but for section 959(a)(2), be included by the section 958(a) U.S. shareholder under section 951(a)(1)(B); and earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1) with respect to the section 958(a) U.S. shareholder are further increased to the extent of the section 958(a) U.S. shareholder's inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(B).


(c) *Adjustments to earnings and profits by reason of section 965(a).* The earnings and profits of a deferred foreign income corporation described in section 959(c)(2) with respect to a section 958(a) U.S. shareholder are increased by an amount equal to the section 965(a) inclusion amount of the section 958(a) U.S. shareholder with respect to the deferred foreign income corporation, if any, translated (if necessary) into the functional currency of the deferred foreign income corporation using the spot rate on December 31, 2017, provided the section 965(a) inclusion amount is included in income by the section 958(a) U.S. shareholder. For purposes of the section 965 regulations, the earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) by reason of this paragraph (c) and the earnings and profits initially described in section 959(c)(2) by reason of this paragraph (c) but subsequently reclassified as earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1), if any, are referred to as *section 965(a) previously taxed earnings and profits.* Furthermore, the earnings and profits (including a deficit) of the deferred foreign income corporation that are described in section 959(c)(3) (or that would be described in section 959(c)(3) but for the application of section 965(a) and the section 965 regulations) are reduced (or, in the case of a deficit, increased) by an amount equal to the section 965(a) previously taxed earnings and profits.

For purposes of the section 965 regulations, the earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) by reason of this paragraph (d) and the earnings and profits initially described in section 959(c)(2) by reason of this paragraph (d) but subsequently reclassified as earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1) are referred to as *section 965(b) previously taxed earnings and profits,* and are treated as having been previously included in the gross income of the section 958(a) U.S. shareholder under section 951 for purposes of section 1248(d)(1). Furthermore, the earnings and profits (including a deficit) described in section 959(c)(3) of the deferred foreign income corporation (or that would be described in section 959(c)(3) but for the application of section 965(b) and the section 965 regulations) are reduced (or, in the case of a deficit, increased) by an amount equal to the section 965(b) previously taxed earnings and profits.

For purposes of section 316, the earnings and profits of the E&P deficit foreign corporation attributable to the increase described in the preceding sentence are not treated as earnings and profits of the taxable year described in section 316(a)(2). See also § 1.965-6(b)(3) for the timing of this adjustment for purposes of determining foreign taxes deemed paid under sections 902 and 960.

(1) *Applicable property.* The term *applicable property* means, with respect to a section 958(a) U.S. shareholder and a specified foreign corporation, property owned by the section 958(a) U.S. shareholder (including through one or more foreign pass-through entities) by reason of which the section 958(a) U.S. shareholder is considered under section 958(a)(2) as owning section 958(a) stock of the specified foreign corporation.


(2) *Foreign pass-through entity.* The term *foreign pass-through entity* means a foreign partnership or a foreign estate or trust (as defined in section 7701(a)(31)) (including a controlled domestic partnership treated as a foreign partnership pursuant to § 1.965-1(e)).


(3) *Property.* The term *property* has the meaning provided in § 1.961-1(b)(1).


(j) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this section.


(1) *Example 1. Determination of accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income with subpart F income earned before E&P measurement date on November 2, 2017*—(i) *Facts.* USP, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of CFC1, a foreign corporation, which owns all of the stock of CFC2, also a foreign corporation. USP, CFC1, and CFC2 all have taxable years ending December 31, 2017. As of January 1, 2017, CFC1 has no earnings and profits, and CFC2 has 100u of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3) that were accumulated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, while CFC2 was a specified foreign corporation, and $21x of post-1986 foreign income taxes. None of CFC2's earnings and profits are attributable to income treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. On March 1, 2017, CFC1 earns 30u of subpart F income (as defined in section 952), and CFC2 earns 20u of subpart F income. No foreign income tax is imposed on CFC1's or CFC2's subpart F income. For purposes of section 904, the post-1986 undistributed earnings, subpart F income, and post-1986 foreign income taxes are in the general category. On July 1, 2017, CFC2 distributes 40u to CFC1. On November 1, 2017, CFC1 distributes 60u to USP. USP does not have an aggregate foreign E&P deficit. USP includes in gross income all amounts that it is required to include under section 951. No foreign income tax is imposed or withheld on the distribution by CFC2 to CFC1 or the distribution by CFC1 to USP.


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Adjustments to section 959(c) classification of earnings and profits for inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A) without regard to section 965.* The distribution from CFC2 to CFC1 does not give rise to subpart F income to CFC1 due to the application of section 954(c)(6). Accordingly, USP's inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A) without regard to section 965(a) is 30u with respect to CFC1 and 20u with respect to CFC2 for their taxable years ending December 31, 2017. As a result of the inclusions under section 951(a)(1)(A), CFC1 and CFC2 increase their earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) by 30u and 20u, respectively.


(B) *Distributions between specified foreign corporations before January 1, 2018.* The distribution of 40u from CFC2 to CFC1 is treated as a distribution of 20u out of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) (attributable to inclusions under section 951(a)(1)(A) without regard to section 965(a)) and 20u out of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3).


(C) *Section 965(a) inclusion amount.* USP determines whether CFC1 and CFC2 are deferred foreign income corporations and, if so, determines its section 965(a) inclusion amounts with respect to CFC1 and CFC2. CFC1 and CFC2 are specified foreign corporations, and CFC1 and CFC2 each have accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income greater than zero as of an E&P measurement date. Accordingly, CFC1 and CFC2 are deferred foreign income corporations. USP's section 965(a) inclusion amount with respect to each of CFC1 and CFC2, respectively, equals the section 965(a) earnings amount of CFC1 and CFC2, respectively.


(*1*) *CFC1 section 965(a) earnings amount.* The section 965(a) earnings amount with respect to CFC1 is 20u, the amount of its accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income as of both November 2, 2017, and December 31, 2017, which is equal to 70u of post-1986 earnings and profits (30u earned and 40u attributable to the CFC2 distribution) reduced by 50u of such post-1986 earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) (30u earned and 20u attributable to the CFC2 distribution) under section 965(d)(2)(B) and § 1.965-1(f)(7)(i)(B). Under section 965(d)(3)(B) and § 1.965-1(f)(29)(i)(B), the post-1986 earnings and profits of CFC1 are not reduced by the 60u distribution to USP.


(*2*) *CFC2 section 965(a) earnings amount.* The section 965(a) earnings amount with respect to CFC2 is 80u, the amount of its accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income as of both November 2, 2017, and December 31, 2017, which is equal to the amount of CFC2's post-1986 earnings and profits of 80u. CFC2's accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income is equal to its post-1986 earnings and profits because CFC2 does not have earnings and profits that are attributable to income of the specified foreign corporation that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States and subject to tax under chapter 1, or that, if distributed, would be excluded from the gross income of a United States shareholder under section 959 or from the gross income of another shareholder if such shareholder were a United States shareholder, and, therefore, no adjustment is made under section 965(d)(2) or § 1.965-1(f)(7). CFC2's 80u of post-1986 earnings and profits consists of 120u of earnings and profits that it earned, reduced by the 40u distribution to CFC1 under section 965(d)(3)(B) and § 1.965-1(f)(29)(i)(B). The amount of the reduction to the post-1986 earnings and profits of CFC2 for the 40u distribution is not limited by § 1.965-1(f)(29)(i)(B) because CFC1's post-1986 earnings and profits are increased by 40u as a result of the distribution. Furthermore, because the 40u distribution was made on July 1, 2017, which is before the E&P measurement date on November 2, 2017, § 1.965-4(f) is not relevant.


(*3*) *Effect on earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) and (3).* CFC1 and CFC2 increase their earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) by USP's section 965(a) inclusion amounts with respect to CFC1 and CFC2, 20u and 80u, respectively, and reduce their earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3) by an equivalent amount.


(D) *Distribution to United States shareholder.* The distribution from CFC1 to USP is treated as a distribution of 60u out of the earnings and profits of CFC1 described in section 959(c)(2), which include earnings and profits attributable to the section 965(a) inclusion amount taken into account by USP.


(E) *Section 902 and section 960 consequences*—(*1*) *Distribution by and inclusions with respect to CFC2.* Under section 960, USP is deemed to pay $3.50x ($21x × (20u/120u)) of CFC2's post-1986 foreign income taxes as a result of its inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A) without regard to section 965(a) with respect to CFC2. As a result of the distribution from CFC2 to CFC1, CFC2's post-1986 foreign income taxes are reduced, and CFC1's post-1986 foreign income taxes are increased, by the foreign income taxes deemed paid by CFC1 under section 902 of $3.50x (($21x−$3.50x) × (20u/120u−20u)). Under section 960, USP is deemed to pay $14x (($21x−$3.50x−$3.50x) × 80u/(120u−40u)) of CFC2's post-1986 foreign income taxes as a result of its section 965(a) inclusion with respect to CFC2. The taxes deemed paid by USP as a result of its section 965(a) inclusion with respect to CFC2 are subject to the applicable percentage disallowance under section 965(g).


(*2*) *Inclusions with respect to CFC1.* As determined in paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(E)(*1*) of this *section (paragraph (E)(*1*) in the analysis in this Example 1),* as a result of the distribution from CFC2 to CFC1, CFC1 is deemed under section 902 to pay $3.50x of CFC2's post-1986 foreign income taxes. Under section 960, USP is deemed to pay $2.10x ($3.50x × (30u/(30u + 20u))) of CFC1's post-1986 foreign income taxes as a result of its inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A) without regard to section 965(a) with respect to CFC1. Under section 960, USP is deemed to pay $1.40x (($3.50x−$2.10x) × 20u/(30u + 20u−30u)) of CFC1's post-1986 foreign income taxes as a result of its section 965(a) inclusion with respect to CFC1. The taxes deemed paid by USP as a result of its section 965(a) inclusion with respect to CFC1 are subject to the applicable percentage disallowance under section 965(g).


(2) *Example 2. Determination of accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income with subpart F income earned after E&P measurement date on November 2, 2017*—(i) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section (the facts in *Example 1*), except that on December 1, 2017, CFC1 earns an additional 50u of subpart F income (as defined in section 952), and neither CFC1 nor CFC2 has any post-1986 foreign income taxes.


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Adjustments to section 959(c) classification of earnings and profits for inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A) without regard to section 965.* USP determines its inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A) without regard to section 965(a), which is 80u with respect to CFC1 and 20u with respect to CFC2 for their taxable years ending December 31, 2017. As a result of the inclusions under section 951(a)(1)(A), CFC1 and CFC2 increase their earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) by 80u and 20u, respectively.


(B) *Distributions between specified foreign corporations before January 1, 2018.* The analysis is the same as in paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(B) of this section (paragraph (B) in the analysis in *Example 1*).


(C) *Section 965(a) inclusion amount.* USP determines whether CFC1 and CFC2 are deferred foreign income corporations and, if so, determines its section 965(a) inclusion amounts with respect to CFC1 and CFC2. CFC1 and CFC2 are specified foreign corporations, and CFC1 and CFC2 each have accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income greater than zero as of an E&P measurement date. Accordingly, CFC1 and CFC2 are deferred foreign income corporations. USP's section 965(a) inclusion amount with respect to each of CFC1 and CFC2, respectively, equals the section 965(a) earnings amount of CFC1 and CFC2, respectively.


(*1*) *CFC1 section 965(a) earnings amount.* The section 965(a) earnings amount with respect to CFC1 is 20u, the greater of—


(*i*) The amount of its accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income as of November 2, 2017, 20u, which is equal to 70u of post-1986 earnings and profits (30u earned and 40u attributable to the CFC2 distribution) reduced by 50u of such post-1986 earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) without regard to the subpart F income earned after November 2, 2017 (30u earned and 20u attributable to the CFC2 distribution) under section 965(d)(2)(B) and § 1.965-1(f)(7)(i)(B) and (ii), and


(*ii*) The amount of its accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income as of December 31, 2017, 20u, which is equal to 120u of post-1986 earnings and profits (80u earned and 40u attributable to the CFC2 distribution) reduced by 100u of such post-1986 earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) with regard to the subpart F income earned on or before December 31, 2017 (80u earned and 20u attributable to the CFC2 distribution) under section 965(d)(2)(B) and § 1.965-1(f)(7)(i)(B) and (ii).


(*2*) *CFC2 section 965(a) earnings amount.* The analysis is the same as in paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(C)(*2*) of this section (paragraph (C)(*2*) in the analysis in *Example 1*)).


(*3*) *Effect on earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) and (3).* The analysis is the same as in paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(C)(*3*) of this section (paragraph (C)(*3*) in the analysis in *Example 1*).


(D) *Distribution to United States shareholder.* The analysis is the same as in paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(D) of this section (paragraph (D) in the analysis in *Example 1*).


(3) *Example 3. Determination of accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income with subpart F income earned after E&P measurement date on November 2, 2017, but previously taxed earnings and profits attributable to the subpart F income distributed before E&P measurement date on November 2, 2017*—(i) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section (the facts in *Example 1*), except that on December 1, 2017, CFC2 earns an additional 50u of subpart F income (as defined in section 952), and neither CFC1 nor CFC2 has any post-1986 foreign income taxes.


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Adjustments to section 959(c) classification of earnings and profits for inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A) without regard to section 965.* USP determines its inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A) without regard to section 965(a), which is 30u with respect to CFC1 and 70u with respect to CFC2 for their taxable years ending December 31, 2017. As a result of the inclusions under section 951(a)(1)(A), CFC1 and CFC2 increase their earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) by 30u and 70u, respectively.


(B) *Distributions between specified foreign corporations before January 1, 2018.* The distribution of 40u from CFC2 to CFC1 is treated as a distribution of 40u out of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) (attributable to inclusions under section 951(a)(1)(A) without regard to section 965(a)).


(C) *Section 965(a) inclusion amount.* USP determines whether CFC1 and CFC2 are deferred foreign income corporations, and, if so, determines its section 965(a) inclusion amounts with respect to CFC1 and CFC2. Because USP wholly owns CFC1 and CFC2 under section 958(a) and USP does not have an aggregate foreign E&P deficit, USP's section 965(a) inclusion amount with respect to each of CFC1 and CFC2, respectively, equals the section 965(a) earnings amount, if any, of CFC1 and CFC2, respectively.


(*1*) *CFC1 section 965(a) earnings amount.* CFC1 is not a deferred foreign income corporation and does not have a section 965(a) earnings amount because the amount of its accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income as of both November 2, 2017, and December 31, 2017, is 0u, which is equal to 70u of post-1986 earnings and profits (30u earned and 40u attributable to the CFC2 distribution) reduced by 70u of such post-1986 earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) (30u earned and 40u attributable to the CFC2 distribution) under section 965(d)(2)(B) and § 1.965-1(f)(7)(i)(B).


(*2*) *CFC2 section 965(a) earnings amount.* The section 965(a) earnings amount with respect to CFC2 is 100u, the greater of the amounts in paragraph (j)(3)(ii)(C)(2)(*i*) and (*ii*) of this section (paragraph (C)(2)(*i*) and (*ii*) in the analysis in this *Example 3*)—


(*i*) The amount of its accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income as of November 2, 2017, 80u. CFC2's 80u of accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income as of November 2, 2017, is equal to its 80u of post-1986 earnings and profits because no adjustment is made under section 965(d)(2) or § 1.965-1(f)(7), as CFC2 does not have earnings and profits that are attributable to income of the specified foreign corporation that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States and subject to tax under chapter 1, or that, if distributed, would be excluded from the gross income of a United States shareholder under section 959 or from the gross income of another shareholder if such shareholder were a United States shareholder, without regard to the subpart F income earned after November 2, 2017. CFC2's 80u of post-1986 earnings and profits consists of 120u of earnings and profits that it earned, reduced by the 40u distribution to CFC1 under section 965(d)(3)(B) and § 1.965-1(f)(29)(i)(B). The amount of the reduction to the post-1986 earnings and profits of CFC2 for the 40u distribution is not limited by § 1.965-1(f)(29)(i)(B) because CFC1's post-1986 earnings and profits are increased by 40u as a result of the distribution. Furthermore, because the 40u distribution was made on July 1, 2017, which is before any E&P measurement date, § 1.965-4(f) is not relevant.


(*ii*) The amount of its accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income as of December 31, 2017, 100u, which is equal to 130u of post-1986 earnings and profits reduced by 30u of such post-1986 earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) with regard to the subpart F income earned before December 31, 2017, under section 965(d)(2)(B) and § 1.965-1(f)(7)(i)(B) and (ii). CFC2's 130u of post-1986 earnings and profits consists of 170u of earnings and profits that it earned, reduced by the 40u distribution to CFC1 under section 965(d)(3)(B) and § 1.965-1(f)(29)(i)(B).


(*3*) *Effect on earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) and (3).* CFC2 increases its earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) by USP's section 965(a) inclusion amount with respect to CFC2, 100u, and reduces its earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3) by an equivalent amount.


(D) *Distribution to United States shareholder.* The analysis is the same as in paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(D) of this section (paragraph (D) in the analysis in *Example 1*).


(4) *Example 4. Determination of accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income with distribution made after E&P measurement date on November 2, 2017*—(i) *Facts.* USP, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of CFC1, a foreign corporation, which owns all of the stock of CFC2, also a foreign corporation. USP, CFC1, and CFC2 all have taxable years ending December 31, 2017. As of January 1, 2017, CFC1 has 10u of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3) that were accumulated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, while CFC1 was a specified foreign corporation, and $2x of post-1986 foreign income taxes; and CFC2 has 100u of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3) that were accumulated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, while CFC2 was a specified foreign corporation and $10x of post-1986 foreign income taxes. For purposes of section 904, the post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes are in the general category. None of CFC1's or CFC2's earnings and profits are attributable to income treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. On December 1, 2017, CFC2 distributes 100u to CFC1, and CFC1 distributes 10u to USP. USP does not have an aggregate foreign E&P deficit. USP includes in gross income all amounts that it is required to include under section 951. No foreign income tax is imposed or withheld on the distribution by CFC2 to CFC1 or the distribution by CFC1 to USP. USP does not apply § 1.965-4(f)(3) to determine the post-1986 earnings and profits of CFC1 and CFC2.


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Adjustments to section 959(c) classification of earnings and profits for inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A) without regard to section 965.* The distribution from CFC2 to CFC1 does not give rise to subpart F income to CFC1 due to the application of section 954(c)(6). Accordingly, USP does not have an inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A) without regard to section 965(a) with respect to CFC1 or CFC2 for their taxable years ending December 31, 2017. As a result, neither CFC1 nor CFC2 has earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2).


(B) *Distributions between specified foreign corporations before January 1, 2018.* The distribution of 100u from CFC2 to CFC1 is initially treated as a distribution out of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3).


(C) *Section 965(a) inclusion amount.* USP determines whether CFC1 and CFC2 are deferred foreign income corporations, and, if so, determines its section 965(a) inclusion amounts with respect to CFC1 and CFC2. CFC1 and CFC2 are specified foreign corporations, and CFC1 and CFC2 each have accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income greater than zero as of an E&P measurement date. Accordingly, CFC1 and CFC2 are deferred foreign income corporations. USP's section 965(a) inclusion amount with respect to each of CFC1 and CFC2, respectively, equals the section 965(a) earnings amount of CFC1 and CFC2, respectively.


(*1*) *CFC1 section 965(a) earnings amount.* The section 965(a) earnings amount with respect to CFC1 is 10u, the amount of its accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income as of both November 2, 2017, and December 31, 2017, which is equal to the amount of CFC1's post-1986 earnings and profits of 10u. CFC1's accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income is equal to its post-1986 earnings and profits because CFC1 does not have earnings and profits that are attributable to income of the specified foreign corporation that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States and subject to tax under chapter 1, or that, if distributed, would be excluded from the gross income of a United States shareholder under section 959 or from the gross income of another shareholder if such shareholder were a United States shareholder, and therefore no adjustment is made under section 965(d)(2) or § 1.965-1(f)(7). But for § 1.965-4(f), CFC1's post-1986 earnings and profits as of December 31, 2017, would be 110u, but because the distribution from CFC2 is a specified payment, it is disregarded in determining CFC1's post-1986 earnings and profits as of December 31, 2017, under § 1.965-4(f). Under section 965(d)(3)(B) and § 1.965-1(f)(29)(i)(B), the post-1986 earnings and profits of CFC1 are not reduced by the 10u distribution to USP.


(*2*) *CFC2 section 965(a) earnings amount.* The section 965(a) earnings amount with respect to CFC2 is 100u, the amount of its accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income as of both November 2, 2017, and December 31, 2017, which is equal to the amount of CFC2's post-1986 earnings and profits of 100u. CFC2's accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income is equal to its post-1986 earnings and profits because CFC2 does not have earnings and profits that are attributable to income of the specified foreign corporation that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States and subject to tax under chapter 1, or that, if distributed, would be excluded from the gross income of a United States shareholder under section 959 or from the gross income of another shareholder if such shareholder were a United States shareholder, and therefore no adjustment is made under section 965(d)(2) or § 1.965-1(f)(7). But for § 1.965-4(f), CFC2's post-1986 earnings and profits as of December 31, 2017, would be 0u, but because the distribution to CFC1 is a specified payment, it is disregarded in determining CFC2's post-1986 earnings and profits as of December 31, 2017, under § 1.965-4(f).


(*3*) *Effect on earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) and (3).* CFC1 and CFC2 increase their earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) by USP's section 965(a) inclusion amounts with respect to CFC1 and CFC2, 10u and 100u, respectively, and reduce their earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3) by an equivalent amount.


(D) *Distributions*—(*1*) *Distribution that is a specified payment.* The distribution from CFC2 to CFC1 is recharacterized as a distribution of 100u out of the earnings and profits of CFC2 described in section 959(c)(2), which include earnings and profits attributable to the section 965(a) inclusion amount taken into account by USP.


(*2*) *Distribution to United States shareholder.* The distribution from CFC1 to USP is treated as a distribution of 10u out of the earnings and profits of CFC1 described in section 959(c)(2), which include earnings and profits attributable to the section 965(a) inclusion amount taken into account by USP.


(E) *Section 902 and section 960 consequences.* Under section 960, USP is deemed to pay $10x ($10x × (100u/100u)) of CFC2's post-1986 foreign income taxes as a result of its section 965(a) inclusion with respect to CFC2 and $2x ($2x × (10u/10u) of CFC1's post-1986 foreign income taxes as a result of its section 965(a) inclusion with respect to CFC1. Such taxes are subject to the applicable percentage disallowance under section 965(g).


(5) *Example 5. Determination of accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income with section 951(a)(1)(B) inclusion after E&P measurement date on November 2, 2017*—(i) *Facts.* USP, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of CFC, a foreign corporation. USP has a taxable year ending December 31, 2017, and CFC has a taxable year ending November 30, 2017. As of December 1, 2016, CFC has 110u of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3) that were accumulated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, while CFC was a specified foreign corporation. CFC holds 150u of United States property throughout its taxable year ending November 30, 2017, but disposes of it on December 1, 2017, recognizing no gain or loss on the property. Between December 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017, CFC earns an additional 10u of income that does not constitute subpart F income or income treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States that gives rise to 10u of earnings and profits. USP includes in income all amounts that it is required to include under section 951.


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Section 965(a) inclusion amount.* USP determines whether CFC is a deferred foreign income corporation, and, if so, determines its section 965(a) inclusion amount with respect to CFC. CFC is a specified foreign corporation, and CFC has accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income greater than zero as of an E&P measurement date. Accordingly, CFC is a deferred foreign income corporation. USP's section 965(a) inclusion amount with respect to CFC equals the section 965(a) earnings amount of CFC.


(*1*) *CFC section 965(a) earnings amount.* The section 965(a) earnings amount with respect to CFC is 110u, the greater of the amount of its accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income as of November 2, 2017, which is 110u, and the amount of its accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income as of December 31, 2017, which is 10u. CFC's accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income as of November 2, 2017, is equal to its 110u of post-1986 earnings and profits, which are not reduced by the 110u of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1) as a result of USP's section 951(a)(1)(B) inclusion with respect to CFC as of December 31, 2017, because such amounts would not be excluded from the gross income of a United States shareholder under section 959 under section 965(d)(2) or § 1.965-1(f)(7) if distributed on November 2, 2017. CFC's accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income as of December 31, 2017, is equal to its 120u of post-1986 earnings and profits reduced by the 110u of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1) as a result of USP's section 951(a)(1)(B) inclusion with respect to CFC as of December 31, 2017, which would be excluded from the gross income of a United States shareholder under section 959 under section 965(d)(2) or § 1.965-1(f)(7) if distributed on December 31, 2017.


(*2*) *Effect on earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) and (3).* In USP's taxable year ending December 31, 2018, CFC increases its earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) by USP's section 965(a) inclusion amount with respect to CFC, 110u, and reduces its earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3) by an equivalent amount.


(B) *Section 956 inclusion.* In USP's taxable year ending December 31, 2017, USP increases its earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1) by USP's amount included under sections 951(a)(1)(B) and 956 with respect to CFC, 110u, and reduces its earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3) by an equivalent amount.


(6) *Example 6. Section 1248 inclusion*—(i) *Facts.* USP1, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of CFC, a foreign corporation, until it sells all of such stock to USP2, a domestic corporation, on December 1, 2017, in a sale on which USP1 recognizes $100x of gain. Throughout 2017, 1u=$1x. USP1, USP2, and CFC all have taxable years ending December 31, 2017. As of January 1, 2017, CFC has 100u of earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3) that were accumulated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, while CFC was wholly owned by USP1. On March 1, 2017, CFC distributes 20u to USP1. None of CFC's earnings and profits are attributable to income treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. USP2 does not have an aggregate foreign E&P deficit. USP1 and USP2 include in income all amounts that they are required to include under sections 951 and 1248.


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Adjustments to section 959(c) classification of earnings and profits for section 1248 inclusion.* USP1's inclusion under section 1248 with respect to CFC is $80x ($100x−$20x). As a result of the inclusion under section 1248, under section 959(e), CFC increases its earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) by 80u.


(B) *Section 965(a) inclusion amount.* USP2 determines whether CFC is a deferred foreign income corporation and, if so, determines its section 965(a) inclusion amount with respect to CFC. CFC is a specified foreign corporation, and CFC has accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income greater than zero as of an E&P measurement date. Accordingly, CFC is a deferred foreign income corporation. USP2's section 965(a) inclusion amount with respect to CFC equals the section 965(a) earnings amount of CFC. The section 965(a) earnings amount with respect to CFC is 20u, the amount of its accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income as of both November 2, 2017, and December 31, 2017, which is equal to 100u of post-1986 earnings and profits reduced by 80u of such post-1986 earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) under section 965(d)(2)(B) and § 1.965-1(f)(7)(i)(B). CFC increases its earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) by USP2's section 965(a) inclusion amount with respect to CFC, 20u, and reduces its earnings and profits that would be described in section 959(c)(3) but for the application of section 965(a) by an equivalent amount.


(C) *Distributions to United States shareholders.* The distributions from CFC to USP1 (including the deemed dividend under section 1248) are treated as distributions out of the earnings and profits of CFC described in section 959(c)(3).


(7) *Example 7. Distribution attributable to section 965(a) previously taxed earnings and profits*—(i) *Facts.* USP, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of CFC1, a specified foreign corporation that has no post-1986 earnings and profits (or deficit in post-1986 earnings and profits), and CFC1 owns all the stock of CFC2, a deferred foreign income corporation. USP is a calendar year taxpayer. CFC1's last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, ends on November 30, 2018; CFC2 has an inclusion year that ends on November 30, 2018. The functional currency of CFC1 and CFC2 is the U.S. dollar. USP's adjusted basis in the stock of CFC1 is zero. On January 1, 2018, CFC2 distributes $100x to CFC1, and CFC1 distributes $100x to USP. USP has a section 965(a) inclusion amount of $100x with respect to CFC2 that is taken into account for USP's taxable year ending December 31, 2018. CFC2 has no earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1) or (2) other than section 965(a) previously taxed earnings and profits.


(ii) *Analysis.* Under paragraph (c) of this section, CFC2 has $100x of section 965(a) previously taxed earnings and profits with respect to USP. USP receives a distribution from CFC2 through a chain of ownership described in section 958(a) during the inclusion year of CFC2 that is attributable to the $100x of section 965(a) previously taxed earnings and profits of CFC2. Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the amount of gain that USP otherwise would recognize with respect to the stock of CFC1 under section 961(b)(2) is reduced (but not below zero) by $100x, the amount of CFC2's section 965(a) previously taxed earnings and profits with respect to USP. As of the close of November 30, 2018, USP's basis in CFC1 is increased under paragraph (e) of this section by USP's section 965(a) inclusion amount with respect to CFC2 ($100x), and is reduced under paragraph (g)(2) of this section by the amount of gain that would have been recognized by USP under section 961(b)(2) but for the application of paragraph (g)(1) of this section ($100x).


(8) *Example 8. Distribution attributable to section 965(b) previously taxed earnings and profits; parent-subsidiary*—(i) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(7)(i) of this section (the facts in *Example 7*), except that CFC1 has a specified E&P deficit of $100x. Because of the specified E&P deficit of CFC1, USP's section 965(a) inclusion amount with respect to CFC2 is reduced to zero pursuant to section 965(b)(1) and § 1.965-1(b)(2). USP makes the election described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Application of the gain reduction rule.* Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, CFC2 has $100x of section 965(b) previously taxed earnings and profits with respect to USP, and, under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, CFC1's earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3) are increased by $100x to $0. USP receives a distribution from CFC2 through a chain of ownership described in section 958(a) during the inclusion year of CFC2 that is attributable to the $100x of section 965(b) previously taxed earnings and profits of CFC2. Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the amount of gain that USP otherwise would recognize with respect to the stock of CFC1 under section 961(b)(2) is reduced (but not below zero) by $100x, the amount of CFC2's section 965(b) previously taxed earnings and profits with respect to USP under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.


(B) *Adjustments to the basis of CFC1.* Because USP makes the election described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, as of the close of November 30, 2018, USP's basis in CFC1 is increased under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section by an amount equal to CFC2's section 965(b) previously taxed earnings and profits with respect to USP under paragraph (d)(1) of this section ($100x), reduced under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section by an amount equal to the portion of the specified E&P deficit of CFC1 taken into account in determining USP's section 965(a) inclusion amount with respect to CFC2 ($100x), and reduced under paragraph (g)(2) of this section by the amount of gain that would have been recognized by USP with respect to the stock of CFC1 under section 961(b)(2) but for the application of paragraph (g)(1) of this section ($100x). Under paragraph (h)(2) and (3) of this section, the excess of the net reduction from the adjustments under paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section over USP's basis in the stock of CFC1 (in this case, $100x) is treated as gain recognized by USP from the sale or exchange of property.


(9) *Example 9. Distribution attributable to section 965(b) previously taxed earnings and profits; brother-sister*—(i) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (j)(8)(i) of this section (the facts in *Example 8*), except that USP owns all the stock of CFC2, USP's adjusted basis in the stock of CFC2 is zero, CFC1 made no distributions, and on January 1, 2018, CFC2 distributes $100x to USP.


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Application of the gain reduction rule.* Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, CFC2 has $100x of section 965(b) previously taxed earnings and profits with respect to USP, and, under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, CFC1's earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(3) (deficit of $100x) are increased by $100x to $0. USP receives a distribution from CFC2 during the inclusion year of CFC2 that is attributable to the $100x of section 965(b) previously taxed earnings and profits of CFC2. Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the amount of gain that USP otherwise would recognize with respect to the stock of CFC2 under section 961(b)(2) is reduced (but not below zero) by $100x, the amount of CFC2's section 965(b) previously taxed earnings and profits with respect to USP under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.


(B) *Adjustments to the basis of CFC1 and CFC2.* Because USP makes the election described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, as of the close of November 30, 2018, USP's basis in the stock of CFC2 is increased under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section by the amount of CFC2's section 965(b) previously taxed earnings and profits with respect to USP under paragraph (d)(1) of this section ($100x) and reduced under paragraph (g)(2) of this section by the amount of gain that would have been recognized by USP with respect to the stock of CFC2 under section 961(b)(2) but for the application of paragraph (g)(1) of this section ($100x). As of the close of November 30, 2018, USP's basis in CFC1 is reduced under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section by an amount equal to the portion of USP's pro rata share of the specified E&P deficit of CFC1 taken into account in determining USP's section 965(a) inclusion amount with respect to CFC2 ($100x). Under paragraph (h)(3) of this section, the excess of the reduction under paragraph (f) of this section over USP's basis in the stock of CFC1 (in this case, $100x) is treated as gain recognized by USP from the sale or exchange of property.
