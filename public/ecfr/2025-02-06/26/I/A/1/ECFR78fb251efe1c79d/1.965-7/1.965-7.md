(a) *Scope.* This section provides rules regarding certain elections and payments. Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules regarding the section 965(h) election. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules regarding the section 965(i) election. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules regarding the section 965(m) election and a special rule for real estate investment trusts. Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules regarding the section 965(n) election. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules regarding the election to use the alternative method for calculating post-1986 earnings and profits. Paragraph (g) of this section provides definitions that apply for purposes of this section.


(b) *Section 965(h) election*—(1) *In general.* Any person with a section 965(h) net tax liability (that is, a section 958(a) U.S. shareholder or a domestic pass-through owner with respect to a domestic pass-through entity that is a section 958(a) U.S. shareholder, but not a domestic pass-through entity itself) may elect under section 965(h) and this paragraph (b) to pay its section 965(h) net tax liability in eight installments. This election may be revoked only by paying the full amount of the remaining unpaid section 965(h) net tax liability.


(i) *Amount of installments.* Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, if a person makes a section 965(h) election, the amounts of the installments are—


(A) Eight percent of the section 965(h) net tax liability in the case of each of the first five installments;


(B) Fifteen percent of the section 965(h) net tax liability in the case of the sixth installment;


(C) Twenty percent of the section 965(h) net tax liability in the case of the seventh installment; and


(D) Twenty-five percent of the section 965(h) net tax liability in the case of the eighth installment.


(ii) *Increased installments due to a deficiency or a timely filed or amended return*—(A) *In general.* If a person makes a section 965(h) election, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) of this section, any deficiency or additional liability will be prorated to the installments described under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section if any of the following occur:


(*1*) A deficiency is assessed with respect to the person's section 965(h) net tax liability;


(*2*) The person files a return by the due date of the return (taking into account extensions, if any) increasing the amount of its section 965(h) net tax liability beyond that taken into account in paying the first installment described under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section; or


(*3*) The person files an amended return that reflects an increase in the amount of its section 965(h) net tax liability.


(B) *Timing.* If the due date for the payment of an installment to which the deficiency is prorated has passed, the amount prorated to such installment must be paid on notice and demand by the Secretary, or, in the case of an additional liability reported on a return increasing the amount of the section 965(h) net tax liability after payment of the first installment or on an amended return, with the filing of the return. If the due date for the payment of an installment to which the deficiency or additional liability is prorated has not passed, then such amount will be due at the same time as, and as part of, the relevant installment.


(C) *Exception for negligence, intentional disregard, or fraud.* If a deficiency or additional liability is due to negligence, intentional disregard of rules and regulations, or fraud with intent to evade tax, the proration rule of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii) will not apply, and the deficiency or additional liability (as well as any applicable interest and penalties) must be paid on notice and demand by the Secretary or, in the case of an additional liability reported on a return increasing the amount of the section 965(h) net tax liability after payment of the first installment or on an amended return, with the filing of the return.


(iii) *Due date of installments*—(A) *In general.* If a person makes a section 965(h) election, the first installment payment is due on the due date (without regard to extensions) for the return for the relevant taxable year. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the term *relevant taxable year* means, in the case in which the person is a section 958(a) U.S. shareholder, the section 958(a) U.S. shareholder inclusion year, or, in the case in which the person is a domestic pass-through owner, the taxable year in which the person has the section 965(a) inclusion to which the section 965(h) net tax liability is attributable. Each succeeding installment payment is due on the due date (without regard to extensions) for the return for the taxable year following the taxable year with respect to which the previous installment payment was made.


(B) *Extension for specified individuals.* If a person is a specified individual with respect to a taxable year within which an installment payment is due pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, then, for purposes of determining the due date of an installment payment under paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, the due date of the return (without regard to extensions) due within the taxable year will be treated as the fifteenth day of the sixth month following the close of the prior taxable year. This paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) is applicable regardless of whether the person is a specified individual with respect to the relevant taxable year.


(2) *Manner of making election*—(i) *Eligibility.* Any person with a section 965(h) net tax liability may make the section 965(h) election, provided that, with respect to the person, none of the acceleration events described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section has occurred before the election is made. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a person that would be eligible to make the section 965(h) election but for the occurrence of an event described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section may make the section 965(h) election if the exception described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section applies.


(ii) *Timing.* A section 965(h) election must be made no later than the due date (taking into account extensions, if any, or any additional time that would have been granted if the person had made an extension request) for the return for the relevant taxable year. Relief is not available under § 301.9100-2 or § 301.9100-3 to file a late election.


(iii) *Election statement.* Except as otherwise provided in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance, to make a section 965(h) election, a person must attach a statement, signed under penalties of perjury consistent with the rules for signatures applicable to the person's return, to its return for the relevant taxable year. The statement must include the person's name, taxpayer identification number, total net tax liability under section 965, section 965(h) net tax liability, section 965(i) net tax liability with respect to which a section 965(i) election is effective (if applicable), and the anticipated amounts of each installment described under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. The statement must be filed in the manner prescribed in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance. The attachment of an unsigned copy of the election statement to the timely-filed return for the relevant taxable year satisfies the signature requirement of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii) if the person making the election retains the original signed election statement in the manner specified by § 1.6001-1(e).


(3) *Acceleration of payment*—(i) *Acceleration.* Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, if a person makes a section 965(h) election and an acceleration event described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section subsequently occurs, then, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, the unpaid portion of the remaining installments will be due on the date of the acceleration event (or in the case of a title 11 or similar case, the day before the petition is filed).


(ii) *Acceleration events.* The following events are acceleration events for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section with respect to a person that has made a section 965(h) election—


(A) An addition to tax is assessed for the failure to timely pay an installment described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section;


(B) A liquidation, sale, exchange, or other disposition of substantially all of the assets of the person (including in a title 11 or similar case, or, in the case of an individual, by reason of death);

(D) Any event that results in the person no longer being a United States person, including a resident alien (as defined in section 7701(b)(1)(A)) becoming a nonresident alien (as defined in section 7701(b)(1)(B));


(E) In the case of a person that was not a member of any consolidated group, the person becoming a member of a consolidated group;


(F) In the case of a consolidated group, the group ceasing to exist (including by reason of the acquisition of a consolidated group within the meaning of § 1.1502-13(j)(5)) or the group otherwise discontinuing in the filing of a consolidated return; or


(G) A determination by the Commissioner described in the second sentence of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(*2*) of this section.


(iii) *Eligible section 965(h) transferee exception*—(A) *In general.* Paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section does not apply (such that the unpaid portion of all remaining installments will not be due as of the date of the acceleration event) to a person with respect to which an acceleration event occurs if the requirements described in paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*1*) and (*2*) of this section are satisfied. A person with respect to which an acceleration event described in this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) occurs is referred to as an *eligible section 965(h) transferor.*

(*1*) *Requirement to have a covered acceleration event.* The acceleration event satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*1*) if it is described in—


(*i*) Paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, and the acceleration event is a qualifying consolidated group member transaction within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(E) of this section;


(*ii*) Paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section (other than, in the case of an individual, an acceleration event caused by reason of death) in a transaction that is not a qualifying consolidated group member transaction;


(*iii*) Paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(E) of this section;


(*iv*) Paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(F) of this section, and the acceleration event results from the acquisition of a consolidated group within the meaning of § 1.1502-13(j)(5), and the acquired consolidated group members join a different consolidated group as of the day following the acquisition;


(*v*) Paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(F) of this section, and the group ceases to exist as a result of the transfer of all of the assets of one or more members of the consolidated group to other members with only one entity remaining (the *successor entity*); or


(*vi*) Paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(F) of this section, and the group ceases to exist as a result of the termination of the subchapter S election pursuant to section 1362(d) of a shareholder of the common parent of the consolidated group and, for the shareholder's taxable year immediately following the termination, the shareholder joins in the filing of a consolidated return as a consolidated group that includes all of the former members of the former consolidated group.


(*2*) *Requirement to enter into a transfer agreement.* An eligible section 965(h) transferor and an eligible section 965(h) transferee (as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*1*) of this section) must enter into an agreement with the Commissioner that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section.


(B) *Transfer agreement*—(*1*) *Eligibility.* A transfer agreement that satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) must be entered into by an eligible section 965(h) transferor and an eligible section 965(h) transferee. For this purpose, the term *eligible section 965(h) transferee* refers to a single United States person that is not a domestic pass-through entity and that—


(*i*) With respect to an acceleration event described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*1*)(*i*) of this section, is a departing member (as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(E)(*1*)(*i*) of this section) or its qualified successor (as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(E)(*2*) of this section);

(*v*) With respect to an acceleration event described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*1*)(*v*) of this section, is the successor entity (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*1*)(*v*) of this section); or

(*2*) *Filing requirements*—(*i*) *In general.* A transfer agreement must be timely filed. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*2*)(*ii*) of this section, a transfer agreement is considered timely filed only if the transfer agreement is filed within 30 days of the date that the acceleration event occurs. The transfer agreement must be filed in accordance with the rules provided in publications forms, instructions, or other guidance. In addition, a duplicate copy of the transfer agreement must be attached to the returns of both the eligible section 965(h) transferee and the eligible section 965(h) transferor for the taxable year during which the acceleration event occurs filed by the due date for such returns (taking into account extensions, if any). Relief is not available under § 301.9100-2 or 301.9100-3 to file a transfer agreement late.


(*ii*) *Transition rule.* If an acceleration event occurs on or before February 5, 2019, the transfer agreement must be filed by March 7, 2019, to be considered timely filed.


(*3*) *Signature requirement.* The transfer agreement that is filed within 30 days of the acceleration event or by the due date specified in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*2*)(*ii*) of this section must be signed under penalties of perjury by a person who is authorized to sign a return on behalf of the eligible section 965(h) transferor and a person who is authorized to sign a return on behalf of the eligible section 965(h) transferee.


(*4*) *Terms of agreement.* A transfer agreement under this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) must be entitled “Transfer Agreement Under Section 965(h)(3)” and must contain the following information and representations—


(*i*) A statement that the document constitutes an agreement by the eligible section 965(h) transferee to assume the liability of the eligible section 965(h) transferor for any unpaid installment payments of the eligible section 965(h) transferor under section 965(h);


(*ii*) A statement that the eligible section 965(h) transferee (and, if the eligible section 965(h) transferor continues in existence immediately after the acceleration event, the eligible section 965(h) transferor) agrees to comply with all of the conditions and requirements of section 965(h) and paragraph (b) of this section, as well as any other applicable requirements in the section 965 regulations;


(*iii*) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the eligible section 965(h) transferor and the eligible section 965(h) transferee;


(*iv*) The amount of the eligible section 965(h) transferor's section 965(h) net tax liability remaining unpaid, as determined by the eligible section 965(h) transferor, which amount is subject to adjustment by the Commissioner;


(*v*) A copy of the eligible section 965(h) transferor's most recent Form 965-A or Form 965-B, as applicable, if the eligible section 965(h) transferor has been required to file a Form 965-A or Form 965-B;


(*vi*) A detailed description of the acceleration event that led to the transfer agreement;


(*vii*) A representation that the eligible section 965(h) transferee is able to make the remaining payments required under section 965(h) and paragraph (b) of this section with respect to the section 965(h) net tax liability being assumed;


(*viii*) If the eligible section 965(h) transferor continues to exist immediately after the acceleration event, an acknowledgement that the eligible section 965(h) transferor and any successor to the eligible section 965(h) transferor will remain jointly and severally liable for any unpaid installment payments of the eligible section 965(h) transferor under section 965(h), including, if applicable, under § 1.1502-6;


(*ix*) A statement as to whether the leverage ratio of the eligible section 965(h) transferee and all subsidiary members of its affiliated group immediately after the acceleration event exceeds three to one, which ratio may be modified as provided in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance;


(*x*) A certification by the eligible section 965(h) transferee stating that the eligible section 965(h) transferee waives the right to a notice of liability and consents to the immediate assessment of the portion of the section 965(h) net tax liability remaining unpaid; and


(*xi*) Any additional information, representation, or certification required by the Commissioner in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance.


(*5*) *Consolidated groups.* For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B), in the case of a consolidated group, the terms “eligible section 965(h) transferor” and “eligible section 965(h) transferee” each refer to a consolidated group that is a party to a covered acceleration event described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*1*) of this section. In such a case, any transfer agreement under this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) must be entered into by the agent (as defined in § 1.1502-77) of the relevant consolidated group.


(*6*) *Leverage ratio.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(4)(*ix*) of this section, and except as otherwise provided in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance, the term *leverage ratio* means the ratio that the total indebtedness of the eligible section 965(h) transferee bears to the sum of its money and all other assets reduced (but not below zero) by such total indebtedness. For this purpose, the amount taken into account with respect to any asset is the adjusted basis thereof for purposes of determining gain, and the amount taken into account with respect to any indebtedness with original issue discount is its issue price plus the portion of the original issue discount previously accrued as determined under the rules of section 1272 (determined without regard to subsection (a)(7) or (b)(4) thereof).


(C) *Consent of Commissioner*—(*1*) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance, if an eligible section 965(h) transferor and an eligible section 965(h) transferee file a transfer agreement in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, the eligible section 965(h) transferor and the eligible section 965(h) transferee will be considered to have entered into an agreement described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*2*) of this section with the Commissioner for purposes of section 965(h)(3) and paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. If the Commissioner determines that additional information is necessary (for example, additional information regarding the ability of the eligible section 965(h) transferee to fully pay the remaining section 965(h) net tax liability), the eligible section 965(h) transferee must provide such information upon request.


(*2*) *Material misrepresentations and omissions.* If the Commissioner determines that an agreement filed by an eligible section 965(h) transferor and an eligible section 965(h) transferee contains a material misrepresentation or material omission, or if the eligible section 965(h) transferee does not provide the additional information requested under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(*1*) of this section within a reasonable timeframe communicated by the Commissioner to the eligible section 965(h) transferee, then the Commissioner may reject the transfer agreement (effective as of the date of the related acceleration event). In the alternative, on the date that the Commissioner determines that the transfer agreement includes a material misrepresentation or material omission, the Commissioner may determine that an acceleration event has occurred with respect to the eligible section 965(h) transferee as of the date of the determination, such that any unpaid installment payments of the eligible section 965(h) transferor that were assumed by the eligible section 965(h) transferee become due on the date of the determination.


(D) *Effect of assumption*—(*1*) *In general.* If the exception in this paragraph (b)(3)(iii) applies with respect to an eligible section 965(h) transferor and an eligible section 965(h) transferee, the eligible section 965(h) transferee assumes all of the outstanding obligations and responsibilities of the eligible section 965(h) transferor with respect to the section 965(h) net tax liability as though the eligible section 965(h) transferee had included the section 965(a) inclusion in income. Accordingly, the eligible section 965(h) transferee is responsible for making payments and reporting with respect to any unpaid installment payments. In addition, for example, if an acceleration event described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section occurs with respect to an eligible section 965(h) transferee, any unpaid installment payments of the eligible section 965(h) transferor that were assumed by the eligible section 965(h) transferee will become due on the date of such event, subject to any applicable exception in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section.


(*2*) *Eligible section 965(h) transferor liability.* An eligible section 965(h) transferor (or a successor) remains jointly and severally liable for any unpaid installment payments of the eligible section 965(h) transferor that were assumed by the eligible section 965(h) transferee, as well as any penalties, additions to tax, or other additional amounts attributable to such net tax liability.


(E) *Qualifying consolidated group member transaction*—(*1*) *Definition of qualifying consolidated group member transaction.* For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), the term *qualifying consolidated group member transaction* means a transaction in which—


(*i*) A member of a consolidated group (the *departing member*) ceases to be a member of the consolidated group (including by reason of the distribution, sale, or exchange of the departing member's stock);


(*ii*) The transaction results in the consolidated group (which is treated as a single person for this purpose under § 1.965-8(e)(1)) being treated as transferring substantially all of its assets for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section; and


(*iii*) The departing member either continues to exist immediately after the transaction or has a qualified successor.


(*2*) *Definition of qualified successor.* For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), the term *qualified successor* means, with respect to a departing member described in this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(E), another domestic corporation (or consolidated group) that acquires substantially all of the assets of the departing member (including in a transaction described in section 381(a)(2)).


(*3*) *Departure of multiple members of a consolidated group.* Multiple members that deconsolidate from the same consolidated group as a result of a single transaction are treated as a single departing member to the extent that, immediately after the transaction, they become members of the same (second) consolidated group, which would be treated as a single person under § 1.965-8(e)(1).


(c) *Section 965(i) election*—(1) *In general.* Each shareholder of an S corporation (including a person listed in § 1.1362-6(b)(2) with respect to a trust or estate, but not a domestic pass-through entity itself) that is a United States shareholder of a deferred foreign income corporation may elect under section 965(i) and this paragraph (c) to defer the payment of the shareholder's section 965(i) net tax liability with respect to the S corporation until the shareholder's taxable year that includes a triggering event described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. This election may be revoked only by paying the full amount of the unpaid section 965(i) net tax liability.


(2) *Manner of making election*—(i) *Eligibility.* Each shareholder with a section 965(i) net tax liability with respect to an S corporation may make the section 965(i) election with respect to such S corporation, provided that, with respect to the shareholder, none of the triggering events described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section have occurred before the election is made. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a shareholder that would be eligible to make the section 965(i) election but for the occurrence of an event described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section may make the section 965(i) election if an exception described in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section applies.


(ii) *Timing.* A section 965(i) election must be made no later than the due date (taking into account extensions, if any) for the shareholder's return for each taxable year that includes the last day of the taxable year of the S corporation in which the S corporation has a section 965(a) inclusion to which the shareholder's section 965(i) net tax liability is attributable. Relief is not available under § 301.9100-2 or 301.9100-3 to make a late election.


(iii) *Election statement.* Except as otherwise provided in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance, to make a section 965(i) election, a shareholder must attach a statement, signed under penalties of perjury consistent with the rules for signatures applicable to the person's return, to its return for the taxable year that includes the last day of a taxable year of the S corporation in which the S corporation has a section 965(a) inclusion to which the shareholder's section 965(i) net tax liability is attributable. The statement must include the shareholder's name, taxpayer identification number, the name and taxpayer identification number of the S corporation with respect to which the election is made, the amount described in paragraph (g)(10)(i)(A) of this section as modified by paragraph (g)(6) of this section for purposes of determining the section 965(i) net tax liability with respect to the S corporation, the amount described in paragraph (g)(10)(i)(B) of this section, and the section 965(i) net tax liability with respect to the S corporation. The statement must be filed in the manner prescribed in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance. The attachment of an unsigned copy of the election statement to the timely-filed return for the relevant taxable year satisfies the signature requirement of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) if the shareholder retains the original signed election statement in the manner specified by § 1.6001-1(e).


(3) *Triggering events*—(i) *In general.* If a shareholder makes a section 965(i) election with respect to an S corporation, the shareholder defers payment of its section 965(i) net tax liability with respect to the S corporation until the shareholder's taxable year that includes the occurrence of a triggering event described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section with respect to the section 965(i) net tax liability with respect to the S corporation. If a triggering event described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section with respect to an S corporation occurs, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section, the shareholder's section 965(i) net tax liability with respect to the S corporation will be assessed as an addition to tax for the shareholder's taxable year that includes the triggering event.


(ii) *Triggering events.* The following events are considered triggering events for purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section with respect to a shareholder's section 965(i) net tax liability with respect to an S corporation—


(A) The corporation ceases to be an S corporation (determined as of the first day of the first taxable year that the corporation is not an S corporation);


(B) A liquidation, sale, exchange, or other disposition of substantially all of the assets of the S corporation (including in a title 11 or similar case), a cessation of business by the S corporation, or the S corporation ceasing to exist;


(C) The transfer of any share of stock of the S corporation by the shareholder (including by reason of death or otherwise) that results in a change of ownership for federal income tax purposes; or


(D) A determination by the Commissioner described in the second sentence of paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(C)(*2*) of this section.


(iii) *Partial transfers.* If an S corporation shareholder transfers less than all of its shares of stock of the S corporation, the transfer will be a triggering event only with respect to the portion of a shareholder's section 965(i) net tax liability that is properly allocable to the transferred shares.


(iv) *Eligible section 965(i) transferee exception*—(A) *In general.* Paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section will not apply (such that a shareholder's section 965(i) net tax liability with respect to an S corporation will not be assessed as an addition to tax for the shareholder's taxable year that includes the triggering event) if the requirements described in paragraphs (c)(3)(iv)(A)(*1*) and (*2*) of this section are satisfied. A shareholder with respect to which a triggering event described in this paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(A) occurs is referred to as an *eligible section 965(i) transferor.*

(*1*) *Requirement to have a covered triggering event.* The triggering event satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(A)(*1*) if it is described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C) of this section.


(*2*) *Requirement to enter into a transfer agreement.* The shareholder with respect to which a triggering event occurs and an eligible section 965(i) transferee (as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B)(*1*) of this section) must enter into an agreement with the Commissioner that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B) of this section.


(B) *Transfer agreement*—(*1*) *Eligibility.* A transfer agreement that satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B) may be entered into by an eligible section 965(i) transferor and an eligible section 965(i) transferee. For this purpose, the term *eligible section 965(i) transferee* refers to a single United States person that becomes a shareholder of the S corporation (including a person listed in § 1.1362-6(b)(2) with respect to a trust or estate, but not a domestic pass-through entity itself). In the case of a transfer that consists of multiple partial transfers (as described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section), a transfer agreement that satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B) may be entered into by an eligible section 965(i) transferor and an eligible section 965(i) transferee for each partial transfer.


(*2*) *Filing requirements*—(*i*) *In general.* A transfer agreement must be timely filed. Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(3)(iv)(B)(*2*)(*ii*) and (*iii*) of this section, a transfer agreement is considered timely filed only if the transfer agreement is filed within 30 days of the date that the triggering event occurs. The transfer agreement must be filed in accordance with the rules provided in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance. In addition, a duplicate copy of the transfer agreement must be attached to the returns of both the eligible section 965(i) transferee and the eligible section 965(i) transferor for the taxable year during which the triggering event occurs filed by the due date (taking into account extensions, if any) for such returns. Relief is not available under § 301.9100-2 or 301.9100-3 to file a transfer agreement late.


(*ii*) *Transition rule.* If a triggering event occurs on or before February 5, 2019, the transfer agreement must be filed by March 7, 2019, to be considered timely filed.


(*iii*) *Death of eligible section 965(i) transferor.* If the triggering event is the death of the eligible section 965(i) transferor, the transfer agreement must be filed by the later of the unextended due date for the eligible section 965(i) transferor's final income tax return or March 7, 2019.


(*3*) *Signature requirement.* The transfer agreement that is filed within 30 days of the triggering event or by the due date specified in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B)(*2*)(*ii*) or (*iii*) of this section must be signed under penalties of perjury by a person who is authorized to sign a return on behalf of the eligible section 965(i) transferor and a person who is authorized to sign a return on behalf of the eligible section 965(i) transferee.


(*4*) *Terms of agreement.* A transfer agreement under this paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B) must be entitled “Transfer Agreement Under Section 965(i)(2)” and must contain the following information and representations:


(*i*) A statement that the document constitutes an agreement by the eligible section 965(i) transferee to assume the liability of the eligible section 965(i) transferor for the unpaid portion of the section 965(i) net tax liability, or, in the case of a partial transfer, for the unpaid portion of the section 965(i) net tax liability attributable to the transferred stock;


(*ii*) A statement that the eligible section 965(i) transferee agrees to comply with all of the conditions and requirements of section 965(i) and paragraph (c) of this section, including the annual reporting requirement, as well as any other applicable requirements in the section 965 regulations;


(*iii*) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the eligible section 965(i) transferor and the eligible section 965(i) transferee;


(*iv*) The amount of the eligible section 965(i) transferor's unpaid section 965(i) net tax liability or, in the case of a partial transfer, the unpaid portion of the section 965(i) net tax liability attributable to the transferred stock, each as determined by the eligible section 965(i) transferor, which amount is subject to adjustment by the Commissioner;


(*v*) A copy of the eligible section 965(i) transferor's most recent Form 965-A, if the eligible section 965(i) transferor has been required to file a Form 965-A;


(*vi*) A detailed description of the triggering event that led to the transfer agreement, including the name and taxpayer identification number of the S corporation with respect to which the section 965(i) election was effective;


(*vii*) A representation that the eligible section 965(i) transferee is able to pay the section 965(i) net tax liability being assumed;


(*viii*) An acknowledgement that the eligible section 965(i) transferor and any successor to the eligible section 965(i) transferor will remain jointly and severally liable for the section 965(i) net tax liability being assumed by the eligible section 965(i) transferee;


(*ix*) A statement as to whether the leverage ratio of the eligible section 965(i) transferee immediately after the triggering event exceeds three to one, which ratio may be modified as provided in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance;


(*x*) Any additional information, representation, or certification required by the Commissioner in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance.


(*5*) *Special rule in the case of death of eligible section 965(i) transferor.* Except in the case of transfers to trusts, if the triggering event is the death of the eligible section 965(i) transferor, and the identity of the beneficiary or beneficiaries (in the case of multiple partial transfers) is determined as of the due date for the transfer agreement described in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B)(*2*)(*iii*) of this section, then the transfer may be treated as a transfer directly between the eligible 965(i) transferor and the beneficiary or beneficiaries. If, however, the identity of the beneficiary or beneficiaries is not determined as of the due date for the transfer agreement described in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B)(*2*)(*iii*) of this section, then the transfer must be treated first as a transfer between the eligible section 965(i) transferor and his or her estate at the time of death and second as a transfer between the estate and the beneficiary or beneficiaries when the shares are actually transferred to the beneficiary or beneficiaries. Separate transfer agreements must be filed for each transfer. The transfer from the eligible section 965(i) transferor to his or her estate is a transfer resulting from a triggering event that is the death of the eligible section 965(i) transferor, and the transfer agreement is subject to the timing rules in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B)(*2*)(*iii*) of this section. The transfer from the estate to the beneficiary or beneficiaries is not a transfer resulting from a triggering event that is the death of the eligible section 965(i) transferor, and the transfer agreement is subject to the timing rules in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B)(*2*)(*i*) and (*ii*) of this section.


(*6*) *Leverage ratio.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B)(4)(*ix*) of this section, and except as otherwise provided in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance, the term *leverage ratio* means the ratio that the total indebtedness of the eligible section 965(i) transferee bears to the sum of its money and all other assets reduced (but not below zero) by such total indebtedness. For this purpose, the amount taken into account with respect to any asset is the adjusted basis thereof for purposes of determining gain, and the amount taken into account with respect to any indebtedness with original issue discount is its issue price plus the portion of the original issue discount previously accrued as determined under the rules of section 1272 (determined without regard to subsection (a)(7) or (b)(4) thereof).


(C) *Consent of Commissioner*—(*1*) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance, if an eligible section 965(i) transferor and an eligible section 965(i) transferee file a transfer agreement in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B) of this section, the eligible section 965(i) transferor and the eligible section 965(i) transferee will be considered to have entered into an agreement with the Commissioner for purposes of section 965(i)(2) and paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section. If the Commissioner determines that additional information is necessary (for example, additional information regarding the ability of the eligible section 965(i) transferee to pay the eligible section 965(i) transferor's unpaid section 965(i) net tax liability), the eligible section 965(i) transferee must provide such information upon request.


(*2*) *Material misrepresentations and omissions.* If the Commissioner determines that an agreement filed by an eligible section 965(i) transferor and an eligible section 965(i) transferee contains a material misrepresentation or material omission, or if the eligible section 965(i) transferee does not provide the additional information requested under paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(C)(*1*) of this section within a reasonable timeframe communicated by the Commissioner to the eligible section 965(i) transferee, then the Commissioner may reject the transfer agreement (effective as of the date of the related triggering event). In the alternative, on the date that the Commissioner determines that the transfer agreement includes a material misrepresentation or material omission, the Commissioner may determine that a triggering event has occurred with respect to the eligible section 965(i) transferee as of the date of the determination, such that the unpaid section 965(i) net tax liability of the eligible section 965(i) transferor that was assumed by the eligible section 965(i) transferee becomes due on the date of the determination.


(D) *Effect of assumption*—(*1*) *In general.* When the exception in this paragraph (c)(3)(iv) applies with respect to an eligible section 965(i) transferor and an eligible section 965(i) transferee, the eligible section 965(i) transferee assumes all of the outstanding obligations and responsibilities of the eligible section 965(i) transferor with respect to the section 965(i) net tax liability with respect to the S corporation as though the eligible section 965(i) transferee had included the section 965(a) inclusion in income. Accordingly, the eligible section 965(i) transferee is responsible for making payments and reporting with respect to any unpaid section 965(i) net tax liability with respect to the S corporation. In addition, for example, if a triggering event described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section occurs with respect to an eligible section 965(i) transferee, any unpaid portion of the section 965(i) net tax liability of the eligible section 965(i) transferor that was assumed by the eligible section 965(i) transferee becomes due on the date of such event, subject to any applicable exception in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) or (v) of this section.


(*2*) *Eligible section 965(i) transferor liability.* An eligible section 965(i) transferor remains jointly and severally liable for any unpaid installment payments of the eligible section 965(i) transferor that were assumed by the eligible section 965(i) transferee, as well as any penalties, additions to tax, or other additional amounts attributable to such net tax liability.


(v) *Coordination with section 965(h) election*—(A) *In general.* Subject to the limitation described in paragraph (c)(3)(v)(D) of this section, a shareholder that has made a section 965(i) election with respect to an S corporation, upon the occurrence of a triggering event with respect to such S corporation, may make a section 965(h) election with respect to the portion of the shareholder's section 965(i) net tax liability with respect to such S corporation that is assessed as an addition to tax for the shareholder's taxable year that includes the triggering event pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section as if such portion were a section 965(h) net tax liability.


(B) *Timing for election.* A section 965(h) election made pursuant to section 965(i)(4) and paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A) of this section must be made no later than the due date (taking into account extensions, if any) for the shareholder's return for the taxable year in which the triggering event with respect to the S corporation occurs. Relief is not available under § 301.9100-2 or § 301.9100-3 to make a late election.


(C) *Due date for installment.* If a shareholder makes a section 965(h) election pursuant to section 965(i)(4) and paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A) of this section, the payment of the first installment (as described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section) must be made no later than the due date (without regard to extensions) for the shareholder's return of tax for the taxable year in which the triggering event with respect to the S corporation occurs.


(D) *Limitation*—(*1*) *In general.* Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A) of this section, if the triggering event with respect to an S corporation is a triggering event described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, then the section 965(h) election may only be made with the consent of the Commissioner.


(*2*) *Manner of obtaining consent*—(*i*) *In general.* In order to obtain the consent of the Commissioner as required by paragraph (c)(3)(v)(D)(*1*) of this section, the shareholder intending to make the section 965(h) election must file the agreement described in paragraph (c)(3)(v)(D)(*4*) of this section within 30 days of the occurrence of the triggering event, except as described in paragraph (c)(3)(v)(D)(*2*)(*ii*) of this section. The agreement must be filed in accordance with the rules provided in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance. In addition, a duplicate copy of the agreement must be filed, with the shareholder's timely-filed return for the taxable year during which the triggering event occurs (taking into account extensions, if any), along with the election statement described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section. Relief is not available under § 301.9100-2 or § 301.9100-3 to file an agreement late.


(*ii*) *Transition rule.* If a triggering event occurs on or before February 5, 2019, the agreement must be filed by March 7, 2019, in order to be considered timely filed.


(*3*) *Signature requirement.* The agreement that is filed within 30 days of the triggering event or by the due date specified in paragraph (c)(3)(v)(D)(*2*)(*ii*) of this section must be signed under penalties of perjury by the shareholder.


(*4*) *Terms of agreement.* The agreement under this paragraph (c)(3)(v)(D) must be entitled “Consent Agreement Under Section 965(i)(4)(D)” and must contain the following information and representations—


(*i*) A statement that the shareholder agrees to comply with all of the conditions and requirements of section 965(h) and paragraph (b) of this section, as well as any other applicable requirements in the section 965 regulations;


(*ii*) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the shareholder;


(*iii*) The amount of the section 965(i) net tax liability under section 965 remaining unpaid with respect to which the section 965(h) election is made pursuant to section 965(i)(4)(D) and paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A) of this section, as determined by the shareholder, which amount is subject to adjustment by the Commissioner; and


(*iv*) A representation that the shareholder is able to make the payments required under section 965(h) and paragraph (b) of this section with respect to the portion of the total net tax liability under section 965 remaining unpaid described in paragraph (c)(3)(v)(D)(*4*)(*iii*) of this section.


(*v*) A statement as to whether the leverage ratio of the shareholder and all subsidiary members of its affiliated group immediately following the triggering event exceeds three to one; and


(*vi*) Any additional information, representation, or certification required by the Commissioner in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance.


(*5*) *Consent of Commissioner*—(*i*) *In general.* If a shareholder files an agreement in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(3)(v)(D) of this section, the shareholder will be considered to have obtained the consent of the Commissioner for purposes of section 965(i)(4)(D) and paragraph (c)(3)(v)(D)(*1*) of this section. However, if the Commissioner reviews the agreement and determines that additional information is necessary, the shareholder must provide such information upon request.


(*ii*) *Material misrepresentations and omissions.* If the Commissioner determines that an agreement filed by a shareholder in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (c)(3)(v)(D) contains a material misrepresentation or material omission, or if the shareholder does not provide the additional information requested under paragraph (c)(3)(v)(D)(*5*)(*i*) of this section within a reasonable timeframe communicated by the Commissioner to the shareholder, then the Commissioner may reject the agreement (effective as of the date of the related triggering event).


(*6*) *Leverage ratio.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(v)(D)(4)(*v*) of this section, and except as otherwise provided in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance, the term *leverage ratio* means the ratio that the total indebtedness of the shareholder bears to the sum of its money and all other assets reduced (but not below zero) by such total indebtedness. For this purpose, the amount taken into account with respect to any asset is the adjusted basis thereof for purposes of determining gain, and the amount taken into account with respect to any indebtedness with original issue discount is its issue price plus the portion of the original issue discount previously accrued as determined under the rules of section 1272 (determined without regard to subsection (a)(7) or (b)(4) thereof).


(4) *Joint and several liability.* If any shareholder of an S corporation makes a section 965(i) election, the S corporation is jointly and severally liable for the payment of the shareholder's section 965(i) net tax liability with respect to the S corporation, as well as any penalties, additions to tax, or other additional amounts attributable to such net tax liability.


(5) *Extension of limitation on collection.* If an S corporation shareholder makes a section 965(i) election with respect to its section 965(i) net tax liability with respect to an S corporation, any limitation on the time period for the collection of the net tax liability shall not begin before the date of the triggering event with respect to the section 965(i) net tax liability.


(6) *Annual reporting requirement*—(i) *In general.* A shareholder that makes a section 965(i) election with respect to its section 965(i) net tax liability with respect to an S corporation is required to report the amount of its deferred net tax liability on its return of tax for the taxable year in which the election is made and on the return of tax for each subsequent taxable year until such net tax liability has been fully assessed.


(ii) *Failure to report.* If a shareholder fails to report the amount of its deferred net tax liability as required with respect to any taxable year by the due date (taking into account extensions, if any) for the return of tax for that taxable year, five percent of such deferred net tax liability will be assessed as an addition to tax for such taxable year.


(d) *Section 965(m) election and special rule for real estate investment trusts*—(1) *In general.* A real estate investment trust may elect under section 965(m) and this paragraph (d) to defer the inclusion in gross income (for purposes of the computation of real estate investment trust taxable income under section 857(b)) of its REIT section 965 amounts and include them in income according to the schedule described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. This election is revocable only by including in gross income (for purposes of the computation of real estate investment trust taxable income under section 857(b)) the full amount of the REIT section 965 amounts.


(2) *Inclusion schedule for section 965(m) election.* If a real estate investment trust makes the section 965(m) election, the REIT section 965 amounts will be included in the real estate investment trust's gross income as follows—


(i) Eight percent of the REIT section 965 amounts in each taxable year in the five-taxable year period beginning with the taxable year the amount would otherwise be included;


(ii) Fifteen percent of the REIT section 965 amounts in the first year following the five year period described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section;


(iii) Twenty percent of the REIT section 965 amounts in the second year following the five year period described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section; and


(iv) Twenty-five percent of the REIT section 965 amounts in the third year following the five year period described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.


(3) *Manner of making election*—(i) *Eligibility.* A real estate investment trust with section 965(a) inclusions may make the section 965(m) election.


(ii) *Timing.* A section 965(m) election must be made no later than the due date (taking into account extensions, if any) for the return for the first year of the five year period described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. Relief is not available under § 301.9100-2 or § 301.9100-3 to make a late election.


(iii) *Election statement.* Except as otherwise provided in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance, to make a section 965(m) election, a real estate investment trust must attach a statement, signed under penalties of perjury consistent with the rules for signatures applicable to the person's return, to its return for the taxable year in which it would otherwise be required to include the REIT section 965 amounts in gross income. The statement must include the real estate investment trust's name, taxpayer identification number, REIT section 965 amounts, and the anticipated amounts of each portion of the REIT section 965 amounts described under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and the statement must be filed in the manner prescribed in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance. The attachment of an unsigned copy of the election statement to the timely-filed return for the relevant taxable year satisfies the signature requirement of this paragraph (d)(3)(iii) if the real estate investment trust retains the original signed election statement in the manner specified by § 1.6001-1(e).


(4) *Coordination with section 965(h).* A real estate investment trust that makes the section 965(m) election may not also make a section 965(h) election for any year with respect to which a section 965(m) election is in effect.


(5) *Acceleration of inclusion.* If a real estate investment trust makes a section 965(m) election and subsequently there is a liquidation, sale, exchange, or other disposition of substantially all of the assets of the real estate investment trust (including in a title 11 or similar case), or a cessation of business by the real estate investment trust, any amount not yet included in gross income (for purposes of the computation of real estate investment trust taxable income under section 857(b)) as a result of the section 965(m) election will be so included as of the day before the date of the event. The unpaid portion of any tax liability with respect to such inclusion will be due on the date of the event (or in the case of a title 11 or similar case, the day before the petition is filed).


(6) *Treatment of section 965(a) inclusions of a real estate investment trust.* Regardless of whether a real estate investment trust has made a section 965(m) election, and regardless of whether it is a United States shareholder of a deferred foreign income corporation, any section 965(a) inclusions of the real estate investment trust are not taken into account as gross income of the real estate investment trust for purposes of applying paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 856(c) for any taxable year for which the real estate investment trust takes into account a section 965(a) inclusion, including pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section.


(e) *Section 965(n) election*—(1) *In general*—(i) *General rule.* A person may elect to not take into account the amount described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section in determining its net operating loss under section 172 for the taxable year or in determining the amount of taxable income for such taxable year (computed without regard to the deduction allowable under section 172) that may be reduced by net operating loss carryovers or carrybacks to such taxable year under section 172. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the election for each taxable year is irrevocable. If the section 965(n) election creates or increases a net operating loss under section 172 for the taxable year, then the taxable income of the person for the taxable year cannot be less than the amount described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. The amount of deductions equal to the amount by which a net operating loss is created or increased for the taxable year by reason of the section 965(n) election (the *deferred amount*) is not taken into account in computing taxable income or the separate foreign tax credit limitations under section 904 for that year. The source and separate category (as defined in § 1.904-5(a)(4)(v)) components of the deferred amount are determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section.


(ii) *Applicable amount for section 965(n) election.* If a person makes a section 965(n) election, the amount referred to in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section is the sum of—


(A) The person's section 965(a) inclusions for the taxable year reduced by the person's section 965(c) deductions for the taxable year, and


(B) In the case of a domestic corporation, the taxes deemed paid under section 960(a)(1) for the taxable year with respect to the person's section 965(a) inclusions that are treated as dividends under section 78.


(iii) *Scope of section 965(n) election.* If a person makes a section 965(n) election, the election applies to both net operating losses for the taxable year for which the election is made and the net operating loss carryovers or carrybacks to such taxable year, each in their entirety. Any section 965(n) election made by the agent (within the meaning of § 1.1502-77) of a consolidated group applies to all net operating losses available to the consolidated group, including all components of the consolidated net operating loss deduction (as defined in § 1.1502-21(a)).


(iv) *Effect of section 965(n) election*—(A) *In general.* The section 965(n) election for a taxable year applies solely for purposes of determining the amount of net operating loss under section 172 for the taxable year and determining the amount of taxable income for the taxable year (computed without regard to the deduction allowable under section 172) that may be reduced by net operating loss carryovers or carrybacks to such taxable year under section 172. Paragraph (e)(1)(iv)(B) of this section provides a rule for coordinating the section 965(n) election's effect on section 172 with the computation of the separate foreign tax credit limitations under section 904.


(B) *Ordering rule for allocation and apportionment of deductions for purposes of the section 904 limitation.* The effect of a section 965(n) election with respect to a taxable year on the computation of the separate foreign tax credit limitations under section 904 is computed as follows and in the following order.


(*1*) Deductions, including those that create or increase a net operating loss for the taxable year by reason of the section 965(n) election, are allocated and apportioned under §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-17 to the relevant statutory and residual groupings, taking into account the amount described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. The source and separate category of the net operating loss carryover or carryback to the taxable year, if any, is determined under the rules of § 1.904(g)-3(b), taking into account the amount described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. Therefore, if the amount of the net operating loss carryover or carryback to the taxable year (as reduced by reason of the section 965(n) election) exceeds the U.S. source loss component of the net operating loss that is carried over under § 1.904(g)-3(b)(3)(i), but such excess is less than the potential carryovers (or carrybacks) of the separate limitation losses that are part of the net operating loss, the potential carryovers (or carrybacks) are proportionately reduced as provided in § 1.904(g)-3(b)(3)(ii) or (iii), as applicable.


(*2*) If a net operating loss is created or increased for the taxable year by reason of the section 965(n) election, the deferred amount (as defined in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section) is not allowed as a deduction for the taxable year. See paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section. The deferred amount (which is the corresponding addition to the net operating loss for the taxable year) comprises a ratable portion of the deductions (including the deduction allowed under section 965(c)) allocated and apportioned to each statutory and residual grouping under paragraph (e)(1)(iv)(B)(*1*) of this section. Such ratable portion equals the deferred amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the deductions allocated and apportioned to the statutory or residual grouping under paragraph (e)(1)(iv)(B)(*1*) of this section and the denominator of which is the total deductions described in paragraph (e)(1)(iv)(B)(*1*) of this section. Accordingly, the fraction described in the previous sentence takes into account the deferred amount.


(*3*) Taxable income and the separate foreign tax credit limitations under section 904 for the taxable year are computed without taking into account any deferred amount. Deductions allocated and apportioned to the statutory and residual groupings under paragraph (e)(1)(iv)(B)(*1*) of this section, to the extent deducted in the taxable year rather than deferred to create or increase a net operating loss, are combined with income in the statutory and residual groupings to which those deductions are assigned in order to compute the amount of separate limitation income or loss in each separate category and U.S. source income or loss for the taxable year. Section 904(b), (f), and (g) are then applied to determine the applicable foreign tax credit limitations for the taxable year.


(2) *Manner of making election*—(i) *Eligibility.* A person with a section 965(a) inclusion may make the section 965(n) election.


(ii) *Timing*—(A) *In general.* A section 965(n) election must be made no later than the due date (taking into account extensions, if any) for the person's return for the taxable year to which the election applies. Relief is not available under § 301.9100-2 or § 301.9100-3 of this chapter to make a late election.


(B) *Transition rule.* In the case of a section 965(n) election made before June 21, 2019, the election may be revoked by attaching a statement, signed under penalties of perjury, to an amended return for the taxable year to which the election applies (the *election year*). The statement must include the person's name, taxpayer identification number, and a statement that the person revokes the section 965(n) election. The amended return to which the statement is attached must be filed by—


(*1*) In the case of a revocation with respect to an election due before February 5, 2019, the due date (taking into account extensions, if any, or any additional time that would have been granted if the person had made an extension request) for the return for the taxable year following the election year; or


(*2*) In the case of a revocation with respect to an election due on or after February 5, 2019, the due date (taking into account extensions, if any, or any additional time that would have been granted if the person had made an extension request) for the return for the election year.


(iii) *Election statement.* Except as otherwise provided in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance, to make a section 965(n) election, a person must attach a statement, signed under penalties of perjury consistent with the rules for signatures applicable to the person's return, to its return for the taxable year to which the election applies. The statement must include the person's name, taxpayer identification number, the amounts described in section 965(n)(2)(A) and paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(A) of this section and section 965(n)(2)(B) and paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, and the sum thereof, and the statement must be filed in the manner prescribed in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance. The attachment of an unsigned copy of the election statement to the timely-filed return for the relevant taxable year satisfies the signature requirement of this paragraph (e)(2)(iii) if the person making the election retains the original signed election statement in the manner specified by § 1.6001-1(e).


(3) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section.


(i) *Example 1: Net operating loss in inclusion year*—(A) *Facts.* USP, a domestic corporation, has a section 965(a) inclusion of $100x and has a section 965(c) deduction of $70x for its taxable year ending December 31, 2017. USP also includes in gross income the amount treated as dividends under section 78 of $50x (the foreign taxes deemed paid under section 960(a) for the taxable year with respect to USP's section 965(a) inclusion). The section 965(a) inclusion and the section 78 dividends are foreign source general category income. During the 2017 taxable year, USP also has U.S. source gross income of $150x and other deductions of $210x, comprising $60x of interest expense and $150x of other deductible expenses that are not definitely related to any gross income. USP's total tax book value of its assets, as determined under §§ 1.861-9(g)(2) and 1.861-9T(g)(3), is divided equally between assets that generate foreign source general category income and assets that generate U.S. source income. USP elects under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section to not take into account the amount described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section in determining its net operating loss under section 172 for the taxable year. Before taking into account the section 965(n) election, USP's total deductions are $280x ($210x + $70x) and USP's taxable income is $20x ($100x + $50x + $150x−$70x−$210x).


(B) *Analysis*. (*1*) The amount described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section is $80x ($100x section 965(a) inclusion−$70x section 965(c) deduction + $50x section 78 dividends). Not taking into account the $80x creates a net operating loss under section 172 of $60x ($20x taxable income without regard to the section 965(n) election−$80x) for the taxable year (the “deferred amount”). Under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the deferred amount of $60x constitutes a net operating loss and is not allowed as a deduction for the taxable year. USP's taxable income for the year is $80x ($100x + $50x + $150x−($280x−$60x)).


(*2*) Under paragraph (e)(1)(iv)(B)(*1*) of this section, deductions are allocated and apportioned under §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-17 to the relevant statutory and residual groupings, taking into account the amount described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. Under § 1.861-8(b), USP's section 965(c) deduction is definitely related to the section 965(a) inclusion, and, therefore, is allocated solely to foreign source general category income. Under § 1.861-9T, based on USP's asset values, the interest expense of $60x is ratably apportioned $30x to foreign source general category income and $30x to U.S. source income. Under § 1.861-8(c)(3), based on $150x of gross U.S. source income and $150x of gross foreign source general category income, the other expenses of $150x are ratably apportioned $75x to foreign source general category income and $75x to U.S. source income. Therefore, USP's deductions allocated and apportioned to foreign source general category income are $175x ($70x + $30x + $75x) and its deductions allocated and apportioned to U.S. source income are $105x ($30x + $75x).


(*3*) Under paragraph (e)(1)(iv)(B)(*2*) of this section, the deferred amount of $60x comprises a ratable portion of the allocated and apportioned deductions. Therefore, $37.5x ($60x × $175x/$280x) of the deferred amount comprises deductions allocated and apportioned to foreign source general category income, and $22.5x ($60x × $105x/$280x) comprises deductions allocated and apportioned to U.S. source income.


(*4*) Under paragraph (e)(1)(iv)(B)(*3*) of this section, for purposes of the separate foreign tax credit limitation under section 904, foreign source general category income for the taxable year is computed without taking into account the $37.5x of the deferred amount that is attributable to the deductions allocated and apportioned to the foreign source general category. Therefore, for the 2017 taxable year, foreign source general category income is $12.5x ($100x section 965(a) inclusion + $50x section 78 dividends−($175x deductions−$37.5x deferred amount). The remaining taxable income of $67.5x is U.S. source income.


(ii) *Example 2: Net operating loss carryover to the inclusion year*—(A) *Facts.* USP, a domestic corporation, has a section 965(a) inclusion of $100x and has a section 965(c) deduction of $60x for its taxable year ending December 31, 2017. USP also includes in gross income the amount treated as dividends under section 78 of $40x (the foreign taxes deemed paid under section 960(a) for the taxable year with respect to USP's section 965(a) inclusion). The section 965(a) inclusion and the section 78 dividends are foreign source general category income. USP also has U.S. source gross income of $200x, foreign source passive category gross income of $100x, and other deductions of $140x. Under § 1.861-8(b), USP's $60x section 965(c) deduction is definitely related to the section 965(a) inclusion, and, therefore, is allocated solely to foreign source general category income. Under §§ 1.861-8 through 1.861-17, USP allocates and apportions the other $140x of deductions as follows: $40x to foreign source general category income, $40x to foreign source passive category income, and $60x to U.S. source income. USP has a net operating loss of $260x for the 2016 taxable year consisting of a $120x U.S. source loss, a $75x general category separate limitation loss, and a $65x passive category separate limitation loss. Under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, USP elects to not take into account the amount described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section in determining the amount of taxable income that may be reduced by net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks to the taxable year under section 172. USP's taxable income before taking into account the section 965(n) election and any net operating loss carryover deduction is $240x:


(B) *Analysis*—(*1*) The amount described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section is $80x ($100x section 965(a) inclusion−$60x section 965(c) deduction + $40x section 78 dividends). As a result of the section 965(n) election, the net operating loss deduction allowed in the 2017 taxable year is reduced from $240x to $160x (the amount of USP's taxable income reduced by the amount described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section).


(*2*) Under paragraph (e)(1)(iv)(B)(*1*) of this section, the source and separate category of the net operating loss deduction allowed in the 2017 taxable year is determined under the rules of § 1.904(g)-3(b), taking into account the amount described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. Under § 1.904(g)-3(b)(3)(i), first the $120x U.S. source component of the net operating loss is allocated to U.S. source income for the 2017 taxable year. Because the total tentative carryover under § 1.904(g)-3(b)(3)(ii) of $100x ($40x in the general category and $60x in the passive category) exceeds the remaining net operating loss deduction of $40x ($160x−$120x), the tentative carryover amount from each separate category is reduced proportionately, to $16x ($40x × $40x/$100x) for the general category and $24x ($40x × $60x/$100x) for the passive category. Accordingly, $16x of the general category component of the net operating loss is carried forward, and $24x of the passive category component of the net operating loss is carried forward and combined with income in the same respective categories for the 2017 taxable year. After allocation of the net operating loss carryover from 2016, USP's taxable income for the 2017 taxable year is as follows:
