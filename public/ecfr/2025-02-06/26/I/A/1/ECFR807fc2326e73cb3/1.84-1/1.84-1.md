# § 1.84-1   Transfer of appreciated property to political organizations.

(a) *Transfer defined.* A transfer after May 7, 1974, of property to a political organization (as defined in section 527(e)(1), and including a newsletter fund to the extent provided under section 527(g)) is treated as a sale of the property to the political organization if the fair market value of the property exceeds its adjusted basis. The transferor is treated as having realized an amount equal to the fair market value of the property on the date of the transfer. For purposes of this section, a transfer is any assignment, conveyance, or delivery of property other than a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth, whether the transfer is in trust or otherwise, whether the transfer is direct or indirect and whether the property is real or personal, tangible or intangible. Thus, for example, a sale at less than fair market value (other than an ordinary trade discount), or a receipt of property by a political organization under an agency agreement entitling the organization to sell the property and retain all or a portion of the proceeds of the sale, is a transfer within the meaning, of this section. The term “transfer” also includes an illegal contribution of property.


(b) *Amount realized.* A transferor to whom this section applies realizes an amount equal to the fair market value of the property on the date of the transfer. For purposes of this section, the definition of fair market value set forth in § 1.170A-1(c) (2) and (3) is incorporated by reference.


(c) *Amount recognized.* A transferor to whom this section applies is treated as having sold the property to the political organization on the date of the transfer. Therefore, the rules of chapter 1 of subtitle A (relating to income tax) apply to the gain realized under this section as if this gain were an amount realized upon the sale of the property. These rules include those of section 55 and section 56 (relating to minimum tax for tax preference), section 306 (relating to disposition of certain stock), section 1201 (relating to the alternative tax on certain capital gains), section 1245 (relating to gain from dispositions of certain depreciable property), and section 1250 (relating to gain from dispositions of certain depreciable realty).


(d) *Holding period.* The holding period of property transferred to a political organization to which this section applies begins on the day after the date of acquisition of the property by the political organization.
