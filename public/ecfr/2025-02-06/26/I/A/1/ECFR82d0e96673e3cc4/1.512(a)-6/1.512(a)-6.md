# § 1.512(a)-6   Special rule for organizations with more than one unrelated trade or business.

(a) *More than one unrelated trade or business*—(1) *In general.* An organization with more than one unrelated trade or business must compute unrelated business taxable income (UBTI) separately with respect to each such trade or business, without regard to the specific deduction in section 512(b)(12), including for purposes of determining any net operating loss (NOL) deduction. An organization with more than one unrelated trade or business computes its total UBTI under paragraph (g) of this section.


(2) *Separate trades or businesses.* An organization determines whether it regularly carries on unrelated trades or businesses by applying sections 511 through 514. For purposes of section 512(a)(6)(A) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an organization identifies its separate unrelated trades or businesses using the methods described in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.


(3) *Reporting changes in identification.* An organization that changes the identification of a separate unrelated trade or business under paragraph (a)(2) of this section must report the change in the taxable year of that change in accordance with forms and instructions. For this purpose, a change in identification of a separate unrelated trade or business includes the changed identification of the separate unrelated trade or business with respect to a partnership interest that was incorrectly designated as a qualifying partnership interest (QPI). In the case of an incorrect designation of a QPI, paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section (regarding designation of qualifying partnership interests) does not apply. In all cases, to report the change in identification, an organization must provide the following information with respect to each separate change in identification—


(i) The identification of the separate unrelated trade or business in the previous taxable year;


(ii) The identification of the separate unrelated trade or business in the current taxable year; and


(iii) The reason for the change.


(b) *North American Industry Classification System*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, an organization identifies each of its separate unrelated trades or businesses using the first two digits of the North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS 2-digit code) that most accurately describes the unrelated trade or business based on the more specific NAICS code, such as at the 6-digit level, that describes the activity it conducts and subject to the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) and (3) of this section. The descriptions in the current NAICS manual (available at *www.census.gov*) of trades or businesses using more than two digits of the NAICS codes are relevant in this determination. In the case of the sale of goods, both online and in stores, the separate unrelated trade or business is identified by the goods sold in stores if the same goods generally are sold both online and in stores.


(2) *Codes must identify the unrelated trade or business.* The NAICS 2-digit code must identify the unrelated trade or business in which the organization engages (directly or indirectly) and not activities the conduct of which are substantially related to the exercise or performance by such organization of its charitable, educational, or other purpose or function constituting the basis for its exemption under section 501 (or, in the case of an organization described in section 511(a)(2)(B), to the exercise or performance of any purpose or function described in section 501(c)(3)). For example, a college or university described in section 501(c)(3) cannot use the NAICS 2-digit code for educational services to identify all its separate unrelated trades or businesses, and a qualified retirement plan described in section 401(a) cannot use the NAICS 2-digit code for finance and insurance to identify all of its unrelated trades or businesses.


(3) *Codes only reported once.* An organization will report each NAICS 2-digit code only once. For example, a hospital organization that operates several hospital facilities in a geographic area (or multiple geographic areas), all of which include pharmacies that sell goods to the general public, would include all the pharmacies under the NAICS 2-digit code for retail trade, regardless of whether the hospital organization keeps separate books and records for each pharmacy.


(c) *Activities in the nature of investments*—(1) *In general.* An organization's activities in the nature of investments (investment activities) are treated collectively as a separate unrelated trade or business for purposes of section 512(a)(6) and paragraph (a) of this section. Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(7) and (c)(8) of this section, an organization's investment activities are limited to its—


(i) Qualifying partnership interests (described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section);


(ii) Qualifying S corporation interests (described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section); and


(iii) Debt-financed property or properties (within the meaning of section 514).


(2) *Qualifying partnership interests*—(i) *Directly-held partnership interests.* An interest in a partnership is a qualifying partnership interest (QPI) if the exempt organization holds a direct interest in the partnership (directly-held partnership interest) that meets the requirements of either the de minimis test (described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section) or the participation test (described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section).


(ii) *Indirectly-held partnership interests*—(A) *Look through rule.* If an organization holds a direct interest in a partnership but that directly-held partnership interest is not a QPI because it does not meet the requirements of the de minimis test (described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section) or the participation test (described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section), any partnership in which the organization holds an indirect interest through the directly-held partnership interest (indirectly-held partnership interest) may be a QPI if the indirectly-held partnership interest meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) or (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section.


(B) *Indirectly-held partnership interests that meet the requirements of the de minimis test.* An indirectly-held partnership interest meets the requirements of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) if the indirectly-held partnership interest meets the requirements of the de minimis test described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section with regard to the organization. For example, if an organization directly holds 50 percent of the capital interests of a partnership and the directly-held partnership holds 4 percent of the capital and profits interest of lower-tier partnership A, the organization may aggregate its interest in lower-tier partnership A with its other QPIs because the organization indirectly holds 2 percent of the capital and profits interests of lower-tier partnership A (4 percent × 50 percent).


(C) *Indirectly-held partnership interests that meet the requirements of the participation test.* An indirectly-held partnership interest meets the requirements of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) if the indirectly-held partnership interest meets the requirements of the participation test (described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section) with respect to the partnership that directly owns the interest in the indirectly-held partnership. For purposes of applying the participation test to a partnership, the term *organization* in paragraph (c)(4) of this section refers to the partnership that directly holds the indirectly-held partnership interest being tested for QPI status. Additionally, the list of officers, directors, trustees, or employees of an organization found in paragraphs (c)(4)(iii)(B) and (C) includes a general partner that directly owns an interest in the lower-tier partnership.


(D) *Example.* (*1*) Organization D is described in section 501(c) and is exempt from Federal income tax under section 501(a). Organization D owns 50 percent of the capital interest in Partnership A. Partnership A owns 30 percent of the capital interest in Partnership B, but Partnership A does not significantly participate in Partnership B within the meaning of paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section. Further, Partnership B owns 15 percent of the capital interest in Partnership C, in which Partnership B does not significantly participate within the meaning of paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section. No other organizations related (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section) to either Organization D or the partnerships owns an interest in any of the lower-tier partnerships.


(*2*) Neither the interest in Partnership A nor B is a QPI. Organization D's interest in Partnership A does not meet the requirements of either the de minimis test or the participation test because it owns 50 percent of the interest in the partnership. Organization D's indirect interest in Partnership B (50 percent of 30 percent, or 15 percent) does not meet the de minimis test. Additionally, because Partnership A owns greater than 20 percent interest in Partnership B, Partnership A's interest in Partnership B does not meet the participation test. However, Organization D's interest in Partnership C is a QPI because Partnership C meets the participation test. That is, Partnership B holds a 15 percent interest in Partnership C and does not significantly participate in Partnership C.


(iii) *Designation.* An organization that has a partnership interest meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section in a taxable year may designate that partnership interest as a QPI by including its share of partnership gross income (and directly connected deductions) with the gross income (and directly connected deductions) from its other investment activities (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section) in accordance with forms and instructions. Any partnership interest that is designated as a QPI remains a QPI unless and until it no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section. For example, if an organization designates a directly-held partnership interest that meets the requirements of the de minimis rule as a QPI in one taxable year, the organization cannot, in the next taxable year, use NAICS 2-digit codes to describe the partnership trades or businesses that are unrelated trades or businesses with respect to the organization unless the directly-held partnership interest fails to meet the requirements of both the de minimis test and the participation test (after application of the grace period described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, if appropriate).


(3) *De minimis test.* A partnership interest is a QPI that meets the requirements of the de minimis test if the organization holds directly (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section) or indirectly (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) no more than 2 percent of the profits interest and no more than 2 percent of the capital interest during the organization's taxable year with which or in which the partnership's taxable year ends.


(4) *Participation test*—(i) *In general.* A partnership interest is a QPI that meets the requirements of the participation test if the organization holds directly (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section) or indirectly (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) no more than 20 percent of the capital interest during the organization's taxable year with which or in which the partnership's taxable year ends and the organization does not significantly participate in the partnership within the meaning of paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section.


(ii) *Combining related interests.* When determining an organization's percentage interest in a partnership for purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the interests of a supporting organization (as defined in section 509(a)(3) and § 1.509(a)-4), other than a Type III supporting organization (as defined in § 1.509(a)-4(i)) that is not a parent of its supported organization, or of a controlled entity (as defined in section 512(b)(13)(D) and § 1.512(b)-1(l)) in the same partnership will be taken into account. For example, if an organization owns 10 percent of the capital interests in a partnership, and its Type I supporting organization owns an additional 15 percent capital interest in that partnership, the organization would not meet the requirements of the participation test because its aggregate percentage interest exceeds 20 percent (10 percent + 15 percent = 25 percent).


(iii) *Significant Participation.* An organization significantly participates in a partnership if—


(A) The organization, by itself, may require the partnership to perform, or may prevent the partnership from performing (other than through a unanimous voting requirement or through minority consent rights), any act that significantly affects the operations of the partnership;


(B) Any of the organization's officers, directors, trustees, or employees have rights to participate in the management of the partnership at any time;


(C) Any of the organization's officers, directors, trustees, or employees have rights to conduct the partnership's business at any time; or


(D) The organization, by itself, has the power to appoint or remove any of the partnership's officers or employees or a majority of directors.


(5) *Determining percentage interest*—(i) *Profits interest.* For purposes of the de minimis test described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, an organization's profits interest in a partnership is determined in the same manner as its distributive share of partnership taxable income. See section 704(b) (relating to the determination of the distributive share by the income or loss ratio) and §§ 1.704-1 through 1.704-4.


(ii) *Capital interest.* For purposes of the de minimis test (described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section) and the participation test (described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section), in the absence of a provision in the partnership agreement, an organization's capital interest in a partnership is determined on the basis of its interest in the assets of the partnership which would be distributable to such organization upon its withdrawal from the partnership, or upon liquidation of the partnership, whichever is the greater.


(iii) *Average percentage interest.* For purposes of the de minimis test (described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section) and the participation test (described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section), an organization determines its percentage interest by taking the average of the organization's percentage interest at the beginning and the end of the partnership's taxable year, or, in the case of a partnership interest held for less than a year, the percentage interest held at the beginning and end of the period of ownership within the partnership's taxable year. For example, if an organization acquires an interest in a partnership that files on a calendar year basis in May and the partnership reports on Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) that the partner held a 3 percent profits interest at the date of acquisition but held a 1 percent profits interest at the end of the calendar year, the organization will be considered to have held 2 percent of the profits interest in that partnership for that year ((3 percent + 1 percent)/2).


(iv) *Reliance on Schedule K-1 (Form 1065).* When determining the organization's average percentage interest (described in paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section) in a partnership for purposes of the de minimis test (described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section) and the participation test (described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section), an organization may rely on the Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) (or its successor) it receives from the partnership if the form lists the organization's percentage profits interest or its percentage capital interest, or both, at the beginning and end of the year. However, the organization may not rely on the form to the extent that any information about the organization's percentage interest is not specifically provided. For example, if the Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) an organization receives from a partnership lists the organization's profits interest as “variable” but lists its percentage capital interest at the beginning and end of the year, the organization may rely on the form only with respect to its percentage capital interest.


(6) *Changes in percentage interest.* A partnership interest that fails to meet the requirements of the de minimis test (described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section) or the participation test (described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section) because of an increase in percentage interest in the organization's current taxable year may be treated for the taxable year of the change as meeting the requirements of the test it met in the prior taxable year if—


(i) The partnership interest met the requirements of the de minimis test or participation test, respectively, in the organization's prior taxable year without application of this paragraph (c)(6);


(ii) The increase in percentage interest is solely due to the actions of one or more partners other than the organization; and


(iii) In the case of a partnership interest that met the requirements of the participation test in the prior taxable year, the interest of the partner or partners that caused the increase in paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section was not combined for the prior taxable year and is not combined for the taxable year of the change with the organization's partnership interest for purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.


(7) *UBTI from the investment activities of organizations subject to section 512(a)(3).* For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, UBTI from the investment activities of an organization subject to section 512(a)(3) includes any amount that—


(i) Would be excluded from the calculation of UBTI under section 512(b)(1), (2), (3), or (5) if the organization were subject to section 512(a)(1);


(ii) Is attributable to income set aside (and not in excess of the set aside limit described in section 512(a)(3)(E)), but not used, for a purpose described in section 512(a)(3)(B)(i) or (ii); or


(iii) Is in excess of the set aside limit described in section 512(a)(3)(E).


(8) *Limitations*—(i) *Social clubs.* Paragraphs (c)(2) (regarding QPIs) and (c)(9) (transition rule for certain partnership interests) of this section do not apply to social clubs described in section 501(c)(7).


(ii) *General partnership interests.* Any partnership in which an organization, or an organization whose interest is combined with that organization's interest for purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, is a general partner under applicable state law is not a QPI within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, regardless of the organization's percentage interest. Such partnership interest cannot be a QPI for any organization or for any of the organizations whose interest is combined with that organization's interest for purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.


(iii) *Application of other sections.* This paragraph (c) does not otherwise impact application of section 512(c) and the fragmentation rule under section 513(c).


(9) *Transition rule for certain partnership interests*—(i) *In general.* If a directly-held partnership interest acquired prior to August 21, 2018, is not a QPI, an organization may treat such partnership interest as a separate unrelated trade or business for purposes of section 512(a)(6) regardless of the number of unrelated trades or businesses directly or indirectly conducted by the partnership. For example, if an organization has a 35 percent capital interest in a partnership acquired prior to August 21, 2018, it can treat the partnership as a single trade or business even if the partnership's investments generated UBTI from lower-tier partnerships that were engaged in multiple trades or businesses. A partnership interest acquired prior to August 21, 2018, will continue to meet the requirement of this rule even if the organization's percentage interest in such partnership changes before the end of the transition period (see paragraph (c)(9)(iii) of this section).


(ii) *Exclusivity.* An organization may apply either the transition rule in paragraph (c)(9)(i) of this section or the look-through rule in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, but not both, to a partnership interest described in paragraph (c)(9)(i) of this section that also qualifies for application of the look-through rule described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii).


(iii) *Transition period.* An organization may rely on this transition rule until the first day of the organization's first taxable year beginning after December 2, 2020.


(d) *Income from certain controlled entities*—(1) *Specified payments from controlled entities.* If an organization (controlling organization) controls another entity (within the meaning of section 512(b)(13)(D)) (controlled entity), all specified payments (as defined in section 512(b)(13)(C)) received by a controlling organization from that controlled entity are treated as gross income from a separate unrelated trade or business for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section. If a controlling organization receives specified payments from two different controlled entities, the payments from each controlled entity are treated as a separate unrelated trade or business. For example, a controlling organization that receives rental payments from two controlled entities has two separate unrelated trades or businesses, one for each controlled entity. The specified payments from a controlled entity are treated as gross income from one trade or business regardless of whether the controlled entity engages in more than one unrelated trade or business or whether the controlling organization receives more than one type of specified payment from that controlled entity.


(2) *Certain amounts derived from controlled foreign corporations.* All amounts included in UBTI under section 512(b)(17) are treated as income derived from a separate unrelated trade or business for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section.


(e) *S corporation interests*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, if an organization owns stock in an S corporation (S corporation interest), such S corporation interest is treated as an interest in a separate unrelated trade or business for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section. Thus, if an organization owns two S corporation interests, neither of which is described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the exempt organization reports two separate unrelated trades or businesses, one for each S corporation interest. The UBTI from an S corporation interest is the amount described in section 512(e)(1)(B).


(2) *Exception for a qualifying S corporation interest.* Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an organization may aggregate its UBTI from an S corporation interest with its UBTI from other investment activities (described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section) if the organization's ownership interest in the S corporation meets the criteria for a QPI as described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section (substituting “S corporation” for “partnership” and “shareholder” or “shareholders” for “partner” or “partners,” as applicable, throughout paragraphs (c)(2)(i), (c)(3), (c)(4), (c)(5)(iii), (c)(5)(iv), and (c)(6) of this section; “no more than 2 percent of stock ownership” for “no more than 2 percent of the profits interest and no more than 2 percent of the capital interest” in paragraph (c)(3) of this section; “no more than 20 percent of stock ownership” in place of “no more than 20 percent of the capital interest” in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section; and “Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S)” for “Schedule K-1 (Form 1065)” for purposes of paragraph (c)(5)(iv) of this section). Paragraphs (c)(5)(i) and (c)(5)(ii) do not apply for purposes of determining an organization's ownership interest in an S corporation; rather, the average percentage stock ownership determined under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section applies for purposes of this paragraph (e)(2). For purposes of paragraph (c)(5)(iv) of this section, an organization can rely on the Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S) (or its successor) it receives from the S corporation only if the form lists information sufficient to determine the organization's percentage of stock ownership for the year. A Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S) that reports “zero” as the organization's number of shares of stock in either the beginning or end of the S corporation's taxable year does not list information sufficient to determine the organization's percentage of stock ownership for the year. The grace period described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section applies to changes in an exempt organization's percentage of stock ownership in an S corporation.


(f) *Allocation of deductions.* An organization must allocate deductions between separate unrelated trades or businesses using the method described in § 1.512(a)-1(c).


(g) *Total UBTI*—(1) *In general.* The total UBTI of an organization with more than one unrelated trade or business is the sum of the UBTI computed with respect to each separate unrelated trade or business (as identified under paragraph (a)(2) of this section and subject to the limitation described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section), less a charitable contribution deduction, an NOL deduction for losses arising in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018 (pre-2018 NOLs), and a specific deduction under section 512(b)(12), as applicable.


(2) *UBTI not less than zero.* For purposes of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the UBTI with respect to any separate unrelated trade or business identified under paragraph (a)(2) of this section cannot be less than zero.


(h) *Net operating losses*—(1) *In general.* For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, an exempt organization with more than one unrelated trade or business determines the NOL deduction allowed by sections 172(a) and 512(b)(6) separately with respect to each of its unrelated trades or businesses. Accordingly, if an exempt organization has more than one unrelated trade or business, § 1.512(b)-1(e) applies separately with respect to each such unrelated trade or business.


(2) *Coordination of pre-2018 and post-2017 NOLs.* An organization with pre-2018 NOLs, and with losses arising in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017 (post-2017 NOLs), deducts its pre-2018 NOLs from total UBTI before deducting any post-2017 NOLs with regard to a separate unrelated trade or business against the UBTI from such trade or business. Pre-2018 NOLs are taken against the total UBTI as determined under paragraph (g) of this section in a manner that allows for maximum utilization of post-2017 NOLs in a taxable year. For example, an organization could choose to allocate all of its pre-2018 NOLs to one of its separate unrelated trades or businesses or it could allocate its pre-2018 NOLs ratably among its separate unrelated trades or businesses, whichever results in the greatest utilization of the post-2017 NOLs in that taxable year.


(3) *Treatment of NOLs upon the termination, sale, exchange, or other disposition of a separate unrelated trade or business.* After offsetting any gain resulting from the termination, sale, exchange, or disposition of a separate unrelated trade or business, any NOL remaining is suspended. However, the suspended NOLs may be used if that previous separate unrelated trade or business is later resumed or if a new unrelated trade or business that is accurately identified using the same NAICS 2-digit code as the previous separate unrelated trade or business is commenced or acquired in a future taxable year.


(4) *Treatment of NOLs when the identification of a separate unrelated trade or business changes*—(i) *In general.* For purposes of section 512(a)(6) and this section, a separate unrelated trade or business for which the appropriate identification (within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section) changes is treated as if the originally identified separate unrelated trade or business is terminated and a new separate unrelated trade or business is commenced. None of the NOLs from the previously identified separate unrelated trade or business will be carried over to the newly identified separate unrelated trade or business. For example, if the nature of a separate unrelated trade or business changes such that it is more accurately described by another NAICS 2-digit code, the separate unrelated trade or business is treated as a new separate unrelated trade or business with no NOLs. The change in identification may apply to all or a part of the originally identified separate unrelated trade or business. If the change in identification applies to the originally identified separate trade or business in its entirety, any NOLs attributable to that separate unrelated trade or business are suspended in accordance with paragraph (h)(3) of this section. If the change in identification applies to the originally identified separate unrelated trade or business in part, the originally identified separate unrelated trade or business that is not changing retains the full NOLs attributable to the originally identified separate unrelated trade or business, without allocation to the portion that became a newly identified separate unrelated trade or business. This paragraph (h)(4) also applies to each QPI that becomes a non-QPI. In this case, any NOLs attributable to the QPI that became a non-QPI are retained with the organization's investment activities described in paragraph (c) of this section.


(ii) *Exception for non-material changes.* In the case of a separate unrelated trade or business that is accidentally identified using the wrong NAICS 2-digit code or if an organization has determined that a separate unrelated trade or business that has not materially changed is more accurately identified by another NAICS 2-digit code, any NOL attributable to the originally identified separate unrelated trade or business becomes an NOL of the newly identified separate unrelated trade or business.


(iii) *Effective date of change in identification.* A change in identification described in this paragraph (h)(4) is effective on the first day of the taxable year in which the change in identification is made. Accordingly, the newly identified separate unrelated trade or business is treated as commencing on this date.


(iv) *Examples*—(A) *In general.* The following examples illustrate the rules described in this paragraph (h)(4).


(B) *Example 1. Erroneous code.* (*1*) Organization G is described in section 501(c) and is exempt from Federal income tax under section 501(a). In addition to its investment activities, Organization G has two separate unrelated trades or businesses—Q and R—that are identified with different NAICS 2-digit codes. Both Q and R have NOLs carried over from post-2017 taxable years.


(*2*) In Year 2 (a post-2017 taxable year), Organization G realizes that it accidentally used the wrong NAICS 2-digit code to identify R. The NOLs attributable to R under the old NAICS 2-digit code become the NOLs of R under the new NAICS 2-digit code as of the first day of Year 2.


(C) *Example 2. Material change.* (*1*) Same facts as *Example 1,* except assume that, in addition to its investment activities, Organization G has three separate unrelated trades or businesses—Q, R, and S—that are identified with different NAICS 2-digit codes. Q, R, and S all have NOLs carried over from post-2017 taxable years.


(*2*) Organization G changes the NAICS 2-digit code identifying R to the same NAICS 2-digit code identifying S because the nature of the unrelated trade or business materially changed. Any post-2017 NOLs attributable to R are suspended (see paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section). Organization G now has two separate unrelated trades or businesses—Q and S—as of the first day of Year 2.


(D) *Example 3. Partial material change.* Same facts as *Example 1,* except assume that Organization G determines that a part of R has materially changed such that R should be identified as two separate unrelated trades or businesses—R1 and R2. R1 retains the NAICS 2-digit code originally identifying R, and R2 is identified with a new NAICS 2-digit code that is not the same NAICS 2-digit code identifying Q. R2 is treated as a new separate unrelated trade or business with no NOLs as of the first day of Year 2. Any post-2017 NOLs attributable to R remain with R1.


(E) *Example 4. QPI to non-QPI.* (*1*) Same facts as *Example 1,* but assume that Organization G has a partnership interest in T that was, for prior taxable years, a QPI included with Organization G's investment activities. In Year 3 (a post-2017 taxable year), Organization G acquires more than 20 percent of the capital interests in T. The grace period described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section does not apply because the increase in percentage interest was not due to the actions of other partners.


(*2*) T conducts two trade or business activities that are unrelated trade or business activities with respect to Organization G—T1 and T2. Both T1 and T2 will be treated as new separate unrelated trades or business as of the first day of Year 2. Organization G identifies T1 with the same NAICS 2-digit code used to identify Q and T2 with a NAICS 2-digit code that is different than the NAICS 2-digit codes used to identify Q and R. In addition to its investment activities, Organization G has three separate unrelated trades or businesses—Q, R, and T2. Any post-2017 NOLs attributable to the QPI remain with Organization G's other investment activities separate unrelated trade or business.


(i) *Applicability dates.* This section is applicable to taxable years beginning on or after December 2, 2020. Taxpayers may choose to apply this section to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and before December 2, 2020.
