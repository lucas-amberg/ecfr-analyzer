# ยง 1.613-7   Application of percentage depletion rates provided in section 613(b) to certain taxable years ending in 1954.

(a) *Election of taxpayer.* In the case of any taxable year ending after December 31, 1953, to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 is applicable, the taxpayer may elect in accordance with section 613(d) and this section to apply the appropriate percentage depletion rate specified in section 613 in respect of any mineral property (within the meaning of the 1939 Code). In the case of mines, wells, or other natural deposits listed in section 613(b), the election may be made by the taxpayer irrespective of whether his depletion allowance with respect to the property for the taxable year was computed upon the basis of cost, discovery value, or upon a percentage of gross income from the property. Once made, the election shall be irrevocable with respect to the property for which it is exercised. The election may be made for any mineral property of the taxpayer and need not be made for all such properties. *Gross income from the property* and *net income from the property* shall have the same meaning as those terms are used in 26 CFR (1939) 39.23(m)-1 (Regulations 118).


(b) *Computation of depletion allowance.* The depletion allowance for any taxable year with respect to any property for which the taxpayer makes the election under section 613(d) shall be an amount equal to the sum of:


(1) That portion of a tentative allowance, computed under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 (without regard to paragraph (1) of section 613(d)), which the number of days in the taxable year prior to January 1, 1954, bears to the total number of days in such taxable year; plus


(2) That portion of a tentative allowance, computed by using the appropriate percentage depletion rate specified in section 613(b) (but otherwise computed under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939), which the number of days in the taxable year after December 31, 1953, bears to the total number of days in such taxable year


(c) *Examples.* The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:


(d) *Requirement for making election.* (1) The election under section 613(d) shall be made by filing a statement with the district director with whom the income tax return was filed for the taxable year to which the election is applicable. Such statement shall indicate that an election is being made under section 613(d), shall contain a recomputation of the depletion allowance and the tax liability for all taxable years affected by the exercise of the election, and shall be accompanied either by a claim for refund or credit or by an amended return or returns, whichever is appropriate.


(2) If the treatment of any item upon which a tax previously determined was based, or if the application of any provisions of the internal revenue laws with respect to such tax, depends upon the amount of income (e.g., charitable contributions, foreign tax credit, dividends received credit, and medical expenses), readjustment in these particulars will be necessary as part of any recomputation in conformity with the change in the amount of the income which results solely from the making of the election under section 613(d).


(e) *Administrative provisions; etc.* (1) Section 36(b) of the Technical Amendments Act of 1958 (72 Stat. 1633) provides as follows:


(2) If refund or credit of any overpayment resulting from the application of section 613(d) is prevented on September 2, 1958, or on or before March 2, 1959, by the operation of any law or rule of law (other than section 3760 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or section 7121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, relating to closing agreements, and other than section 3761 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or section 7122 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, relating to compromises), refund or credit of such overpayment may, nevertheless, be made or allowed if claim therefor is filed on or before March 2, 1959. If such refund or credit is not prevented on or before March 2, 1959, the time for filing claim therefor shall be governed by the rules of law generally applicable to credits and refunds.


(3) The amount of any refund or credit which is allowable by reason of section 613(d) shall not exceed the decrease in income tax liability resulting solely from the application of the percentage rates specified in section 613(b). No interest shall be allowed or paid on any overpayment resulting from the application of section 613(d).


(4) For purposes of this section the *decrease in income tax liability* shall be the amount by which the tax previously determined (as defined in section 3801(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) exceeds the tax as recomputed under section 613(d) and this section.


(f) *Adjustment to basis.* Proper adjustment shall be made to the basis of any property as required by section 113(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and 26 CFR (1939) 39.113(b)(*1*)-1(c) (Regulations 118) to reflect any change in the depletion allowance resulting from the application of section 613(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
