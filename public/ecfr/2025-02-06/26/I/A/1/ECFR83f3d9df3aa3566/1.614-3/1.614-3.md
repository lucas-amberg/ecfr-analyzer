# § 1.614-3   Rules relating to separate operating mineral interests in the case of mines.

(a) *Election to aggregate separate operating mineral interests*—(1) *General rule.* Except in the case of oil and gas wells, a taxpayer who owns two or more separate operating mineral interests, which constitute part or all of the same operating unit, may elect under section 614(c)(1) and this paragraph to form an aggregation of all such operating mineral interests which comprise any one mine or any two or more mines and to treat such aggregation as one property. The aggregated property which results from the exercise of such election shall be considered as one property for all purposes of subtitle A of the Code. The preceding sentence does not preclude the use of more than one account under a single method of computing depreciation or the use of more than one method of computing depreciation under section 167, if otherwise proper. Any reasonable and consistently applied method or methods of computing depreciation of the improvements made with respect to the separate properties aggregated may be continued in accordance with section 167 and the regulations thereunder. It is not necessary for purposes of the aggregation that the separate operating mineral interests be included in a single tract or parcel of land or in contiguous tracts or parcels of land so long as such interests constitute part or all of the same operating unit. A taxpayer may elect to form more than one aggregation of separate operating mineral interests within one operating unit so long as each aggregation consists of all the separate operating mineral interests which comprise any one mine or any two or more mines. Thus, no aggregation may include any separate operating mineral interest which is a part of a mine without including all of the separate operating mineral interests which comprise such mine in the first taxable year for which the election to aggregate is effective. Any separate operating mineral interest which becomes a part of such mine in a subsequent taxable year must also be included in such aggregation as of the taxable year that such interest becomes a part of such mine. The taxable year in which such interest becomes a part of such mine shall be determined upon the basis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. If a taxpayer fails to make an election under this paragraph to aggregate a particular operating mineral interest (other than an interest which becomes a part of a mine with respect to which the interests have been aggregated in a prior taxable year) on or before the last day prescribed for making such an election, such interest shall be treated as if an election had been made to treat it as a separate property. A taxpayer may not aggregate operating mineral interests and nonoperating mineral interests such as royalty interests. For definitions of the terms *operating mineral interest, operating unit,* and *mine,* see respectively paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section.


(2) *Aggregation in subsequent taxable years.* If the taxpayer has made an election under section 614(c)(1) for a particular taxable year with respect to any operating mineral interest or interests within a particular operating unit, and if, for a subsequent taxable year, the taxpayer desires to make an election with respect to an additional operating mineral interest within the same operating unit, then whether or not the taxpayer may elect to include such additional interest in an aggregation or treat it as a separate property depends upon the nature of such additional interest and of the taxpayer's previous elections. If the additional interest is a part of a mine with respect to which the other interests have been aggregated, the additional interest must be included in such aggregation. If the additional interest is a part of a mine with respect to which the other interests have been treated as separate properties, the additional interest must be treated as a separate property. If the additional interest is part of a mine which previously consisted of only a single interest which has not been aggregated with any other mine, such additional interest may be aggregated or treated as a separate property. If the additional interest is an entire mine, it may, at the election of the taxpayer, (i) be added to any aggregation within the same operating unit, (ii) be aggregated with any other single interest which is an entire mine provided both interests are within the same operating unit even though such single interest has previously been treated as a separate property, or (iii) be treated as a separate property.


(b) *Election to treat a single operating mineral interest as more than one property*—(1) *General rule.* Except in the case of oil and gas wells, a taxpayer who owns a separate operating mineral interest in a mineral deposit in a single tract or parcel of land may elect under section 614(c)(2) and this paragraph to treat such interest as two or more separate operating mineral interests if such mineral deposit is being developed or extracted by means of two or more mines. In order for this election to be applicable, there must be at least two mines with respect to each of which an expenditure for development or operation has been made by the taxpayer. The election under section 614(c)(2) may also be made with respect to a separate operating mineral interest formed by a previous election under section 614(c)(2) at such time as the mineral deposit previously allocated to such interest is being developed or extracted by means of two or more mines. If there is more than one mineral deposit in a single tract or parcel of land, an election under section 614(c)(2) with respect to any one of such mineral deposits has no application to the other mineral deposits. The election under section 614(c)(2) may not be made with respect to an aggregated property or with respect to any operating mineral interest which is a part of any aggregation formed by the taxpayer unless the taxpayer obtains consent from the Commissioner. Such consent will not be granted where the principal purpose for the request to make the election is based on tax consequences. Application for such consent shall be made in writing to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC 20224. The application must be accompanied by a statement setting forth in detail the reason or reasons for the request to exercise the election with respect to an aggregated property.


(2) *Allocation of mineral deposit.* If the taxpayer elects to treat a separate operating mineral interest in a mineral deposit in a single tract or parcel of land as more than one separate operating mineral interest, then all of such mineral deposit therein and all of the portion of the tract or parcel of land allocated thereto must be allocated to the newly formed separate operating mineral interests. A portion of such mineral deposit and such tract or parcel of land must be allocated to each such newly formed separate operating mineral interest. There must be at least one mine, with respect to which an expenditure for development or operation has been made by the taxpayer, with respect to each such portion. The extent of the portion to be allocated to each newly formed separate operating mineral interest is to be determined upon the basis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case.


(3) *Basis of newly formed separate operating mineral interests.* The adjusted basis of each of the separate operating mineral interests formed by the making of the election under section 614(c)(2) shall be determined by apportioning the adjusted basis of the separate operating mineral interest with respect to which such election was made between (or among) the newly formed separate operating mineral interests in the same proportion as the fair market value of each such newly formed interest (as of the date on which the election becomes effective) bears to the total fair market value of the interest with respect to which the election was made as of such date.


(4) *Aggregation of newly formed separate operating mineral interests.* Any separate operating mineral interest formed by the making of the election under section 614(c)(2) may be included as a part of an aggregation subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, provided that the time for making the election under section 614(c)(1) to include such separate operating mineral interest in such aggregation has not expired. See paragraph (f) of this section. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:


(c) *Operating mineral interest defined.* For the definition of the term *operating mineral interest* as used in this section, see paragraph (b) of § 1.614-2.


(d) *Operating unit defined.* For the definition of the term *operating unit* as used in this section, see paragraph (c) of § 1.614-2.


(e) *Mine defined.* For purposes of this section, the term *mine* means any excavation or other workings or series of related excavations or related workings, as the case may be, for the purpose of extracting any known mineral deposit except oil and gas deposits. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, the term *excavations* or *workings* includes quarries, pits, shafts, and wells (except oil and gas wells). The number of excavations or workings that constitute a mine is to be determined upon the basis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case such as the nature and position of the mineral deposit or deposits, the method of mining the mineral, the location of the excavations or other workings in relation to the mineral deposit or deposits, and the topography of the area. The determination of the taxpayer as to the composition of a mine is to be accepted unless there is a clear and convincing basis for a change in such determination.


(f) *Manner and scope of election*—(1) *Election to apply section 614(c) (1) and (2) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957.* Except as provided in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, the election under section 614(c)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section to treat an operating mineral interest as part of an aggregation shall be made under section 614(c)(3)(A) not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the taxpayer's income tax return (including extensions thereof) for whichever of the following taxable years is the later:


(i) The first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, or


(ii) The first taxable year in which any expenditure for development or operation in respect of the separate operating mineral interest is made by the taxpayer after the acquisition of such interest


(iii) The first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, or


(iv) The first taxable year in which expenditures for development or operation of more than one mine in respect of the separate operating mineral interest are made by the taxpayer after the acquisition of such interest


(2) *Election to apply section 614(c) (1) and (2) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1958.* In accordance with section 614(c)(3)(B), the election under section 614(c) (1) and paragraph (a) of this section to treat an operating mineral interest as part of an aggregation may, at the election of the taxpayer, be made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the taxpayer's income tax return (including extensions thereof) for whichever of the following taxable years is the later:


(i) The first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954, for which assessment of a deficiency or credit or refund of an overpayment, as the case may be, resulting from an election under section 614(c)(1), is not prevented on September 2, 1958, by the operation of any law or rule of law, or


(ii) The first taxable year in which any expenditure for development or operation in respect of the separate operating mineral interest is made by the taxpayer after the acquisition of such interest


(iii) The first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954, for which assessment of a deficiency or credit or refund of an overpayment, as the case may be, resulting from an election under section 614(c)(2), is not prevented on September 2, 1958, by the operation of any law or rule of law, or


(iv) The first taxable year in which expenditures for development or operation of more than one mine in respect of the separate operating mineral interest are made by the taxpayer after the acquisition of such interest


(3) *Limitation.* If the taxpayer makes an election under section 614(c) (1) or (2) in accordance with section 614(c)(3)(B) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph with respect to any operating mineral interest which constitutes part or all of an operating unit, such taxpayer may not make any election under section 614(c) (1) or (2) in accordance with section 614(c)(3)(A) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph with respect to any operating mineral interest which constitutes part or all of such operating unit. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:


(4) *Statute of limitations.* If the taxpayer makes any election in accordance with section 614(c)(3)(B) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph and if assessment of any deficiency for any taxable year resulting from such election is prevented on May 1, 1961, or at any time within one year after such first day, by the operation of any law or rule of law, such assessment may, nevertheless, be made within one year after May 1, 1961. Any election by a taxpayer in accordance with section 614(c)(3)(B) shall constitute consent to the assessment of any deficiency resulting from any such election. If refund or credit of any overpayment of income tax resulting from any election made in accordance with section 614(c)(3)(B) is prevented on May 1, 1961, or at any time within one year after May 1, 1961, by the operation of any law or rule of law, refund or credit of such overpayment may, nevertheless, be made or allowed but only if claim therefor is filed within one year after May 1, 1961. This subparagraph shall not apply with respect to any taxable year of a taxpayer for which an assessment of a deficiency resulting from an election made in accordance with section 614(c)(3)(B) or a refund or credit of an overpayment resulting from any such election, as the case may be, is prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law on September 2, 1958.


(5) *Elections—how made*—(i) *General rule.* Except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, an election under section 614(c) (1) or (2) and paragraph (a) or (b) of this section must be made by a statement attached to the income tax return of the taxpayer for the first taxable year for which the election is made. The statement shall contain the following information:


(*a*) Whether the taxpayer is making an election or elections with respect to the operating unit in accordance with section 614(c)(3) (A) or (B);


(*b*) A description of the operating unit of the taxpayer in sufficient detail to identify the operating mineral interests which are included within such operating unit;


(*c*) A description of each aggregation to be formed within the operating unit in sufficient detail to show that each aggregation consists of all the separate operating mineral interests which comprise any one mine or any two or more mines;


(*d*) A description of each separate operating mineral interest within the operating unit which is to be treated as a separate property in sufficient detail to show that such interest is not a part of any mine for which an election to aggregate has been made;


(*e*) The taxable year in which the first expenditure for development or operation was made by the taxpayer with respect to each separate operating mineral interest within the operating unit, but if the first expenditure for development or operation has not been made with respect to a separate operating mineral interest before the close of the taxable year for which the election under this section is made, such information should also be included;


(*f*) A description of each separate operating mineral interest within the operating unit which the taxpayer elects to treat as more than one such interest under section 614(c)(2) in sufficient detail to show that the separate operating mineral interest was not a part of an aggregation formed by the taxpayer under section 614(c)(1) for any taxable year prior to the taxable year for which the election under section 614(c)(2) is made, and to show that the mineral deposit representing the separate operating mineral interest is being developed or extracted by means of two or more mines;


(*g*) The taxable year in which the first expenditure for development or operation was made by the taxpayer with respect to each mine on the separate operating mineral interest that the taxpayer is electing to treat as more than one such interest; and


(*h*) The allocation of the mineral deposit representing the separate operating mineral interest between (or among) the newly formed interests and the method by which such allocation was made


(ii) *Special rule.* If the last day prescribed by law for filing the taxpayer's income tax return (including extensions thereof) for the first taxable year for which an election under section 614(c) (1) or (2) is made falls before May 1, 1961, the statement of election or modification thereof for such taxable year must be filed on or before May 1, 1961, with the district director for the district in which such return was filed. The statement must contain the information as required in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, must indicate the first taxable year for which the election contained therein is made, and shall be accompanied by an amended return or returns if necessary or, if appropriate, a claim for refund or credit.


(6) *Elections; when effective.* If the taxpayer has elected to form an aggregation under section 614(c)(1) and this section, the date on which the aggregation becomes effective is the first day of the first taxable year for which the election is made; except that if any separate operating mineral interest included in such aggregation was acquired after such first day, the date on which the inclusion of such interest in such aggregation becomes effective is the date of its acquisition. If the taxpayer elects to add another operating mineral interest to such aggregation for a subsequent taxable year, the date on which aggregation of the additional interest becomes effective is the first day of such subsequent taxable year or the date of acquisition of such interest, whichever is later. If an operating mineral interest is required to be included in the aggregation for a subsequent taxable year because such interest becomes a part of a mine which the taxpayer has previously elected to aggregate, the date on which the inclusion of such interest in the aggregation becomes effective is the first day of the subsequent taxable year or the date of acquisition of such interest, whichever is later. If the taxpayer has elected to treat a separate operating mineral interest as more than one such interest, the date on which the election becomes effective is the first day of the first taxable year for which the election is made or the earliest date on which the first expenditure for development or operation has been made by the taxpayer with respect to a mine on each newly formed separate operating mineral interest, whichever is later.


(7) *Elections; binding effect.* A valid election under section 614(c) (1) or (2) whether made in accordance with section 614(c)(3) (A) or (B) shall be binding upon the taxpayer for the taxable year for which made and for all subsequent taxable years unless consent to change the treatment of an operating mineral interest with respect to which an election has been made is obtained from the Commissioner. For rules relating to the binding effect of an election where the basis of a separate or an aggregated property in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to the basis in the hands of the transferor, see paragraph (c) of § 1.614-6. A taxpayer can neither include within an aggregation a separate operating mineral interest which he has previously elected to treat as a separate property, nor exclude from an aggregation a separate operating mineral interest which he has properly elected to include within such aggregation unless consent to do so is obtained from the Commissioner. A change in tax consequences alone is not sufficient to obtain consent to change the treatment of an operating mineral interest. However, consent may be appropriate where, for example, there has been a substantial change in the taxpayer's operations so that a major part of an aggregation becomes a part of another operating unit. Applications for consent shall be made in writing to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC 20224. The application must be accompanied by a statement indicating the reason or reasons for the change and furnishing the information required in subparagraph (5)(i) of this paragraph, unless such information has been previously filed and is current.


(8) *Invalid aggregations*—(i) *General rule.* In addition to aggregations which are invalid under this section because of the failure to make timely elections, aggregations may be invalid under this section in situations which may be divided into two general categories. The first category involves invalid basic aggregations. The second category involves invalid additions to basic aggregations.


(ii) *Invalid basic aggregations.* The term *invalid basic aggregations* refers to aggregations which are initially invalid. Generally, a basic aggregation is initially invalid because it does not include all the separate operating mineral interests which comprise a complete mine or mines or because it includes separate operating mineral interests which are not part of the same operating unit. If the taxpayer makes an invalid basic aggregation, each of the separate operating mineral interests included in such aggregation shall be treated as a separate property for the first taxable year for which the election is made and for all subsequent taxable years unless consent is obtained from the Commissioner to treat any such interest in a different manner. Consent will be granted in appropriate cases. For example, assume that the taxpayer elects to form an aggregation of the operating mineral interests which comprise one or more complete mines. If the taxpayer demonstrates that he inadvertently failed to include a minor part of one of the aggregated mines or inadvertently included a minor part of another mine that is not a part of the aggregation, consent will ordinarily be granted to maintain the aggregation by including the part omitted or by excluding the part included. The provisions of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:


(iii) *Invalid additions.* The term *invalid addition* refers to an operating mineral interest which is invalidly aggregated with an existing aggregation. Generally, an addition is invalid because it is a part of a mine and is aggregated with an aggregation which does not include other interests which are parts of the same mine, or because it is in one operating unit and is included as part of an aggregation which is in another operating unit. If an invalid addition is properly a part of a mine with respect to which other interests have been validly aggregated for a taxable year prior to the first taxable year for which the election to aggregate the invalid addition is made, then the invalid addition shall be included in the aggregation of which it is properly a part for such first taxable year and all subsequent taxable years. Any other invalid addition shall be treated as a separate property for the first taxable year for which the election to aggregate such addition is made and for all subsequent taxable years unless consent is obtained from the Commissioner to treat any such interest in a different manner. The provisions of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:


(g) *Special rule as to deductions under section 615(a) prior to aggregation*—(1) *General rule.* If an aggregation of operating mineral interests under section 614(c)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section includes any interest or interests in respect of which exploration expenditures, paid or incurred after the acquisition of such interest or interests, were deducted by the taxpayer under section 615(a) for any taxable year which precedes the date on which such aggregation becomes effective, then the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code for the taxable year or years in which such exploration expenditures were so deducted shall be recomputed in accordance with the rules contained in this paragraph. If an operating mineral interest is added to such aggregation for a subsequent taxable year and exploration expenditures made with respect to such interest after its acquisition were deducted by the taxpayer under section 615(a) for any taxable year which precedes the date on which the aggregation of such additional interest becomes effective, then the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for the taxable year or years in which such exploration expenditures were so deducted shall be recomputed. For purposes of this paragraph, such taxable year or years shall be referred to as the taxable year or years for which a recomputation is required to be made. See paragraph (f)(6) of this section for rules relating to the date on which an aggregation becomes effective or the date on which the aggregation of an additional interest to an aggregation becomes effective. See subparagraph (3) of this paragraph for rules relating to the method of recomputation of tax. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(2) *Exceptions*—(i) *Taxable years beginning before January 1, 1958.* In the case of exploration expenditures deducted by the taxpayer with respect to an operating mineral interest for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1958, subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall apply only if the taxpayer has made an election under section 614(c) (1) or (2) with respect to the operating unit of which such interest is a part and such election applies to the taxable year for which such exploration expenditures were deducted. Thus, if the taxpayer does not make an election with respect to the operating unit under section 614(c) (1) or (2) and (3)(B), subparagraph (1) of this paragraph does not apply in the case of exploration expenditures deducted with respect to any operating mineral interest which is a part of such operating unit for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1958. The provisions of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:


(ii) *Interests formed pursuant to an election under section 614(c)(2).* In the case of exploration expenditures deducted with respect to an operating mineral interest which the taxpayer elects to treat as more than one such interest under section 614(c)(2) and paragraph (b) of this section, subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not apply. Thus, if the taxpayer deducts exploration expenditures with respect to an operating mineral interest, subsequently elects to treat such interest as more than one interest under section 614(c)(2), and includes one of the newly formed interests in an aggregation under section 614(c)(1), subparagraph (1) of this paragraph does not apply in the case of the exploration expenditures deducted with respect to the interest which the taxpayer elected to treat as more than one interest. The provisions of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:


(3) *Recomputation of tax*—(i) *General rule.* In the case of an aggregation formed under section 614(c)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section in respect of which a recomputation of tax is required to be made under the provisions of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph for any taxable year or years, the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 shall be recomputed for each such taxable year as if:


(*a*) The taxpayer had elected to form an aggregation for the taxable year for which the recomputation is required to be made, and


(*b*) Such aggregation had included all the interests included in the aggregation formed under section 614(c)(1) except those interests which the taxpayer did not own during the taxable year for which the recomputation is required to be made and those interests in respect of which the taxpayer had made no expenditures for exploration, development, or operation before or during the taxable year for which the recomputation is required to be made


(*c*) The taxpayer had elected to form an aggregation for the taxable year for which the recomputation is required to be made, and


(*d*) Such aggregation had included all the interests included in the aggregation formed under section 614(c)(1) (including any interest which the taxpayer had disposed of prior to the date on which the aggregation of the additional interest becomes effective) except those interests which the taxpayer did not own during the taxable year for which the recomputation is required to be made and those interests in respect of which the taxpayer had made no expenditures for exploration, development, or operation before or during the taxable year for which the recomputation is required to be made


(ii) *Recomputation of depletion allowance.* The taxpayer shall compute the depletion allowance with respect to the constructed aggregated property for the taxable year for which the recomputation is required to be made. In making this computation, cost depletion for such taxable year shall be computed with reference to the depletion unit for the constructed aggregated property. See paragraph (a) of § 1.611-2. Percentage depletion for such taxable year shall not exceed 50 percent of the taxable income from the constructed aggregated property computed in accordance with § 1.613-5. If a recomputation is required to be made for the same taxable year with respect to any other aggregation or aggregations formed by the taxpayer under section 614(c)(1), the depletion allowance with respect to the other constructed aggregated property or properties shall be similarly computed. If, for a taxable year in respect of which a recomputation is required, the sum of the depletion allowance or allowances as computed under this subdivision is less than the sum of the depletion allowance or allowances actually deducted for such taxable year with respect to all the properties required to be taken into account in making the computation under this subdivision, then the total depletion allowance deducted by the taxpayer for such taxable year shall be reduced by the difference. The taxable income or net operating loss of the taxpayer for such taxable year shall be adjusted to reflect such reduction for purposes of the recomputation of tax. However, if for a taxable year in respect of which a recomputation is required, the sum of the depletion allowance or allowances as computed under this subdivision exceeds the sum of the depletion allowance or allowances actually deducted for such taxable year with respect to all the properties required to be taken into account in making the computation under this subdivision, the recomputation of tax for such taxable year is disregarded for purposes of applying section 614(c)(4) (B), (C), and (D).


(iii) *Effect of recomputation with respect to items based on amount of income.* In making the recomputation of tax under this subparagraph for any taxable year, any deduction, credit, or other allowance which is based upon the adjusted gross income or taxable income of the taxpayer for such year shall be recomputed taking into account the adjustment required under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. For example, if a corporate taxpayer's taxable income is increased under the provisions of such subdivision, then the amount of charitable contributions which may be deducted under the limitation contained in section 170(b)(2) shall be correspondingly increased for purposes of the recomputation. Moreover, the effect that the recomputation of any deduction, credit, or other allowance for a taxable year has on the tax imposed for any other taxable year shall also be taken into account for purposes of the recomputation of tax under this subparagraph. Any change in items of tax preferences (as defined in section 57 and the regulations thereunder) must also be taken into account for purposes of the recomputation under this subparagraph.


(iv) *Effect of recomputation with respect to a net operating loss and a net operating loss deduction.* If the recomputation of tax under this subparagraph for the taxable year for which the recomputation is required to be made results in a reduction of a net operating loss for such year, then the taxpayer shall take into account the effect of such reduction on the tax imposed by chapter I of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (or by corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) for any taxable year affected by such reduction. If the recomputation of tax for the taxable year for which the recomputation is required to be made results in an increase in taxable income as defined in section 172(b)(2) for such year, then the taxpayer shall take into account the effect of such increase on the tax imposed by chapter I of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (or by corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) for any taxable year affected by such increase. Furthermore, in making the recomputation of tax for any taxable year for which the recomputation is required to be made, the taxpayer shall take into account any change in the net operating loss deduction for such year resulting from the recomputation of tax for any other taxable year for which a recomputation is required to be made. For provisions relating to the net operating loss deduction, see section 172 and the regulations thereunder. For rules relating to the effect of the net operating loss deduction on the minimum tax for tax preferences see section 56 and the regulations thereunder and § 1.58-7.


(v) *Determination of increase in tax.* If the taxpayer elects to form an aggregation or aggregations for a taxable year under section 614(c)(1) and if a recomputation of tax is required to be made under this paragraph for any prior taxable year or years, then the taxpayer shall compute the difference between the tax, including the tax imposed by section 56 (relating to the minimum tax for tax preferences), as recomputed under this subparagraph for such prior taxable year or years (and other taxable years affected by the recomputation) and the tax liability previously determined (computed without regard to section 614(c)(4)) with respect to such prior taxable year or years (and other taxable years affected by the recomputation). If the taxpayer is subsequently required to make a recomputation with respect to any taxable year or years for which he has previously made a recomputation, then the taxpayer shall compute the difference between the tax as subsequently recomputed for such taxable year or years (and other taxable years affected by the subsequent recomputation) and the tax as previously recomputed for such taxable year or years (and other taxable years affected by the subsequent recomputation). For treatment of the increase in tax resulting from the recomputation of tax under this subparagraph, see subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.


(4) *Treatment of increase in tax*—(i) *General rule.* If the taxpayer elects to form an aggregation or aggregations for a taxable year under section 614(c)(1) and if a recomputation of tax is required to be made for any prior taxable year or years, then the total increase in tax resulting from such recomputation determined under subparagraph (3)(v) of this paragraph shall be taken into account in the first taxable year to which the election to form such aggregation or aggregations is applicable and in each succeeding taxable year until the full amount of such total increase in tax has been taken into account. The number of taxable years over which such total increase shall be taken into account shall be equal to the number of taxable years for which a recomputation of tax is required to be made under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph as limited by subparagraph (2) of this paragraph and for which such recomputation results in a reduction of the taxpayer's depletion allowance under subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph. The amount of the increase in tax which is to be taken into account in a taxable year is determined by dividing the total increase in tax by the number of taxable years over which such total increase is to be taken into account. The tax imposed by chapter I of the Code for each of the taxable years over which the total increase in tax is to be taken into account shall be increased by the amount determined in accordance with the preceding sentence. However, such increase in tax for each of such taxable years shall have no effect upon the determination of the amount of any credit against the tax for any of such taxable years. For example, the amount of such increase shall not affect the computation of the limitation on the foreign tax credit under section 904. The amount of the increase in tax which is required to be taken into account by the taxpayer in a particular taxable year under section 614(c)(4)(C) shall be treated as a tax imposed with respect to such taxable years even though, without regard to section 614(c)(4) and this paragraph, such taxpayer would otherwise have no tax liability for such taxable year.


(ii) *Increase in tax not determinable as of first taxable year of aggregation.* If the recomputation of tax under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, for any taxable year or years prior to the first taxable year to which the election to form an aggregation or aggregations under section 614(c)(1) applies, results in a reduction of any net operating loss carryover to a taxable year subsequent to such first taxable year, then the total increase in tax resulting from the recomputation is not determinable as of such first taxable year. In such case, the total increase in tax shall be taken into account in equal installments in the first taxable year for which such total increase is determinable and in each succeeding taxable year for which a portion of the increase in tax would have been taken into account under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph if the total increase had been determinable as of the first taxable year to which the election to form the aggregation or aggregations under section 614(c)(1) applies. The provisions of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:


(iii) *Death or cessation of existence of taxpayer.* If the taxpayer dies or ceases to exist, the portion of the increase in tax determined under subparagraph (3)(v) of this paragraph which has not been taken into account under subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph for taxable years prior to the taxable year of the occurrence of such death or such cessation of existence, as the case may be, shall be taken into account for the taxable year in which such death or such cessation of existence, as the case may be, occurs.


(5) *Adjustments to basis of aggregated property.* If the taxpayer elects to form an aggregated property or properties under section 614(c)(1) for a taxable year and if a recomputation of tax is required to be made for any taxable year which results in reduction of the depletion allowance previously deducted by the taxpayer for such year, then proper adjustments shall be made with respect to the adjusted basis of such aggregated property or properties. In such a case:


(i) If the sum of the depletion allowances actually deducted with respect to the interests included in a constructed aggregated property exceeds the depletion allowance computed under subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph with respect to such constructed aggregated property, the adjusted basis of the aggregated property formed under section 614(c)(1) shall be increased by such excess, and


(ii) If the depletion allowance computed under subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph with respect to a constructed aggregated property exceeds the sum of the depletion allowances actually deducted with respect to the interests included in such constructed aggregated property, the adjusted basis of the aggregated property formed under section 614(c)(1) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by such excess.
