# § 1.614-6   Rules applicable to basis, holding period, and abandonment losses where mineral interests have been aggregated or combined.

(a) *Basis of property resulting from aggregation or combination*—(1) *General rule.* (i) When a taxpayer has aggregated as one property two or more interests under section 614(b) (prior to its amendment by section 226(a) of the Revenue Act of 1964), (c), or (e), the unadjusted basis of such aggregated property shall be the sum of the unadjusted bases of the various mineral interests aggregated. The adjusted basis of the aggregated property on the effective date of the aggregation shall be the unadjusted basis of the aggregated property, adjusted by the total of all adjustments to the bases of the several mineral interests aggregated as required by section 1016 to the effective date of aggregation. Thereafter, the adjustments to basis required by section 1016 shall apply to the total adjusted basis of the aggregated property for all purposes of subtitle A of the Code.


(ii) When a taxpayer has combined as one property two or more interests under section 614(b) (as amended by section 226(a) of the Revenue Act of 1964), the adjusted basis of such combined property shall be the sum of:


(*a*) The unadjusted bases of all such interests which have never been included in an aggregation; and


(*b*) The adjusted bases of all such interests which at some time have been included in an aggregation, as of the date on which they ceased to participate in an aggregation


(*c*) In the case of interests described in (*a*), for the entire period of the taxpayer's ownership of such interest; and


(*d*) In the case of interests described in (*b*), for the period, if any, between the time of deaggregation and the time of combination.


(2) *Bases upon disposition of part of, or termination of, or change in, an aggregated or combined property*—(i) *In general.* (*a*) When a taxpayer has aggregated or combined two or more separate mineral interests as one property under section 614(b) (either before or after its amendment by section 226(a) of the Revenue Act of 1964), (c), or (e) and thereafter sells, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of part of such property, the total adjusted basis of the property as of the date of sale, exchange, or other disposition shall be apportioned to determine the adjusted basis of the part disposed of and the part retained for purposes of computing gain or loss, depletion and for all other purposes of subtitle A of the Code. Such adjusted basis shall be determined by apportioning the total adjusted basis of the property between the part of the property disposed of and the part retained in the same proportion as the fair market value of each part (as of the date of sale, exchange, or other disposition) bears to the total fair market value of the property as of such date. For determining gain or loss on the sale or exchange of any part of the aggregated or combined property, the adjusted basis of the aggregated or combined property (from which the adjusted basis of the part is determined) shall not be reduced below zero.


(*b*) If, for any taxable year after the first taxable year for which an aggregation under section 614(b) (prior to its amendment by section 226(a) of the Revenue Act of 1964), (c), or (e) is effective:


(*1*) Any such aggregation is terminated for any reason other than the expiration of an aggregation by reason of section 614(b) as amended by section 226(a) of the Revenue Act of 1964 (see subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph), or


(*2*) The treatment of any mineral interests in any such aggregation is changed after obtaining the consent of the Commissioner


(ii) *Allocation of basis of aggregation of operating mineral interests in oil and gas wells as of the first day of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963—(a) Fair market value method.* Unless the taxpayer elects to use the allocation of adjustments method of determining basis provided in (b) of this subdivision (ii), the adjusted basis as of the first day of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, of each interest which was participating in an aggregation of operating mineral interests on the day preceding such first day shall be determined by multiplying the adjusted basis of the aggregation by a fraction the numerator of which is the fair market value of such interest and the denominator of which is the fair market value of such aggregation. For purposes of this subdivision (*a*), the adjusted basis and the fair market value of the aggregation, and the fair market value of such interest, shall be determined as of the day preceding the first day of the first taxable year which begins after December 31, 1963. Unless the taxpayer elects to use the allocation of adjustments method, he shall obtain accurate and reliable information, and keep records with respect thereto, establishing all facts necessary for making the computation prescribed in this subdivision (*a*). See example 5 of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.


(*b) Allocation of adjustments method. (i*) The taxpayer may elect to determine basis by an allocation of adjustments in lieu of the fair market value method prescribed in (*a*) of this subdivision (ii). In such a case, the adjusted basis (as of the first day of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963) of each interest which was participating in an aggregation of operating mineral interests on the day preceding such first day is the unadjusted basis of such interest immediately after its acquisition by the taxpayer, adjusted by the total of all adjustments to its basis as required by section 1016 to the effective date of aggregation, and by that portion of those section 1016 adjustments to the basis of the aggregation which is reasonably attributable to such interest. For this purpose, two or more interests which are being combined upon deaggregation shall be treated as one interest. An adjustment to the basis of the aggregation is reasonably attributable to such interest to the extent that the adjustment thereto resulted from inclusion of the interest in the aggregation, even though such interest would not have been entitled to the adjustment to the same extent if such interest had been treated separately because of the 50 percent of taxable income limitation or for any other reason. In a case in which the amount of a percentage depletion deduction which was allowed with respect to an aggregation was limited by the 50 percent of taxable income limitation of section 613(a), the portion of such amount which is attributable to each of the interests in the aggregation shall be determined by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the gross income from such interest and the denominator of which is the gross income from the aggregation. The determination as to which property a particular adjustment is attributable may be based upon records of production or any other facts which establish the reasonableness of the determination. See example 6 of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.


(*ii*) If, under the adjustment described in (*i*) of this subdivision (*b*), the total of the adjusted bases of the interests which were included in the aggregation exceeds the adjusted basis of the aggregation, the adjusted bases of the interests shall be further adjusted so that the total of the adjusted bases of the interests equals the adjusted basis of the aggregation. This further adjustment shall be made by reducing the basis of each interest (other than an interest having a basis of zero) by an amount which is determined by multiplying such excess by a fraction, the numerator of which is the adjusted basis of such interest after making the adjustment described in (*i*) of this subdivision (*b*) and the denominator of which is the total of the adjusted bases of all such interests after making the adjustment described in (*i*) of this subdivision (*b*). See example 6 of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.


(*iii*) The election provided for in this subdivision (*b*) shall be made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the taxpayer's income tax return (including extensions thereof) for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, and shall be made in a statement attached to such return.


(3) The application of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(4) *Basis for gain and loss where mineral interests acquired before March 1, 1913, are included in an aggregation.* Where mineral interests acquired before March 1, 1913, are included in an aggregation under section 614 (b), (c), or (e), the aggregated property has two bases, one for the determination of gain and another for the determination of loss upon the disposition of the whole or a part of the aggregated property. For the purpose of determining gain, the adjusted basis of the aggregated property on the effective date of aggregation shall be the sum of:


(i) The unadjusted bases of those mineral interests acquired on or after March 1, 1913, plus


(ii) The cost of any interest acquired before March 1, 1913 (adjusted for the period before March 1, 1913), or the fair market value of such interest as of March 1, 1913, whichever is greater


(iii) The unadjusted bases of those mineral interests acquired on or after March 1, 1913, plus


(iv) The cost of those interests acquired before March 1, 1913, adjusted for the period before March 1, 1913


(5) *Basis for gain and loss where mineral interests acquired before March 1, 1913, are included in a combination and one or more of such interests have not previously been included in an aggregation.* Where mineral interests acquired before March 1, 1913, are included in a combination under section 614(b) and § 1.614-8 and one or more of such interests have not previously been included in an aggregation, the combined property has two bases, one for the determination of gain and another for the determination of loss upon the disposition of the whole or a part of the combined property. For the purpose of determining gain, the adjusted basis of the combined property on the effective date of combination shall be the sum of:


(i) The adjusted bases at the time of deaggregation, as determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, of all interests which have previously been included in an aggregation,


(ii) The unadjusted bases of other mineral interests acquired on or after March 1, 1913, and


(iii) The cost of each other interest acquired before March 1, 1913 (adjusted for the period before March 1, 1913), or the fair market value of such interest as of March 1, 1913, whichever is greater


(iv) The adjusted bases at the time of deaggregation, as determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, of all interests which have previously been included in an aggregation.


(v) The unadjusted bases of other mineral interests acquired on or after March 1, 1913, and


(vi) The cost of other mineral interests acquired before March 1, 1913, adjusted for the period before March 1, 1913


(b) *Holding period of aggregated or combined properties.* Where a taxpayer sells or exchanges either a part or all of an aggregated or combined property which includes part or all of a mineral interest which the taxpayer has held for (1 year 6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) or less, the sales price and adjusted basis attributable to the interest sold must be apportioned in proportion to the relative fair market values as of the date of sale to determine the amount of income represented by the sale of property held for (1 year 6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) or less. The application of this rule may be illustrated by the following example:


(c) *Acquisition of property with transferor's basis.* If a separate property or an aggregated or combined property is acquired in a transaction in which the basis of such property in the hands of the taxpayer is determined by reference to the basis of such property in the hands of a transferor, then the election of such transferor as to the treatment of such separate, aggregated, or combined property shall be binding upon the taxpayer for all taxable years ending after the transfer unless, in the case of an aggregation, the aggregation terminates or consent to make a change is obtained under paragraph (d) (4) of § 1.614-2, paragraph (f) (7) of § 1.614-3, or paragraph (b) (3) or (e) (5) of § 1.614-5, whichever is applicable.


(d) *Abandonment and casualty losses.* In the case of mineral interests which are aggregated or combined as one property, no losses resulting from worthlessness or abandonment are allowable until all the mineral rights in the entire aggregated or combined property are proven to be worthless or until the entire aggregated or combined property is disposed of or abandoned. Casualty losses are allowable in accordance with the rules applicable to casualty losses in general. For rules applicable to losses in general, see section 165 and the regulations thereunder.
