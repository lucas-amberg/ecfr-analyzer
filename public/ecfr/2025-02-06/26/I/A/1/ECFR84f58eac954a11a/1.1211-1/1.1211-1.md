# § 1.1211-1   Limitation on capital losses.

(a) *Corporations*—(1) *General rule.* In the case of a corporation, there shall be allowed as a deduction an amount equal to the sum of:


(i) Losses sustained during the taxable year from sales or exchanges of capital assets, plus


(ii) The aggregate of all losses sustained in other taxable years which are treated as a short-term capital loss in such taxable year pursuant to section 1212(a)(1),


(2) *Banks.* See section 582(c) for modification of the limitation under section 1211(a) in the case of a bank, as defined in section 581.


(b) *Taxpayers other than corporations*—(1) *General rule.* In the case of a taxpayer other than a corporation, there shall be allowed as a deduction an amount equal to the sum of:


(i) Losses sustained during the taxable year from sales or exchanges of capital assets, plus


(ii) The aggregate of all losses sustained in other taxable years which are treated either as a short-term capital loss or as a long-term capital loss in such taxable year pursuant to section 1212(b), but only to the extent of gains from sales or exchanges of capital assets in such taxable year, plus (if such losses exceed such gains) the additional allowance or transitional additional allowance deductible under section 1211(b) from ordinary income for such taxable year. The additional allowance deductible under section 1211(b) shall be determined by application of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, and the transitional additional allowance by application of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.


(2) *Additional allowance.* Except as otherwise provided by subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, the additional allowance deductible under section 1211(b) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, shall be the least of:


(i) The taxable income for the taxable year reduced, but not below zero, by the zero bracket amount (in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977, the taxable income for the taxable year);


(ii) $3,000 ($2,000 for taxable years beginning in 1977; $1,000 for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977); or


(iii) The sum of the excess of the net short-term capital loss over the net long-term capital gain, plus one-half of the excess of the net long-term capital loss over the net short-term capital gain.


(3) *Transitional additional allowance*—(i) *In general.* If, pursuant to the provisions of § 1.1212-1(b) and subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, there is carried to the taxable year from a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970, a long-term capital loss, and if for the taxable year there is an excess of net long-term capital loss over net short-term capital gain, then, in lieu of the additional allowance provided by subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the transitional additional allowance deductible under section 1211(b) shall be the least of:


(*a*) The taxable income for the taxable year reduced, but not below zero, by the zero bracket amount (in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977, the taxable income for the taxable year);


(*b*) $3,000 ($2,000 for taxable years beginning in 1977; $1,000 for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977); or


(*c*) The sum of the excess of the net short-term capital loss over the net long-term capital gain; that portion of the excess of the net long-term capital loss over the net short-term capital gain computed as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph; plus one-half of the remaining portion of the excess of the net long-term capital loss over the net short-term capital gain.


(ii) *Computation of specially treated portion of excess long-term capital loss over net short-term capital gain.* In determining the transitional additional allowance deductible as provided by this subparagraph, there shall be applied thereto in full on a dollar-for-dollar basis the excess of net long-term capital loss over net short-term capital gain (computed with regard to capital losses carried to the taxable year) to the extent that the long-term capital losses carried to the taxable year from taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970, as provided by § 1.1212-1(b) and subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, exceed the sum of (*a*) the portion of the capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) actually realized in the taxable year (i.e., computed without regard to capital losses carried to the taxable year) which consists of net long-term capital gain actually realized in the taxable year, plus (*b*) the amount by which the portion of the capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) actually realized in the taxable year (i.e., computed without regard to capital losses carried to the taxable year) which consists of net short-term capital gain actually realized in the taxable year exceeds the total of short-term capital losses carried to the taxable year from taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970, as provided by § 1.1212-1(b) and subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph.


(iii) *Carryover of certain long-term capital losses not utilized in computation of transitional additional allowance.* If for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, the transitional net long-term capital loss component determined as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph exceeds the amount of such component applied to the transitional additional allowance for the taxable year as provided by subdivision (i) of this subparagraph and subparagraph (4)(ii) of this paragraph, then such excess shall for the purposes of this subparagraph be carried to the succeeding taxable year as long-term capital losses from taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970, for utilization in the computation of the transitional additional allowance in the succeeding taxable year as provided in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph. In no event, however, shall the amount of such component carried to the following taxable year as otherwise provided by this subdivision exceed the total of net long-term capital losses actually carried to such succeeding taxable year pursuant to section 1212(b) and § 1.1212-1(b).


(iv) *Carryover of certain short-term capital losses not utilized in computation of additional allowance or transitional additional allowance.* If for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, the total short-term capital losses carried to such year from taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970, as provided by § 1.1212-1(b) and this subdivision exceed the sum of:


(*a*) The portion of the capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) actually realized in the taxable year (i.e., computed without regard to capital losses carried to the taxable year) which consists of net short-term capital gain actually realized in the taxable year, plus


(*b*) The amount by which the portion of the capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) actually realized in the taxable year (i.e., computed without regard to capital losses carried to the taxable year) which consists of net long-term capital gain actually realized in the taxable year exceeds the total long-term capital losses carried to the taxable year from taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970, as provided in § 1.1212-1(b) and subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph,


(v) *Scope of rules.* The rules provided by this subparagraph are for the purpose of computing the amount of the transitional additional allowance deductible for the taxable year pursuant to the provisions of section 1212(b)(3) and this subparagraph. More specifically, their operation permits the limited use of a long-term capital loss carried to the taxable year from a taxable year beginning before December 31, 1969, in full on a dollar-for-dollar basis in computing the transitional additional allowance deductible for the taxable year. These rules have no application to, or effect upon, a determination of the character or amount of capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) reportable in the taxable year. See paragraph (b)(1) of this section and § 1.1212-1 for the determination of the amount and character of capital gains and losses reportable in the taxable year. Further, except to the extent that their application may affect the amount of the transitional additional allowance deductible for the taxable year and thus the amount to be treated as short-term capital loss for carryover purposes under section 1212(b) and § 1.1212-1(b)(2), these rules have no effect upon a determination of the character or amount of capital losses carried to or from the taxable year pursuant to section 1212(b) and § 1.1212-1(b).


(4) *Order of application of capital losses to additional allowance or transitional additional allowance.* In applying the excess of the net short-term capital loss over the net long-term capital gain and the excess of the net long-term capital loss over the net short-term capital gain to the additional allowance or transitional additional allowance deductible under section 1211(b) and this paragraph, such excesses shall, subject to the limitations of subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph, be used in the following order:


(i) First, there shall be applied to the additional allowance or transitional additional allowance the excess, if any, of the net short-term capital loss over the net long-term capital gain.


(ii) Second, if such transitional additional allowance exceeds the amount so applied thereto as provided in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, there shall next be applied thereto as provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph the excess, if any, of the net long-term capital loss over the net short-term capital gain to the extent of the transitional net long-term capital loss component for the taxable year computed as provided by subdivision (ii) of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.


(iii) Third, if such additional allowance or transitional additional allowance exceeds the sum of the amounts so applied thereto as provided in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, there shall be applied thereto one-half of the balance, if any, of the excess net long-term capital loss not applied pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.


(5) *Taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1970.* For any taxable year beginning prior to January 1, 1970, subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph shall not apply and losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets shall be allowed as a deduction only to the extent of gains from such sales or exchanges, plus (if such losses exceed such gains) the taxable income of the taxpayer or $1,000, whichever is smaller.


(6) *Special rules.* (i) For purposes of section 1211(b) and this paragraph, taxable income is to be computed without regard to gains or losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets and without regard to the deductions provided in section 151 (relating to personal exemptions) or any deduction in lieu thereof. For example, the deductions available to estates and trusts under section 642(b) are in lieu of the deductions allowed under section 151, and, in the case of estates and trusts, are to be added back to taxable income for the purposes of section 1211(b) and this paragraph.


(ii) For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, in case the tax is computed under section 3 and the regulations thereunder (relating to optional tax tables for individuals), the term *taxable income* as used in section 1211(b) and this paragraph shall be read as *adjusted gross income.*

(iii) In the case of a joint return, the limitation under section 1211(b) and this paragraph, relating to the allowance of losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets, is to be computed and the net capital loss determined with respect to the combined taxable income and the combined capital gains and losses of the spouses.


(7) *Married taxpayers filing separate returns*—(i) *In general.* In the case of a husband or a wife who files a separate return for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, the $3,000, $2,000, and $1,000 amounts specified in subparagraphs (2)(ii) and (3)(i)(*b*) of this paragraph shall instead be $1,500, $1,000, and $500, respectively.


(ii) *Special rule.* If, pursuant to the provisions of § 1.1212-1(b) and subparagraph (3) (iii) or (iv) of this paragraph, there is carried to the taxable year from a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970, a short-term capital loss or a long-term capital loss, the $1,500, $1,000 and $500 amounts specified in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall instead be maximum amounts of $3,000, $2,000, and $1,000 respectively, equal to $1,500, $1,000, and $500, respectively, plus the total of the transitional net long-term capital loss component for the taxable year computed as provided by subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph and the transitional net short-term capital loss component for the taxable year computed as provided by subparagraph (3)(iv) of this paragraph.
