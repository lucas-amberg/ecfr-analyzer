# § 1.1212-1   Capital loss carryovers and carrybacks.

(a) *Corporations; other taxpayers for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964*—(1) *Regular net capital loss sustained for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970.* (i) A corporation sustaining a net capital loss for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970, and a taxpayer other than a corporation sustaining a net capital loss for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1964, shall carry over such net loss to each of the 5 succeeding taxable years and treat it in each of such 5 succeeding taxable years as a short-term capital loss to the extent not allowed as a deduction against any net capital gains (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976) of any taxable years intervening between the taxable year in which the net capital loss was sustained and the taxable year to which carried. The carryover is thus applied in each succeeding taxable year to offset any net capital gain in such succeeding taxable year. The amount of the capital loss carryover may not be included in computing a new net capital loss of a taxable year which can be carried over to the next 5 succeeding taxable years. For purposes of this subparagraph, a net capital gain (capital gain net income for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976) shall be computed without regard to capital loss carryovers or carrybacks. In the case of nonresident alien individuals, see section 871 for special rules on capital loss carryovers. For the rules applicable to the portion of a net capital loss of a corporation which is attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss sustained in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1958, see subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. For the rules applicable to a taxpayer other than a corporation in the treatment of that amount of a net capital loss which may be carried over under section 1212 and this subparagraph as a short-term capital loss to the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, see paragraph (b) of this section.


(ii) The practical operation of the provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:


(2) *Corporations sustaining foreign expropriation capital losses for taxable years ending after December 31, 1958*—(i) *In general.* A corporation sustaining a net capital loss for any taxable year ending after December 31, 1958, any portion of which is attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss, shall carry over such portion of the loss to each of the ten succeeding taxable years and treat it in each of such succeeding taxable years as a short-term capital loss to the extent and consistent with the manner provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. For such purposes, the portion of any net capital loss for any taxable year which is attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss is the amount, not in excess of the net capital loss for such year, of the foreign expropriation capital loss for such year. The portion of a net capital loss for any taxable year which is attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss shall be treated as a separate net capital loss for that year and shall be applied, after first applying the remaining portion of such net capital loss, to offset any capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) in a succeeding taxable year. In applying net capital losses of two or more taxable years to offset the capital gain net income (net capital gain(s) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) of a subsequent taxable year, such net capital losses shall be offset against such capital gain net income (net capital gain(s) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) in the order of the taxable years in which the losses were sustained, beginning with the loss for the earliest preceding taxable year, even though one or more of such net capital losses are attributable in whole or in part to a foreign expropriation capital loss.


(ii) *Foreign expropriation capital loss defined.* For purposes of this subaparagraph the term *foreign expropriation capital loss* means, for any taxable year, the sum of the losses taken into account in computing the net capital loss for such year which are:


(*a*) Losses sustained directly by reason of the expropriation, intervention, seizure, or similar taking of property by the government of any foreign country, any political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of the foregoing, or


(*b*) Losses (treated under section 165 (g)(1) as losses from the sale or exchange of capital assets) from securities which become worthless by reason of the expropriation, intervention, seizure, or similar taking of property by the government of any foreign country, any political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of the foregoing.


(iii) *Illustrations.* The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(3) *Regular net capital loss sustained by a corporation for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969*—(i) *General rule.* A corporation sustaining a net capital loss for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969 (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as the *loss year*), shall:


(*a*) Carry back such net capital loss to each of the 3 taxable years preceding the loss year, but only to the extent that such net capital loss is not attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss and the carryback of such net capital loss does not increase or produce a net operating loss (as defined in section 172(c)) for the taxable year to which it is carried back; and


(*b*) Carry over such net capital loss to each of the 5 taxable years succeeding the loss year,


(ii) *Amount treated as a short-term capital loss in each year.* The entire amount of the net capital loss for any loss year shall be carried to the earliest of the taxable years to which such net capital loss may be carried, and the portion of such net capital loss which shall be carried to each of the other taxable years to which such net capital loss may be carried shall be the excess, if any, of such net capital loss over the total of the capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) (computed without regard to the capital loss carryback from the loss year or any taxable year thereafter) for each of the prior taxable years to which such net capital loss may be carried.


(iii) *Special rules. (a)* In the case of a net capital loss which is not a foreign expropriation capital loss and which cannot be carried back in full to a preceding taxable year by reason of section 1212(a)(1)(A)(ii) and subdivision (i)(*a*) of this subparagraph because such loss would produce or increase a net operating loss in such preceding taxable year, the capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) for such preceding taxable year shall in no case be treated as greater than the amount of such net capital loss which can be carried back to such preceding taxable year upon the application of section 1212(a)(1)(A)(ii) and subdivision (i)(*a*) of this subparagraph.


(*b*) For the rules applicable to the portion of a net capital loss of a corporation which is attributable to a foreign expropriation capital loss sustained in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1958, see section 1212(a)(2) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.


(*c*) Section 1212(a)(1)(A) and subdivision (*i*)(*a*) of this subparagraph shall not apply to (and no carryback shall be allowed with respect to) the net capital loss of a corporation for any taxable year for which such corporation is an electing small business corporation under subchapter S. See § 1.1372-1.


(*d*) A net capital loss of a corporation for a year for which it is not an electing small business corporation under subchapter S shall not be carried back under section 1212(a)(1)(A) and subdivision (i)(*a*) of this subparagraph to a taxable year for which such corporation is an electing small business corporation. See section 1212(a)(3).


(*e*) A net capital loss of a corporation shall not be carried back under section 1212(a)(1)(A) and subdivision (i)(*a*) of this subparagraph to a taxable year for which the corporation was a foreign personal holding company, a regulated investment company, or a real estate investment trust, or for which an election made by the corporation under section 1247 is applicable. See section 1212(a)(4).


(*f*) A taxable year to which a net capital loss of a corporation cannot, by reason of (*d*) or (*e*) of this subdivision, be carried back under section 1212(a) (1)(A) and subdivision (i)(*a*) of this subparagraph shall nevertheless be treated as 1 of the 3 taxable years preceding the loss year for purposes of section 1212(a)(1)(A) and such subdivision (i)(*a*); but any capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) for such taxable year to which such net capital loss cannot be carried back shall be disregarded for purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.


(*g*) A regulated investment company (as defined in section 851) sustaining a net capital loss shall carry over that loss to each of the 8 taxable years succeeding the loss year. However, the 8-year period prescribed in the preceding sentence shall be reduced (but not to less than 5 years) by the sum of (*1*) the number of taxable years to which the net capital loss must be carried back pursuant to subdivision (i)(*a*) of this subparagraph (as limited by subdivision (iii)(*e*) of this subparagraph) and (*2*) the number of taxable years, of the 8 taxable year succeeding the loss year, that the corporation failed to qualify as a regulated investment company as defined in section 851. This subdivision shall not extend the carryover period prescribed in subdivision (i)(*b*) of this subparagraph to a year in which a corporation is not a regulated investment company as defined in section 851.


(iv) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples, in each of which it is assumed that the corporation is not, and never has been, a corporation described in subdivision (iii) (*c*) or (*d*) of this subparagraph, that the corporation files its tax returns on a calendar year basis, and that no capital loss sustained is a foreign expropriation capital loss:


(b) *Taxpayers other than corporations for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963*—(1) *In general.* If a taxpayer other than a corporation sustains a net capital loss for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, the portion thereof which is a short-term capital loss carryover shall be carried over to the succeeding taxable year and treated as a short-term capital loss sustained in such succeeding taxable year, and the portion thereof which constitutes a long-term capital loss carryover shall be carried over to the succeeding taxable year and treated as a long-term capital loss sustained in such succeeding taxable year. The carryovers are included in the succeeding taxable year in the determination of the amount of the short-term capital loss, the net short-term capital gain or loss, the long-term capital loss, and the net long-term capital gain or loss in such year, the net capital loss in such year, and the capital loss carryovers from such year. For purposes of this subparagraph:


(i) A short-term capital loss carryover is the excess of the net short-term capital loss for the taxable year over the net long-term capital gain for such year, and


(ii) A long-term capital loss carryover is the excess of the net long-term capital loss for the taxable year over the net short-term capital gain for such year.


(2) *Special rules for determining a net short-term capital gain or loss for purposes of carryover*—(i) *Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, and before January 1, 1970.* In determining a net short-term capital gain or loss of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, and before January 1, 1970, for purposes of computing a short-term or long-term capital loss carryover to the succeeding taxable year, an amount equal to the additional allowance deductible under section 1211(b) for the taxable year (determined as provided in section 1211(b), as in effect for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970, and § 1.1211-1(b)(5)) is treated as a short-term capital gain occurring in such year.


(ii) *Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969.* In determining a net short-term capital gain or loss of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969:


(*a*) For purposes of computing a short-term capital loss carryover to the succeeding taxable year, an amount equal to the additional allowance for the taxable year (determined as provided in section 1211(b) and § 1.1211-1(b)(2)) is treated as a short-term capital gain occurring in such year, and


(*b*) For purposes of computing a long-term capital loss carryover to the succeeding taxable year, an amount equal to the sum of the additional allowance for the taxable year (determined as provided in section 1211(b) and § 1.1211-1(b)(2)), plus the excess of such additional allowance over the net short-term capital loss (determined without regard to section 1212(b)(2) for such year) is treated as a short-term capital gain in such year.


(3) *Transitional rule for net capital losses sustained in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1964.* A taxpayer other than a corporation sustaining a net capital loss for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1964, shall treat as a short-term capital loss in the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, any amount which would be treated as a short-term capital loss in such year under subchapter P of chapter 1 of the Code as in effect immediately before the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1964.


(4) *Transitional rule for net long-term capital losses sustained in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970.* In the case of a net long-term capital loss sustained by a taxpayer other than a corporation in a taxable year beginning prior to January 1, 1970 (referred to in this section as a *pre-1970 taxable year*) which is carried over and treated as a long-term capital loss in the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969 (referred to in this section as a *post-1969 taxable year*), the transitional additional allowance deductible under section 1211(b) for the taxable year shall be determined by application of section 1211(b) as in effect for pre-1970 taxable years and § 1.1211-1(b)(3), and the amount of such long-term capital loss carried over and treated as a long-term capital loss in the succeeding taxable year shall be determined by application of section 1212(b)(1) as in effect for pre-1970 taxable years and subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph (instead of under sections 1211(b) and 1212(b)(1) as in effect for post-1969 taxable years and § 1.1211-1(b)(2) and subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph, respectively) but only to the extent that such pre-1970 long-term capital loss constitutes a *transitional net long-term capital loss component* (determined as provided in § 1.1211-1(b)(3)(ii)) in the taxable year to which such pre-1970 long-term capital loss is carried. Thus, for purposes of paragraph (2) of this section, to the extent that a component of the transitional additional allowance deductible for a post-1969 taxable year under section 1211(b) and § 1.1211-1(b)(3)(i) is a transitional net long-term capital loss component carried over to such post-1969 taxable year, such component shall be treated as a short-term capital gain in determining the amount and character of capital loss carryovers from such post-1969 taxable year to the succeeding taxable year. Such component shall be so treated as a short-term capital gain in full on a dollar-for-dollar basis and shall not be doubled for this purpose as is provided by subdivision (ii) of paragraph (2) of this section in the case of a component of the additional allowance made up of net long-term capital losses applied pursuant to the provisions of § 1.1211-1(b)(2)(iii). The transitional rule provided in this paragraph does not apply to a determination of the character of capital losses (as long-term or short-term) actually deductible for the current taxable year under section 1211(b) and § 1.1211-1(b).


(5) *Examples.* The application of this paragraph can be illustrated by the following examples:


(c) *Husband and wife.* (1) The following rules shall be applied in computing capital loss carryovers by husband and wife:


(i) If a husband and wife making a joint return for any taxable year made separate returns for the preceding year, any capital loss carryovers of each spouse from such preceding taxable year may be carried forward to the taxable year in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.


(ii) If a joint return was made for the preceding taxable year, any capital loss carryover from such preceding taxable year may be carried forward to the taxable year in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.


(iii) If a husband and wife make separate returns for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, or any prior taxable year, and they made a joint return for the preceding taxable year, any capital loss carryover from such preceding taxable year shall be allocated to the spouses on the basis of their individual net capital loss which gave rise to such capital loss carryover. The capital loss carryover so allocated to each spouse may be carried forward by such spouse to the taxable year in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.


(iv) If a husband and wife making separate returns for any taxable year following the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, made a joint return for the preceding taxable year, any long-term or short-term capital loss carryovers shall be allocated to the spouses on the basis of their individual net long-term and net short-term capital losses for the preceding taxable year which gave rise to such capital loss carryovers, and the portions of the long-term or short-term capital loss carryovers so allocated to each spouse may be carried forward by such spouse to the taxable year in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.


(v) If separate returns are made both for the taxable year and the preceding taxable year, any capital loss carryover of each spouse may be carried forward by such spouse in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.


(2) The provisions of subparagraph (1) (i), (iii), and (iv) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:
