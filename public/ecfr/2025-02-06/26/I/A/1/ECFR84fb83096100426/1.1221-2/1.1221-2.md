# § 1.1221-2   Hedging transactions.

(a) *Treatment of hedging transactions*—(1) *In general.* This section governs the treatment of hedging transactions under section 1221(a)(7). Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the term capital asset does not include property that is part of a hedging transaction (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section). 


(2) *Short sales and options.* This section also governs the character of gain or loss from a short sale or option that is part of a hedging transaction. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, gain or loss on a short sale or option that is part of a hedging transaction (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) is ordinary income or loss. 


(3) *Exclusivity.* If a transaction is not a hedging transaction as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, gain or loss from the transaction is not made ordinary on the grounds that property involved in the transaction is a surrogate for a noncapital asset, that the transaction serves as insurance against a business risk, that the transaction serves a hedging function, or that the transaction serves a similar function or purpose. 


(4) *Coordination with section 988.* This section does not apply to determine the character of gain or loss realized on a section 988 transaction as defined in section 988(c)(1) or realized with respect to any qualified fund as defined in section 988(c)(1)(E)(iii). 


(b) *Hedging transaction defined.* Section 1221(b)(2)(A) provides that a hedging transaction is any transaction that a taxpayer enters into in the normal course of the taxpayer's trade or business primarily— 


(1) To manage risk of price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to ordinary property (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) that is held or to be held by the taxpayer; 


(2) To manage risk of interest rate or price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made, or ordinary obligations incurred or to be incurred, by the taxpayer; or 


(3) To manage such other risks as the Secretary may prescribe in regulations (see paragraph (d)(6) of this section). 


(c) *General rules*—(1) *Normal course.* Solely for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, if a transaction is entered into in furtherance of a taxpayer's trade or business, the transaction is entered into in the normal course of the taxpayer's trade or business. This rule includes managing risks relating to the expansion of an existing business or the acquisition of a new trade or business. 


(2) *Ordinary property and obligations.* Property is ordinary property to a taxpayer only if a sale or exchange of the property by the taxpayer could not produce capital gain or loss under any circumstances. Thus, for example, property used in a trade or business within the meaning of section 1231(b) (determined without regard to the holding period specified in that section) is not ordinary property. An obligation is an ordinary obligation if performance or termination of the obligation by the taxpayer could not produce capital gain or loss. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), the term termination has the same meaning as it does in section 1234A. 


(3) *Hedging an aggregate risk.* The term hedging transaction includes a transaction that manages an aggregate risk of interest rate changes, price changes, and/or currency fluctuations only if all of the risk, or all but a de minimis amount of the risk, is with respect to ordinary property, ordinary obligations, or borrowings. 


(4) *Managing risk*—(i) *In general.* Whether a transaction manages a taxpayer's risk is determined based on all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the taxpayer's business and the transaction. Whether a transaction manages a taxpayer's risk may be determined on a business unit by business unit basis (for example by treating particular groups of activities, including the assets and liabilities attributable to those activities, as separate business units), provided that the business unit is within a single entity or consolidated return group that adopts the single-entity approach. A taxpayer's hedging strategies and policies as reflected in the taxpayer's minutes or other records are evidence of whether particular transactions were entered into primarily to manage the taxpayer's risk. 


(ii) *Limitation of risk management transactions to those specifically described.* Except as otherwise determined by published guidance or by private letter ruling, a transaction that is not treated as a hedging transaction under paragraph (d) does not manage risk. Moreover, a transaction undertaken for speculative purposes will not be treated as a hedging transaction. 


(d) *Transactions that manage risk*—(1) *Risk reduction transactions*—(i) *In general.* A transaction that is entered into to reduce a taxpayer's risk, manages a taxpayer's risk. 


(ii) *Micro and macro hedges*—(A) *In general.* A taxpayer generally has risk of a particular type only if it is at risk when all of its operations are considered. Nonetheless, a hedge of a particular asset or liability generally will be respected as reducing risk if it reduces the risk attributable to the asset or liability and if it is reasonably expected to reduce the overall risk of the taxpayer's operations. If a taxpayer hedges particular assets or liabilities, or groups of assets or liabilities, and the hedges are undertaken as part of a program that, as a whole, is reasonably expected to reduce the overall risk of the taxpayer's operations, the taxpayer generally does not have to demonstrate that each hedge that was entered into pursuant to the program reduces its overall risk. 


(B) *Example.* The following example illustrates the rules stated in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section: 


(iii) *Written options.* A written option may reduce risk. For example, in appropriate circumstances, a written call option with respect to assets held by a taxpayer or a written put option with respect to assets to be acquired by a taxpayer may be a hedging transaction. See also paragraph (d)(3) of this section. 


(iv) *Fixed-to-floating price hedges.* Under the principles of paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, a transaction that economically converts a price from a fixed price to a floating price may reduce risk. For example, a taxpayer with a fixed cost for its inventory may be at risk if the price at which the inventory can be sold varies with a particular factor. Thus, for such a taxpayer a transaction that converts its fixed price to a floating price may be a hedging transaction. 


(2) *Interest rate conversions.* A transaction that economically converts an interest rate from a fixed rate to a floating rate or that converts an interest rate from a floating rate to a fixed rate manages risk. 


(3) *Transactions that counteract hedging transactions.* If a transaction is entered into primarily to offset all or any part of the risk management effected by one or more hedging transactions, the transaction is a hedging transaction. For example, if a written option is used to reduce or eliminate the risk reduction obtained from another position such as a purchased option, then it may be a hedging transaction. 


(4) *Recycling.* A taxpayer may enter into a hedging transaction by using a position that was a hedge of one asset or liability as a hedge of another asset or liability (recycling). 


(5) *Transactions not entered into primarily to manage risk*—(i) *Rule.* Except as otherwise determined in published guidance or private letter ruling, the purchase or sale of a debt instrument, an equity security, or an annuity contract is not a hedging transaction even if the transaction limits or reduces the taxpayer's risk with respect to ordinary property, borrowings, or ordinary obligations. In addition, the Commissioner may determine in published guidance that other transactions are not hedging transactions. 


(ii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the rule stated in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section: 


(6) *Hedges of other risks.* The Commissioner may, by published guidance, determine that hedging transactions include transactions entered into to manage risks other than interest rate or price changes, or currency fluctuations. 


(7) *Miscellaneous provision*—(i) *Extent of risk management.* A taxpayer may hedge all or any portion of its risk for all or any part of the period during which it is exposed to the risk. 


(ii) *Number of transactions.* The fact that a taxpayer frequently enters into and terminates positions (even if done on a daily or more frequent basis) is not relevant to whether these transactions are hedging transactions. Thus, for example, a taxpayer hedging the risk associated with an asset or liability may frequently establish and terminate positions that hedge that risk, depending on the extent the taxpayer wishes to be hedged. Similarly, if a taxpayer maintains its level of risk exposure by entering into and terminating a large number of transactions in a single day, its transactions may nonetheless qualify as hedging transactions. 


(e) *Hedging by members of a consolidated group*—(1) *General rule: single-entity approach.* For purposes of this section, the risk of one member of a consolidated group is treated as the risk of the other members as if all of the members of the group were divisions of a single corporation. For example, if any member of a consolidated group hedges the risk of another member of the group by entering into a transaction with a third party, that transaction may potentially qualify as a hedging transaction. Conversely, intercompany transactions are not hedging transactions because, when considered as transactions between divisions of a single corporation, they do not manage the risk of that single corporation. 


(2) *Separate-entity election.* In lieu of the single-entity approach specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a consolidated group may elect separate-entity treatment of its hedging transactions. If a group makes this separate-entity election, the following rules apply: 


(i) *Risk of one member not risk of other members.* Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the risk of one member is not treated as the risk of other members. 


(ii) *Intercompany transactions.* An intercompany transaction is a hedging transaction (an intercompany hedging transaction) with respect to a member of a consolidated group if and only if it meets the following requirements— 


(A) The position of the member in the intercompany transaction would qualify as a hedging transaction with respect to the member (taking into account paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section) if the member had entered into the transaction with an unrelated party; and 


(B) The position of the other member (the marking member) in the transaction is marked to market under the marking member's method of accounting. 


(iii) *Treatment of intercompany hedging transactions.* An intercompany hedging transaction (that is, a transaction that meets the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section) is subject to the following rules— 


(A) The character and timing rules of § 1.1502-13 do not apply to the income, deduction, gain, or loss from the intercompany hedging transaction; and 


(B) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, the character of the marking member's gain or loss from the transaction is ordinary.


(iv) *Making and revoking the election.* Unless the Commissioner otherwise prescribes, the election described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section must be made in a separate statement that provides, “[INSERT NAME AND EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OF COMMON PARENT] HEREBY ELECTS THE APPLICATION OF § 1.1221-2(e)(2) (THE SEPARATE-ENTITY APPROACH).” The statement must also indicate the date as of which the election is to be effective. The election must be filed by including the statement on or with the consolidated group's income tax return for the taxable year that includes the first date for which the election is to apply. The election applies to all transactions entered into on or after the date so indicated. The election may only be revoked with the consent of the Commissioner.


(3) *Definitions.* For definitions of consolidated group, divisions of a single corporation, group, intercompany transactions, and member, see section 1502 and the regulations thereunder. 


(4) *Examples. General Facts.* In these examples, *O* and *H* are members of the same consolidated group. *O*'s business operations give rise to interest rate risk “*A*,” which *O* wishes to hedge. *O* enters into an intercompany transaction with *H* that transfers the risk to *H. O*'s position in the intercompany transaction is “*B*,” and *H*'s position in the transaction is “*C.*” *H* enters into position “*D*” with a third party to reduce the interest rate risk it has with respect to its position *C. D* would be a hedging transaction with respect to risk *A* if *O*'s risk *A* were *H*'s risk. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (e):


(f) *Identification and recordkeeping*—(1) *Same-day identification of hedging transactions.* Under section 1221(a)(7), a taxpayer that enters into a hedging transaction (including recycling an existing hedging transaction) must clearly identify it as a hedging transaction before the close of the day on which the taxpayer acquired, originated, or entered into the transaction (or recycled the existing hedging transaction). 


(2) *Substantially contemporaneous identification of hedged item*—(i) *Content of the identification.* A taxpayer that enters into a hedging transaction must identify the item, items, or aggregate risk being hedged. Identification of an item being hedged generally involves identifying a transaction that creates risk, and the type of risk that the transaction creates. For example, if a taxpayer is hedging the price risk with respect to its June purchases of corn inventory, the transaction being hedged is the June purchase of corn and the risk is price movements in the market where the taxpayer buys its corn. For additional rules concerning the content of this identification, see paragraph (f)(3) of this section. 


(ii) *Timing of the identification.* The identification required by this paragraph (f)(2) must be made substantially contemporaneously with entering into the hedging transaction. An identification is not substantially contemporaneous if it is made more than 35 days after entering into the hedging transaction. 


(3) *Identification requirements for certain hedging transactions.* In the case of the hedging transactions described in this paragraph (f)(3), the identification under paragraph (f)(2) of this section must include the information specified. 


(i) *Anticipatory asset hedges.* If the hedging transaction relates to the anticipated acquisition of assets by the taxpayer, the identification must include the expected date or dates of acquisition and the amounts expected to be acquired. 


(ii) *Inventory hedges.* If the hedging transaction relates to the purchase or sale of inventory by the taxpayer, the identification is made by specifying the type or class of inventory to which the transaction relates. If the hedging transaction relates to specific purchases or sales, the identification must also include the expected dates of the purchases or sales and the amounts to be purchased or sold. 


(iii) *Hedges of debt of the taxpayer*—(A) *Existing debt.* If the hedging transaction relates to accruals or payments under an issue of existing debt of the taxpayer, the identification must specify the issue and, if the hedge is for less than the full issue price or the full term of the debt, the amount of the issue price and the term covered by the hedge. 


(B) *Debt to be issued.* If the hedging transaction relates to the expected issuance of debt by the taxpayer or to accruals or payments under debt that is expected to be issued by the taxpayer, the identification must specify the following information: the expected date of issuance of the debt; the expected maturity or maturities; the total expected issue price; and the expected interest provisions. If the hedge is for less than the entire expected issue price of the debt or the full expected term of the debt, the identification must also include the amount or the term being hedged. The identification may indicate a range of dates, terms, and amounts, rather than specific dates, terms, or amounts. For example, a taxpayer might identify a transaction as hedging the yield on an anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt during the second half of its fiscal year, with the anticipated amount of the debt between $75 million and $125 million, and an anticipated term of approximately 20 to 30 years. 


(iv) *Hedges of aggregate risk*—(A) *Required identification.* If a transaction hedges aggregate risk as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the identification under paragraph (f)(2) of this section must include a description of the risk being hedged and of the hedging program under which the hedging transaction was entered. This requirement may be met by placing in the taxpayer's records a description of the hedging program and by establishing a system under which individual transactions can be identified as being entered into pursuant to the program. 


(B) *Description of hedging program.* A description of a hedging program must include an identification of the type of risk being hedged, a description of the type of items giving rise to the risk being aggregated, and sufficient additional information to demonstrate that the program is designed to reduce aggregate risk of the type identified. If the program contains controls on speculation (for example, position limits), the description of the hedging program must also explain how the controls are established, communicated, and implemented. 


(v) *Transactions that counteract hedging transactions.* If the hedging transaction is described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the description of the hedging transaction must include an identification of the risk management transaction that is being offset and the original underlying hedged item. 


(4) *Manner of identification and records to be retained*—(i) *Inclusion of identification in tax records.* The identification required by this paragraph (f) must be made on, and retained as part of, the taxpayer's books and records. 


(ii) *Presence of identification must be unambiguous.* The presence of an identification for purposes of this paragraph (f) must be unambiguous. The identification of a hedging transaction for financial accounting or regulatory purposes does not satisfy this requirement unless the taxpayer's books and records indicate that the identification is also being made for tax purposes. The taxpayer may indicate that individual hedging transactions, or a class or classes of hedging transactions, that are identified for financial accounting or regulatory purposes are also being identified as hedging transactions for purposes of this section. 


(iii) *Manner of identification.* The taxpayer may separately and explicitly make each identification, or, so long as paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section is satisfied, the taxpayer may establish a system pursuant to which the identification is indicated by the type of transaction or by the manner in which the transaction is consummated or recorded. An identification under this system is made at the later of the time that the system is established or the time that the transaction satisfies the terms of the system by being entered, or by being consummated or recorded, in the designated fashion. 


(iv) *Principles of paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section illustrated.* Paragraphs (f)(4)(iv)(A) through (C) of this section illustrate the principles of paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section and assume that the other requirements of this paragraph (f) are satisfied. 


(A) A taxpayer can make an identification by designating a hedging transaction for (or placing it in) an account that has been identified as containing only hedges of a specified item (or of specified items or specified aggregate risk). 


(B) A taxpayer can make an identification by including and retaining in its books and records a statement that designates all future transactions in a specified derivative product as hedges of a specified item, items, or aggregate risk. 


(C) A taxpayer can make an identification by designating a certain mark, a certain form, or a certain legend as meaning that a transaction is a hedge of a specified item (or of specified items or a specified aggregate risk). Identification can be made by placing the designated mark on a record of the transaction (for example, trading ticket, purchase order, or trade confirmation) or by using the designated form or a record that contains the designated legend. 


(5) *Identification of hedges involving members of the same consolidated group*—(i) *General rule: single-entity approach.* A member of a consolidated group must satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (f) as if all of the members of the group were divisions of a single corporation. Thus, the member entering into the hedging transaction with a third party must identify the hedging transaction under paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, that member must also identify the item, items, or aggregate risk that is being hedged, even if the item, items, or aggregate risk relates primarily or entirely to other members of the group. If the members of a group use intercompany transactions to transfer risk within the group, the requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this section may be met by identifying the intercompany transactions, and the risks hedged by the intercompany transactions, as hedges or hedged items, as appropriate. Because identification of the intercompany transaction as a hedge serves solely to identify the hedged item, the identification is timely if made within the period required by paragraph (f)(2) of this section. For example, if a member transfers risk in an intercompany transaction, it may identify under the rules of this paragraph (f) both its position in that transaction and the item, items, or aggregate risk being hedged. The member that hedges the risk outside the group may identify under the rules of this paragraph (f) both its position with the third party and its position in the intercompany transaction. Paragraph (e)(4) *Example 1* of this section illustrates this identification. 


(ii) *Rule for consolidated groups making the separate-entity election.* If a consolidated group makes the separate-entity election under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, each member of the group must satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (f) as though it were not a member of a consolidated group. 


(6) *Consistency with section 1256(e)(2).* Any identification for purposes of section 1256(e)(2) is also an identification for purposes of paragraph (f)(1) of this section. 


(g) *Effect of identification and non-identification*—(1) *Transactions identified*—(i) *In general.* If a taxpayer identifies a transaction as a hedging transaction for purposes of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the identification is binding with respect to gain, whether or not all of the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section are satisfied. Thus, gain from that transaction is ordinary income. If the transaction is not in fact a hedging transaction described in paragraph (b) of this section, however, paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section do not apply and the character of loss is determined without reference to whether the transaction is a surrogate for a noncapital asset, serves as insurance against a business risk, serves a hedging function, or serves a similar function or purpose. Thus, the taxpayer's identification of the transaction as a hedging transaction does not itself make loss from the transaction ordinary. 


(ii) *Inadvertent identification.* Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, if the taxpayer identifies a transaction as a hedging transaction for purposes of paragraph (f) of this section, the character of the gain is determined as if the transaction had not been identified as a hedging transaction if— 


(A) The transaction is not a hedging transaction (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section); 


(B) The identification of the transaction as a hedging transaction was due to inadvertent error; and 


(C) All of the taxpayer's transactions in all open years are being treated on either original or, if necessary, amended returns in a manner consistent with the principles of this section. 


(2) *Transactions not identified*—(i) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraphs (g)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the absence of an identification that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section is binding and establishes that a transaction is not a hedging transaction. Thus, subject to the exceptions, the rules of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section do not apply, and the character of gain or loss is determined without reference to whether the transaction is a surrogate for a noncapital asset, serves as insurance against a business risk, serves a hedging function, or serves a similar function or purpose. 


(ii) *Inadvertent error.* If a taxpayer does not make an identification that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section, the taxpayer may treat gain or loss from the transaction as ordinary income or loss under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section if— 


(A) The transaction is a hedging transaction (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section); 


(B) The failure to identify the transaction was due to inadvertent error; and 


(C) All of the taxpayer's hedging transactions in all open years are being treated on either original or, if necessary, amended returns as provided in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section. 


(iii) *Anti-abuse rule.* If a taxpayer does not make an identification that satisfies all the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section but the taxpayer has no reasonable grounds for treating the transaction as other than a hedging transaction, then gain from the transaction is ordinary. The reasonableness of the taxpayer's failure to identify a transaction is determined by taking into consideration not only the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section but also the taxpayer's treatment of the transaction for financial accounting or other purposes and the taxpayer's identification of similar transactions as hedging transactions. 


(3) *Transactions by members of a consolidated group*—(i) *Single-entity approach.* If a consolidated group is under the general rule of paragraph (e)(1) of this section (the single-entity approach), the rules of this paragraph (g) apply only to transactions that are not intercompany transactions. 


(ii) *Separate-entity election.* If a consolidated group has made the election under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, then, in addition to the rules of paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section, the following rules apply: 


(A) If an intercompany transaction is identified as a hedging transaction but does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, then, notwithstanding any contrary provision in § 1.1502-13, each party to the transaction is subject to the rules of paragraph (g)(1) of this section with respect to the transaction as though it had incorrectly identified its position in the transaction as a hedging transaction. 


(B) If a transaction meets the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section but the transaction is not identified as a hedging transaction, each party to the transaction is subject to the rules of paragraph (g)(2) of this section. (Because the transaction is an intercompany hedging transaction, the character and timing rules of § 1.1502-13 do not apply. See paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A) of this section.) 


(h) *Effective date.* The rules of this section apply to transactions entered into on or after March 20, 2002.


(i) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.1221-2T(i) through (j)(1).


(j) *Effective/applicability date.* Paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section applies to any original consolidated Federal income tax return due (without extensions) after June 14, 2007. For original consolidated Federal income tax returns due (without extensions) after May 30, 2006, and on or before June 14, 2007, see § 1.1221-2T as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on April 1, 2007. For original consolidated Federal income tax returns due (without extensions) on or before May 30, 2006, see § 1.1221-2 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on April 1, 2006.
