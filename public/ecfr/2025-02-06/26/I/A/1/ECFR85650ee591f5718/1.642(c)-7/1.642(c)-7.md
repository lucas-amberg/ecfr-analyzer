# § 1.642(c)-7   Transitional rules with respect to pooled income funds.

(a) *In general*—(1) *Amendment of certain funds.* A fund created before May 7, 1971, and not otherwise qualifying as a pooled income fund may be treated as a pooled income fund to which § 1.642(c)-5 applies if on July 31, 1969, or on each date of transfer of property to the fund occurring after July 31, 1969, it possessed the initial characteristics described in paragraph (b) of this section and is amended, in the time and manner provided in paragraph (c) of this section, to meet all the requirements of section 642(c)(5) and § 1.642(c)-5. If a fund to which this subparagraph applies is amended in the time and manner provided in paragraph (c) of this section it shall be treated as provided in paragraph (d) of this section for the period beginning on August 1, 1969, or, if later, on the date of its creation and ending the day before the date on which it meets the requirements of section 642(c)(5) and § 1.642(c)-5. 


(2) *Severance of a portion of a fund.* Any portion of a fund created before May 7, 1971, which consists of property transferred to such fund after July 31, 1969, may be severed from such fund consistently with the principles of paragraph (c)(2) of this section and established before January 1, 1972, as a separate pooled income fund, provided that on and after the date of severance the severed fund meets all the requirements of section 642(c)(5) and § 1.642(c)-5. A separate fund which is established pursuant to this subparagraph shall be treated as provided in paragraph (d) of this section for the period beginning on the day of the first transfer of property which becomes part of the separate fund and ending the day before the day on which the separate fund meets the requirements of section 642(c)(5) and § 1.642(c)-5. 


(b) *Initial characteristics required.* A fund described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not be treated as a pooled income fund to which section 642(c)(5) applies, even though it is amended as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, unless it possessed the following characteristics on July 31, 1969, or on each date of transfer of property to the fund occurring after July 31, 1969: 


(1) It satisfied the requirements of section 642(c)(5)(A) other than that the fund be a trust; 


(2) It was constituted in a way to attract and contain commingled properties transferred to the fund by more than one donor satisfying such requirements; and 


(3) Each beneficiary of a life income interest which was retained or created in any property transferred to the fund was entitled to receive, but not less often than annually, a proportional share of the annual income earned by the fund, such share being based on the fair market value of the property in which such life interest was retained or created. 


(c) *Amendment requirements.* (1) A fund described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and possessing the initial characteristics described in paragraph (b) of this section on the date prescribed therein shall be treated as a pooled income fund if it is amended to meet all the requirements of section 642(c)(5) and § 1.642(c)-5 before January 1, 1972, or, if later, on or before the 30th day after the date on which any judicial proceedings commenced before January 1, 1972, which are required to amend its governing instrument or any other instrument which does not permit it to meet such requirements, become final. However, see paragraph (d) of this section for limitation on the period in which a claim for credit or refund may be filed. 


(2) In addition, if the transferred property described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is commingled with other property, the transferred property must be separated on or before the date specified in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph from the other property and allocated to the fund in accordance with the transferred property's percentage share of the fair market value of the total commingled property on the date of separation. The percentage share shall be the ratio which the fair market value of the transferred property on the date of separation bears to the fair market value of the total commingled property on that date and shall be computed in a manner consistent with paragraph (c) of § 1.642(c)-5. The property which is so allocated to the fund shall be treated as property received from transfers which meet the requirements of section 642(c)(5), and such transfers shall be treated as made on the dates on which the properties giving rise to such allocation were transferred to the fund by the respective donors. The property so allocated to the fund must be representative of all the commingled property other than securities the income from which is exempt from tax under subtitle A of the Code; compensating increases in other commingled property allocated to the fund shall be made where such tax-exempt securities are not allocated to the fund. The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example: 


(d) *Transactions before amendment of or severance from fund.* (1) A fund which is amended pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, or is severed from a fund pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, shall be treated for all purposes, including the allowance of a deduction for any charitable contribution, as if it were before its amendment or severance a pooled income fund to which section 642(c)(5) and § 1.642(c)-5 apply. Thus, for example, where a donor transferred property in trust to such an amended or severed fund on August 1, 1969, but before its amendment or severance under this section, a charitable contributions deduction for the value of the remainder interest may be allowed under section 170, 2055, 2106, or 2522. The deduction may not be allowed, however, until the fund is amended or severed pursuant to this section and shall be allowed only if a claim for credit or refund is filed within the period of limitation prescribed by section 6511(a). 


(2) For purposes of determining under § 1.642(c)-6 the highest yearly rate of return earned by a fund (which is amended pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section) for the 3 preceding taxable years, taxable years of the fund preceding its taxable year in which the fund is so amended and qualifies as a pooled income fund under this section shall be used provided that the fund did not at any time during such preceding years hold any investments in securities the income from which is exempt from tax under subtitle A of the Code. If any such tax-exempt securities were held during such period by such amended fund, or if the fund consists of a portion of a fund which is severed pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the highest yearly rate of return under § 1.642(c)-6 shall be determined by treating the fund as a pooled income fund which has been in existence for less than 3 taxable years preceding the taxable year in which the transfer of property to the fund is made. 


(3) Property transferred to a fund before its amendment pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, or before its severance under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, shall be treated as property received from transfers which meet the requirements of section 642(c)(5).
