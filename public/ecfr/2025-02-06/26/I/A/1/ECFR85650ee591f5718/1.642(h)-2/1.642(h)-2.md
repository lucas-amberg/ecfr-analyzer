# § 1.642(h)-2   Excess deductions on termination of an estate or trust.

(a) *Excess deductions*—(1) *In general.* If, on the termination of an estate or trust, the estate or trust has for its last taxable year deductions (other than the deductions allowed under section 642(b) (relating to the personal exemption) or section 642(c) (relating to charitable contributions)) in excess of gross income, the excess deductions as determined under paragraph (b) of this section are allowed under section 642(h)(2) as items of deduction to the beneficiaries succeeding to the property of the estate or trust.


(2) *Treatment by beneficiary.* A beneficiary may claim all or part of the amount of the deductions provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, as determined after application of paragraph (b) of this section, before, after, or together with the same character of deductions separately allowable to the beneficiary under the Internal Revenue Code for the beneficiary's taxable year during which the estate or trust terminated as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.


(b) *Character and amount of excess deductions*—(1) *Character.* The character and amount of the excess deductions on termination of an estate or trust will be determined as provided in this paragraph (b). Each deduction comprising the excess deductions under section 642(h)(2) retains, in the hands of the beneficiary, its character (specifically, as allowable in arriving at adjusted gross income, as a non-miscellaneous itemized deduction, or as a miscellaneous itemized deduction) while in the estate or trust. An item of deduction succeeded to by a beneficiary remains subject to any additional applicable limitation under the Internal Revenue Code and must be separately stated if it could be so limited, as provided in the instructions to Form 1041, *U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts,* and the Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), *Beneficiary's Share of Income, Deductions, Credit, etc.,* or successor forms.


(2) *Amount.* The amount of the excess deductions in the final year is determined as follows:


(i) Each deduction directly attributable to a class of income is allocated in accordance with the provisions in § 1.652(b)-(a);


(ii) To the extent of any remaining income after application of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, deductions are allocated in accordance with the provisions in § 1.652(b)-3(b) and (d); and


(iii) Deductions remaining after the application of paragraph (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section comprise the excess deductions on termination of the estate or trust. These deductions are allocated to the beneficiaries succeeding to the property of the estate of or trust in accordance with § 1.642(h)-4.


(c) *Year of termination*—(1) *In general.* The deductions provided for in paragraph (a) of this section are allowable only in the taxable year of the beneficiary in which or with which the estate or trust terminates, whether the year of termination of the estate or trust is of normal duration or is a short taxable year.


(2) *Example.* Assume that a trust distributes all its assets to B and terminates on December 31, Year X. As of that date, it has excess deductions of $18,000, all characterized as allowable in arriving at adjusted gross income under section 67(e). B, who reports on the calendar year basis, could claim the $18,000 as a deduction allowable in arriving at B's adjusted gross income for Year X. However, if the deduction (when added to other allowable deductions that B claims for the year) exceeds B's gross income, the excess may not be carried over to any year subsequent to Year X.


(d) *Net operating loss carryovers.* A deduction based upon a net operating loss carryover will never be allowed to beneficiaries under both paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 642(h). Accordingly, a net operating loss deduction which is allowable to beneficiaries succeeding to the property of the estate or trust under the provisions of paragraph (1) of section 642(h) cannot also be considered a deduction for purposes of paragraph (2) of section 642(h) and paragraph (a) of this section. However, if the last taxable year of the estate or trust is the last year in which a deduction on account of a net operating loss may be taken, the deduction, to the extent not absorbed in that taxable year by the estate or trust, is considered an “excess deduction” under section 642(h)(2) and paragraph (a) of this section. 


(e) *Items included in net operating loss or capital loss carryovers.* (c) Any item of income or deduction, or any part thereof, which is taken into account in determining the net operating loss or capital loss carryover of the estate or trust for its last taxable year shall not be taken into account again in determining excess deductions on termination of the trust or estate within the meaning of section 642(h)(2) and paragraph (a) of this section (see example in § 1.642(h)-5).


(f) *Applicability date.* Paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section apply to taxable years beginning after October 19, 2020. The rules applicable to taxable years beginning on or before October 19, 2020 are contained in §  1.642(h)-2 as in effect prior to October 19, 2020 (see 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2020). Taxpayers may choose to apply paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and on or before October 19, 2020.
