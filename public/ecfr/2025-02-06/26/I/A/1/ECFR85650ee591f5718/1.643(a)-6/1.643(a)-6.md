# ยง 1.643(a)-6   Income of foreign trust.

(a) *Distributable net income of a foreign trust.* In the case of a foreign trust (see section 7701(a)(31)), the determination of distributable net income is subject to the following rules: 


(1) There is included in distributable net income the amounts of gross income from sources without the United States, reduced by disbursements allocable to such foreign income which would have been deductible but for the provisions of section 265 (relating to disallowance of deductions allocable to tax exempt income). See paragraph (b) of ยง 1.643(a)-5 for rules applicable when an estate or trust is allowed a charitable contributions deduction under section 642(c). 


(2) In the case of a distribution made by a trust before January 1, 1963, for purposes of determining the distributable net income of the trust for the taxable year in which the distribution is made, or for any prior taxable year; 


(i) Gross income from sources within the United States is determined by taking into account the provisions of section 894 (relating to income exempt under treaty); and 


(ii) Distributable net income is determined by taking into account the provisions of section 643(a)(3) (relating to exclusion of certain gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets). 


(3) In the case of a distribution made by a trust after December 31, 1962, for purposes of determining the distributable net income of the trust for any taxable year, whether ending before January 1, 1963, or after December 31, 1962; 


(i) Gross income (for the entire foreign trust) from sources within the United States is determined without regard to the provisions of section 894 (relating to income exempt under treaty); 


(ii) In respect of a foreign trust created by a U.S. person (whether such trust constitutes the whole or only a portion of the entire foreign trust) (see section 643(d) and ยง 1.643(d)-1), there shall be included in gross income gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets reduced by losses from such sales or exchanges to the extent such losses do not exceed gains from such sales or exchanges, and the deduction under section 1202 (relating to deduction for capital gains) shall not be taken into account; and 


(iii) In respect of a foreign trust created by a person other than a U.S. person (whether such trust constitutes the whole or only a portion of the entire foreign trust) (see section 643(d) and ยง 1.643(d)-1), distributable net income is determined by taking into account all of the provisions of section 643 except section 643(a)(6)(C) (relating to gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets by a foreign trust created by a U.S. person). 


(b) *Examples.* The application of this section, showing the computation of distributable net income for one of the taxable years for which such a computation must be made, may be illustrated by the following examples:
