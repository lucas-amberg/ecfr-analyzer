# § 1.1474-1   Liability for withheld tax and withholding agent reporting.

(a) *Payment and returns of tax withheld*—(1) *In general.* A withholding agent is required to deposit any tax withheld pursuant to chapter 4 as provided under paragraph (b) of this section and to make the returns prescribed by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. When several persons qualify as withholding agents with respect to a single payment, only one tax is required to be withheld and deposited.


(2) *Withholding agent liability.* A withholding agent that is required to withhold with respect to a payment under § 1.1471-2(a), 1.1471-4(b) (in the case of a participating FFI), or 1.1472-1(b) but fails either to withhold or to deposit any tax withheld as required under paragraph (b) of this section is liable for the amount of tax not withheld and deposited.


(3) *Use of agents*—(i) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(3), a withholding agent may authorize an agent to fulfill its obligations under chapter 4. The acts of an agent of a withholding agent (including the receipt of withholding certificates, the payment of amounts subject to withholding, the withholding and deposit of tax withheld, and the reporting required on the relevant form) are imputed to the withholding agent on whose behalf it is acting.


(ii) *Authorized agent.* An agent is authorized only if—


(A) There is a written agreement between the withholding agent and the person acting as agent;


(B) A Form 8655, “Reporting Agent Authorization,” is filed with the IRS by a withholding agent if its agent (including any sub-agent) acts as a reporting agent for filing Form 1042 on behalf of the withholding agent and the agent (or sub-agent) identifies itself as the filer on the Form 1042;


(C) Books and records and relevant personnel of the agent (including any sub-agent) are available to the withholding agent (on a continuous basis, including after termination of the relationship) in order to evaluate the withholding agent's compliance with the provisions of chapter 4; and


(D) The withholding agent remains fully liable for the acts of its agent (or any sub-agent) and does not assert any of the defenses that may otherwise be available, including under common law principles of agency, in order to avoid tax liability under the Code.


(iii) *Liability of withholding agent acting through an agent.* A withholding agent acting through an agent is liable for any failure of the agent, such as a failure to withhold an amount or make a payment of tax, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the agent's failure had been the failure of the withholding agent. For this purpose, the agent's actual knowledge or reason to know shall be imputed to the withholding agent. Except as otherwise provided in the QI, WP, or WT agreement, an agent of a withholding agent is subject to the same withholding and reporting obligations that apply to any withholding agent under the provisions of chapter 4 and does not benefit from the special procedures or exceptions that apply to a QI, WP, or WT. If the agent is a foreign person, however, a U.S. withholding agent may treat the acts of the foreign agent as its own for purposes of determining whether it has complied with the provisions of chapter 4. The withholding agent's liability under paragraph (a)(2) of this section will exist even if the agent is also a withholding agent and is itself separately liable for failure to comply with the provisions of chapter 4. The same tax, interest, or penalties, however, shall not be collected more than once.


(4) *Liability for failure to obtain documentation timely or to act in accordance with applicable presumptions*—(i) *In general.* A withholding agent that cannot reliably associate a payment with documentation on the date of payment and that does not withhold under § 1.1471-2(a), 1.1471-4(b), or 1.1472-1(b), or withholds at less than the 30 percent rate prescribed, is liable under this section for the tax required to be withheld under § 1.1471-2(a), 1.1471-4(b), or 1.1472-1(b) (including interest, penalties, or additions to tax otherwise applicable in respect of the failure to deduct and withhold) unless—


(A) The withholding agent has appropriately relied on the presumptions described in § 1.1471-3(f) in order to treat the payment as exempt from withholding; or


(B) The withholding agent obtained after the date of payment valid documentation that meets the requirements of § 1.1471-3(c)(7) to establish that the payment was, in fact, exempt from withholding.


(ii) *Withholding satisfied by another withholding agent.* If a withholding agent fails to deduct and withhold any amount required to be deducted and withheld under § 1.1471-2(a), 1.1471-4(b), or 1.1472-1(b), and the tax is satisfied by another withholding agent or is otherwise paid, then the amount of tax required to be deducted and withheld shall not be collected from the first-mentioned withholding agent. However, the withholding agent is not relieved from liability in any such case for any interest or penalties or additions to tax otherwise applicable in respect of the failure to deduct and withhold.


(b) *Payment of withheld tax*—(1) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b), every withholding agent who withholds tax pursuant to chapter 4 shall deposit such tax within the time provided in § 1.6302-2(a) by electronic funds transfer as provided under § 31.6302-1(h) of this chapter. If for any reason the total amount of tax required to be deposited for any calendar year pursuant to the income tax return described in paragraph (c) of this section has not been deposited pursuant to § 1.6302-2, the withholding agent shall pay the balance of such tax due for such year at such place as the IRS shall specify. The tax shall be paid when filing the return described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for such year, unless the IRS specifies otherwise. See § 1.1471-4(b)(6) for the special rule allowing participating FFIs to set aside in escrow amounts withheld with respect to dormant accounts.


(2) *Special rule for foreign passthru payments and payments of gross proceeds that include an undetermined amount of income subject to tax.* [Reserved]


(c) *Income tax return*—(1) *In general.* Every withholding agent shall file an income tax return on Form 1042, “Annual Withholding Tax Return for U.S. Source Income of Foreign Persons,” (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) to report chapter 4 reportable amounts (as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section). This income tax return shall be filed on the same income tax return used to report amounts subject to reporting for chapter 3 purposes as described in § 1.1461-1(b). The return must show the aggregate amount of payments that are chapter 4 reportable amounts and must report the tax withheld for the preceding calendar year by the withholding agent, in addition to any information required by the form and its accompanying instructions. Withholding certificates and other statements or information provided to a withholding agent are not required to be attached to the return. A Form 1042 must be filed under this paragraph (c)(1) even if no tax was required to be withheld for chapter 4 purposes during the preceding calendar year. The withholding agent must retain a copy of Form 1042 for the applicable period of limitations on assessment and collection with respect to the amounts required to be reported on the Form 1042. See section 6501 and the regulations thereunder for the applicable period of limitations. Adjustments to the total amount of tax withheld described in § 1.1474-2 shall be stated on the return as prescribed by the form and its accompanying instructions.


(2) *Participating FFIs, registered deemed-compliant FFIs, and U.S. branches treated as U.S. persons.* A participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI shall file Form 1042 in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section to report chapter 4 reportable amounts for which the participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI is required to file Form 1042-S, as described in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section. A participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI with a U.S. branch that is treated as a U.S. person must exclude from Form 1042 payments made and taxes withheld by such U.S. branch. A U.S. branch that is treated as a U.S. person shall file a separate Form 1042 in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the instructions on the form to report chapter 4 reportable amounts.


(3) *Amended returns.* An amended return under this paragraph (c)(3) must be filed on Form 1042. An amended return must include such information as the form or its accompanying instructions shall require, including, with respect to any information that has changed from the time of the filing of the return, the information that was shown on the original return and the corrected information.


(d) *Information returns for payment reporting*—(1) *Filing requirement*—(i) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section or in the instructions to Form 1042-S, every withholding agent must file an information return on Form 1042-S, “Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding,” (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) to report to the IRS chapter 4 reportable amounts as described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section that were paid to a recipient during the preceding calendar year. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (d)(4)(ii)(B) (certain unknown recipients) and (d)(4)(i)(B) and (d)(4)(iii)(A) of this section (describing payees includable in reporting pools of a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI), a separate Form 1042-S must be filed with the IRS for each recipient of an amount subject to reporting under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section and for each separate type of payment made to a single recipient in accordance with paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section. The Form 1042-S shall be prepared in such manner as the form and its accompanying instructions prescribe. One copy of the Form 1042-S shall be filed with the IRS on or before March 15 of the calendar year following the year in which the amount subject to reporting was paid, with a transmittal form as provided in the instructions to the form. Withholding certificates, certifications, documentary evidence, or other statements or documentation provided to a withholding agent are not required to be attached to the form. A copy of the Form 1042-S must be furnished to the recipient for whom the form is prepared (or any other person, as required under this paragraph or the instructions to the form) and to any intermediary or flow-through entity described in paragraph (d)(3)(vii) of this section on or before March 15 of the calendar year following the year in which the amount subject to reporting was paid. A person required by this paragraph (d)(1)(i) to furnish a copy of Form 1042-S to the recipient for whom it is prepared may furnish the copy of Form 1042-S in an electronic format in lieu of a paper format provided it meets the requirements of § 1.1461-1(c)(1)(i)(A). The withholding agent must retain a copy of each Form 1042-S for the period of limitations on assessment and collection applicable to the tax reportable on the Form 1042 to which the Form 1042-S relates (determined as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section). See paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section for the additional reporting requirements of participating FFIs and deemed-compliant FFIs. 


(ii) *Recipient*—(A) *Defined.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the term *recipient* under this paragraph (d) means a person that is a recipient of a chapter 4 reportable amount, and includes—

(A) An amount of a withholdable payment that is subject to withholding under chapter 4 paid after June 30, 2014;


(B) An amount of a withholdable payment of U.S. source FDAP income (including an amount that would be a withholdable payment but for the fact that it is an amount effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, as described in § 1.1471-3(a)(4)(ii)) that is also reportable on Form 1042-S under § 1.1461-1(c)(2)(i); or


(C) A foreign passthru payment subject to withholding under chapter 4. 


(ii) *Exception to reporting.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(2)(ii), a chapter 4 reportable amount does not include an amount paid to a U.S. person if the withholding agent treats such U.S. person as a payee for purposes of determining whether withholding is required under §§ 1.1471-2 and 1.1472-1. A chapter 4 reportable amount does, however, include an amount paid to a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI to the extent allocable to its reporting pool of payees that are U.S. persons as described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B) of this section.


(iii) *Coordination with chapter 3.* A payment that is not subject to reporting under this paragraph (d)(2) may be subject to chapter 3 reporting on Form 1042-S to the extent provided on such form and its accompanying instructions or under § 1.1461-1(c)(2). The recipient information and other information required to be reported on Form 1042-S for purposes of chapter 4 shall be in addition to the information required to be provided on Form 1042-S for purposes of chapter 3.


(3) *Required information.* The information required to be furnished under this paragraph (d)(3) shall be based upon the information provided by or on behalf of the recipient of an amount subject to reporting (as corrected and supplemented based on the withholding agent's actual knowledge) or the presumption rules provided under § 1.1471-3(f) for a U.S. withholding agent and under § 1.1471-4(c)(3)(ii) and (c)(4)(i) for a participating FFI. The Form 1042-S must include the following information, if applicable—


(i) The name, address, and EIN or GIIN (as applicable) of the withholding agent (as required on the instructions to the form) and the withholding agent's status for chapter 3 and chapter 4 purposes (as defined in the instructions to the form);


(ii) A description of each category of income or payment made based on the income and payment codes provided on the form (for example, interest, dividends, and gross proceeds) and the aggregate amount in each category expressed in U.S. dollars;


(iii) The rate and amount of withholding applied or, in the case of a payment of U.S. source FDAP income not subject to withholding and reportable under paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the basis for exempting the payment from withholding under chapter 4 based on exemption codes provided on the form);


(iv) The name and address of the recipient and its TIN or GIIN (as applicable) and foreign taxpayer identification number and date of birth (as required on the instructions to the form);


(v) In the case of a payment to a person (including a flow-through entity or U.S. branch) for which the payment is reported as effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business in the United States or, in the case of a U.S. branch that is treated as a U.S. person, the EIN used by the person or U.S. branch to file its U.S. income tax returns;


(vi) The name, address of any FFI, flow-through entity that is an NFFE, or U.S. branch or territory financial institution that is not treated as a U.S. person when an account holder or owner of such entity (including an unknown recipient or owner) is treated as the recipient of the payment;


(vii) The EIN or GIIN (as applicable), status for chapter 3 and chapter 4 purposes (as required on the instructions to the form) of an entity reported under paragraph (d)(3)(vi) of this section;


(viii) The country of incorporation or organization (based on the country codes provided on the form) of any entity the name of which appears on the form; and


(ix) Such information as the form or instructions may require in addition to, or in lieu of, information required under this paragraph (d)(3).


(4) *Method of reporting*—(i) *Payments by U.S. withholding agent to recipients.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(4) or on the Form 1042-S and its accompanying instructions, a withholding agent that is a U.S. person (including a U.S. branch that is treated as a U.S. person and excluding a foreign branch of a U.S. person that is a QI) and that makes a payment of a chapter 4 reportable amount must file a separate form for each recipient that receives such amount. Except as otherwise provided on Form 1042-S or its instructions, only payments for which the income or payment code, exemption code, withholding rate, and recipient code are the same may be reported on a single form filed with the IRS. See paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section for reporting of payments made to a person that is not a recipient and that is otherwise required to be reported on Form 1042-S.


(A) *Payments to certain entities that are beneficial owners.* If the beneficial owner of a payment made by a U.S. withholding agent is an exempt beneficial owner, an FFI, an NFFE, or a territory entity, it must complete Form 1042-S treating such entity as the recipient of the payment.


(B) *Payments to participating FFIs, deemed-compliant FFIs, and certain QIs.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B), a U.S. withholding agent that makes a payment of a chapter 4 reportable amount to a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI that is an NQI, NWP, or NWT must complete a Form 1042-S treating such FFI as the recipient. With respect to a payment of U.S. source FDAP income made to a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI that is an NQI, NWP, or NWT or QI that elects to be withheld upon under section 1471(b)(3) and from whom the withholding agent receives an FFI withholding statement allocating the payment (or portion of the payment) to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool, a U.S. withholding agent must complete a separate Form 1042-S issued to the participating FFI, registered deemed-compliant FFI, or QI (as applicable) as the recipient with respect to each such pool identified on an FFI withholding statement, described in § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B)(*2*). If, however, a participating FFI, deemed-compliant FFI, or QI (as applicable) has made an election under § 1.1471-4(b)(3)(iii), for the portion of the payment that the FFI allocates to each recalcitrant account holder that is subject to backup withholding under section 3406, the withholding agent must report on Form 1099 the amount of the payment and tax withheld in accordance with the form's requirements and accompanying instructions. See § 1.1471-2(a)(2)(i) for the requirement of a withholding agent to withhold on payments of U.S. source FDAP income made to a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI that is an NQI, NWP, or NWT. See also § 1.1471-2(a)(2)(iii) in the case of payments made to a QI. See § 1.1461-1(c)(4)(A) for the extent to which reporting is required under that section for U.S. source FDAP income that is reportable on Form 1042-S under chapter 3 and not subject to withholding under chapter 4, in which case the U.S. withholding agent must report in the manner described under § 1.1461-1(c)(4)(ii) and paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section. See paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for reporting rules applicable if participating FFIs or deemed-compliant FFIs provide specific payee information for reporting to the recipient of the payment for Form 1042-S reporting purposes. See paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section for the residual reporting responsibilities of an NQI, NWP, or NWT that is an FFI.


(C) *Amounts paid to a U.S. branch.* A U.S. withholding agent making a payment of U.S. source FDAP income to a U.S. branch shall complete Form 1042-S as follows—


(*1*) If the U.S. branch is treated as a U.S. person, if the withholding agent treats amounts paid as effectively connected with the conduct of the branch's trade or business in the United States, or if the U.S. branch is the beneficial owner of the payment, the withholding agent must file Form 1042-S reporting the U.S. branch as the recipient;


(*2*) If the U.S. branch of an FFI is not treated as a U.S. person and applies the rules described in § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C) and provides the withholding agent with a withholding certificate that transmits information regarding its reporting pools referenced in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B) of this section or information regarding each recipient that is an account holder or payee of the U.S. branch, the withholding agent must complete a separate Form 1042-S issued to the U.S. branch for each such pool to the extent required on the form and its accompanying instructions or must complete a separate Form 1042-S issued to each recipient whose documentation is associated with the U.S. branch's withholding certificate as described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section and report the U.S. branch as an entity not treated as a recipient; or


(*3*) If the U.S. branch of an FFI is not treated as a U.S. person and applies the rules described in § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C) to the extent it fails to provide sufficient information regarding its account holders or payees, the withholding agent shall report the recipient of the payment as an unknown recipient to the extent recipient information is not provided and report the U.S. branch as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for an entity not treated as a recipient.


(D) *Amounts paid to territory financial institutions that are flow-through entities or acting as intermediaries.* A U.S. withholding agent making a withholdable payment to a territory financial institution that is a flow-through entity or that acts as an intermediary must complete Form 1042-S as follows—


(*1*) If the territory financial institution is treated as a U.S. person or is the beneficial owner of the payment, the withholding agent must file Form 1042-S treating the territory financial institution as the recipient;


(*2*) If the territory financial institution is not treated as a U.S. person and provides the withholding agent with a withholding certificate that transmits information regarding each recipient that is an partner, beneficiary, owner, account holder, or payee, the withholding agent must complete a separate Form 1042-S for each recipient whose documentation is associated with the territory financial institution's withholding certificate as described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section and must report the territory financial institution under that paragraph; or


(*3*) If the territory financial institution is not treated as a U.S. person, to the extent its fails to provide sufficient information regarding its partners, beneficiaries, owners, account holders or payees, the withholding agent shall report the recipient of the payment as an unknown recipient and report the territory financial institution as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for an entity not treated as a recipient.


(E) *Amounts paid to NFFEs.* A U.S. withholding agent that makes payments of chapter 4 reportable amounts to an excepted or passive NFFE shall complete Forms 1042-S treating the NFFE as the recipient, except when the NFFE is a flow-through entity or acting as an intermediary and the partner or beneficiary is treated as the payee. In cases in which the chapter 4 reportable amount is also an amount of U.S. source FDAP income reportable on Form 1042-S (described in § 1.1441-2(a)), see also § 1.1461-1(c)(4)(ii)(A) for the extent to which reporting is required with respect to the partners, beneficiaries, or owners of such entities.


(ii) *Payments made by withholding agents to certain entities that are not recipients*—(A) *Entities that provide information for a withholding agent to perform specific payee reporting.* If a U.S. withholding agent makes a payment of a chapter 4 reportable amount to a flow-through entity that is a passive NFFE, a nonparticipating FFI receiving a payment on behalf of an exempt beneficial owner, or a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI that is an NQI, NWP, or NWT, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the withholding agent must complete a separate Form 1042-S for each recipient that is a partner, beneficiary, owner, or account holder of such entity to the extent the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with valid documentation (under the rules of § 1.1471-3(c) and (d)) provided by such entity, as applicable, with respect to each such recipient. If a payment is made through tiers of such entities, the withholding agent must nevertheless complete Form 1042-S for the recipient to the extent it can reliably associate the payment with documentation provided with respect to that recipient. A withholding agent that is completing a Form 1042-S for a recipient described in this paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) must include on the form the information described in paragraph (d)(3)(vii) of this section for the entity through which the recipient directly receives the payment.


(B) *Nonparticipating FFI that is a flow-through entity or intermediary.* If a withholding agent makes a payment of a chapter 4 reportable amount to a nonparticipating FFI that it is required to treat as an intermediary with regard to a payment or as a flow-through entity under rules described in § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii), and except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A)(*1*)(*x*) of this section (relating to an exempt beneficial owner), the withholding agent must report the recipient of the payment as an unknown recipient and report the nonparticipating FFI as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for an entity not treated as a recipient.


(C) *Disregarded entities.* If a U.S. withholding agent makes a payment to a disregarded entity and receives a valid withholding certificate or other documentary evidence from the person that is the single owner of such disregarded entity, the withholding agent must file a Form 1042-S treating the single owner as the recipient in accordance with the instructions to the Form 1042-S.


(iii) *Reporting by participating FFIs and deemed-compliant FFIs (including QIs, WPs, and WTs) and U.S. branches of FFIs not treated as U.S. persons*—(A) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(B) (relating to NQIs, NWPs, NWTs, and FFIs electing under section 1471(b)(3)) and § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(ii)(F) (relating to transitional payee-specific reporting for payments to nonparticipating FFIs), a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI (including a QI, WP, or WT), and a U.S. branch of an FFI that is not treated as a U.S. person that applies the rules described in § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C) that makes a payment that is a chapter 4 reportable amount to a recalcitrant account holder or nonparticipating FFI must complete a Form 1042-S to report such payments. A participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a QI, WP, or WT), and a U.S. branch of an FFI that is not treated as a U.S. person that applies the rules described in § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C) may report in pools consisting of its recalcitrant account holders and payees that are nonparticipating FFIs. With respect to recalcitrant account holders, the FFI may report in pools consisting of recalcitrant account holders within a particular status described in § 1.1471-4(d)(6) and within a particular income code. Except as otherwise provided in § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(ii)(F), with respect to payees that are nonparticipating FFIs, the FFI may report in pools consisting of one or more nonparticipating FFIs that fall within a particular income code and within a particular status code described in the instructions to Form 1042-S. Alternatively, a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a QI, WP, or WT) and a U.S. branch of an FFI that is not treated as a U.S. person that applies the rules described in § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C) may (and a certified deemed-compliant FFI is required to) perform payee-specific reporting to report a chapter 4 reportable amount paid to a recalcitrant account holder or a nonparticipating FFI when withholding was applied (or should have applied) to the payment.


(B) *Special reporting requirements of participating FFIs, deemed-compliant FFIs, FFIs that make an election under section 1471(b)(3), and U.S. branches of FFIs not treated as U.S. persons.* Except as otherwise provided in § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(ii)(F), a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI that is an NQI, NWP, or NWT, and a U.S. branch of an FFI that is not treated as a U.S. person that applies the rules described in § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(iii)(C) or an FFI that has made an election under section 1471(b)(3) and has provided sufficient information to its withholding agent to withhold and report the payment is not required to report the payment on Form 1042-S as described in paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(A) of this section if the payment is made to a nonparticipating FFI or recalcitrant account holder and its withholding agent has withheld the correct amount of tax on such payment and correctly reported the payment on a Form 1042-S. Such FFI or branch is required to report a payment, however, when the FFI knows, or has reason to know, that less than the required amount has been withheld by the withholding agent on the payment or the withholding agent has not correctly reported the payment on Form 1042-S. In such case, the FFI or branch must report on Form 1042-S to the extent required under paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(A) of this section. See, however, § 1.1471-4(d)(6) for the requirement to report certain aggregate information regarding accounts held by recalcitrant account holders on Form 8966, “FATCA Report,” regardless of whether withholdable payments are made to such accounts.


(C) *Reporting by a U.S. branch treated as a U.S. person.* A U.S. branch treated as a U.S. person (as defined in § 1.1471-1(b)(135)) must report amounts paid to recipients on Forms 1042-S in the same manner as a U.S. withholding agent under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.


(iv) *Reporting by territory financial institutions.* A territory financial institution that is not treated as a U.S. person will not be required to report on Form 1042-S if another withholding agent has reported the same amount with regard to the same recipient for which such entity would otherwise be required to file a return under this paragraph (d)(4)(iv) and such withholding agent has withheld the entire amount required to be withheld from such payment. A territory financial institution must, however, report payments made to recipients for whom it has failed to provide the appropriate documentation to another withholding agent or to the extent it knows, or has reason to know, that less than the required amount has been withheld. A territory financial institution that is treated as a U.S. person or is otherwise required under this paragraph (d)(4)(iv) to report amounts paid to recipients on Forms 1042-S must report in the same manner as a U.S. withholding agent.


(v) *Nonparticipating FFIs.* A nonparticipating FFI that is a flow-through entity or that acts as an intermediary with respect to a payment may file Forms 1042 and 1042-S only to report and allocate tax withheld to the account holders, partners, owners, or beneficiaries of the nonparticipating FFI.


(vi) *Other withholding agents.* Any person that is a withholding agent that is not described in any of paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (v) of this section shall file Forms 1042-S in the same manner as a U.S. withholding agent and in accordance with the instructions to the form.


(vii) *Combined Form 1042-S reporting.* A withholding agent required to report on Form 1042-S under paragraph (d)(4) of this section (other than a nonparticipating FFI reporting under paragraph (d)(4)(v) of this section) may rely on the procedures used for chapter 3 purposes (provided in published guidance) for reporting on Form 1042-S (even if the withholding agent is not required to report under chapter 3) for combined reporting following a merger or acquisition, provided that all of the requirements for such reporting provided in the Instructions for Form 1042-S are satisfied.


(e) *Reporting in electronic form.* See §§ 301.6011-2(b) and 301.6011-15 of this chapter, which apply for purposes of this section, for the requirements of a withholding agent that is not a financial institution with respect to the filing of Forms 1042-S and Form 1042 in electronic form. See § 301.1474-1(a) of this chapter for the requirements applicable to a withholding agent that is a financial institution with respect to the filing of Forms 1042 and 1042-S in electronic form.


(f) *Indemnification of withholding agent.* A withholding agent is indemnified against the claims and demands of any person for the amount of any tax it deducts and withholds in accordance with the provisions of chapter 4 and the regulations thereunder. A withholding agent that withholds based on a reasonable belief that such withholding is required under chapter 4 and the regulations thereunder is treated for purposes of section 1474 and this paragraph (f) as having withheld tax in accordance with the provisions of chapter 4 and the regulations thereunder. This paragraph (f) does not relieve a withholding agent from tax liability under chapter 3 or chapter 4 or the regulations under those chapters.


(g) *Extensions of time to file Forms 1042 and 1042-S.* The IRS may grant an extension of time to file Form 1042 or 1042-S as described in § 1.1461-1(g).


(h) *Penalties.* For penalties and additions to tax for failure to file returns or file and furnish statements in accordance with this section, see sections 6651, 6662, 6663, 6721, 6722, 6723, 6724(c), 7201, 7203, and the regulations under those sections. For penalties and additions to tax for failure to timely pay the tax required to be withheld under chapter 4, see sections 6656, 6672, 7202, and the regulations under those sections.


(i) *Additional reporting requirements with respect to U.S. owned foreign entities and owner-documented FFIs*—(1) *Reporting by certain withholding agents with respect to owner-documented FFIs*—(i) Beginning on July 1, 2014, if a withholding agent (other than an FFI reporting accounts held by owner-documented FFIs under § 1.1471-4(d)) makes a withholdable payment to an entity account holder or payee of an obligation and the withholding agent treats the entity as an owner-documented FFI under § 1.1471-3(d)(6), the withholding agent is required to report for July 1 through December 31, 2014, with respect to each specified U.S. person identified in § 1.1471-3(d)(6)(iv)(A)(*1*) and (*2*) the information described in paragraph (i)(1)(iii) of this section.


(ii) Beginning in calendar year 2015, if a withholding agent (other than an FFI reporting accounts held by owner-documented FFIs under § 1.1471-4(d)) makes during a calendar year a withholdable payment to an entity account holder or payee of an obligation and the withholding agent treats the entity as an owner-documented FFI under § 1.1471-3(d)(6), the withholding agent is required to report for such calendar year with respect to each specified U.S. person identified in § 1.1471-3(d)(6)(iv)(A)(*1*) and (*2*) the information described in paragraph (i)(1)(iii) of this section.


(iii) The information that a withholding agent (other than an FFI reporting accounts held by owner-documented FFIs under § 1.1471-4(d)) is required to report under paragraphs (i)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section must be made on Form 8966 (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) and filed on or before March 31 of the calendar year following the year in which the withholdable payment was made. A withholding agent is not required to report under paragraph (i)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section on a withholdable payment made to a participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI that is allocated to a payee that is an owner-documented FFI on an FFI withholding statement when the participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI includes on the statement the certification described in § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B)(*2*)(*v*), provided that the withholding agent does not know or have reason to know that the certification is incorrect or unreliable. The report must contain the following information—


(A) The name of the owner-documented FFI;


(B) The name, address, and TIN of each specified U.S. person identified in § 1.1471-3(d)(6)(iv)(A)(*1*) and (*2*);


(C) For the period from July 1 through December 31, 2014, the total of all withholdable payments made to the owner-documented FFI, and with respect to payments made after the 2014 calendar year, the total of all withholdable payments made to the owner-documented FFI during the calendar year;


(D) The account balance or value of the account held by the owner-documented FFI; and


(E) Any other information required on Form 8966 and its accompanying instructions provided for purposes of such reporting. iii) through (i)(1)(iii)(E).


(2) *Reporting by certain withholding agents with respect to U.S. owned foreign entities that are passive NFFEs.* Beginning on July 1, 2014, in addition to the reporting on Form 1042-S required under paragraph (d)(4)(i)(E) of this section, a withholding agent (other than an FFI reporting accounts held by NFFEs under § 1.1471-4(d)) that makes a withholdable payment to, and receives information about any substantial U.S. owners of, a passive NFFE that is not an excepted NFFE as defined in § 1.1472-1(c) shall file a report with the IRS for the period from July 1 through December 31, 2014, and in each subsequent calendar year in which a withholdable payment is made with respect to any substantial U.S. owners of such NFFE. Such report must be made on Form 8966 (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) and filed on or before March 31 of the calendar year following the year in which the withholdable payment was made. A withholding agent is not required to report under this paragraph (i)(2) on a withholdable payment made to a participating FFI or a registered deemed-compliant FFI that is allocated to a payee that is a passive NFFE with one or more substantial U.S. owners on an FFI withholding statement when the participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI includes on the statement the certification described in § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B)(*2*)(*iv*), provided that the withholding agent does not know or have reason to know that the certification is incorrect or unreliable. In the case of an entity to which the preceding sentence does not apply that is a flow-through entity or is acting as an intermediary receiving a withholdable payment allocable to a passive NFFE with one or more substantial U.S. owners, the entity is not required to report with respect to the passive NFFE under this paragraph (i)(2) if it provides to the withholding agent from which it receives the payment documentation sufficient for the withholding agent to report information with respect to the passive NFFE under this paragraph (i)(2), provided that the intermediary or flow-through entity does not know or have reason to know that the withholding agent does not report with respect to the passive NFFE under this paragraph (i)(2). The report must contain the following information—


(i) Name of the NFFE that is owned by a substantial U.S. owner;


(ii) The name, address, and TIN of each substantial U.S. owner of such NFFE;


(iii) For the period from July 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, the total of all withholdable payments made to the NFFE and, with respect to payments made after the 2014 calendar year, the total of all withholdable payments made to the NFFE during the calendar year; and


(iv) Any other information as required by the form and its accompanying instructions.


(3) *Cross reference to reporting by participating FFIs.* For the reporting requirements of a participating FFI with respect to an account holder that is a U.S. owned foreign entity or that it treats as an owner-documented FFI, see § 1.1471-4(d).


(4) *Extensions of time to file.* The IRS shall grant an automatic 90-day extension of time in which to file Form 8966 as required under paragraph (i)(1) or (i)(2) of this section. Form 8809-I, “Application of Extension of Time to File FATCA Form 8966,” (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) must be used to request such extension of time and must be filed no later than the due date of Form 8966. Under certain hardship conditions, the IRS may grant an additional 90-day extension. A request for extension due to hardship must contain a statement of the reasons for requesting the extension and such other information as the form or instructions may require.


(j) *Applicability date.* The rules of this section apply to returns required to be filed for taxable years ending on or after December 31, 2023.
