# § 1.216-2   Treatment as property subject to depreciation.

(a) *General rule.* For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961, stock in a cooperative housing corporation (as defined by section 216(b) (1) and paragraph (c) of § 1.216-1) owned by a tenant-stockholder (as defined by section 216(b) (2) and paragraph (d) of § 1.216-1) who uses the proprietary lease or right of tenancy, which was conferred on him solely by reason of his ownership of such stock, in a trade or business or for the production of income shall be treated as property subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167(a) in the manner and to the extent prescribed in this section. 


(b) *Determination of allowance for depreciation*—(1) *In general.* Subject to the special rules provided in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph and the limitation provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the allowance for depreciation for the taxable year with respect to stock of a tenant-stockholder, subject to the extent provided in this section to an allowance for depreciation, shall be determined: 


(i) By computing the amount of depreciation (amortization in the case of a leasehold) which would be allowable under one of the methods of depreciation prescribed in section 167(b) and the regulations thereunder (in paragraph (a) of § 1.162-11 and § 1.167(a)-4 in the case of a leasehold) in respect of the depreciable (amortizable) real property owned by the cooperative housing corporation in which such tenant-stockholder has a proprietary lease or right of tenancy, 


(ii) By reducing the amount of depreciation (amortization) so computed in the same ratio as the rentable space in such property which is not subject to a proprietary lease or right of tenancy by reason of stock ownership but which is held for rental purposes bears to the total rentable space in such property, and 


(iii) By computing such tenant-stockholder's proportionate share of such annual depreciation (amortization), so reduced. 


(2) *Stock acquired subsequent to first offering.* Except as provided in subparagraph (3), in the case of a tenant-stockholder who purchases stock other than as part of the first offering of stock by the corporation, the basis of the depreciable real property for purposes of the computation required by subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph shall be the amount obtained by: 


(i) Multiplying the taxpayer's cost per share by the total number of outstanding shares of stock of the corporation, including any shares held by the corporation, 


(ii) Adding thereto the mortgage indebtedness to which such depreciable real property is subject on the date of purchase of such stock, and 


(iii) Subtracting from the sum so obtained the portion thereof not properly allocable as of the date such stock was purchased to the depreciable real property owned by the cooperative housing corporation in which such tenant-stockholder has a proprietary lease or right of tenancy. 


(3) *Conversion subsequent to date of acquisition.* In the case of a tenant-stockholder whose proprietary lease or right of tenancy is converted, in whole or in part, to use in a trade or business or for the production of income on a date subsequent to the date on which he acquired the stock conferring on him such lease or right of tenancy, the basis of the depreciable real property for purposes of the computation required by subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph shall be the fair market value of such depreciable real property on the date of the conversion if the fair market value is less than the adjusted basis of such property in the hands of the cooperative housing corporation provided in section 1011 without taking into account any adjustment for depreciation required by section 1016(a)(2). Such fair market value shall be deemed to be equal to the adjusted basis of such property, taking into account adjustments required by section 1016(a)(2) computed as if the corporation had used the straight line method of depreciation, in the absence of evidence establishing that the fair market value so attributed to the property is unrealistic. In the case of a tenant-stockholder who purchases stock other than as part of the first offering of stock of the corporation, and at a later date converts his proprietary lease to use for business or production of income: 


(i) The adjusted basis of the cooperative housing corporation's depreciable real property without taking into account any adjustment for depreciation shall be the amount determined in accordance with subdivisions (i), (ii), and (iii) of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, and 


(ii) The fair market value shall be deemed to be equal to such adjusted basis reduced by the amount of depreciation, computed under the straight line method, which would have been allowable in respect of depreciable real property having a cost or other basis equal to the amount representing such adjusted basis in the absence of evidence establishing that the fair market value so attributed to the property is unrealistic. 


(c) *Limitation.* If the allowance for depreciation for the taxable year determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section exceeds the adjusted basis (provided in section 1011) of the stock described in paragraph (a) of this section allocable to the tenant-stockholder's proprietary lease or right of tenancy used in a trade or business or for the production of income, such excess is not allowable as a deduction. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, such excess, subject to the provisions of this paragraph (c), is allowable as a deduction for depreciation in the succeeding taxable year. To determine the portion of the adjusted basis of such stock which is allocable to such proprietary lease or right of tenancy, the adjusted basis is reduced by taking into account the same factors as are taken into account under paragraph (b)(1) of this section in determining the allowance for depreciation.


(d) *Examples.* The provisions of section 216(c) and this section may be illustrated by the following examples:
