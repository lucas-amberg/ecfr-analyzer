# § 1.848-2   Determination of net premiums.

(a) *Net premiums*—(1) *In general.* An insurance company must use the accrual method of accounting (as prescribed by section 811(a)(1)) to determine the net premiums with respect to each category of specified insurance contracts. With respect to any category of contracts, net premiums means—


(i) The gross amount of premiums and other consideration (see paragraph (b) of this section); reduced by


(ii) The sum of—


(A) The return premiums (see paragraph (e) of this section); and


(B) The net negative consideration for a reinsurance agreement (other than an agreement described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section). See paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section for rules relating to the determination of net negative consideration.


(2) *Separate determination of net premiums for certain reinsurance agreements.* Net premiums with respect to reinsurance agreements for which an election under paragraph (h)(3) of this section has been made (certain reinsurance agreements with parties not subject to United States taxation) are treated separately and are subject to the rules of paragraph (h) of this section.


(b) *Gross amount of premiums and other consideration*—(1) *General rule.* The term “gross amount of premiums and other consideration” means the sum of—


(i) All premiums and other consideration (other than amounts on reinsurance agreements); and


(ii) The net positive consideration for any reinsurance agreement (other than an agreement for which an election under paragraph (h)(3) of this section has been made).


(2) *Items included.* The gross amount of premiums and other consideration includes—


(i) Advance premiums;


(ii) Amounts in a premium deposit fund or similar account, to the extent provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section;


(iii) Fees;


(iv) Assessments;


(v) Amounts that the insurance company charges itself representing premiums with respect to benefits for its employees (including full-time life insurance salesmen treated as employees under section 7701(a)(20)); and


(vi) The value of a new contract issued in an exchange described in paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section.


(3) *Treatment of premium deposits*—(i) *In general.* An amount in a premium deposit fund or similar account is taken into account in determining the gross amount of premiums and other consideration at the earlier of the time that the amount is applied to, or irrevocably committed to, the payment of a premium on a specified insurance contract. If an amount is irrevocably committed to the payment of a premium on a specified insurance contract, then neither that amount nor any earnings allocable to that amount are included in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration when applied to the payment of a premium on the same contract.


(ii) *Amounts irrevocably committed to the payment of premiums.* Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, an amount in a premium deposit fund or similar account is irrevocably committed to the payment of premiums on a contract only if neither the amount nor any earnings allocable to that amount may be—


(A) Returned to the policyholder or any other person (other than on surrender of the contract); or


(B) Used by the policyholder to fund another contract.


(iii) *Retired lives reserves.* Premiums received by an insurance company under a retired lives reserve arrangement are treated as irrevocably committed to the payment of premiums on a specified insurance contract.


(4) *Deferred and uncollected premiums.* The gross amount of premiums and other consideration does not include deferred and uncollected premiums.


(c) *Policy exchanges*—(1) *General rule.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), an exchange of insurance contracts (including a change in the terms of a specified insurance contract) does not result in any amount being included in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration.


(2) *External exchanges.* If a contract is exchanged for a specified insurance contract issued by another insurance company, the company that issues the new contract must include the value of the new contract in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration.


(3) *Internal exchanges resulting in fundamentally different contracts*—(i) *In general.* If a contract is exchanged for a specified insurance contract issued by the same insurance company that issued the original contract, the company must include the value of the new contract in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration if the new contract—


(A) Relates to a different category of specified insurance contract than the original contract;


(B) Does not cover the same insured as the original contract; or


(C) Changes the interest, mortality, morbidity, or expense guarantees with respect to the nonforfeiture benefits provided in the original contract.


(ii) *Certain modifications treated as not changing the mortality, morbidity, interest, or expense guarantees.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C) of this section, the following items are not treated as changing the interest, mortality, morbidity, or expense guarantees with respect to the nonforfeiture benefits provided in the contract—


(A) A change in a temporary guarantee with respect to the amounts to be credited as interest to the policyholder's account, or charged as mortality, morbidity, or expense charges, if the new guarantee applies for a period of ten years or less;


(B) The determination of benefits on annuitization using rates which are more favorable to the policyholder than the permanently guaranteed rates; and


(C) Other items as specified by the Commissioner in subsequent guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.


(iii) *Exception for contracts restructured by a court supervised rehabilitation or similar proceeding.* No amount is included in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration with respect to any change made to the interest, mortality, morbidity, or expense guarantees with respect to the nonforfeiture benefits of contracts of an insurance company that is the subject of a rehabilitation, conservatorship, insolvency, or similar state proceeding. This treatment applies only if the change—


(A) Occurs as part of the rehabilitation, conservatorship, insolvency, or similar state proceeding; and


(B) Is approved by the state court, the state insurance department, or other state official with authority to act in the rehabilitation, conservatorship, insolvency, or similar state proceeding.


(4) *Value of the contract*—(i) *In general.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, the value of the new contract is established through the most recent sale by the company of a comparable contract. If the value of the new contract is not readily ascertainable, the value may be approximated by using the interpolated terminal reserve of the original contract as of the date of the exchange.


(ii) *Special rule for group term life insurance contracts.* In the case of any exchange involving a group term life insurance contract without cash value, the value of the new contract is deemed to be zero.


(iii) *Special rule for certain policy enhancement and update programs*—(A) *In general.* If the interest, mortality, morbidity, or expense guarantees with respect to the nonforfeiture benefits of a specified insurance contract are changed pursuant to a policy enhancement or update program, the value of the contract included in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration equals 30 percent of the value determined under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.


(B) *Policy enhancement or update program defined.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, a policy enhancement or update program means any offer or commitment by the insurance company to all of the policyholders holding a particular policy form to change the interest, mortality, morbidity, or expense guarantees used to determine the contract's nonforfeiture benefits.


(5) *Example.* The principles of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by the following example.


(d) *Amounts excluded from the gross amount of premiums and other consideration*—(1) *In general.* The following items are not included in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration—


(i) Items treated by section 808(e) as policyholder dividends that are paid to the policyholder and immediately returned to the insurance company as a premium on the same contract that generated the dividends, including—


(A) A policyholder dividend applied to pay a premium under the contract that generated the dividend;


(B) Excess interest accumulated within the contract;


(C) A policyholder dividend applied for additional coverage (for example, a paid-up addition, extension of the period for which insurance protection is provided, or reduction of the period for which premiums are paid) on the contract that generated the dividend;


(D) A policyholder dividend applied to reduce premiums otherwise payable on the contract that generated the dividend;


(E) An experience-rated refund applied to pay a premium on the group contract that generated the refund; and 


(F) An experience-rated refund applied to a premium stabilization reserve held with respect to the group contract that generated the refund;


(ii) Premiums waived as a result of the disability of an insured or the disability or death of a premium payor;


(iii) Premiums considered to be paid on a contract as the result of a partial surrender or withdrawal from the contract, or as a result of the surrender or withdrawal of a paid-up addition previously issued with respect to the same contract; and


(iv) Amounts treated as premiums upon the selection by a policyholder or by a beneficiary of a settlement option provided in a life insurance contract.


(2) *Amounts received or accrued from a guaranty association.* Amounts received or accrued from a guaranty association relating to an insurance company that is subject to an insolvency, delinquency, conservatorship, rehabilitation, or similar proceeding are not included in the gross amount of premiums and other consideration.


(3) *Exclusion not to apply to dividend accumulations.* For purposes of section 848(d)(3) and paragraph (d)(1) of this section, amounts applied from a dividend accumulation account to pay premiums on a specified insurance contract are not amounts treated as paid to, and immediately returned by, the policyholder.


(e) *Return premiums.* For purposes of section 848(d)(1)(B) and this section, return premiums do not include policyholder dividends (as defined in section 808), claims or benefits payments, or amounts returned to another insurance company under a reinsurance agreement. For the treatment of amounts returned to another insurance company under a reinsurance agreement, see paragraph (f) of this section.


(f) *Net consideration for a reinsurance agreement*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of section 848, the ceding company and the reinsurer must treat amounts arising from the reinsurance of a specified insurance contract consistently in determining their net premiums. See paragraph (g) of this section for restrictions on the amount of the net negative consideration for any reinsurance agreement that may be taken into account. See paragraph (h) of this section for special rules applicable to reinsurance agreements with parties not subject to United States taxation.


(2) *Net consideration determined by a ceding company*—(i) *In general.* The net consideration determined by a ceding company for a reinsurance agreement equals—


(A) The gross amount incurred by the reinsurer with respect to the reinsurance agreement, including any ceding commissions, annual allowances, reimbursements of claims and benefits, modified coinsurance reserve adjustments under paragraph (f)(5) of this section, experience-rated adjustments, and termination payments; less


(B) The gross amount of premiums and other consideration incurred by the ceding company with respect to the reinsurance agreement.


(ii) *Net negative and net positive consideration.* If the net consideration is less than zero, the ceding company has net negative consideration for the reinsurance agreement. If the net consideration is greater than zero, the ceding company has net positive consideration for the reinsurance agreement.


(3) *Net consideration determined by the reinsurer*—(i) *In general.* The net consideration determined by a reinsurer for a reinsurance agreement equals—


(A) The amount described in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section; less


(B) The amount described in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section.


(ii) *Net negative and net positive consideration.* If the net consideration is less than zero, the reinsurer has net negative consideration for the reinsurance agreement. If the net consideration is greater than zero, the reinsurer has net positive consideration for the reinsurance agreement.


(4) *Timing consistency required.* For purposes of determining the net consideration of a party for a reinsurance agreement, an income or expense item is taken into account for the first taxable year for which the item is required to be taken into account by either party. Thus, the ceding company and the reinsurer must take the item into account for the same taxable year (or for the same period if the parties have different taxable years).


(5) *Modified coinsurance and funds-withheld reinsurance agreements*—(i) *In general.* In the case of a modified coinsurance or funds-withheld reinsurance agreement, the net consideration for the agreement includes the amount of any payments or reserve adjustments, as well as any related loan transactions between the ceding company and the reinsurer. The amount of any investment income transferred between the parties as the result of a reserve adjustment or loan transaction is treated as an item of consideration under the reinsurance agreement.


(ii) *Special rule for certain funds-withheld reinsurance agreements.* In the case of a funds-withheld reinsurance agreement that is entered into after November 14, 1991, but before the first day of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1991, and is terminated before January 1, 1995, the parties' net consideration in the year of termination must include the amount of the original reserve for any reinsured specified insurance contract that, in applying the provisions of subchapter L, was treated as premiums and other consideration incurred for reinsurance for the taxable year in which the agreement became effective.


(6) *Treatment of retrocessions.* For purposes of this paragraph (f), a retrocession agreement is treated as a separate reinsurance agreement. The party that is relieved of liability under a retrocession agreement is treated as the ceding company.


(7) *Mixed reinsurance agreement.* If a reinsurance agreement includes more than one category of specified insurance contracts (or specified insurance contracts and contracts that are not specified insurance contracts), the portion of the agreement relating to each category of reinsured specified insurance contracts is treated as a separate agreement. The portion of the agreement relating to reinsured contracts that are not specified insurance contracts is similarly treated as a separate agreement.


(8) *Treatment of policyholder loans.* For purposes of determining the net consideration under a reinsurance agreement, the transfer of a policyholder loan receivable is treated as an item of consideration under the agreement. The interest credited with respect to a policyholder loan receivable is treated as investment income earned directly by the party holding the receivable. The amounts taken into account as claims and benefit reimbursements under the agreement must be determined without reduction for the policyholder loan.


(9) *Examples.* The principles of this paragraph (f) are illustrated by the following examples.


(g) *Reduction in the amount of net negative consideration to ensure consistency of capitalization for reinsurance agreements*—(1) *In general.* Paragraph (g)(3) of this section provides for a reduction in the amount of net negative consideration that a party to a reinsurance agreement (other than a reinsurance agreement described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section) may take into account in determining net premiums under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section if the party with net positive consideration has a capitalization shortfall (as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section). Unless the party with net negative consideration demonstrates that the party with net positive consideration does not have a capitalization shortfall or demonstrates the amount of the other party's capitalization shortfall which is allocable to the reinsurance agreement, the net negative consideration that may be taken into account under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section is zero. However, the reduction of paragraph (g)(3) of this section does not apply to a reinsurance agreement if the parties make a joint election under paragraph (g)(8) of this section. Under the election, the party with net positive consideration capitalizes specified policy acquisition expenses with respect to the agreement without regard to the general deductions limitation of section 848(c)(1).


(2) *Application to reinsurance agreements subject to the interim rules.* In applying this paragraph (g) to a reinsurance agreement that is subject to the interim rules of § 1.848-3, the term “premiums and other consideration incurred for reinsurance under section 848(d)(1)(B)” is substituted for “net negative consideration,” and the term “gross amount of premiums and other consideration under section 848(d)(1)(A)” is substituted for “net positive consideration.” If an insurance company has “premiums and other consideration incurred for reinsurance under section 848(d)(1)(B)” and a “gross amount of premiums and other consideration under section 848(d)(1)(A)” for the same agreement, the net of these amounts is taken into account for purposes of this paragraph (g).


(3) *Amount of reduction.* The reduction required by this paragraph (g)(3) equals the amount obtained by dividing—


(i) The portion of the capitalization shortfall (as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) allocated to the reinsurance agreement under paragraph (g)(7) of this section; by


(ii) The applicable percentage set forth in section 848(c)(1) for the category of specified insurance contracts reinsured by the agreement.


(4) *Capitalization shortfall.* A “capitalization shortfall” equals the excess of—


(i) The sum of the required capitalization amounts (as defined in paragraph (g)(5) of this section) for all reinsurance agreements (other than reinsurance agreements for which an election has been made under paragraph (h)(3) of this section); over


(ii) The general deductions allocated to those reinsurance agreements, as determined under paragraph (g)(6) of this section.


(5) *Required capitalization amount*—(i) *In general.* The “required capitalization amount” for a reinsurance agreement (other than a reinsurance agreement for which an election has been made under paragraph (h)(3) of this section) equals the amount (either positive or negative) obtained by multiplying—


(A) The net positive or negative consideration for an agreement not described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, and the net positive consideration for an agreement described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, but for which an election under paragraph (h)(3) of this section has not been made; by


(B) The applicable percentage set forth in section 848(c)(1) for that category of specified insurance contracts.


(ii) *Special rule with respect to net negative consideration.* Solely for purposes of computing a party's required capitalization amount under this paragraph (g)(5)—


(A) If either party to the reinsurance agreement is the direct issuer of the reinsured contracts, the party computing its required capitalization amount takes into account the full amount of any net negative consideration without regard to any potential reduction under paragraph (g)(3) of this section; and


(B) If neither party to the reinsurance agreement is the direct issuer of the reinsured contracts, any net negative consideration is deemed to equal zero in computing a party's required capitalization amount except to the extent that the party with the net negative consideration establishes that the other party to that reinsurance agreement capitalizes the appropriate amount.


(6) *General deductions allocable to reinsurance agreements.* An insurance company's general deductions allocable to its reinsurance agreements equals the excess, if any, of—


(i) The company's general deductions (excluding additional amounts treated as general deductions under paragraph (g)(8) of this section); over


(ii) The amount determined under section 848(c)(1) on specified insurance contracts that the insurance company has issued directly (determined without regard to any reinsurance agreements).


(7) *Allocation of capitalization shortfall among reinsurance agreements.* The capitalization shortfall is allocated to each reinsurance agreement for which the required capitalization amount (as determined in paragraph (g)(5) of this section) is a positive amount. The portion of the capitalization shortfall allocable to each agreement equals the amount which bears the same ratio to the capitalization shortfall as the required capitalization amount for the reinsurance agreement bears to the sum of the positive required capitalization amounts.


(8) *Election to determine specified policy acquisition expenses for an agreement without regard to general deductions limitation*—(i) *In general.* The reduction specified by paragraph (g)(3) of this section does not apply if the parties to a reinsurance agreement make an election under this paragraph (g)(8). The election requires the party with net positive consideration to capitalize specified policy acquisition expenses with respect to the reinsurance agreement without regard to the general deductions limitation of section 848(c)(1). That party must reduce its deductions under section 805 or section 832(c) by the amount, if any, of the party's capitalization shortfall allocable to the reinsurance agreement. The additional capitalized amounts are treated as specified policy acquisition expenses attributable to premiums and other consideration on the reinsurance agreement, and are deductible in accordance with section 848(a)(2).


(ii) *Manner of making election.* To make an election under paragraph (g)(8) of this section, the ceding company and the reinsurer must include an election statement in the reinsurance agreement, either as part of the original terms of the agreement or by an addendum to the agreement. The parties must each attach a schedule to their federal income tax returns which identifies the reinsurance agreement for which the joint election under this paragraph (g)(8) has been made. The schedule must be attached to each of the parties' federal income tax returns filed for the later of—


(A) The first taxable year ending after the election becomes effective; or


(B) The first taxable year ending on or after December 29, 1992.


(iii) *Election statement.* The election statement in the reinsurance agreement must—


(A) Provide that the party with net positive consideration for the reinsurance agreement for each taxable year will capitalize specified policy acquisition expenses with respect to the reinsurance agreement without regard to the general deductions limitation of section 848(a)(1);


(B) Set forth the agreement of the parties to exchange information pertaining to the amount of net consideration under the reinsurance agreement each year to ensure consistency;


(C) Specify the first taxable year for which the election is effective; and


(D) Be signed by both parties.


(iv) *Effect of election.* An election under this paragraph (g)(8) is effective for the first taxable year specified in the election statement and for all subsequent taxable years for which the reinsurance agreement remains in effect. The election may not be revoked without the consent of the Commissioner.


(9) *Example.* The principles of this paragraph (g) are illustrated by the following examples.


(h) *Treatment of reinsurance agreements with parties not subject to U.S. taxation*—(1) *In general.* Unless an election under paragraph (h)(3) of this section is made, an insurance company may not reduce its net premiums by the net negative consideration for the taxable year (or, with respect to a reinsurance agreement that is subject to the interim rules of § 1.848-3, by the premiums and other consideration incurred for reinsurance) under a reinsurance agreement to which this paragraph (h) applies.


(2) *Agreements to which this paragraph (h) applies*—(i) *In general.* This paragraph (h) applies to a reinsurance agreement if, with respect to the premiums and other consideration under the agreement, one party to that agreement is subject to United States taxation and the other party is not.


(ii) *Parties subject to U.S. taxation*—(A) *In general.* A party is subject to United States taxation for this purpose if the party is subject to United States taxation either directly under the provisions of subchapter L of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (subchapter L), or indirectly under the provisions of subpart F of part III of subchapter N of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (subpart F).


(B) *Effect of a closing agreement.* If a reinsurer agrees in a closing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service to be subject to tax under rules equivalent to the provisions of subchapter L on its premiums and other consideration from reinsurance agreements with parties subject to United States taxation, the reinsurer is treated as an insurance company subject to tax under subchapter L.


(3) *Election to separately determine the amounts required to be capitalized for reinsurance agreements with parties not subject to U.S. taxation*—(i) *In general.* This paragraph (h)(3) authorizes an insurance company to make an election to separately determine the amounts required to be capitalized for the taxable year with respect to reinsurance agreements with parties that are not subject to United States taxation. If this election is made, an insurance company separately determines a net foreign capitalization amount for the taxable year for all reinsurance agreements to which this paragraph (h) applies.


(ii) *Manner of making the election.* An insurance company makes the election authorized by this paragraph (h)(3) by attaching an election statement to the federal income tax return (including an amended return) for the taxable year for which the election becomes effective. The election applies to that taxable year and all subsequent taxable years unless permission to revoke the election is obtained from the Commissioner.


(4) *Amount taken into account for purposes of determining specified policy acquisition expenses.* If for a taxable year an insurance company has a net positive foreign capitalization amount (as defined in paragraph (h)(5)(i) of this section), any portion of that amount remaining after the reduction described in paragraph (h)(7) of this section is treated as additional specified policy acquisition expenses for the taxable year (determined without regard to amounts taken into account under this paragraph (h)). A net positive capitalization amount is treated as an amount otherwise required to be capitalized for the taxable year for purposes of the reduction under section 848(f)(1)(A).


(5) *Net foreign capitalization amount*—(i) *In general.* An insurance company's net foreign capitalization amount equals the sum of the foreign capitalization amounts (netting positive and negative amounts) determined under paragraph (h)(5)(ii) of this section for each category of specified insurance contracts reinsured by agreements described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. If the amount is less than zero, the company has a net negative foreign capitalization amount. If the amount is greater than zero, the company has a net positive foreign capitalization amount.


(ii) *Foreign capitalization amounts by category.* The foreign capitalization amount for a category of specified insurance contracts is determined by—


(A) Combining the net positive consideration and the net negative consideration for the taxable year (or, with respect to a reinsurance agreement that is subject to the interim rules of § 1.848-3, by combining the gross amount of premiums and other consideration and the premiums and other consideration incurred for reinsurance) for all agreements described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section which reinsure specified insurance contracts in that category; and


(B) Multiplying the result (either positive or negative) by the percentage for that category specified in section 848(c)(1).


(6) *Treatment of net negative foreign capitalization amount*—(i) *Applied as a reduction to previously capitalized amounts.* If for a taxable year an insurance company has a net negative foreign capitalization amount, the negative amount reduces (but not below zero) the unamortized balances of the amounts previously capitalized (beginning with the amount capitalized for the most recent taxable year) to the extent attributable to prior years' net positive foreign capitalization amounts. The amount by which previously capitalized amounts is reduced is allowed as a deduction for the taxable year.


(ii) *Carryover of remaining net negative foreign capitalization amount.* The net negative foreign capitalization amount, if any, remaining after the reduction described in paragraph (h)(6)(i) of this section is carried over to reduce a future net positive capitalization amount. The remaining net negative foreign capitalization amount may only offset a net positive foreign capitalization amount in a future year, and may not be used to reduce the amounts otherwise required to be capitalized under section 848(a) for the taxable year, or to reduce the unamortized balances of specified policy acquisition expenses from preceding taxable years, with respect to directly written business or reinsurance agreements other than agreements for which the election under paragraph (h)(3) of this section has been made.


(7) *Reduction of net positive foreign capitalization amount by carryover amounts allowed.* If for a taxable year an insurance company has a net positive foreign capitalization amount, that amount is reduced (but not below zero) by any carryover of net negative foreign capitalization amounts from preceding taxable years. Any remaining net positive foreign capitalization amount is taken into account as provided in paragraph (h)(4) of this section.


(8) *Examples.* The principles of this paragraph (h) are illustrated by the following examples.


(i) *Carryover of excess negative capitalization amount*—(1) *In general.* This paragraph (i) authorizes a carryover of an excess negative capitalization amount (as defined in paragraph (i)(2) of this section) to reduce amounts otherwise required to be capitalized under section 848. Paragraph (i)(4) provides special rules for the treatment of excess negative capitalization amounts of insolvent insurance companies.


(2) *Excess negative capitalization amount.* The excess negative capitalization amount with respect to a category of specified insurance contracts for a taxable year is equal to the excess of—


(A) The negative capitalization amount with respect to that category; over


(B) The amount that can be utilized under section 848(f)(1).


(3) *Treatment of excess negative capitalization amount.* The excess negative capitalization amount for a taxable year reduces the amounts that are otherwise required to be capitalized by an insurance company under section 848(c)(1) for future years.


(4) *Special rule for the treatment of an excess negative capitalization amount of an insolvent company*—(i) *When applicable.* This paragraph (i)(4) applies only for the taxable year in which an insolvent insurance company has an excess negative capitalization amount and has net negative consideration under a reinsurance agreement. See paragraph (i)(4)(v) of this section for the definition of “insolvent.”


(ii) *Election to forego carryover of excess negative capitalization amount.* At the joint election of the insolvent insurance company and the other party to the reinsurance agreement—


(A) The insolvent insurance company reduces the excess negative capitalization amount which would otherwise be carried over under paragraph (i)(1) of this section by the amount determined under paragraph (i)(4)(iii) of this section; and


(B) The other party reduces the amount of its specified policy acquisition expenses for the taxable year by the amount determined under paragraph (i)(4)(iii) of this section.


(iii) *Amount of reduction to the excess negative capitalization amount and specified policy acquisition expenses.* To determine the reduction to the carryover of an insolvent insurance company's excess negative capitalization amount and the specified policy acquisition expenses of the other party with respect to a reinsurance agreement—


(A) Multiply the net negative consideration for each reinsurance agreement of the insolvent insurer for which there is net negative consideration for the taxable year by the appropriate percentage specified in section 848(c)(1) for the category of specified insurance contracts reinsured by the agreement;


(B) Sum the results for each agreement;


(C) Calculate the ratio between the results in paragraphs (i)(4)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section for each agreement; and


(D) Multiply that result by the increase in the excess negative capitalization amount of the insolvent insurer for the taxable year.


(iv) *Manner of making election.* To make an election under paragraph (i)(4) of this section, each party to the reinsurance agreement must attach an election statement to its federal income tax return (including an amended return) for the taxable year for which the election is effective. The election statement must identify the reinsurance agreement for which the joint election under this paragraph (i)(4) has been made, state the amount of the reduction to the insolvent insurance company's excess negative capitalization amount that is attributable to the agreement, and be signed by both parties. An election under this paragraph (i)(4) is effective for the taxable year specified in the election statement, and may not be revoked without the consent of the Commissioner.


(v) *Presumptions relating to the insolvency of an insurance company undergoing a court supervised rehabilitation or similar state proceeding.* For purposes of this paragraph (i)(4), an insurance company which is undergoing a rehabilitation, conservatorship, or similar state proceeding shall be presumed to be insolvent if the state proceeding results in—


(A) An order of the state court finding that the fair market value of the insurance company's assets is less than its liabilities;


(B) The use of funds, guarantees, or reinsurance from a guaranty association;


(C) A reduction of the policyholders' available account balances; or


(D) A substantial limitation on access to funds (for example, a partial or total moratorium on policyholder withdrawals or surrenders that applies for a period of 5 years).


(vi) *Example.* The principles of this paragraph (i)(4) are illustrated by the following example.


(j) *Ceding commissions with respect to reinsurance of contracts other than specified insurance contracts.* A ceding commission incurred with respect to the reinsurance of an insurance contract that is not a specified insurance contract is not subject to the provisions of section 848(g).


(k) *Effective dates*—(1) *In general.* Unless otherwise specified in this paragraph, the rules of this section are effective for the taxable years of an insurance company beginning after November 14, 1991.


(2) *Reduction in the amount of net negative consideration to ensure consistency of capitalization for reinsurance agreements.* Section 1.848-2(g) (which provides for an adjustment to ensure consistency) is effective for—


(i) All amounts arising under any reinsurance agreement entered into after November 14, 1991; and


(ii) All amounts arising under any reinsurance agreement for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1991, without regard to the date on which the reinsurance agreement was entered into.


(3) *Net consideration rules.* Section 1.848-2(f) (which provides rules for determining the net consideration for a reinsurance agreement) applies to—


(i) Amounts arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1991, under a reinsurance agreement entered into after November 14, 1991; and


(ii) Amounts arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1994, under a reinsurance agreement entered into before November 15, 1991.


(4) *Determination of the date on which a reinsurance agreement is entered into.* A reinsurance agreement is considered entered into at the earlier of—


(i) The date of the reinsurance agreement; or 


(ii) The date of a binding written agreement to enter into a reinsurance transaction if the written agreement evidences the parties' agreement on substantially all material items relating to the reinsurance transaction.


(5) *Special rule for certain reinsurance agreements with parties not subject to U.S. taxation.* The election and special rules in paragraph (h) of this section relating to the determination of amounts required to be capitalized on reinsurance agreements with parties not subject to United States taxation apply to taxable years ending on or after September 30, 1990.


(6) *Carryover of excess negative capitalization amount.* The provisions of paragraph (i) of this section, including the special rule for the treatment of excess negative capitalization amounts of insolvent insurance companies, are affected with respect to amounts arising in taxable years ending on or after September 30, 1990.
