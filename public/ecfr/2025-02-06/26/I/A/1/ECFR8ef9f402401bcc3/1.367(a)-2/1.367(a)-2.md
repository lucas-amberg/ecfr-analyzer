# § 1.367(a)-2   Exceptions for transfers of property for use in the active conduct of a trade or business.

(a) *Scope and general rule*—(1) *Scope.* Paragraph (a)(2) of this section provides the general exception to section 367(a)(1) for certain property transferred for use in the active conduct of a trade or business. Paragraph (b) of this section describes property that is eligible for the exception provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Paragraph (c) of this section describes property that is not eligible for the exception provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Paragraph (d) of this section provides general rules, and paragraphs (e) through (h) of this section provide special rules, for determining whether property is used in the active conduct of a trade or business outside of the United States. Paragraph (i) of this section is reserved. Paragraph (j) of this section provides relief for certain failures to comply with the reporting requirements under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section that are not willful. Paragraph (k) of this section provides dates of applicability. The rules of this section do not apply to a transfer of stock or securities in an exchange subject to § 1.367(a)-3.


(2) *General rule.* Except as otherwise provided in §§ 1.367(a)-4, 1.367(a)-6, and 1.367(a)-7, section 367(a)(1) does not apply to property transferred by a United States person (U.S. transferor) to a foreign corporation if—


(i) The property constitutes eligible property;


(ii) The property is transferred for use by the foreign corporation in the active conduct of a trade or business outside of the United States, as determined under paragraph (d), (e), (f), (g), or (h) of this section, as applicable; and


(iii) The U.S. transferor complies with the reporting requirements of section 6038B and the regulations thereunder.


(b) *Eligible property.* Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, eligible property means—


(1) Tangible property;


(2) A working interest in oil and gas property; and


(3) A financial asset. For purposes of this section, a financial asset is—


(i) A cash equivalent;


(ii) A security within the meaning of section 475(c)(2), without regard to the last sentence of section 475(c)(2) (referencing section 1256) and without regard to section 475(c)(4), but excluding an interest in a partnership;


(iii) A commodities position described in section 475(e)(2)(B), 475(e)(2)(C), or 475(e)(2)(D); and


(iv) A notional principal contract described in § 1.446-3(c)(1).


(c) *Exception for certain property.* Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, property described in paragraph (c)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section does not constitute eligible property.


(1) *Inventory.* Stock in trade of the taxpayer or other property of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year, or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business (including raw materials and supplies, partially completed goods, and finished products).


(2) *Installment obligations, etc.* Installment obligations, accounts receivable, or similar property, but only to the extent that the principal amount of any such obligation has not previously been included by the taxpayer in its taxable income.


(3) *Nonfunctional currency, etc.*—(i) *In general.* Property that gives rise to a section 988 transaction of the taxpayer described in section 988(c)(1)(A) through (C), without regard to section 988(c)(1)(D) and (E), or that would give rise to such a section 988 transaction if it were acquired, accrued, entered into, or disposed of directly by the taxpayer.


(ii) *Limitation of gain required to be recognized.* If section 367(a)(1) applies to a transfer of property described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, then the gain required to be recognized is limited to the gain realized as part of the same transaction upon the transfer of property described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, less any loss realized as part of the same transaction upon the transfer of property described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section. This limitation applies in lieu of the rule in § 1.367(a)-1(b)(1). No loss is recognized with respect to property described in this paragraph (c)(3).


(4) *Certain leased tangible property.* Tangible property with respect to which the transferor is a lessor at the time of the transfer, unless either the foreign corporation is the lessee at the time of the transfer or the foreign corporation will lease the property to third persons.


(d) *Active conduct of a trade or business outside the United States*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraphs (e), (f), (g), and (h) of this section, to determine whether property is transferred for use by the foreign corporation in the active conduct of a trade or business outside of the United States, four factual determinations must be made:


(i) What is the trade or business of the foreign corporation (see paragraph (d)(2) of this section);


(ii) Do the activities of the foreign corporation constitute the active conduct of that trade or business (see paragraph (d)(3) of this section);


(iii) Is the trade or business conducted outside of the United States (see paragraph (d)(4) of this section); and


(iv) Is the transferred property used or held for use in the trade or business (see paragraph (d)(5) of this section)?


(2) *Trade or business.* Whether the activities of the foreign corporation constitute a trade or business is determined based on all the facts and circumstances. In general, a trade or business is a specific unified group of activities that constitute (or could constitute) an independent economic enterprise carried on for profit. For example, the activities of a foreign selling subsidiary could constitute a trade or business if they could be independently carried on for profit, even though the subsidiary acts exclusively on behalf of, and has operations fully integrated with, its parent corporation. To constitute a trade or business, a group of activities must ordinarily include every operation which forms a part of, or a step in, a process by which an enterprise may earn income or profit. In this regard, one or more of such activities may be carried on by independent contractors under the direct control of the foreign corporation. (However, see paragraph (d)(3) of this section.) The group of activities must ordinarily include the collection of income and the payment of expenses. If the activities of the foreign corporation do not constitute a trade or business, then the exception provided by this section does not apply, regardless of the level of activities carried on by the corporation. The following activities are not considered to constitute by themselves a trade or business for purposes of this section:


(i) Any activity giving rise to expenses that would be deductible only under section 212 if the activities were carried on by an individual; or


(ii) The holding for one's own account of investments in stock, securities, land, or other property, including casual sales thereof.


(3) *Active conduct.* Whether a trade or business is actively conducted by the foreign corporation is determined based on all the facts and circumstances. In general, a corporation actively conducts a trade or business only if the officers and employees of the corporation carry out substantial managerial and operational activities. A corporation may be engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business even though incidental activities of the trade or business are carried out on behalf of the corporation by independent contractors. In determining whether the officers and employees of the corporation carry out substantial managerial and operational activities, however, the activities of independent contractors are disregarded. On the other hand, the officers and employees of the corporation are considered to include the officers and employees of related entities who are made available to and supervised on a day-to-day basis by, and whose salaries are paid by (or reimbursed to the lending related entity by), the foreign corporation. See paragraph (d)(6) of this section for the standard that applies to determine whether a trade or business that produces rents or royalties is actively conducted. The rule of this paragraph (d)(3) is illustrated by the following example.


(4) *Outside of the United States.* Whether the foreign corporation conducts a trade or business outside of the United States is determined based on all the facts and circumstances. Generally, the primary managerial and operational activities of the trade or business must be conducted outside the United States and immediately after the transfer the transferred assets must be located outside the United States. Thus, the exception provided by this section would not apply to the transfer of the assets of a domestic business to a foreign corporation if the domestic business continued to operate in the United States after the transfer. In such a case, the primary operational activities of the business would continue to be conducted in the United States. Moreover, the transferred assets would be located in the United States. However, it is not necessary that every item of property transferred be used outside of the United States. As long as the primary managerial and operational activities of the trade or business are conducted outside of the United States and substantially all of the transferred assets are located outside the United States, incidental items of transferred property located in the United States may be considered to have been transferred for use in the active conduct of a trade or business outside of the United States.


(5) *Use in the trade or business.* Whether property is used or held for use by the foreign corporation in a trade or business is determined based on all the facts and circumstances. In general, property is used or held for use in the foreign corporation's trade or business if it is—


(i) Held for the principal purpose of promoting the present conduct of the trade or business;


(ii) Acquired and held in the ordinary course of the trade or business; or


(iii) Otherwise held in a direct relationship to the trade or business. Property is considered held in a direct relationship to a trade or business if it is held to meet the present needs of that trade or business and not its anticipated future needs. Thus, property will not be considered to be held in a direct relationship to a trade or business if it is held for the purpose of providing for future diversification into a new trade or business, future expansion of trade or business activities, future plant replacement, or future business contingencies.


(6) *Active leasing and licensing.* For purposes of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, whether a trade or business that produces rents or royalties is actively conducted is determined under the principles of section 954(c)(2)(A) and the regulations thereunder, but without regard to whether the rents or royalties are received from an unrelated party. See §§ 1.954-2(c) and (d).


(e) *Special rules for certain property to be leased*—(1) *Leasing business of the foreign corporation.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e), tangible property that will be leased to another person by the foreign corporation will be considered to be transferred for use by the foreign corporation in an active trade or business outside the United States only if—


(i) The foreign corporation's leasing of the property constitutes the active conduct of a leasing business, as determined under paragraph (d)(6) of this section;


(ii) The lessee of the property is not expected to, and does not, use the property in the United States; and


(iii) The foreign corporation has a need for substantial investment in assets of the type transferred.


(2) *De minimis leasing by the foreign corporation.* Tangible property that will be leased to another person by the foreign corporation but that does not satisfy the conditions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section will, nevertheless, be considered to be transferred for use in the active conduct of a trade or business if either—


(i) The property transferred will be used by the foreign corporation in the active conduct of a trade or business but will be leased during occasional brief periods when the property would otherwise be idle, such as an airplane leased during periods of excess capacity; or


(ii) The property transferred is real property located outside the United States and—


(A) The property will be used primarily in the active conduct of a trade or business of the foreign corporation; and


(B) Not more than ten percent of the square footage of the property will be leased to others.


(3) *Aircraft and vessels leased in foreign commerce.* For purposes of satisfying paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an aircraft or vessel, including component parts such as an engine leased separately from the aircraft or vessel, that will be leased to another person by the foreign corporation will be considered to be transferred for use in the active conduct of a trade or business if—


(i) The employees of the foreign corporation perform substantial managerial and operational activities of leasing aircraft or vessels outside the United States; and


(ii) The leased property is predominantly used outside the United States, as determined under § 1.954-2(c)(2)(v).


(f) *Special rules for oil and gas working interests*—(1) *In general.* A working interest in oil and gas property will be considered to be transferred for use in the active conduct of a trade or business if—


(i) The transfer satisfies the conditions of paragraph (f)(2) or (f)(3) of this section;


(ii) At the time of the transfer, the foreign corporation has no intention to farm out or otherwise transfer any part of the transferred working interest; and


(iii) During the first three years after the transfer there are no farmouts or other transfers of any part of the transferred working interest as a result of which the foreign corporation retains less than a 50-percent share of the transferred working interest.


(2) *Active use of working interest.* A working interest in oil and gas property that satisfies the conditions in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section will be considered to be transferred for use in the active conduct of a trade or business if—


(i) The U.S. transferor is regularly and substantially engaged in exploration for and extraction of minerals, either directly or through working interests in joint ventures, other than by reason of the property that is transferred;


(ii) The terms of the working interest transferred were actively negotiated among the joint venturers;


(iii) The working interest transferred constitutes at least a five percent working interest;


(iv) Before and at the time of the transfer, through its own employees or officers, the U.S. transferor was regularly and actively engaged in—


(A) Operating the working interest, or


(B) Analyzing technical data relating to the activities of the venture;


(v) Before and at the time of the transfer, through its own employees or officers, the U.S. transferor was regularly and actively involved in decision making with respect to the operations of the venture, including decisions relating to exploration, development, production, and marketing; and


(vi) After the transfer, the foreign corporation will for the foreseeable future satisfy the requirements of subparagraphs (iv) and (v) of this paragraph (f)(2).


(3) *Start-up operations.* A working interest in oil and gas property that satisfies the conditions in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section but that does not satisfy all the requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this section will, nevertheless, be considered to be transferred for use in the active conduct of a trade or business if—


(i) The working interest was acquired by the U.S. transferor immediately before the transfer and for the specific purpose of transferring it to the foreign corporation;


(ii) The requirements of paragraphs (f)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section are satisfied; and


(iii) The foreign corporation will for the foreseeable future satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f)(2)(iv) and (v) of this section.


(4) *Other applicable rules.* A working interest in oil and gas property that is not described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section may nonetheless qualify for the exception to section 367(a)(1) contained in this section depending upon the facts and circumstances.


(g) *Property retransferred by the foreign corporation*—(1) *General rule.* Property will not be considered to be transferred for use in the active conduct of a trade or business outside of the United States if—


(i) At the time of the transfer, it is reasonable to believe that, in the reasonably foreseeable future, the foreign corporation will sell or otherwise dispose of any material portion of the property other than in the ordinary course of business; or


(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the foreign corporation receives the property in an exchange described in section 367(a)(1), and, as part of the same transaction, transfers the property to another person. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a subsequent transfer within six months of the initial transfer will be considered to be part of the same transaction, and a subsequent transfer more than six months after the initial transfer may be considered to be part of the same transaction under step-transaction principles.


(2) *Exception.* Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the active conduct exception provided by this section shall apply to the initial transfer if—


(i) The initial transfer is followed by one or more subsequent transfers described in section 351 or 721; and


(ii) Each subsequent transferee is either a partnership in which the preceding transferor is a general partner or a corporation in which the preceding transferor owns common stock; and


(iii) The ultimate transferee uses the property in the active conduct of a trade or business outside the United States.


(h) *Compulsory transfers of property.* Property is presumed to be transferred for use in the active conduct of a trade or business outside of the United States, if—


(1) The property was previously in use in the country in which the foreign corporation is organized; and


(2) The transfer is either:


(i) Legally required by the foreign government as a necessary condition of doing business; or


(ii) Compelled by a genuine threat of immediate expropriation by the foreign government.


(i) [Reserved]


(j) *Failure to comply with reporting requirements of section 6038B*—(1) *Failure to comply.* For purposes of the exception to the application of section 367(a)(1) provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a failure to comply with the reporting requirements of section 6038B and the regulations thereunder (failure to comply) has the meaning set forth in § 1.6038B-1(f)(2).


(2) *Relief for certain failures to comply that are not willful*—(i) *In general.* A failure to comply described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section will be deemed not to have occurred for purposes of satisfying the requirements of this section if the taxpayer demonstrates that the failure was not willful using the procedure set forth in this paragraph (j)(2). For this purpose, willful is to be interpreted consistent with the meaning of that term in the context of other civil penalties, which would include a failure due to gross negligence, reckless disregard, or willful neglect. Whether a failure to comply was a willful failure will be determined by the Director of Field Operations, Cross Border Activities Practice Area, Large Business & International (or any successor to the roles and responsibilities of such position, as appropriate) (Director) based on all the facts and circumstances. The taxpayer must submit a request for relief and an explanation as provided in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. Although a taxpayer whose failure to comply is determined not to be willful will not be subject to gain recognition under this section, the taxpayer will be subject to a penalty under section 6038B if the taxpayer fails to demonstrate that the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. See § 1.6038B-1(b)(1) and (f). The determination of whether the failure to comply was willful under this section has no effect on any request for relief made under § 1.6038B-1(f).


(ii) *Procedures for establishing that a failure to comply was not willful*—(A) *Time and manner of submission.* A taxpayer's statement that the failure to comply was not willful will be considered only if, promptly after the taxpayer becomes aware of the failure, an amended return is filed for the taxable year to which the failure relates that includes the information that should have been included with the original return for such taxable year or that otherwise complies with the rules of this section, and that includes a written statement explaining the reasons for the failure to comply. The amended return must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service at the location where the taxpayer filed its original return. The taxpayer may submit a request for relief from the penalty under section 6038B as part of the same submission. See § 1.6038B-1(f).


(B) *Notice requirement.* In addition to the requirements of paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the taxpayer must comply with the notice requirements of this paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B). If any taxable year of the taxpayer is under examination when the amended return is filed, a copy of the amended return and any information required to be included with such return must be delivered to the Internal Revenue Service personnel conducting the examination. If no taxable year of the taxpayer is under examination when the amended return is filed, a copy of the amended return and any information required to be included with such return must be delivered to the Director.


(3) For illustrations of the application of the willfulness standard of this paragraph (j), see the examples in § 1.367(a)-8(p)(3).


(4) Paragraph (j) applies to requests for relief submitted on or after November 19, 2014.


(k) *Effective/applicability dates*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraphs (j)(4) and (k)(2) of this section, the rules of this section apply to transfers occurring on or after September 14, 2015, and to transfers occurring before September 14, 2015, resulting from entity classification elections made under § 301.7701-3 that are filed on or after September 14, 2015. For transfers occurring before this section is applicable, see §§ 1.367(a)-2, -2T, -4, -4T, -5, and -5T as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2016.


(2) *Foreign currency exception.* Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, § 1.367(a)-5T(d)(2) as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2016, applies to transfers of property denominated in a foreign currency occurring before December 16, 2016, other than transfers occurring before that date resulting from entity classification elections made under § 301.7701-3 that are filed on or after that date.
