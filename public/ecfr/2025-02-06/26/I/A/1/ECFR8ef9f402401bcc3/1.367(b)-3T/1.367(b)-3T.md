(a)-(b)(3) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.367(b)-3(a) through (b)(3). 


(4) *Election of taxable exchange treatment*—(i) *Rules*—(A) *In general.* In lieu of the treatment prescribed by § 1.367(b)-3(b)(3)(i), an exchanging shareholder described in § 1.367(b)-3(b)(1) may instead elect to recognize the gain (but not loss) that it realizes in the exchange (taxable exchange election). To make a taxable exchange election, the following requirements must be satisfied— 


(*1*) The exchanging shareholder (and its direct or indirect owners that would be affected by the election, in the case of an exchanging shareholder that is a foreign corporation) reports the exchange in a manner consistent therewith (see, e.g., sections 954(c)(1)(B)(i), 1001 and 1248); 


(*2*) The notification requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C) of this section are satisfied; and


(*3*) The adjustments described in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of this section are made when the following circumstances are present— 


(*i*) The transaction is described in section 332 or is an asset acquisition described in section 368(a)(1), with regard to which one U.S. person owns (directly or indirectly) 100 percent of the foreign acquired corporation; and 


(*ii*) The all earnings and profits amount described in § 1.367(b)-3(b)(3)(i) with respect to the exchange exceeds the gain recognized by the exchanging shareholder. 


(B) *Attribute reduction*—(*1*) *Reduction of NOL carryovers.* The amount by which the all earnings and profits amount exceeds the gain recognized by the exchanging shareholder (the excess earnings and profits amount) shall be applied to reduce the net operating loss carryovers (if any) of the foreign acquired corporation to which the domestic acquiring corporation would otherwise succeed under section 381(a) and (c)(1). See also Rev. Rul. 72-421 (1972-2 C.B. 166) (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). 


(*2*) *Reduction of capital loss carryovers.* After the application of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B)(*1*) of this section, any remaining excess earnings and profits amount shall be applied to reduce the capital loss carryovers (if any) of the foreign acquired corporation to which the domestic acquiring corporation would otherwise succeed under section 381(a) and (c)(3). 


(*3*) *Reduction of basis.* After the application of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B)(*2*) of this section, any remaining excess earnings and profits amount shall be applied to reduce (but not below zero) the basis of the assets (other than dollar-denominated money) of the foreign acquired corporation that are acquired by the domestic acquiring corporation. Such remaining excess earnings and profits amount shall be applied to reduce the basis of such assets in the following order: first, tangible depreciable or depletable assets, according to their class lives (beginning with those assets with the shortest class life); second, other non-inventory tangible assets; third, intangible assets that are amortizable; and finally, the remaining assets of the foreign acquired corporation that are acquired by the domestic acquiring corporation. Within each of these categories, if the total basis of all assets in the category is greater than the excess earnings and profits amount to be applied against such basis, the taxpayer may choose to which specific assets in the category the basis reduction first applies. 


(C) *Notification.* The exchanging shareholder shall elect to apply the rules of this paragraph (b)(4)(i) by attaching a statement of its election to its section 367(b) notice. See § 1.367(b)-1(c) For the rules concerning filing a section 367(b) notice. 


(D) *Example.* The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (b)(4)(i):


(ii) *Effective date.* This paragraph (b)(4) applies for section 367(b) exchanges that occur between February 23, 2000, and February 23, 2001. 


(c)-(d) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.367(b)-3(c) through (d).
