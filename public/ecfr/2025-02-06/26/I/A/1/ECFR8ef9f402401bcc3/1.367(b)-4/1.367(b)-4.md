(a) *Scope.* This section applies to certain acquisitions by a foreign corporation of the stock or assets of a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 351 or in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1). Paragraph (b) of this section provides a rule regarding when an exchanging shareholder is required to include in income as a deemed dividend the section 1248 amount attributable to the stock that it exchanges. Paragraph (c) of this section provides a rule excluding deemed dividends from foreign personal holding company income. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules for subsequent sales or exchanges. Paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section provide rules regarding certain exchanges following inversion transactions. Paragraph (g) of this section provides rules regarding exchanges that occur pursuant to a transaction described in § 1.367(b)-10(a)(1), without regard to the exceptions in § 1.367(b)-10(a)(2). Paragraph (h) of this section provides definitions and special rules, including special rules regarding triangular reorganizations and recapitalizations. Paragraph (i) of this section provides the applicability dates for certain paragraphs of this section. See also § 1.367(a)-3(b)(2) for transactions subject to the concurrent application of sections 367(a) and (b) and § 1.367(b)-2 for additional definitions that apply.


(b) *Income inclusion.* If a foreign corporation (the transferee foreign corporation) acquires the stock of a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 351 or the stock or assets of a foreign corporation in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1) (in either case, the foreign acquired corporation), then an exchanging shareholder must, if its exchange is described in paragraph (b)(1)(i), (b)(2)(i), or (b)(3) of this section, include in income as a deemed dividend the section 1248 amount attributable to the stock that it exchanges.


(1) *Exchange that results in loss of status as section 1248 shareholder*—(i) *General rule.* Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, an exchange is described in this paragraph (b)(1)(i) if— 


(A) Immediately before the exchange, the exchanging shareholder is— 


(*1*) A United States person that is a section 1248 shareholder with respect to the foreign acquired corporation; or 


(*2*) A foreign corporation, and a United States person is a section 1248 shareholder with respect to such foreign corporation and with respect to the foreign acquired corporation;


(B) Either of the following conditions is satisfied— 


(*1*) Immediately after the exchange, the stock received in the exchange is not stock in a corporation that is a controlled foreign corporation as to which the United States person described in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section is a section 1248 shareholder; or 


(*2*) Immediately after the exchange, the transferee foreign corporation or the foreign acquired corporation (in the case of the acquisition of the stock of a foreign acquired corporation) is not a controlled foreign corporation as to which the United States person described in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section is a section 1248 shareholder; and


(C) The exchange is not a specified exchange to which paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies.


(ii) *Special rules*—(A) *Receipt of foreign stock in an exchange to which § 1.367(a)-7(c) applies.* If an exchanging shareholder is a domestic corporation that transfers stock of a foreign acquired corporation in an exchange under section 361(a) or (b) (section 361 exchange) to which the exception to section 367(a)(5) in § 1.367(a)-7(c) applies, and the exchanging shareholder receives stock in either the transferee foreign corporation or foreign controlling corporation (in the case of a triangular reorganization), such exchange will not be described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section only if immediately after the exchanging shareholder's receipt of the foreign stock in the section 361 exchange, but prior to, and without taking into account, the exchanging shareholder's distribution of the foreign stock under section 361(c)(1), the foreign acquired corporation, transferee foreign corporation, and foreign controlling corporation (in the case of a triangular reorganization) are controlled foreign corporations as to which the exchanging shareholder is a section 1248 shareholder. See paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, *Example 4,* for an illustration of this rule. If an exchange is not described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section as a result of the application of this paragraph, see §§ 1.1248(f)-1(b)(3) and 1.1248(f)-2(c), as applicable. For adjustments to the basis of stock of the foreign surviving corporation in certain triangular reorganizations, see paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B)(*2*)(*i*) of this section.


(B) *Special rules for certain triangular reorganizations*—(*1*) *Receipt of domestic stock.* In the case of a triangular reorganization in which the stock received in the exchange is stock of a domestic controlling corporation, such exchange is not described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section if immediately after the exchange the following foreign corporations are controlled foreign corporations as to which the domestic controlling corporation is a section 1248 shareholder—


(*i*) The foreign acquired corporation and foreign surviving corporation, in the case of a section 354 exchange of the stock of the foreign acquired corporation pursuant to a triangular B reorganization.


(*ii*) The foreign surviving corporation, in the case of a section 354 or section 356 exchange of the stock of the foreign acquired corporation pursuant to a forward triangular merger, triangular C reorganization, reverse triangular merger, or triangular G reorganization. See paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, *Example 3B* for an illustration of this rule.


(*iii*) The foreign acquired corporation and foreign surviving corporation, in the case of a section 361 exchange of the stock of the foreign acquired corporation by an exchanging shareholder that is a foreign corporation described in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A)(*2*) of this section and that is a foreign acquired corporation the assets of which are acquired in a triangular reorganization described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B)(*1*)(*ii*) of this section.


(*iv*) The foreign acquired corporation and foreign surviving corporation, in the case of a section 361 exchange of the stock of the foreign acquired corporation by an exchanging shareholder that is a domestic corporation described in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A)(*1*) of this section and that is acquired in a triangular reorganization to which the exception to section 367(a)(5) in § 1.367(a)-7(c) applies. See paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, *Example 5* for an illustration of this rule.


(*2*) *Adjustments to basis of stock of foreign surviving corporation*—(*i*) *Section 361 exchanges to which § 1.367(a)-7(c) applies.* If stock of the foreign acquired corporation is acquired by the foreign surviving corporation in a section 361 exchange by reason of triangular reorganization (other than a triangular B reorganization) to which the exception to section 367(a)(5) provided in § 1.367(a)-7(c) applies, and if paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section does not apply to the section 361 exchange by reason of (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section (if the stock received is stock of a foreign controlling corporation) or by reason of (b)(1)(ii)(B)(*1*)(*iv*) of this section (if the stock received is stock of a domestic controlling corporation), then the controlling corporation (foreign or domestic) must apply the principles of § 1.367(b)-13 to adjust the basis of the stock of the foreign surviving corporation so that the section 1248 amount in the stock of the foreign acquired corporation (determined when the foreign surviving corporation acquires such stock) is reflected in the stock of the foreign surviving corporation immediately after the exchange. See paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, *Example 5,* for an illustration of this rule.


(*ii*) *Other exchanges.* See § 1.367(b)-13 for rules regarding the adjustment to the basis of the stock of the foreign surviving corporation in exchanges pursuant to triangular reorganizations that are not subject to paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B)(*2*)(*i*) of this section.


(iii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (b)(1): 


(2) *Receipt by exchanging shareholder of preferred or other stock in certain instances*—(i) *Rule.* An exchange is described in this paragraph (b)(2)(i) if— 


(A) Immediately before the exchange, the foreign acquired corporation and the transferee foreign corporation are not members of the same affiliated group (within the meaning of section 1504(a), but without regard to the exceptions set forth in section 1504(b), and substituting the words “more than 50” in place of the words “at least 80” in sections 1504(a)(2)(A) and (B)); 


(B) Immediately after the exchange, a domestic corporation directly or indirectly owns 10 percent or more of the voting power or value of the transferee foreign corporation; and 


(C) The exchanging shareholder receives preferred stock (other than preferred stock that is fully participating with respect to dividends, redemptions and corporate growth) in consideration for common stock or preferred stock that is fully participating with respect to dividends, redemptions and corporate growth, or, in the discretion of the Commissioner or the Commissioner's delegate (and without regard to whether the stock exchanged is common stock or preferred stock), receives stock that entitles it to participate (through dividends, redemption payments or otherwise) disproportionately in the earnings generated by particular assets of the foreign acquired corporation or transferee foreign corporation. 


(ii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (b)(2):


(3) *Certain recapitalizations.* An exchange pursuant to a recapitalization under section 368(a)(1)(E) shall be deemed to be an exchange described in this paragraph (b)(3) if the following conditions are satisfied— 


(i) During the 24-month period immediately preceding or following the date of the recapitalization, the corporation that undergoes the recapitalization (or a predecessor of, or successor to, such corporation) also engages in a transaction that would be described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section but for paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section, either as the foreign acquired corporation or the transferee foreign corporation; and 


(ii) The exchange in the recapitalization is described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section. 


(c) *Exclusion of deemed dividend from foreign personal holding company income*—(1) *Rule.* In the event the section 1248 amount is included in income as a deemed dividend by a foreign corporation under paragraph (b) of this section, such deemed dividend shall not be included as foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c). 


(2) *Example.* The following example illustrates the rule of this paragraph (c): 


(d) *Rules for subsequent sales or exchanges*—(1) *Rule.* If an exchanging shareholder (as defined in § 1.1248-8(b)(1)(iv)) is not required to include in income as a deemed dividend the section 1248 amount under paragraph (b) or paragraph (e)(1) of this section (non-inclusion exchange), then, for purposes of applying section 367(b) or 1248 to subsequent sales or exchanges, and subject to the limitation of § 1.367(b)-2(d)(3)(ii) (in the case of a transaction described in § 1.367(b)-3), the determination of the earnings and profits attributable to the stock an exchanging shareholder receives in the non-inclusion exchange is determined pursuant to the rules of section 1248 and the regulations under that section.


(2) *Example.* The following example illustrates the rules of this section. For purposes of the example, assume that—


(i) There is no immediate gain recognition pursuant to section 367(a)(1) and the regulations under that section (either through operation of the rules or because the appropriate parties have entered into a gain recognition agreement under §§ 1.367(a)-3(b) and 1.367(a)-8);


(ii) References to earnings and profits are to earnings and profits that would be includible in income as a dividend under section 1248 and the regulations under that section if stock to which the earnings and profits are attributable were sold or exchanged by its shareholder;


(iii) Each corporation has only a single class of stock outstanding and uses the calendar year as its taxable year; and


(iv) Each transaction is unrelated to all other transactions.


(e) *Income inclusion and gain recognition in certain exchanges following an inversion transaction*—(1) *General rule.* If a foreign corporation (the transferee foreign corporation) acquires stock of a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 351 or stock or assets of a foreign corporation in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1) (in either case, the foreign acquired corporation), then an exchanging shareholder must, if its exchange is a specified exchange and the exception in paragraph (e)(3) of this section does not apply—


(i) Include in income as a deemed dividend the section 1248 amount attributable to the stock that it exchanges; and


(ii) After taking into account the increase in basis provided in § 1.367(b)-2(e)(3)(ii) resulting from the deemed dividend (if any), recognize all realized gain with respect to the stock that would not otherwise be recognized.


(2) *Specified exchanges.* An exchange is a specified exchange if—


(i) Immediately before the exchange, the foreign acquired corporation is an expatriated foreign subsidiary and the exchanging shareholder is either an expatriated entity described in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A)(*1*) of this section or an expatriated foreign subsidiary described in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A)(*2*) of this section;


(ii) The stock received in the exchange is stock of a foreign corporation; and


(iii) The exchange occurs during the applicable period.


(3) *De minimis exception.* The exception in this paragraph (e)(3) applies if—


(i) Immediately after the exchange, the foreign acquired corporation (in the case of an acquisition of stock of the foreign acquired corporation) or the transferee foreign corporation (in the case of an acquisition of assets of the foreign acquired corporation) is a controlled foreign corporation;


(ii) The post-exchange ownership percentage with respect to the foreign acquired corporation (in the case of an acquisition of stock of the foreign acquired corporation) or the transferee foreign corporation (in the case of an acquisition of assets of the foreign acquired corporation) is at least 90 percent of the pre-exchange ownership percentage with respect to the foreign acquired corporation; and


(iii) The post-exchange ownership percentage with respect to each lower-tier expatriated foreign subsidiary of the foreign acquired corporation is at least 90 percent of the pre-exchange ownership percentage with respect to the lower-tier expatriated foreign subsidiary.


(4) *Certain exceptions from foreign personal holding company not available.* An income inclusion of a foreign corporation under paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not qualify for the exceptions from foreign personal holding company income provided by sections 954(c)(3)(A)(i) and 954(c)(6) (to the extent in effect).


(5) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e). For purposes of all of the examples, unless otherwise indicated: FP, a foreign corporation, owns all of the stock of USP, a domestic corporation, and all 40 shares of stock of FS, a controlled foreign corporation for its taxable year beginning January 1, 2017, but not for prior taxable years, except as a result of a transaction described in the facts of an example. USP owns all 50 shares of stock of FT1, a controlled foreign corporation, which, in turn, owns all 50 shares of FT2, a controlled foreign corporation. FP acquired all of the stock of USP in an inversion transaction that was completed on July 1, 2016. Therefore, with respect to that inversion transaction, USP is an expatriated entity; FT1 and FT2 are expatriated foreign subsidiaries; and FP and FS are each a non-EFS foreign related person. All entities have a calendar year tax year for U.S. tax purposes. All shares of stock have a fair market value of $1x, and each corporation has a single class of stock outstanding.


(f) *Gain recognition upon certain transfers of property described in section 351 following an inversion transaction*—(1) *General rule.* If, during the applicable period, an expatriated foreign subsidiary transfers specified property to a foreign corporation (the transferee foreign corporation) in an exchange described in section 351, then the expatriated foreign subsidiary must recognize all realized gain with respect to the specified property transferred that would not otherwise be recognized, unless the exception in paragraph (f)(2) of this section applies.


(2) *De minimis exception.* The exception in this paragraph (f)(2) applies if—


(i) Immediately after the transfer, the transferee foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation; and


(ii) The post-exchange ownership percentage with respect to the transferee foreign corporation is at least 90 percent of the pre-exchange ownership percentage with respect to the expatriated foreign subsidiary.


(3) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (f). For purposes of all of the examples, unless otherwise indicated: FP, a foreign corporation, owns all of the stock of USP, a domestic corporation, and all 10 shares of stock of FS, a controlled foreign corporation for its taxable year beginning January 1, 2017, but not for prior taxable years, except as a result of a transaction described in the facts of an example. USP owns all 50 shares of stock of FT, a controlled foreign corporation. FT owns Asset A, which is specified property with a fair market value of $50x and an adjusted basis of $10x. FP acquired all of the stock of USP in an inversion transaction that was completed on or after September 22, 2014. Accordingly, with respect to that inversion transaction, USP is an expatriated entity, FT is an expatriated foreign subsidiary, and FP and FS are each a non-EFS foreign related person. All entities have a calendar year tax year for U.S. tax purposes. All shares of stock have a fair market value of $1x, and each corporation has a single class of stock outstanding.


(g) *Income inclusion and gain recognition in exchanges occurring in connection with certain triangular reorganizations*—(1) *Rule.* If, in an exchange under section 354 or 356 that occurs in connection with a transaction described in § 1.367(b)-10, an exchanging shareholder exchanges stock or securities of a foreign acquired corporation, then, to the extent that the exchanging shareholder receives stock or securities of P acquired by S in exchange for property in the P acquisition, the shareholder must—


(i) Include in income as a deemed dividend the section 1248 amount attributable to the stock that the shareholder exchanges; and


(ii) After taking into account the increase in basis in the stock provided in § 1.367(b)-2(e)(3)(ii) resulting from the deemed dividend (if any), recognize all realized gain with respect to the stock or securities that would not otherwise be recognized.


(2) *Special rules and definitions.* For the purposes of this paragraph (g), an *exchanging shareholder* means a United States person or foreign person that exchanges stock of a foreign acquired corporation in a prescribed exchange, regardless of whether such United States person is a section 1248 shareholder or such foreign person is a foreign corporation in which a United States person is a section 1248 shareholder. As used in this paragraph (g), the terms P, S, property, and P acquisition have the meanings provided in § 1.367(b)-10(a), and the term *foreign person* means a person that is not a United States person.


(3) *Example.* The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (g):


(i) *Facts.* USP, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of FP and USS. FP is a foreign corporation that owns all of the stock of FS, a foreign corporation. USS is a domestic corporation that owns all of the stock of FT, a foreign corporation. USS owns 100 shares of stock of FT, which constitutes a single block of stock with a fair market value of $100x, an adjusted basis of $20x, and a section 1248 amount of $50x. FS has earnings and profits of $60x. A dividend from FS to FP would qualify for the exception to foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(6). FP issues 100 shares of voting stock with a fair market value of $100x to FS, $40x of which (the 40-percent FP block) is issued in exchange for $40x of newly issued common stock of FS and $60x of which (the 60-percent FP block) is issued in exchange for $60x of cash. FS acquires all of the stock of FT held by USS solely in exchange for the $100x of voting stock of FP (that is, FS exchanges both the 40-percent FP block and the 60-percent FP block) in a triangular reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B) (triangular B reorganization).


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Application of § 1.367(b)-10.* The triangular B reorganization is described in § 1.367(b)-10, and the $60x of cash constitutes property under § 1.367(b)-10(a)(3)(ii). Pursuant to § 1.367(b)-10(b)(1), adjustments must be made that have the effect of a distribution of property in the amount of $60x from FS to FP under section 301. The $60x deemed distribution is treated as separate from, and occurring immediately before, FS's acquisition of the 60-percent FP block used in the triangular B reorganization. The $60x deemed distribution from FS to FP results in $60x of dividend income to FP under section 301(c)(1) that is not foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(6).


(B) *Application of paragraph (g) of this section.* Pursuant to § 1.367(a)-3(a)(2)(iv)(B), this paragraph (g) applies to $60x of the stock of FT (the 60-percent FT block) exchanged for the 60-percent FP block. Thus, under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, USS must include in income a $30x deemed dividend (representing 60 percent of USS's $50x section 1248 amount) with respect to the 60-percent FT block exchanged for the 60-percent FP block. In addition, under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, USS must recognize its realized gain that would not otherwise be recognized with respect to the 60-percent FT block. USS's fair market value and adjusted basis in the 60-percent FT block are $60x (60 percent of the $100x fair market value of the stock of FT) and $12x (60 percent of the $20x adjusted basis of the stock of FT), respectively. USS's initial built-in gain with respect to the 60-percent FT block is accordingly $48x ($60x fair market value less $12x adjusted basis). The $30x deemed dividend increases USS's basis in the 60-percent FT block to $42 ($12x + $30x), leaving $18x ($60x−$42x) of built-in gain. USS must therefore recognize the remaining $18x of gain with respect to the 60-percent FT block.


(C) *Application of paragraph (b) of this section and regulations under section 367(a).* USS has $32x of built-in gain in the remaining $40x of stock of FT (the 40-percent FT block) that USS exchanged for the 40-percent FP block, calculated as USS's initial $80 of built-in gain in all of its stock of FT less the $48x of initial built-in gain attributable to the 60-percent FT block. USS's section 1248 amount in the 40-percent FT block is $20x, calculated as 40 percent of USS's $50x section 1248 amount. USS does not recognize a deemed dividend of the $20x section 1248 amount under paragraph (b) of this section because FT remains a controlled foreign corporation with respect to which USS is a section 1248 shareholder immediately after the triangular B reorganization. Unless USS properly files a gain recognition agreement pursuant to §§ 1.367(a)-3(b) and 1.367(a)-8, USS recognizes the $32x of built-in gain under section 367(a)(1) with respect to the 40-percent FT block.


(h) *Definitions and special rules.* In addition to the definitions and special rules in §§ 1.367(b)-2 and 1.7874-12, the following definitions and special rules apply for purposes of this section.


(1) *Indirect ownership.* To determine indirect ownership of the stock of a corporation for purposes of calculating a pre-exchange ownership percentage or post-exchange ownership percentage with respect to that corporation, the principles of section 958(a) apply without regard to whether an intermediate entity is foreign or domestic. For this purpose, stock of the corporation that is directly or indirectly (applying the principles of section 958(a) without regard to whether an intermediate entity is foreign or domestic) owned by a domestic corporation that is an expatriated entity is not treated as indirectly owned by a non-EFS foreign related person.


(2) A *lower-tier expatriated foreign subsidiary* means an expatriated foreign subsidiary whose stock is directly or indirectly owned (under the principles of section 958(a)) by an expatriated foreign subsidiary.


(3) *Pre-exchange ownership percentage* means, with respect to a corporation, 100 percent less the percentage of stock (by value) in the corporation that, immediately before an exchange, is owned, in the aggregate, directly or indirectly by non-EFS foreign related persons.


(4) *Post-exchange ownership percentage* means, with respect to a corporation, 100 percent less the percentage of stock (by value) in the corporation that, immediately after the exchange, is owned, in the aggregate, directly or indirectly by non-EFS foreign related persons.


(5) *Specified property* means any property other than stock of a lower-tier expatriated foreign subsidiary.


(6) *Recapitalizations.* A foreign corporation that undergoes a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(E) is treated as both the foreign acquired corporation and the transferee foreign corporation.


(7) *Triangular reorganizations*—(i) *Definition.* A triangular reorganization means a reorganization described in § 1.358-6(b)(2)(i) (forward triangular merger), (ii) (triangular C reorganization), (iii) (reverse triangular merger), (iv) (triangular B reorganization), and (v) (triangular G reorganization).


(ii) *Special rules*—(A) *Triangular reorganizations other than a reverse triangular merger.* In the case of a triangular reorganization other than a reverse triangular merger, the surviving corporation is the transferee foreign corporation that acquires the assets or stock of the foreign acquired corporation, and the reference to controlling corporation (foreign or domestic) is to the corporation that controls the surviving corporation.


(B) *Reverse triangular merger.* In the case of a reverse triangular merger, the surviving corporation is the entity that survives the merger, and the controlling corporation (foreign or domestic) is the corporation that before the merger controls the merged corporation. In the case of a reverse triangular merger, this section applies only if stock of the foreign surviving corporation is exchanged for stock of a foreign corporation in control of the merging corporation; in such a case, the foreign surviving corporation is treated as a foreign acquired corporation.


(i) *Applicability date of certain paragraphs in this section.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (i), paragraphs (a), (b) introductory text, (b)(1)(i)(C), (d)(1), (e), (f), and (h) of this section apply to exchanges completed on or after September 22, 2014, but only if the inversion transaction was completed on or after September 22, 2014. Paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section applies to exchanges completed on or after November 19, 2015, but only if the inversion transaction was completed on or after September 22, 2014. The portion of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section that requires the exchanging shareholder to be an expatriated entity or an expatriated foreign subsidiary apply to exchanges completed on or after April 4, 2016, but only if the inversion transaction was completed on or after September 22, 2014. For inversion transactions completed on or after September 22, 2014, however, taxpayers may elect to apply the portion of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section that requires the exchanging shareholder to be an expatriated entity or an expatriated foreign subsidiary to exchanges completed on or after September 22, 2014, and before April 4, 2016. Paragraphs (f) and (h)(5) of this section apply to transfers completed on or after April 4, 2016, but only if the inversion transaction was completed or after September 22, 2014. See § 1.367(b)-4, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2016, for exchanges completed before September 22, 2014. Paragraph (g) of this section applies to transactions completed on or after December 2, 2016. Paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section applies to exchanges completed in taxable years of exchanging shareholders ending on or after November 2, 2020, and to taxable years of exchanging shareholders ending before November 2, 2020, resulting from an entity classification election made under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter that was effective on or before November 2, 2020, but was filed on or after November 2, 2020.
