# § 1.367(d)-1   Transfers of intangible property to foreign corporations.

(a) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.367(d)-1T(a).


(b) *Property subject to section 367(d).* Section 367(d) and the rules of this section apply to the transfer of intangible property, as defined in § 1.367(a)-1(d)(5), by a U.S. person to a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 351 or 361. See section 367(a) and the regulations thereunder for the rules that apply to the transfer of any property other than intangible property.


(c) *Deemed payments upon transfer of intangible property to foreign corporation*—(1) *In general.* For further guidance, *see* § 1.367(d)-1T(c)(1).


(2) *Required adjustments.* For further guidance, *see* § 1.367(d)-1T(c)(2) introductory text and (c)(2)(i).


(i) [Reserved]


(ii) The deemed payment is treated as an allowable deduction (whether or not that amount is paid) of the transferee foreign corporation properly allocated and apportioned to the appropriate classes of gross income in accordance with §§ 1.882-4(b)(1), 1.951A-2(c)(3), 1.954-1(c), and 1.960-1(c) and(d), as applicable.


(3) *Useful life*—(i) *In general.* For purposes of determining the period of inclusions for deemed payments under § 1.367(d)-1T(c)(1), the useful life of intangible property is the entire period during which exploitation of the intangible property is reasonably anticipated to affect the determination of taxable income, as of the time of transfer. Exploitation of intangible property includes any direct or indirect use or transfer of the intangible property, including use without further development, use in the further development of the intangible property itself (and any exploitation of the further developed intangible property), and use in the development of other intangible property (and any exploitation of the other developed intangible property).


(ii) *Procedure to limit inclusions to 20 years.* In cases where the useful life of the transferred property is indefinite or is reasonably anticipated to exceed twenty years, taxpayers may, in lieu of including amounts during the entire useful life of the intangible property, choose in the year of transfer to increase annual inclusions during the 20-year period beginning with the first year in which the U.S. transferor takes into account income pursuant to section 367(d), to reflect amounts that, but for this paragraph (c)(3)(ii), would have been required to be included following the end of the 20-year period. See § 1.6038B-1(d)(1)(iv) for guidance on reporting this choice of method. If the taxpayer applies this method during the 20-year period, no adjustments will be made for taxable years beginning after the conclusion of the 20-year period. However, for purposes of determining whether amounts included during the 20-year period are commensurate with the income attributable to the transferred intangible property, the Commissioner may take into account information with respect to taxable years after that period, such as the income attributable to the transferred property during those later years. The application of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) must be reflected in a statement (titled “Application of 20-Year Inclusion Period to Section 367(d) Transfers”) attached to a timely filed original federal income tax return (including extensions) for the year of the transfer. An increase to the deemed payment rate made pursuant to this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) will be irrevocable, and a failure to timely file the statement under this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) may not be remedied.


(iii) *Example.* Property subject to section 367(d) is transferred from USP, a domestic corporation, to FA, a foreign corporation wholly owned by USP. The useful life of the transferred property, inclusive of derivative works, at the time of transfer is indefinite but is reasonably anticipated to exceed 20 years. In the first five years following the transfer, sales related to the property are expected to be $100x, $130x, $160x, $180x and $187.2x, respectively. Thereafter, for the remainder of the property's useful life, sales are expected to grow by four percent annually. In the first five years following the transfer, operating profits attributable to the property are expected to be $5x, $8x, $11x, $12.5x, and $13x, respectively. Thereafter, for the remainder of the property's useful life, operating profits are expected to grow by four percent annually. It is determined that the appropriate discount rate for sales and operating profits is 10 percent. The present value of operating profits through the property's indefinite useful life is $185x. The present value of sales through the property's indefinite useful life is $2698x. Accordingly, the sales based royalty rate during the property's useful life is 6.8 percent ($185x/$2698x). The taxpayer may choose to take income inclusions into account over a 20-year period. The present value of sales through the 20-year period is $1787x. Accordingly, the sales based royalty rate under the 20-year option is increased to 10.3 percent ($185x/$1787x).


(4) *Blocked income.* For further guidance, *see* § 1.367(d)-1T(c)(4).


(d) *Subsequent transfer of stock of transferee corporation to unrelated person.* For further guidance, *see* § 1.367(d)-1T(d).


(e) *Subsequent transfer of stock of transferee foreign corporation to related person*—(1) *Transfer to related U.S. person treated as disposition of intangible property.* For further guidance, *see* § 1.367(d)-1T(e)(1).


(2) *Required adjustments.* For further guidance, *see* § 1.367(d)-1T(e)(2) introductory text and (e)(2)(i).


(i) [Reserved]


(ii) The deemed payment is treated as an allowable deduction (whether or not that amount is paid) of the transferee foreign corporation properly allocated and apportioned to the appropriate classes of gross income in accordance with §§ 1.882-4(b)(1), 1.951A-2(c)(3), 1.954-1(c), and 1.960-1(c) and(d), as applicable.


(iii) For further guidance, *see* § 1.367(d)-1T(e)(2)(iii) through (e)(4).


(iv) [Reserved]


(3)-(4) [Reserved]


(f) *Subsequent disposition of transferred intangible property by transferee foreign corporation*—(1) *In general.* For further guidance, *see* § 1.367(d)-1T(f)(1).


(2) *Required adjustments.* If a U.S. transferor is required to recognize gain under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section or § 1.367(d)-1T(f)(1), then, in addition to the adjustments described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section and § 1.367(d)-1T(c)(2) with respect to the deemed payment described in § 1.367(d)-1T(f)(1)(ii)—


(i) For purposes of chapter 1 of the Code, the transferee foreign corporation reduces (but not below zero) the portion of its earnings and profits and gross income arising by reason of the subsequent disposition of the intangible property by the amount of gain recognized by the U.S. transferor under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section or § 1.367(d)-1T(f)(1); and


(ii) The U.S. transferor may establish an account receivable from the transferee foreign corporation equal to the amount of gain recognized under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section or § 1.367(d)-1T(f)(1) in accordance with § 1.367(d)-1T(g)(1).


(3) *Subsequent transfer of intangible property to related person.* Except as provided in paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section, a U.S. person's requirement to recognize income under § 1.367(d)-1T(c) or (e) is not affected by the transferee foreign corporation's subsequent disposition of the transferred intangible property to a related person. For purposes of any required adjustments, and of any accounts receivable created under § 1.367(d)-1T(g)(1), the related person that receives the intangible property is treated as the transferee foreign corporation.


(4) *Subsequent transfer of intangible property to qualified domestic person*—(i) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (f)(4)(v) of this section, if a U.S. person transfers intangible property subject to section 367(d) and the rules of this section and § 1.367(d)-1T to a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 351 or 361 and, within the useful life of the intangible property, that transferee foreign corporation subsequently disposes of the intangible property to a qualified domestic person, then—


(A) The U.S. transferor of the intangible property (or any person treated as such pursuant to § 1.367(d)-1T(e)(1)) is required to recognize gain, as applicable, equal to the amount described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section; and


(B) If the U.S. transferor provides the information described in § 1.6038B-1(d)(2)(iv), then—


(*1*) The U.S. transferor is required to recognize a deemed payment as provided in § 1.367(d)-1T(f)(1)(ii); and


(*2*) The intangible property is no longer subject to section 367(d), this section, or § 1.367(d)-1T after applying paragraphs (f)(4)(i)(A) and (f)(4)(i)(B)(*1*) of this section.


(ii) *Gain recognition for U.S. transferor.* The amount of gain a U.S. transferor must recognize under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section is determined as follows—


(A) If the intangible property is transferred basis property (as defined in section 7701(a)(43)) by reason of the subsequent disposition (determined without regard to section 367(d), this section, and § 1.367(d)-1T), the amount of gain, if any, the transferee foreign corporation would recognize if its adjusted basis in the intangible property were equal to the U.S. transferor's former adjusted basis in the property; or


(B) If the intangible property is not transferred basis property by reason of the subsequent disposition (determined without regard to section 367(d), this section, and § 1.367(d)-1T), the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the intangible property on the date of the subsequent disposition over the U.S. transferor's former adjusted basis in that property.


(iii) *Qualified domestic person.* For purposes of this paragraph (f)(4), a *qualified domestic person* means—


(A) The U.S. transferor that initially transferred intangible property subject to section 367(d);


(B) A U.S. person treated as a U.S. transferor under § 1.367(d)-1T(e)(1), provided such person is an individual or a corporation other than a corporation exempt from tax under section 501(a), a regulated investment company (as defined in section 851(a)), a real estate investment trust (as defined in section 856(a)), a DISC (as defined in section 992(a)(1)), or an S corporation (as defined in section 1361(a));


(C) A U.S. person that is an individual related, within the meaning of paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section and § 1.367(d)-1T(h), to the person described in paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section; or


(D) A U.S. person that is a corporation related, within the meaning of paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section and § 1.367(d)-1T(h), to the person described in paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section, other than a corporation exempt from tax under section 501(a), a regulated investment company (as defined in section 851(a)), a real estate investment trust (as defined in section 856(a)), a DISC (as defined in section 992(a)(1)), or an S corporation (as defined in section 1361(a)).


(iv) *Qualified domestic person's basis in the intangible property.* The qualified domestic person's adjusted basis in the intangible property is—


(A) In the case of a subsequent disposition of intangible property described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, and subject to any applicable limitations that may apply under the Code, the lesser of the U.S. transferor's former adjusted basis in the intangible property or the transferee foreign corporation's adjusted basis in the intangible property (as determined immediately before the subsequent disposition), in each case increased by the greater of the amount of gain (if any) described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(A) of this section and recognized by the U.S. transferor or the amount of gain (if any) recognized by the transferee foreign corporation as to the intangible property by reason of the subsequent disposition; or


(B) In the case of a subsequent disposition of intangible property described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, the fair market value of the intangible property (as determined on the date of the subsequent disposition).


(v) *Special rule for related transactions.* If the transferee foreign corporation subsequently disposes of the transferred intangible property to a person that would, absent this paragraph (f)(4)(v), be a qualified domestic person (initial transferee) and, as part of a series of related transactions, the intangible property is subsequently disposed of to any other person, including by reason of multiple dispositions, then the initial transferee is treated as a qualified domestic person only if the ultimate recipient of the intangible property is a qualified domestic person. *see* paragraphs (f)(6)(ii)(D) and (E) of this section (*Examples 4* and *5*) for illustrations of the application of this paragraph (f)(4)(v).


(5) *Relief for certain failures to comply.* This paragraph (f)(5) provides relief if paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B)(*2*) of this section would apply but for the U.S. transferor's failure to provide the information required by paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section (a “failure to comply”). When a failure to comply occurs, the subsequent disposition of the transferred intangible property is generally subject to paragraphs (f)(3) and (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section. Nevertheless, a failure to comply is deemed not to have occurred (regardless of whether the U.S. transferor continued to include amounts in gross income under § 1.367(d)-1T(c) or (e) after the subsequent disposition), and the requirements of paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section are treated as satisfied as of the date of the subsequent disposition if—


(i) Promptly after the U.S. transferor becomes aware of the failure, the U.S. transferor provides such information and provides a reasonable explanation for its failure to comply to the Director of Field Operations, Cross Border Activities Practice Area of Large Business & International (or any successor to the roles and responsibilities of such position, as appropriate), by eFax at (855) 582-4842 (or as otherwise directed on *irs.gov*), or, if any taxable year of the U.S. transferor is under examination when the discovery is made, to the Internal Revenue Service personnel conducting the examination;


(ii) The U.S. transferor timely files an amended return for the taxable year in which the subsequent disposition occurred (and, if applicable, for each taxable year starting with the taxable year immediately after the taxable year in which the subsequent disposition occurred and ending with the taxable year in which the U.S. transferor seeks relief under this paragraph (f)(5)) that includes the information required by paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section; and


(iii) If any taxable year of the U.S. transferor is under examination when an amended return is filed, the U.S. transferor provides a copy of the amended return (or, if applicable, amended returns) to the Internal Revenue Service personnel conducting the examination.


(6) *Examples*—(i) *Assumed facts.* For purposes of the examples in paragraph (f)(6)(ii) of this section, and except where otherwise indicated, the following facts are assumed.


(A) USP and USS are domestic corporations that each use a calendar taxable year.


(B) TFC is a foreign corporation whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar.


(C) In year 1, USP transfers intangible property, as defined in section 367(d)(4), with a $0 adjusted basis, to TFC in a section 351 exchange (the transferred IP), and such transfer is subject to section 367(d).


(D) Each annual inclusion (including any amount described in § 1.367(d)-1T(f)(1)(ii)) is taken into account under section 367(d)(2)(A)(ii)(I) and § 1.367(d)-1T(c)(1).


(E) Any subsequent transfer or disposition of stock of TFC or the transferred IP occurs within the useful life of the transferred IP.


(F) All transactions are respected under general principles of tax law.


(ii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (f)(4) of this section and other paragraphs of this section that relate to paragraph (f)(4).


(A) *Example 1: Complete liquidation of transferee foreign corporation into a qualified domestic person*—(*1*) *Facts.* In year 2, USP transfers all the stock of TFC to USS, a related person within the meaning of § 1.367(d)-1T(h) and paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section, in a section 351 exchange to which § 1.367(d)-1T(e)(1) applies (the year 2 transfer). In year 3, TFC distributes all its property (including the transferred IP) to USS pursuant to a complete liquidation to which sections 332 and 337 apply (the year 3 liquidation). The all earnings and profits amount determined under § 1.367(b)-2(d) with respect to the stock of TFC held by USS is $0. The information described in § 1.6038B-1(d)(2) is provided by USS for the taxable year in which the year 3 liquidation occurs.


(*2*) *Analysis*—(*i*) *The year 2 transfer.* Because the year 2 transfer involves a transfer of all the stock of TFC by USP (the initial U.S. transferor) to a related U.S. person (USS), under § 1.367(d)-1T(e)(1)(i) USS (a successor U.S. transferor) is treated as receiving the right to receive a proportionate share of the contingent annual payments that USP would have otherwise taken into account under § 1.367(d)-1T(c). As determined under § 1.367(d)-1T(e)(4), USS's proportionate share of such payments is 100 percent. Accordingly, USS will annually include in its gross income the full amount of each of the annual payments that USP would otherwise have taken into account under § 1.367(d)-1T(c) over the useful life of the transferred IP, and USP will not recognize any gain upon the year 2 transfer. *see* § 1.367(d)-1T(e)(1)(ii) and (iii).


(*ii*) *The year 3 liquidation.* The year 3 liquidation results in a subsequent disposition of the transferred IP to USS. USS, a U.S. person treated as the U.S. transferor pursuant to § 1.367(d)-1T(e)(1), is a qualified domestic person within the meaning of paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section, USS must recognize the amount of gain described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section. Because the year 3 liquidation is a complete liquidation to which sections 332 and 337 apply, the intangible property is transferred basis property (as defined in section 7701(a)(43) and determined without regard to section 367(d), this section, and § 1.367(d)-1T), and therefore paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(A) of this section applies to determine the amount of any gain USS must recognize. Because TFC does not recognize gain with respect to the transferred IP (regardless of the adjusted basis in the intangible property) by reason of the year 3 liquidation, the amount of gain described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(A) of this section is $0. Accordingly, USS does not recognize gain pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section by reason of the year 3 liquidation. Additionally, because USS provides the information described in § 1.6038B-1(d)(2), paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section applies to the year 3 liquidation. USS therefore recognizes a deemed payment representing the part of USS's taxable year during which TFC held the transferred IP pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B)(*1*) of this section, and the required adjustments described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section and § 1.367(d)-1T(c)(2)(i) apply as to the deemed payment. Also, because USS does not recognize gain pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section, the required adjustments described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section do not apply. Pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B)(*2*) of this section, after taking the deemed payment into account, the transferred IP is no longer subject to section 367(d), this section, and § 1.367(d)-1T. Finally, pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(iv)(A) of this section, USS's adjusted basis in the transferred IP is $0, which is equal to USP's former adjusted basis in the transferred IP ($0), increased by the greater of the amount of gain recognized by USS under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section ($0) or the amount of gain recognized by TFC upon the year 3 liquidation ($0).


(B) *Example 2: Taxable distribution of the transferred intangible property to a qualified domestic person*—(*1*) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(6)(ii)(A) of this section (*Example 1*), except that, instead of in year 3 TFC distributing all its property to USS pursuant to a complete liquidation, in year 3 TFC distributes the transferred IP to USS in a distribution described in section 311(b) when the fair market value of the transferred IP is $100x (the year 3 distribution). TFC's adjusted basis in the transferred IP immediately before the distribution is $0.


(*2*) *Analysis.* The consequence of the year 2 transfer is the same as described in paragraph (f)(6)(ii)(A)(*2*)(*i*) of this section (*Example 1*). Like the consequences described in paragraph (f)(6)(ii)(A)(*2*) of this section (*Example 1*), the year 3 distribution is a subsequent disposition of the transferred IP to USS, a qualified domestic person. Pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section, USS must recognize the amount of gain described in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section. Because the year 3 distribution is described in section 311(b) the intangible property is not transferred basis property (as defined in section 7701(a)(43) and determined without regard to section 367(d), this section, and § 1.367(d)-1T), and therefore USS must recognize $100x gain under paragraph (f)(4)(ii)(B) of this section. The $100x gain amount equals the excess of the fair market value of the transferred IP on the date of the year 3 distribution ($100x) over USP's former adjusted basis in the property ($0). TFC, because of USS's gain recognition under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section, reduces (but not below zero) the portion of its earnings and profits and gross income arising by reason of the year 3 distribution by the amount of such gain under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. Specifically, because the year 3 distribution requires USS to recognize $100x of gain, TFC reduces the portion of its earnings and profits and gross income that arise by reason of the year 3 distribution, which is $100x (the excess of the fair market value of the transferred IP ($100x) over TFC's adjusted basis in the transferred IP ($0)), by $100x (the amount of gain USS recognizes pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section). As a result, after taking into account the reduction, TFC has no earnings and profits or gross income that arise by reason of the year 3 distribution. Furthermore, USS may establish an account receivable from TFC equal to $100x under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section. Additionally, and as described in paragraph (f)(6)(ii)(A)(*2*) of this section (*Example 1*), pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B)(*1*) of this section, USS recognizes a deemed payment for the portion of USS's taxable year during which TFC held the transferred IP, and the required adjustments described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section and § 1.367(d)-1T(c)(2) apply to this deemed payment. After taking these consequences into account, pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B)(*2*) of this section, the transferred IP is no longer subject to section 367(d), this section, and § 1.367(d)-1T. Finally, pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(iv)(B) of this section, USS's adjusted basis in the transferred IP is $100x, which is the fair market value of the transferred IP on the date of the year 3 distribution.


(C) *Example 3: Qualified domestic person's basis in intangible property when intangible property is repatriated in an exchange described in section 351*(*b*)—(*1*) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(6)(ii)(A) of this section (*Example 1*), except that the transfer of stock of TFC to USS in year 2 does not occur and instead of the year 3 liquidation, in year 3 TFC transfers the intangible property to USS (a qualified domestic person as defined in paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section) in an exchange described in section 351(b) pursuant to which TFC recognizes $50x of gain and USP recognizes $50x of gain under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section (the year 3 exchange), which amount will reduce TFC's earnings and profits and gross income by $50x under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.


(*2*) *Analysis.* Pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(iv)(A) of this section, USS's adjusted basis in the intangible property is $50x, which is the amount equal to the lesser of USP's former adjusted basis in the property ($0) or TFC's adjusted basis in the property ($0), increased by the greater of the amount of gain recognized by USP under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section ($50x) or the amount of gain recognized by TFC upon the year 3 exchange ($50x).


(D) *Example 4: Repatriation as part of a series of related transactions culminating in transfer to a foreign corporation*—(*1*) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(6)(ii)(A)(*1*) of this section (*Example 1*), except that the year 3 liquidation occurs as part of a series of related transactions pursuant to which USS transfers the transferred IP that it receives from TFC to a related foreign corporation (FC1) in exchange for stock in FC1.


(*2*) *Analysis.* Because the year 3 liquidation occurs as part of a series of related transactions pursuant to which the transferred IP is ultimately contributed to a FC1, a foreign corporation, and because a foreign corporation is not a qualified domestic person pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section, then, under paragraph (f)(4)(v) of this section, the year 3 liquidation is not treated as a subsequent disposition described in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, but is instead treated as a subsequent disposition described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.


(E) *Example 5: Repatriation as part of a series of related transactions culminating in transfer to a qualified domestic person*—(*1*) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(6)(ii)(B)(*1*) of this section (*Example 2*), except that the year 3 distribution occurs as part of a series of related transactions pursuant to which USS disposes of the transferred IP that it receives from TFC to USP.


(*2*) *Analysis.* Because the year 3 distribution occurs as part of a series of related transactions pursuant to which the transferred IP is distributed to USP, and because USP is a qualified domestic person pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section, paragraph (f)(4)(v) of this section does not prevent paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section from applying to the year 3 distribution. Accordingly, the consequences under section 367(d) of the year 3 distribution are the same as those described in paragraph (f)(6)(ii)(B)(*2*) of this section (*Example 2*), and the consequences of the subsequent disposition of the transferred IP by USS to USP are determined after applying paragraph (f)(4) of this section to the transfer of the transferred IP by TFC to USS.

(2) *Election to treat transfer as sale.* For further guidance, *see* § 1.367(d)-1T(g)(2) introductory text.


(i) The intangible property transferred constitutes an operating intangible, as defined in § 1.367(a)-1(d)(6).


(ii) For further guidance, *see* § 1.367-1T(g)(2)(ii) through (g)(2)(iii)(D).

(E) The transferred intangible property will be used in the active conduct of a trade or business outside of the United States within the meaning of § 1.367(a)-2 and will not be used in connection with the manufacture or sale of products in or for use or consumption in the United States.


(F) For further guidance, *see* § 1.367(d)-1T(g)(2)(iii)(F).


(3) *Intangible property transferred from branch with previously deducted losses.* (i) If income is required to be recognized under section 904(f)(3) and the regulations thereunder or under § 1.367(a)-6 upon the transfer of intangible property of a foreign branch that had previously deducted losses, then the income recognized under those sections with respect to that property is credited against amounts that would otherwise be required to be recognized with respect to that same property under paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section in either the current or future taxable years. The amount recognized under section 904(f)(3) or § 1.367(a)-6 with respect to the transferred intangible property is determined in accordance with the following formula:


(ii) For purposes of the formula in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, the “loss recapture income” is the total amount required to be recognized by the U.S. transferor pursuant to section 904(f)(3) or § 1.367(a)-6. The “gain from intangible property” is the total amount of gain realized by the U.S. transferor pursuant to section 904(f)(3) and § 1.367(a)-6 upon the transfer of items of property that are subject to section 367(d). “Gain from intangible property” does not include gain realized with respect to intangible property by reason of an election under paragraph (g)(2) of this section. The “gain from all branch assets” is the total amount of gain realized by the transferor upon the transfer of items of property of the branch for which gain is realized.
