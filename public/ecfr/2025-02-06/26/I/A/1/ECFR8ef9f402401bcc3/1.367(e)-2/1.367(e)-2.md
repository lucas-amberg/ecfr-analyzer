# § 1.367(e)-2   Distributions described in section 367(e)(2).

(a) *Purpose and scope*—(1) *In general.* This section provides rules requiring gain and loss recognition by a corporation on its distribution of property to a foreign corporation in a complete liquidation described in section 332. Paragraph (b)(1) of this section contains the general rule that gain and loss are recognized when a domestic corporation makes a distribution of property in complete liquidation under section 332 to a foreign corporation that meets the stock ownership requirements of section 332(b) with respect to stock in the domestic corporation. Paragraph (b)(2) of this section provides the only exceptions to the gain and loss recognition rule of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Paragraph (b)(3) of this section refers to other consequences of distributions described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. Paragraph (c)(1) of this section contains the general rule that gain and loss are not recognized when a foreign corporation makes a distribution of property in complete liquidation under section 332 to a foreign corporation that meets the stock ownership requirements of section 332(b) with respect to stock in the foreign liquidating corporation. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section provides the only exceptions to the nonrecognition rule of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section refers to other consequences of distributions described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. Paragraph (d) of this section contains an anti-abuse rule. Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules regarding failures to file statements or other documents required under this section or failures to comply with the requirements of this section. Paragraph (f) of this section provides relief for certain failures to file or comply. Finally, paragraph (g) of this section specifies the effective/applicability dates for the rules of this section. The rules of this section are issued pursuant to the authority conferred by section 367(e)(2).


(2) *Nonapplicability of section 367(a).* Section 367(a) shall not apply to a complete liquidation described in section 332 by a domestic liquidating corporation into a foreign corporation that meets the stock ownership requirements of section 332(b).


(b) *Distribution by a domestic corporation*—(1) *General rule*—(i) *Recognition of gain and loss.* If a domestic corporation (domestic liquidating corporation) makes a distribution of property in complete liquidation under section 332 to a foreign corporation (foreign distributee corporation) that meets the stock ownership requirements of section 332(b) with respect to stock in the domestic liquidating corporation, then—


(A) Section 337(a) and (b)(1) will not apply; and


(B) The domestic liquidating corporation will recognize gain or loss on the distribution of property to the foreign distributee corporation, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.


(ii) *Operating rules*—(A) *General rule.* Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) (B) and (C) of this section, the rules contained in section 336 will apply to the gain and loss recognized pursuant to this section.


(B) *Overall loss limitation*—(*1*) *Overall loss limitation rule.* Loss in excess of gain from the distribution shall not be recognized. If realized losses exceed recognized losses, the losses shall be recognized on a pro rata basis with respect to the realized loss attributable to each distributed loss asset in the category of assets (i.e., capital or ordinary) to which the realized but unrecognized loss relates. For additional limitations on the recognition of losses, see, e.g., section 1211.


(*2*) *Example.* The following example illustrates the overall loss limitation rule, the pro rata loss allocation method, and the general capital loss limitation rule in section 1211(a): 


(C) *Special rules for built-in gains and losses attributable to property received in liquidations and reorganizations.* Built-in losses attributable to property received in a transaction described in sections 332 or 361 (during the two-year period ending on the date of the distribution in liquidation covered by this section) shall not offset gain from property not received in the same transaction. Built-in gains attributable to property received in a transaction described in sections 332 or 361 (during the two-year period ending on the date of the distribution in liquidation covered by this section) shall not be offset by a loss from property not received in the same transaction. Built-in gain or loss is that amount of gain or loss on property that existed at the time the domestic liquidating corporation acquired such property. See sections 336(d) and 382 for additional limitations on the recognition of losses.


(iii) *Distribution of partnership interest*—(A) *General rule.* If a domestic corporation distributes a partnership interest (whether foreign or domestic) in a distribution described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, then for purposes of applying this section the domestic liquidating corporation shall be treated as having distributed a proportionate share of partnership property. Accordingly, the applicability of the recognition rules of paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, and of any exception to recognition provided in this section shall be determined with reference to the partnership property, rather than to the partnership interest itself. Where the partnership property includes an interest in a lower-tier partnership, the applicability of any exception with respect to the interest in the lower-tier partnership shall be determined with reference to the lower-tier partnership property. In the case of multiple tiers of partnerships, the applicability of an exception shall be determined with reference to the property of each partnership, applying the rule contained in the preceding sentence. A domestic liquidating corporation's proportionate share of partnership property shall be determined under the rules and principles of sections 701 through 761 and the regulations thereunder.


(B) *Gain or loss calculation.* [Reserved]


(C) *Basis adjustments.* The foreign distributee corporation's basis in the distributed partnership interest shall be equal to the domestic liquidating corporation's basis in such partnership interest immediately prior to the distribution, increased by the amount of gain and reduced by the amount of loss recognized by the domestic liquidating corporation on the distribution of the partnership interest. Solely for purposes of sections 743 and 754, the foreign distributee corporation shall be treated as having purchased the partnership interest for an amount equal to the foreign corporation's adjusted basis therein.


(D) *Publicly traded partnerships.* The distribution by a domestic liquidating corporation of an interest in a publicly traded partnership that is treated as a corporation for U.S. income tax purposes under section 7704(a) shall not be subject to the rules of paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section. Instead, the distribution of such an interest shall be treated in the same manner as a distribution of stock. Thus, a transfer of an interest in a publicly traded partnership that is treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. income tax purposes shall be treated in the same manner as stock in a domestic corporation, and a transfer of an interest in a publicly traded partnership that is treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. income tax purposes shall be treated in the same manner as stock in a foreign corporation.


(2) *Exceptions*—(i) *Distribution of property used in a U.S. trade or business*—(A) *Conditions for nonrecognition.* A domestic liquidating corporation shall not recognize gain or loss under paragraph (b)(1) of this section on its distribution of property (including inventory) used by the domestic liquidating corporation in the conduct of a trade or business within United States, if—


(*1*) The foreign distributee corporation, immediately thereafter and for the ten-year period beginning on the date of the distribution of such property, uses the property in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States;


(*2*) The domestic liquidating corporation attaches the statement described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section to its timely filed U.S. income tax returns for the taxable years that include the distributions in liquidation; and


(*3*) The foreign distributee corporation attaches a copy of the property description contained in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C)(*2*) of this section to its timely filed U.S. income tax returns for the tax year that includes the date of distribution.


(B) *Qualifying property.* Property is used by the foreign distributee corporation in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States within the meaning of this paragraph (b)(2)(i) only if all income from the use of the property and all income or gain from the sale or exchange of the property would be subject to taxation under section 882(a) as effectively connected income. Also, stock held by a dealer as inventory or for sale in the ordinary course of its trade or business shall be treated as inventory and not as stock in the hands of both the domestic liquidating corporation and the distributee foreign corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exception provided in this paragraph (b)(2)(i) shall not apply to intangibles described in section 367(d)(4).


(C) *Required statement.* The statement required by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section shall be entitled “Required Statement under § 1.367(e)-2(b)(2)(i)” and shall be prepared by the domestic liquidating corporation and signed under penalties of perjury by an authorized officer of the domestic liquidating corporation and by an authorized officer of the foreign distributee corporation. The statement shall contain the following items:


(*1*) A declaration that the distribution to the foreign distributee corporation is one to which the rules of this paragraph (b)(2)(i) apply and a certification that the domestic liquidating corporation and the foreign distributee corporation agree to comply with all the conditions and requirements of this section, including, as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, to treat a failure to comply (as described in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section) as extending the period of limitations on assessment of tax for the taxable year in which gain is required to be reported.


(*2*) *Property description.* A description of all property distributed by the domestic liquidating corporation (irrespective of whether the property qualifies for nonrecognition). Such description shall be entitled “Master Property Description” and shall identify the property that continues to be used by the foreign distributee corporation in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, including the location, adjusted basis, estimated fair market value, a summary of the method (including appraisals if any) used for determining such value, and the date of distribution of such items of property. The description shall also identify the property excepted from gain recognition under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section.


(*3*) *Distributee identification.* An identification of the foreign distributee corporation, including its name and address, taxpayer identification number, residence, and place of incorporation.


(*4*) *Treaty benefits waiver.* With respect to property entitled to nonrecognition pursuant to this paragraph (b)(2)(i), a declaration by the foreign distributee corporation that it irrevocably waives any right under any treaty (whether or not currently in force at the time of the liquidation) to sell or exchange any item of such property without U.S. income taxation or at a reduced rate of taxation, or to derive income from the use of any item of such property without U.S. income taxation or at a reduced rate of taxation.


(*5*) *Statute of limitations extension.* An agreement by the domestic liquidating corporation and the foreign distributee corporation to extend the statute of limitations on assessments and collections (under section 6501) with respect to the domestic liquidating corporation on the distribution of each item of property until three years after the date on which all such items of property have ceased to be used in a trade or business within the United States, but in no event shall the extension be for a period longer than 13 years from the filing of the original U.S. income tax return for the taxable year of the last distribution of any such item of property. The agreement to extend the statute of limitation shall be executed on a Form 8838, “Consent to Extend the Time to Assess Tax Under Section 367—Gain Recognition Agreement.”


(D) *Failure to file statement.* If a domestic liquidating corporation that would otherwise qualify for nonrecognition on the distribution of property under this paragraph (b)(2)(i) fails to file the statement described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section or files a statement that does not comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section, the Commissioner may treat the domestic liquidating corporation as if it had claimed nonrecognition under this paragraph (b)(2)(i) and met all the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section, if such treatment is necessary to prevent the domestic liquidating corporation or the foreign distributee corporation from otherwise deriving a tax benefit by such failure.


(E) *Operating rules.* By the domestic liquidating corporation's claiming nonrecognition under this paragraph (b)(2)(i) and filing a statement described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section, the domestic liquidating corporation and the foreign distributee corporation agree to be subject to the rules of this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E).


(*1*) *Gain or loss recognition by the foreign distributee corporation*—(*i*) *Taxable dispositions.* If, within the ten-year period from the date of a distribution of qualifying property, the foreign distributee corporation disposes of any qualifying property in a transaction subject to tax under section 882(a), then the foreign distributee corporation shall recognize such gain (or loss) and properly report it on a timely filed U.S. income tax return. If the foreign distributee corporation recognizes gain (or loss) under this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*1*)(*i*) and properly reports such gain (or loss) on its U.S. income tax return, then the domestic liquidating corporation shall not recognize gain attributable to such property under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*2*) of this section.


(*ii*) *Other triggering events.* If, within the ten-year period from the date of distribution, any qualifying property ceases to be used by the foreign distributee corporation in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States (other than by reason of a taxable disposition described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*1*)(*i*) of this section, a nontriggering event described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*4*) of this section, or a nontriggering transfer described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*5*) of this section), then the foreign distributee corporation shall recognize gain (but not loss) attributable to such property and properly report it on a timely filed U.S. income tax return. If the foreign distributee corporation properly reports gain under this paragraph (or if such qualified property is not gain property on the date that it ceases to be used in the foreign distributee corporation's U.S. trade or business), then the domestic liquidating corporation shall not recognize gain attributable to such property under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*2*) of this section. The gain recognized under this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*1*)(*ii*) shall be an amount equal to the fair market value of the property on the date it ceases to be used in the foreign distributee corporation's U.S. trade or business less the foreign distributee corporation's adjusted basis in such property.


(*2*) *Gain recognition by the domestic liquidating corporation*—(*i*) *General rule.* If, within the ten-year period from the date of distribution, any qualifying property described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section ceases to be used by the foreign distributee corporation (or a qualifying transferee described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*5*) of this section) in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States for any reason (including but not limited to the sale or exchange of such property or the removal of the property from conduct of the trade or business), then, except to the extent gain (or loss) is recognized under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(E)(*1*) of this section, the domestic liquidating corporation shall recognize the gain (but not loss) realized but not recognized upon the initial distribution of such item of property. The domestic liquidating corporation shall recognize gain pursuant to this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*2*)(*i*) on the amended U.S. income tax return described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*2*)(*ii*) of this section.


(*ii*) *Amended return.* If gain recognition is required pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*2*)(*i*) of this section, the foreign distributee corporation shall file an amended U.S. income tax return on behalf of the domestic liquidating corporation for the year of the distribution of such item of property. On the amended return, the domestic liquidating corporation may use any losses (or credits) existing in the year of the distribution to offset the gain recognized pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*2*)(*i*) of this section (or the tax thereon), provided that the losses (or credits) were otherwise available in the year distribution and were not used in another year. The amended return shall be filed no later than the due date (including extensions) for the return of the foreign distributee corporation for the taxable year in which the property ceases to be used by the foreign distributee corporation in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.


(*iii*) *Interest.* If the domestic liquidating corporation owes additional tax pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*2*)(*i*) of this section for the year of liquidation, then interest must be paid on that amount at the rates determined under section 6621. The interest due will be calculated from the due date of the domestic liquidating corporation's U.S. income tax return for the year of the distribution to the date on which the additional tax for that year is paid.


(*iv*) *Joint and several liability.* The foreign distributee corporation shall be jointly and severally liable for any tax owed by the domestic liquidating corporation as a result of the application of this section, and shall succeed to the domestic liquidating corporation's agreement to extend the statute of limitations on assessments and collections under section 6501.


(*3*) *Schedule for property no longer used in a U.S. trade or business.* If qualifying property (other than inventory) ceases to be used by the foreign distributee corporation in the conduct of a U.S. trade or business in the ten-year period beginning on the date of distribution of such property from the domestic liquidating corporation to the foreign distributee corporation, then the foreign distributee corporation shall list on a separate schedule (attached to its timely filed U.S. income tax return for the year of cessation) all such qualifying property. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*3*), property ceases to be used in a U.S. trade or business whenever such property is sold, exchanged, or otherwise removed from the U.S. trade or business, irrespective of whether the domestic liquidating corporation filed an amended return under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*2*) of this section, and irrespective of whether the property ceases to be used in the foreign distributee corporation's U.S. trade or business by virtue of a nontriggering event described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*4*) of this section or a nontriggering transfer described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*5*) of this section.


(*4*) *Nontriggering events*—(*i*) *Conversions, certain exchanges, and abandonment.* Gain (or loss) under this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E) shall not be triggered if qualifying property described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section is involuntarily converted into, or exchanged for, similar qualifying property used in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, to the extent such conversion or exchange qualifies for nonrecognition under section 1033 or 1031. Also, the abandonment or disposal of worthless or obsolete property shall not trigger gain (or loss) under this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E).


(*ii*) *Amendment to Master Property Description.* If the foreign distributee corporation acquires replacement property by virtue of a conversion or exchange of the qualifying property under this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*4*), then the foreign distributee corporation shall attach to its timely filed U.S. income tax return for the year of the acquisition such replacement property a schedule entitled “Amendment to Master Property Description Required by § 1.367(e)-2(b)(2)(i)” that lists the replacement property and the property being replaced.


(*5*) *Nontriggering transfers to qualified transferees.* Gain (or loss) under this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E) will not be triggered if qualifying property described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section is transferred to another person (qualified transferee) in a transaction qualifying for nonrecognition under the Internal Revenue Code (other than transactions described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(E)(4)(*i*) and (c)(1) of this section), if—


(*i*) The qualified transferee (and all other subsequent qualified transferees), immediately thereafter and for the ten-year period beginning on the date of the initial distribution of such qualifying property from the domestic liquidating corporation to the foreign distributee corporation, uses the property in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States;


(*ii*) The foreign distributee corporation (or its successor in interest) prepares and attaches to its timely filed U.S. income tax return for the year of transfer a statement entitled “Required Statement under § 1.367(e)-2(b)(2)(i)(E)(*5*) for Property Transferred to a Qualified Transferee” that is signed under penalties of perjury by an authorized officer of the foreign distributee corporation and by a person similarly authorized by the qualified transferee;


(*iii*) The statement described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*5*)(*ii*) of this section shall contain a description of all qualifying property transferred by the foreign distributee corporation (or qualified transferee) to the qualified transferee (or subsequent qualified transferee);


(*iv*) The statement described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*5*)(*ii*) of this section shall also contain an identification of the qualified transferee (or subsequent qualified transferee), including its name and address, taxpayer identification number, residence, and place of incorporation (if applicable);


(*v*) The statement described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*5*)(*ii*) of this section shall also contain a declaration by the qualifying transferee (or subsequent qualifying transferee) that it irrevocably waives any right under any treaty (whether or not currently in force at the time of the liquidation) to sell or exchange any item of such property without U.S. income taxation or at a reduced rate of taxation, or to derive income from the use of any item of such qualifying property without U.S. income taxation or at a reduced rate of taxation; and


(*vi*) A declaration that the transfer to the qualifying transferee (or subsequent qualifying transferee) is one to which the rules of this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*5*) apply and a certification that the foreign distributee corporation (or its successor in interest) and the qualifying transferee (or subsequent qualifying transferee) agree to all of the terms and conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*1*) of this section, replacing “foreign distributee corporation” with “qualifying transferee” and replacing references to “section 882(a)” with “section 871(b)” (as the case may be).


(ii) *Distribution of certain U.S. real property interests.* A domestic liquidating corporation shall not recognize gain (or loss) under paragraph (b)(1) of this section on the distribution of a U.S. real property interest (other than stock in a former U.S. real property holding corporation that is treated as a U.S. real property interest for five years under section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii)). If property distributed by the domestic liquidating corporation is a U.S. real property interest that qualifies for nonrecognition under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) in addition to nonrecognition provided by paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, then the domestic liquidating corporation shall secure nonrecognition pursuant to this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) and not pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.


(iii) *Distribution of stock of domestic subsidiary corporations*—(A) *Conditions for nonrecognition.* A domestic liquidating corporation shall not recognize gain or loss under paragraph (b)(1) of this section on a distribution of stock of an 80 percent domestic subsidiary corporation, if the domestic liquidating corporation attaches a statement described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(D) of this section to its timely filed U.S. income tax return for the year of the distribution of such stock. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii), a corporation is an 80 percent domestic subsidiary corporation, if—


(*1*) The subsidiary corporation is a domestic corporation (but not a foreign corporation that has made an election under section 897(i) to be treated as a U.S. corporation for purposes of section 897);


(*2*) The domestic liquidating corporation owns (directly and without regard to paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section) at least 80 percent of the total voting power of the stock of such corporation; and


(*3*) The domestic liquidating corporation owns (directly and without regard to paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section) at least 80 percent of the total value of all stock of such corporation.


(B) *Exceptions when the liquidating corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation.* If the domestic liquidating corporation is a U.S. real property holding corporation (as defined in section 897(c)(2)) at the time of liquidation (or is a former U.S. real property holding corporation the stock of which is treated as a U.S. real property interest for five years under section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii)), then the exception in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section shall apply only to the distribution of stock of an 80 percent domestic subsidiary corporation that is a U.S. real property holding corporation (as defined in section 897(c)(2)) at the time of the liquidation and immediately thereafter.


(C) *Anti-abuse rule.* (*1*) The exception in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section shall not apply, if a principal purpose of the distribution of the 80 percent domestic subsidiary corporation's stock is the avoidance of U.S. tax that would have been imposed on the domestic liquidating corporation's disposition of such stock when taken together to an unrelated party. A distribution may have a principal purpose of tax avoidance even though the tax avoidance purpose is outweighed by other purposes when taken together.


(*2*) For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(C)(*1*) of this section, a distribution of stock of the 80 percent domestic subsidiary corporation will be deemed to have been made pursuant to a plan, one of the principal purposes of which was the avoidance of U.S. tax, if the foreign distributee corporation disposes of (whether in a recognition or nonrecognition transaction) any such stock within two years of such distribution. The rule in this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(C)(*2*) will not apply if the foreign distributee corporation can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the avoidance of U.S. tax was not a principal purpose of the liquidation.


(D) *Required statement.* The statement required by paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section shall be entitled “Required Statement under § 1.367(e)-2(b)(2)(iii) for Stock of 80 Percent Domestic Subsidiary Corporations” and shall be prepared by the domestic liquidating corporation and shall be signed under penalties of perjury by an authorized officer of the domestic liquidating corporation and by an authorized officer of the foreign distributee corporation. The required statement shall contain a certification that states that if the foreign distributee corporation disposes of any stock subject to paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section in a transaction described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(C) of this section, then the domestic liquidating corporation shall recognize all realized gain attributable to the distributed stock at the time of distribution, and the domestic liquidating corporation (or the foreign distributee corporation on behalf of the domestic liquidating corporation) shall file a U.S. income tax return (or amended U.S. income tax return, as the case may be) for the year of distribution reporting the gain attributable to such stock. The required statement shall also state that the domestic liquidating corporation agrees, as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, to treat a failure to comply (as described in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section) as extending the period of limitations on assessment of tax for the taxable year in which gain is required to be reported.


(3) *Other consequences*—(i) *Distributee basis in property.* The foreign distributee corporation's basis in property subject to this paragraph (b) shall be the same as the domestic liquidating corporation's basis in such property immediately before the liquidation, increased by any gain, or reduced by any loss recognized by the domestic liquidating corporation on such property pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(ii) *Reporting under section 6038B.* Section 6038B and the regulations thereunder apply to a domestic liquidating corporation's transfer of property to a foreign distributee corporation under section 367(e)(2).


(iii) *Other rules.* For other rules that may apply, see sections 381, 897, 1248, and § 1.482-1(f)(2)(i)(C).


(c) *Distribution by a foreign corporation*—(1) *General rule—gain and loss not recognized.* If a foreign corporation (foreign liquidating) makes a distribution of property in complete liquidation under section 332 to a foreign corporation (foreign distributee) that meets the stock ownership requirements of section 332(b) with respect to stock in the foreign liquidating corporation, then, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, section 337 (a) and (b)(1) shall apply and the foreign liquidating corporation shall not recognize gain (or loss) on the distribution under section 367(e)(2). If a foreign liquidating corporation distributes a partnership interest (whether foreign or domestic), then such corporation shall be treated as having distributed a proportionate share of partnership property in accordance with the principles of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.


(2) *Exceptions*—(i) *Property used in a U.S. trade or business*—(A) *General rule.* A foreign liquidating corporation (including a corporation that has made an effective election under section 897(i)) that makes a distribution described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall recognize gain (or loss in accordance with principles contained in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section) on the distribution of qualified property, as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section (other than U.S. real property interests), that is used by the foreign liquidating corporation in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States at the time of distribution.


(B) *Ten-year active U.S. business exception.* A foreign liquidating corporation shall not recognize gain under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section, if—


(*1*) The foreign distributee corporation, immediately thereafter and for the ten-year period beginning on the date of the distribution of such property, uses the property in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States;


(*2*) The foreign distributee corporation is not entitled to benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty (this requirement shall apply only if the foreign liquidating corporation (or predecessor corporation) was not entitled to benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty); and


(*3*) The foreign liquidating corporation and foreign distributee corporation attach the statement described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section to their timely filed U.S. income tax returns for their taxable years that include the distribution.


(C) *Required statement.* The statement required by paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B)(3) of this section shall be entitled “Required Statement under § 1.367(e)-2(c)(2)(i),” shall be prepared by foreign liquidating corporation, shall be signed under penalties of perjury by an authorized officer of the foreign liquidating corporation and by an authorized officer of the foreign distributee corporation, and shall be identical to the statement described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section, except that “§ 1.367(e)-2(c)(2)(i)(B)” shall be substituted for references to “§ 1.367(e)-2(b)(2)(i)” and “foreign liquidating corporation” shall be substituted for “domestic liquidating corporation” each time it appears. References in the rules of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section to various rules in paragraph (b) of this section shall be applied as if such references were to this paragraph (c). However, the statement described in this paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) shall be modified as follows:


(*1*) The foreign distributee corporation shall not be required to waive its income tax treaty benefits as required by § 1.367(e)-2(b)(2)(i)(C)(*4*), unless—


(*i*) The foreign liquidating corporation was required to waive its treaty benefits under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C)(4) of this section in connection with the distribution of such property in a prior liquidation distribution subject to the provisions of this section; or (*ii*) The foreign distributee corporation is entitled benefits under a treaty to which the foreign liquidating corporation was not entitled.


(*2*) If the foreign distributee is required to waive treaty benefits because of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C)(*1*)(*ii*) of this section, then the foreign distributee shall only be required to waive benefits that were not available to the foreign liquidating corporation (or a predecessor corporation) prior to liquidation.


(*3*) The property description described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C)(*2*) of this section shall include only the qualified U.S. trade or business property described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.


(D) *Operating rules.* By the foreign liquidating corporation's claiming nonrecognition under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section and filing a statement described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section, the foreign liquidating corporation and the foreign distributee corporation agree to be subject to the rules of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, as well as the rules of paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(D) and (E) of this section. In applying the rules of paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(D) and (E) of this section, “foreign liquidating corporation” shall be used instead of “domestic liquidating corporation” each time it appears. References in the rules of paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(D) and (E) of this section to various rules in paragraph (b) of this section shall be applied as if such references were to this paragraph (c).


(ii) *Property formerly used in a United States trade or business.* A foreign liquidating corporation that makes a distribution described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall recognize gain (but not loss) on the distribution of property (other than U.S. real property interests) that had ceased to be used by the foreign liquidating corporation in the conduct of a U.S. trade or business within the ten-year period ending on the date of distribution and that would have been subject to section 864(c)(7) had it been disposed. Section 864(c)(7) shall govern the treatment of any gain recognized on the distribution of assets described in this paragraph as income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.


(3) *Other consequences*—(i) *Distributee basis in property.* The foreign distributee corporation's basis in property subject to this paragraph (c) shall be the same as the foreign liquidating corporation's basis in such property immediately before the liquidation, increased by any gain, or reduced by any loss recognized by the foreign liquidating corporation on such property, pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section.


(ii) *Other rules.* For other rules that may apply, see sections 367(b) and 381.


(d) *Anti-abuse rule.* The Commissioner may require a domestic liquidating corporation to recognize gain on a distribution in liquidation described in paragraph (b) of this section (or treat the liquidating corporation as if it had recognized loss on a distribution in liquidation), if a principal purpose of the liquidation is the avoidance of U.S. tax (including, but not limited to, the distribution of a liquidating corporation's earnings and profits with a principal purpose of avoiding U.S. tax). A liquidation may have a principal purpose of tax avoidance even though the tax avoidance purpose is outweighed by other purposes when taken together.


(e) *Failures to file or failures to comply*—(1) *Scope.* This paragraph (e) provides rules regarding a failure to file an initial liquidation document with respect to one or more liquidating distributions by a domestic liquidating corporation that, absent such failure, would qualify for nonrecognition treatment under paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (iii) of this section, or with respect to one or more liquidating distributions by a foreign liquidating corporation that, absent such failure, would qualify for nonrecognition treatment under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section (failure to file). This paragraph (e) also provides rules regarding failures to comply in all material respects with the terms of this section with respect to one or more liquidating distributions for which nonrecognition treatment was initially claimed under paragraph (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(iii), or (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section, as applicable (failure to comply).


(2) *Definitions.* The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.


(i) An *initial liquidation document* means any statement, schedule, or form required to be filed under this section in order for the domestic liquidating corporation or foreign liquidating corporation, as applicable, to initially qualify to claim nonrecognition treatment with respect to one or more liquidating distributions described in this section, including—


(A) The statement and attachments described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section;


(B) The statement described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(D) of this section; and


(C) The statement and attachments described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section.


(ii) A *subsequent liquidation document* means any statement, schedule, or form (other than an initial liquidation document) required to be filed under this section in order for the domestic liquidating corporation or foreign liquidating corporation, as applicable, to continue to qualify for nonrecognition treatment with respect to one or more liquidating distributions described in this section, including—


(A) The schedule described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*3*) of this section;


(B) The schedule described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*4*)(*ii*) of this section; and


(C) The statement and attachments described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E)(*5*) of this section.


(iii) A *timely filed U.S. income tax return* means a Federal income tax return filed on or before the last date prescribed for filing (taking into account any extensions of time therefor) such return.


(3) *Failure to file*—(i) *General rule.* For purposes of this section and except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(D) or (f) of this section, there is a failure to file an initial liquidation document if—


(A) An initial liquidation document is not filed with the timely filed U.S. income tax return specified under this section, or


(B) An initial liquidation document is not completed in all material respects.


(ii) *Consequences of a failure to file.* If there is a failure to file an initial liquidation document, then nonrecognition treatment under paragraph (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(iii), or (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section (as appropriate) will not apply.


(4) *Failure to comply*—(i) *General rule.* For purposes of this section and except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(D) or (f) of this section, a failure to comply includes—


(A) A failure to report gain, or pay any additional tax or interest due, in accordance with the requirements under this section; and


(B) A failure to file a subsequent liquidation document, as determined by applying paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, but replacing the term “initial liquidation document” with the term “subsequent liquidation document.”


(ii) *Consequences of a failure to comply.* If there is a failure to comply in any material respect with the terms of paragraph (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(iii), or (c)(2)(i) of this section, as applicable, then—


(A) Any gain (but not loss) that was not previously recognized by the domestic liquidating corporation or foreign liquidating corporation, as applicable, under paragraph (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(iii), or (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section must be recognized; and


(B) The period of limitations on assessment of tax for the taxable year in which gain is required to be reported will be extended until the close of the third full taxable year ending after the date on which the domestic liquidating corporation, foreign distributee corporation, or foreign liquidating corporation, as applicable, furnishes to the Director of Field Operations, Cross Border Activities Practice Area of Large Business & International (or any successor to the roles and responsibilities of such position, as appropriate) (Director) the information that should have been provided under this section.


(f) *Relief for certain failures to file or failures to comply that are not willful*—(1) *In general.* This paragraph (f) provides relief if there is a failure to file an initial liquidation document as described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section (failure to file), or a failure to comply in any material respect with the terms of this section as described in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section (failure to comply). A failure to file or a failure to comply will be deemed not to have occurred for purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(ii) or (e)(4)(ii) of this section if the taxpayer demonstrates that the failure was not willful using the procedure set forth in this paragraph (f). For this purpose, willful is to be interpreted consistent with the meaning of that term in the context of other civil penalties, which would include a failure due to gross negligence, reckless disregard, or willful neglect. Whether a failure to file or failure to comply was willful will be determined by the Director (as described in paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(B) of this section) based on all the facts and circumstances. The taxpayer must submit a request for relief and an explanation as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. Although a taxpayer whose failure to file or failure to comply is determined not to be willful will not be subject to gain or loss recognition under this section, the taxpayer will be subject to a penalty under section 6038B if the taxpayer fails to satisfy the reporting requirements, if any, under that section and does not demonstrate that the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. See § 1.6038B-1(e)(4) and (f). The determination of whether the failure to file or failure to comply was willful under this section has no effect on any request for relief made under § 1.6038B-1(f).


(2) *Procedures for establishing that a failure to file or failure to comply was not willful*—(i) *Time and manner of submission.* A taxpayer's statement that a failure to file or failure to comply was not willful will be considered only if, promptly after the taxpayer becomes aware of the failure, an amended return is filed for the taxable year to which the failure relates that includes the information that should have been included with the original return for such taxable year or that otherwise complies with the rules of this section, and that includes a written statement explaining the reasons for the failure. In the case of a liquidating distribution described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the taxpayer must file, with the amended return, a Form 8838 extending the period of limitations on assessment of tax with respect to the gain realized but not recognized with respect to the liquidating distribution to the close of the third full taxable year ending after the date on which the required information is provided to the Director. In the case of a liquidating distribution described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the taxpayer must file, with the amended return, a Form 8838 extending the period of limitations on the assessment of tax with respect to the gain realized but not recognized with respect to the liquidating distribution to the later of: the date provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C)(*5*), taking into account paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) and (D), as applicable (date one); or, the close of the third full taxable year ending after the date on which the required information is provided to the Director (date two). However, the taxpayer is not required to file a Form 8838 with the amended return if both date one is later than date two and a Form 8838 was previously filed extending the period of limitations on assessment of tax with respect to the gain realized but not recognized with respect to the liquidating distribution to date one. If a Form 8838 is not required to be filed pursuant to the previous sentence, a copy of the previously filed Form 8838 must be filed with the amended return. The amended return and either a Form 8838 or a copy of the previously filed Form 8838, as the case may be, must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service at the location where the taxpayer filed its original return. The taxpayer may submit a request for relief from the penalty under section 6038B as part of the same submission. See § 1.6038B-1(f).


(ii) *Notice requirement.* In addition to the requirements of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, the taxpayer must comply with the notice requirements of this paragraph (f)(2)(ii). If any taxable year of the taxpayer is under examination when the amended return is filed, a copy of the amended return and any information required to be included with such return must be delivered to the Internal Revenue Service personnel conducting the examination. If no taxable year of the taxpayer is under examination when the amended return is filed, a copy of the amended return and any information required to be included with such return must be delivered to the Director.


(3) For illustrations of the application of the willfulness standard of this paragraph (f), see the examples in § 1.367(a)-8(p)(3).


(g) *Effective/applicability dates.* Except as otherwise provided, this section applies to distributions occurring on or after September 7, 1999 or, if the taxpayer so elects, to distributions in taxable years ending after August 8, 1999. The ninth, tenth, and eleventh sentences of paragraph (a) of this section, and paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (b)(2)(i)(A)(*2*), (b)(2)(i)(A)(*3*), (b)(2)(i)(E)(*3*), (b)(2)(i)(E)(*4*)(*ii*), (b)(2)(i)(E)(*5*)(*ii*), (b)(2)(iii)(A), (c)(2)(i)(B)(*3*), (e), and (f) of this section will apply to liquidation documents that are required to be filed on or after November 19, 2014, as well as to requests for relief submitted on or after November 19, 2014.
