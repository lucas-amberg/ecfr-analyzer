# ยง 1.1055-3   Basis of real property held subject to liabilities under a redeemable ground rent.

(a) *In general.* The provisions of section 1055(a) and paragraph (a) of ยง 1.1055-1 are applicable in determining the basis of real property held on or after April 11, 1963, in any case where the property at the time of acquisition was subject to liabilities under a redeemable ground rent. (See section 1055(b)(2).) Thus, if on or after April 11, 1963, a taxpayer holds real property which was subject to liabilities under a redeemable ground rent at the time he acquired it, the basis of such property in the hands of such taxpayer, regardless of when the property was acquired, will include the redeemable ground rent in the same manner as if it were a mortgage in an amount equal to the redemption price of such ground rent. Likewise, if on or after April 11, 1963, a taxpayer holds real property which was subject to liabilities under a redeemable ground rent at the time he acquired it and which has a substituted basis in his hands, the basis of the property in the hands of the taxpayer's predecessor in interest is to be determined by treating the redeemable ground rent in the same manner as a mortgage in an amount equal to the redemption price of such ground rent.


(b) *Illustrations.* The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:
