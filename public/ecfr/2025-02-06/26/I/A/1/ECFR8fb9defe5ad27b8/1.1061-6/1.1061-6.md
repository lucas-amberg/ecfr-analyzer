(2) *Failure to obtain information.* Paragraph (b)(1) of this section requires certain Passthrough Entities to furnish an Owner Taxpayer with certain amounts necessary to determine its Recharacterization Amount and meet its reporting requirements under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. To the extent that an Owner Taxpayer is not furnished the information required to be furnished under paragraph (b)(1) of this section in such time and in such manner as required by the Commissioner and the Owner Taxpayer is not otherwise able to substantiate all or a part of these amounts to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, then if the information with respect to the determination of the—

(ii) *Requirement to furnish and file information.* If information is requested of a Passthrough Entity under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the Passthrough Entity must furnish the requested information to the person making the request but only to the extent the information is necessary for the requesting Passthrough Entity to meet its reporting and filing requirements under this section or is required by the Commissioner in forms, instructions, or other guidance. If the person requesting the information is an API Holder in the Passthrough Entity, the information is furnished under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

To the extent that the upper-tier Passthrough Entity is not able to otherwise substantiate and determine the missing information to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, the upper-tier Passthrough Entity must treat these amounts as provided under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The upper-tier Passthrough Entity must provide notice to the API Holder and the IRS regarding the application of this paragraph (b)(2) to the information being reported as required in forms, instructions, and other guidance.
