(ii) The taxpayer has been a life insurance company at all times on and after December 31, 1958, including the date of the sale or other disposition of the property; and


(iii) The fair market value of the property on December 31, 1958, exceeds the adjusted basis for determining gain as of such date.

(4) The difference between the fair market value and adjusted basis referred to in section 817(b)(1) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the excess of (i) the gain that would have been recognized but for section 817(b) on all prior sales or other dispositions after December 31, 1958, of properties referred to in section 817(b)(2)(C) over (ii) the gain that was recognized on such sales or other dispositions; and


(5) The basis of such acquired property shall be determined as if the gain which would have been recognized but for section 817(b) were recognized gain.
