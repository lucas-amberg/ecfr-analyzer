# § 1.819-2   Foreign life insurance companies.

(a) *Carrying on United States insurance business.* Section 819(a) provides that a foreign life insurance company carrying on a life insurance business within the United States, if with respect to its United States business it would qualify as a life insurance company under section 801, shall be taxable on its United States business under section 802 in the same manner as a domestic life insurance company. Thus, the life insurance company taxable income of such a foreign life insurance company shall not be determined in the manner provided by part I, subchapter N, chapter 1 of the Code (relating to determination of sources of income), but shall be determined in the manner provided by part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code (relating to life insurance companies). See section 842. Accordingly, in determining its life insurance company taxable income from its United States business, such a foreign life insurance company shall take into account the appropriate items of income irrespective of whether such items of income are from sources within or without the United States. A foreign life insurance company shall take into account the appropriate items of expenses, losses, and other deductions properly allocable to such items of income from its United States business. To the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this paragraph, section 818(a), and section 819(b), all computations entering into the determination of taxes imposed by part I shall be made in a manner consistent with the manner required for purposes of the annual statement approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.


(b) *Adjustment where surplus held in the United States is less than specified minimum*—(1) *In general.* Section 819(b)(1) provides that if the minimum figure for the taxable year determined under section 819(b)(2) and subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph exceeds the surplus held in the United States as of the end of the taxable year (as defined in section 819(b)(2)(B) and subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph) by a foreign life insurance company carrying on a life insurance business within the United States and taxable under section 802, then:


(i) The amount of the policy and other contract liability requirements (determined under section 805 and § 1.805-4 without regard to this subparagraph), and


(ii) The amount of the required interest (determined under section 809(a)(2) and paragraph (d) of § 1.809-2 without regard to this subparagraph),


(2) *Definitions.* For purposes of section 819(b)(1) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph:


(i) The term *minimum figure,* in the case of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, but before January 1, 1959, means the amount obtained by multiplying the company's total insurance liabilities on United States business by 9 percent. In the case of any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1958, such term means the amount obtained by multiplying the company's total insurance liabilities on United States business by the percentage determined and proclaimed by the Secretary as being applicable for such year.


(ii) The term *surplus held in the United States* means the excess of the assets held in the United States (as of the end of the taxable year) over the total insurance liabilities on United States business (as of the end of the taxable year).


(iii) The term *total insurance liabilities* means the sum of the total reserves (as defined in section 801(c) and paragraph (a) of § 1.801-5) as of the end of the taxable year plus (to the extent not included in total reserves) the items referred to in section 810(c) (3), (4), and (5) of paragraph (b) (3), (4), and (5) of § 1.810-2 as of the end of the taxable year; and


(iv) The term *assets* shall have the same meaning as that contained in section 805(b)(4) and paragraph (a)(4) of § 1.805-5.


(3) *Illustration of principles.* The provisions of section 819(b) and this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:


(4) *Segregated asset accounts.* For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1967, pursuant to the provisions of section 801(g):


(i) A foreign corporation carrying on a life insurance business which issues contracts based on segregated asset accounts shall separately compute in a manner consistent with this subparagraph the adjustment (if any) under section 819 to the amount of policy and other contract liability requirements and the amount of required interest properly attributable to each of such segregated asset accounts. The “minimum figure” used in section 819 in making the adjustment with respect to each of the segregated asset accounts shall be computed as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph in lieu of the manner provided in subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this paragraph.


(ii) The minimum figure applicable to a segregated asset account referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is the amount determined by multiplying the total insurance liabilities on U.S. business attributable to such a segregated asset account, by 1 percent.


(iii) The minimum figure as computed under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph shall be compared only with the surplus held in the United States attributable to each segregated asset account referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. Such surplus is the excess of assets held in the United States properly attributable to such segregated asset account over the total insurance liabilities on U.S. business properly attributable to such account.


(iv) If the minimum figure applicable to accounts other than segregated asset accounts exceeds the surplus held in the United States attributable to such other accounts, for purposes of section 819 and this paragraph, the amount of such excess shall not exceed the company's overall excess, as defined in this subdivision. No adjustment under section 819 or this paragraph shall be made with respect to any account if there is no such overall excess. For purposes of this subdivision and of subdivision (v) of this subparagraph, the term “overall excess” means the amount, if any, by which the aggregate minimum figures applicable to segregated asset accounts plus the minimum figure applicable to accounts other than segregated asset accounts exceeds the surplus held in the United States with respect to the company's entire U.S. life insurance business, including segregated asset accounts as well as other accounts.


(v) In the case of a company which issues contracts based on one or more than one segregated asset account, if the minimum figure applicable to a segregated asset account exceeds the surplus held in the United States attributable to such account, then for purposes of section 819 and this paragraph, the amount of such excess shall not exceed the account limitation figure, as defined in this subdivision. Therefore, no adjustment under section 819 or under this subparagraph shall be made with respect to any segregated asset account if the aggregate of the account limitation figures is zero, but nothing in this subdivision shall preclude an adjustment under section 819 with respect to accounts other than segregated asset accounts. For purposes of this subdivision, the term “account limitation figure” is a segregated assets account's proportionate share of the aggregate of the account limitation figures. Such aggregate of the account limitation figures is equal to the lesser of either the company's overall excess as defined in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph, or the amount, if any, by which the aggregate of the minimum figures applicable to segregated asset accounts exceeds the surplus held in the United States with respect to all such segregated asset accounts. For purposes of this subdivision, a segregated asset account's proportionate share of the aggregate of the account limitation figures is determined by multiplying the amount of such aggregate of account limitation figures by a percentage, the numerator of which is the amount by which the minimum figure applicable to such account exceeds the surplus held in the United States attributable to such account, and the denominator of which is the aggregate of the amounts by which the minimum figure applicable to each segregated asset account exceeds the surplus held in the United States attributable to such account.


(vi) Subdivisions (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(c) *Distributions to shareholders*—(1) *In general.* In the case of a foreign life insurance company carrying on a life insurance business within the United States and taxable under section 802, section 819(c)(1) provides alternative methods for determining the amount of distributions to shareholders for purposes of section 815 (relating to distributions to shareholders) and section 802(b)(3) (relating to life insurance company taxable income). Such a foreign life insurance company may elect (in the manner provided by subparagraph (4) of this paragraph) for each taxable year whichever of the alternative methods provided by section 819(c)(1) and this subparagraph it desires, and the method elected for any one taxable year shall be effective only with respect to the taxable year for which the election is made. Such alternative methods are:


(i) The amount of the distributions to shareholders shall be the amount determined by multiplying the total amount of distributions to shareholders by the percentage which the minimum figure for the taxable year is of the excess of the assets of the company over the total insurance liabilities; or


(ii) The amount of the distributions for shareholders shall be the amount determined by multiplying the total amount of distributions for shareholders by the percentage which the total insurance liabilities on United States business for the taxable year is of the total insurance liabilities of the company.


(2) *Definitions.* For purposes of section 819(c)(1) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph:


(i) The term *total amount of the distributions to shareholders* means all distributions (within the meaning of section 815 and § 1.815-2) by a foreign life insurance company to all of its shareholders whether or not in the United States;


(ii) The term *minimum figure for the taxable year* means the amount determined under section 819(b)(2)(A) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section;


(iii) The term *assets of the company* means all of the assets (as defined in section 805(b) (4) and paragraph (a) (4) of § 1.805-5) of the foreign life insurance company whether or not in the United States (as of the end of the taxable year); and


(iv) The term *total insurance liabilities of the company* means the total insurance liabilities (as defined in section 819(b)(2) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section) on all of its business whether or not in the United States (as of the end of the taxable year).


(3) *Illustration of principles.* The provisions of section 819(c)(1) and subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(4) *Manner and effect of election.* (i) The election provided by section 819(c)(1) shall be made in a statement attached to the foreign life insurance company's income tax return for any taxable year for which the company desires the election to apply. The return and statement must be filed not later than the date prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the return for such taxable year. The statement shall indicate the method elected, the name and address of the taxpayer, and shall be signed by the taxpayer (or his duly authorized representative).


(ii) An election made under section 819(c)(1) and this paragraph shall be effective only with respect to the taxable year for which the election is made. Thus, the company must make a new election for each taxable year for which it desires the election to apply. Once such election has been made for any taxable year it may not be revoked. However, for taxable years beginning prior to April 4, 1961, a company may revoke the election provided by section 819(c)(1) without obtaining consent from the Commissioner by filing, before July 4, 1961, a statement that the company desires to revoke such election. An amended return reflecting such revocation and the selection of the other percentage must accompany the statement for all taxable years for which returns have been filed with respect to such election.


(5) *Application of section 815.* Once the amount of distributions to shareholders is determined under the provisions of section 819(c)(1) and this paragraph, the rules of section 815 (relating to distributions to shareholders) shall apply to the shareholders surplus account and the policyholders surplus account of a foreign stock life insurance company in the same manner as they would apply to a domestic stock life insurance company.


(d) *Distributions pursuant to certain mutualizations.* Section 819(c)(2) provides that for purposes of applying section 815(e) and paragraph (e) of § 1.815-6 (relating to a special rule for certain mutualizations) in the case of a foreign life insurance company subject to tax under section 802:


(1) The paid-in capital and paid-in surplus referred to in section 815(e)(1)(A) of a foreign life insurance company is the portion of such capital and surplus determined by multiplying such amounts by the percentage selected for the taxable year under section 819(c)(1) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and


(2) The excess referred to in section 815(e)(2)(A)(i) (without the adjustment provided by section 815(e)(2)(B)), is whichever of the following is the greater:


(i) The minimum figure for 1958 determined under section 819(b)(2)(A); or


(ii) The surplus held in the United States (as defined in section 819(b)(2)(B)) determined as of December 31, 1958.


(e) *No United States insurance business.* Foreign life insurance companies not carrying on an insurance business within the United States shall not be taxable under part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, but shall be taxable as other foreign corporations. See section 881 and the regulations thereunder.
