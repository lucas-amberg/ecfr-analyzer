# § 1.6417-5   Additional information and registration.

(a) *Pre-filing registration and election.* An applicable entity or electing taxpayer is required to satisfy the pre-filing registration requirements in paragraph (b) of this section as a condition of, and prior to, making an elective payment election. An applicable entity or electing taxpayer must use the pre-filing registration process to register itself as intending to make the elective payment election, to list all applicable credits it intends to claim, and to list each applicable credit property that contributed to the determination of such credits as part of the pre-filing submission (or amended submission). An applicable entity or electing taxpayer that does not obtain a registration number under paragraph (c)(1) of this section or report the registration number on its annual tax return, as defined in § 1.6417-1(b), pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section with respect to an otherwise applicable credit property, is ineligible to receive any elective payment amount with respect to the amount of any credit determined with respect to that applicable credit property. However, completion of the pre-filing registration requirements and receipt of a registration number does not, by itself, mean the applicable entity or electing taxpayer is eligible to receive a payment with respect to the applicable credits determined with respect to the applicable credit property.


(b) *Pre-filing registration requirements*—(1) *Manner of pre-filing registration.* Unless otherwise provided in guidance, an applicable entity or electing taxpayer must complete the pre-filing registration process electronically through the IRS electronic portal and in accordance with the instructions provided therein.


(2) *Pre-filing registration and election for members of a consolidated group.* A member of a consolidated group is required to complete pre-filing registration as a condition of, and prior to, making an elective payment election. *See* § 1.1502-77 (providing rules regarding the status of the common parent as agent for its members).


(3) *Timing of pre-filing registration.* An applicable entity or electing taxpayer must satisfy the pre-filing registration requirements of this paragraph (b) and receive a registration number under paragraph (c) of this section prior to making an elective payment election under § 1.6417-2(b) on the applicable entity's or electing taxpayer's annual tax return for the taxable year at issue.


(4) *Each applicable credit property must have its own registration number.* An applicable entity or electing taxpayer must obtain a registration number for each applicable credit property with respect to which it intends to make an elective payment election.


(5) *Information required to complete the pre-filing registration process.* Unless modified in future guidance, an applicable entity or electing taxpayer must provide the following information to the IRS to complete the pre-filing registration process:


(i) The applicable entity's or electing taxpayer's general information, including its name, address, taxpayer identification number, and type of legal entity.


(ii) Any additional information required by the IRS electronic portal, such as information regarding the taxpayer's exempt status under section 501(a) of the Code; that the applicable entity is a political subdivision of a State, the District of Columbia, or a U.S. territory, or subdivision of an Indian tribal government; or that the applicable entity is an agency or instrumentality of a State, the District of Columbia, an Indian tribal government, or a U.S. territory.


(iii) The taxpayer's taxable year.


(iv) The type of annual tax return(s) normally filed by the applicable entity or electing taxpayer, or that the applicable entity or electing taxpayer does not normally file an annual tax return with the IRS.


(v) The type of applicable credit(s) for which the applicable entity or electing taxpayer intends to make an elective payment election.


(vi) For each applicable credit, each applicable credit property that the applicable entity or electing taxpayer intends to use to determine the credit for which the applicable entity or electing taxpayer intends to make an elective payment election.


(vii) For each applicable credit property listed in paragraph (b)(4)(vi) of this section, any further information required by the IRS electronic portal, such as—


(A) The type of applicable credit property;


(B) Physical location (that is, address and coordinates (longitude and latitude) of the applicable credit property);


(C) Supporting documentation relating to the construction or acquisition of the applicable credit property (such as State, District of Columbia, Indian tribal, U.S. territorial, or local government permits to operate the applicable credit property; certifications; evidence of ownership that ties to a land deed, lease, or other documented right to use and access any land or facility upon which the applicable credit property is constructed or housed; U.S. Coast Guard registration numbers for offshore wind vessels; and the vehicle identification number of an eligible clean vehicle with respect to which a section 45W credit is determined);


(D) The beginning of construction date and the placed in service date of the applicable credit property,


(E) If an investment-related credit property (as defined § 1.6417-2(c)(3)), the source of funds the taxpayer used to acquire the property; and


(F) Any other information that the applicable entity or electing taxpayer believes will help the IRS evaluate the registration request.


(viii) The name of a contact person for the applicable entity or electing taxpayer. The contact person is the person whom the IRS may contact if there is an issue with the registration. The contact person must either possess legal authority to bind the applicable entity or electing taxpayer or must provide a properly executed power of attorney on Form 2848, *Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative.*

(ix) A penalties of perjury statement, effective for all information submitted as a complete application, and signed by a person with personal knowledge of the relevant facts that is authorized to bind the registrant.


(x) Any other information the IRS deems necessary for purposes of preventing duplication, fraud, improper payments, or excessive payments under this section that is provided in guidance.


(c) *Registration number*—(1) *In general.* The IRS will review the information provided and will issue a separate registration number for each applicable credit property for which the applicable entity or electing taxpayer provided sufficient verifiable information.


(2) *Registration number is only valid for one taxable year.* A registration number is valid only with respect to the applicable entity or electing taxpayer that obtained the registration number under this section and only for the taxable year for which it is obtained.


(3) *Renewing registration numbers.* If an elective payment election will be made with respect to an applicable credit property for a taxable year after a registration number under this section has been obtained, the applicable entity or electing taxpayer must renew the registration for that subsequent taxable year in accordance with applicable guidance, including attesting that all the facts previously provided are still correct or updating any facts.


(4) *Amendment of previously submitted registration information if a change occurs before the registration number is used.* As provided in instructions to the pre-filing registration portal, if specified changes occur with respect to one or more applicable credit properties for which a registration number has been previously obtained but not yet used, an applicable entity or electing taxpayer must amend the registration (or may need to submit a new registration) to reflect these new facts. For example, if the owner of a facility previously registered for an elective payment election for applicable credits determined with respect to that facility and the facility undergoes a change of ownership (incident to a corporate reorganization or an asset sale) such that the new owner has a different employer identification number (EIN) than the owner who obtained the original registration, the original owner of the facility must amend the original registration to disassociate its EIN from the applicable credit property and the new owner must submit separately an original registration (or if the new owner previously registered other credit properties, must amend its original registration) to associate the new owner's EIN with the previously registered applicable credit property. If the change of ownership is with respect to an electing taxpayer, then the 5-year election period will continue despite the change in ownership.


(5) *Registration number is required to be reported on the return for the taxable year of the elective payment election.* The applicable entity or electing taxpayer must include the registration number of the applicable credit property on its annual tax return as provided in § 1.6417-2(b) for the taxable year. The IRS will treat an elective payment election as ineffective with respect to an applicable credit determined with respect to an applicable credit property for which the applicable entity or electing taxpayer does not include a valid registration number that was assigned to that particular taxpayer during the pre-registration process on the annual tax return.


(d) *Applicability date.* This section applies to taxable years ending on or after March 11, 2024.
