# § 1.1092(b)-3T   Mixed straddles; straddle-by-straddle identification under section 1092(b)(2)(A)(i)(I) (Temporary).

(a) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided, a taxpayer shall treat in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section gains and losses on positions that are part of a mixed straddle for which the taxpayer has made an election under paragraph (d) of this section (hereinafter referred to as a *section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle*). No election may be made under this section for any straddle composed of one or more positions that are includible in a mixed straddle account (as defined in paragraph (b) of § 1.1092(b)-4T) or for any straddle for which an election under section 1256(d) has been made. See § 1.1092(b)-5T relating to definitions.


(b) *Treatment of gains and losses from positions included in a section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle*—(1) *In general.* Gains and losses from positions that are part of a section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle shall be determined and treated in accordance with the rules of paragraph (b) (2) through (7) of this section.


(2) *All positions of a section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle are disposed of on the same day.* If all positions of a section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle are disposed of (or deemed disposed of) on the same say, gains and losses from section 1256 contracts in the straddle shall be netted, and gains and losses from non-section 1256 positions in the straddle shall be netted. Net gain or loss from the section 1256 contracts shall then be offset against net gain or loss from the non-section 1256 positions to determine the net gain or loss from the straddle. If net gain or loss from the straddle is attributable to the positions of the straddle that are section 1256 contracts, such gain or loss shall be treated as 60 percent long-term capital gain or loss and 40 percent short-term capital gain or loss. If net gain or loss from the straddle is attributable to the positions of the straddle that are non-section 1256 positions, such gain or loss shall be treated as short-term capital gain or loss. This paragraph (b)(2) may be illustrated by the following examples. It is assumed in each example that the positions are the only positions held directly or indirectly (through a related person or flowthrough entity) by an individual calendar year taxpayer during the taxable year.


(3) *All of the non-section 1256 positions of a section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle disposed of on the same day.* This paragraph (b)(3) applies if all of the non-section 1256 positions of a section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle are disposed of on the same day or if this paragraph (b)(3) is made applicable by paragraph (b)(5) of this section. In the case to which this paragraph (b)(3) applies, gain and loss realized from non-section 1256 positions shall be netted. Realized and unrealized gain and loss with respect to the section 1256 contracts of the straddle also shall be netted on that day. Realized net gain or loss from the non-section 1256 positions shall then be offset against net gain or loss from the section 1256 contracts to determine the net gain or loss from the straddle on that day. Net gain or loss from the straddle that is attributable to the non-section 1256 positions shall be realized and treated as short-term capital gain or loss on that day. Net gain or loss from the straddle that is attributable to realized gain or loss with respect to section 1256 contracts shall be realized and treated as 60 percent long-term capital gain or loss and 40 percent short-term capital gain or loss. Any gain or loss subsequently realized on the section 1256 contracts shall be adjusted (through an adjustment to basis or otherwise) to take into account the extent to which gain or loss was offset by unrealized gain or loss on the section 1256 contracts on that day. This paragraph (b)(3) may be illustrated by the following examples. It is assumed in each example that the positions are the only positions held directly or indirectly (through a related person or flowthrough entity) by an individual calendar year taxpayer during the taxable year.


(4) *All of the section 1256 contracts of a section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle disposed of on the same day.* This paragraph (b)(4) applies if all of the section 1256 contracts of a section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle are disposed of (or deemed disposed of) on the same day or if this paragraph (b)(4) is made applicable by paragraph (b)(5) of this section. In the case to which this paragraph (b)(4) applies, gain and loss realized from section 1256 contracts shall be netted. Realized and unrealized gain and loss with respect to the non-section 1256 positions of the straddle also shall be netted on that day. Realized net gain or loss from the section 1256 contracts shall be treated as short-term capital gain or loss to the extent of net gain or loss on the non-section 1256 positions on that day. Net gain or loss with respect to the section 1256 contracts that exceeds the net gain or loss with respect to the non-section 1256 positions of the straddle shall be treated as 60 percent long-term capital gain or loss and 40 percent short-term capital gain or loss. See paragraph (b)(7) of this section relating to the gain or loss on such non-section 1256 positions. This paragraph (b)(4) may be illustrated by the following examples. It is assumed in each example that the positions are the only positions held directly or indirectly (through a related person or flowthrough entity) by an individual calendar year taxpayer during the taxable year.


(5) *Disposition of one or more, but not all, positions of a section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle on the same day.* If one or more, but not all, of the positions of a section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle are disposed of on the same day, and paragraphs (b) (3) and (4) of this section are not applicable (without regard to this paragraph (b)(5)), the gain and loss from the non-section 1256 positions that are disposed of on that day shall be netted, and the gain and loss from the section 1256 contracts that are disposed of on that day shall be netted. In order to determine whether the rules of paragraph (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section apply, net gain or loss from the section 1256 contracts disposed of shall then be offset against net gain or loss from the non-section 1256 positions disposed of to determine net gain or loss from such positions of the straddle. If net gain or loss from the disposition of such positions of the straddle is attributable to the non-section 1256 positions disposed of, the rules prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section apply. If net gain or loss from the disposition of such positions is attributable to the section 1256 contracts disposed of, the rules prescribed in paragraph (b)(4) of this section apply. If the net gain or loss from the netting of non-section 1256 positions disposed of and the netting of section 1256 contracts disposed of are either both gains or losses, the rules prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall apply to net gain or loss from such non-section 1256 positions, and the rules prescribed in paragraph (b)(4) of this section shall apply to net gain or loss from such section 1256 contracts. However, for purposes of determining the treatment of gain or loss subsequently realized on a position of such straddle, to the extent that unrealized gain or loss on other positions was used to offset realized gain or loss on a non-section 1256 position under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, or was used to treat realized gain or loss on a section 1256 contract as short-term capital gain or loss under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, such amount shall not be used for such purposes again. This paragraph (b)(5) may be illustrated by the following examples. It is assumed that the positions are the only positions held directly or indirectly (through a related person or flowthrough entity) by an individual calendar year taxpayer during the taxable year.


(6) *Accrued gain and loss with respect to positions of a section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle established on or before August 18, 2014.* The rules of this paragraph (b)(6) apply to all section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddles established on or before *August 18, 2014*; see § 1.1092(b)-6 for section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddles established after August 18, 2014. If one or more positions of a section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle were held by the taxpayer on the day prior to the day the section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle is established, such position or positions shall be deemed sold for their fair market value as of the close of the last business day preceding the day such straddle is established. See §§ 1.1092(b)-1T and 1.1092(b)-2T for application of the loss deferral and wash sale rules and for treatment of holding periods and losses with respect to such positions. An adjustment (through an adjustment to basis or otherwise) shall be made to any subsequent gain or loss realized with respect to such to such position or positions for any gain or loss recognized under this paragraph (b)(6). This paragraph (b)(6) may be illustrated by the following examples. It is assumed in each example that the positions are the only positions held directly or indirectly (through a related person or flowthrough entity) by an individual calendar year taxpayer during the taxable year.


(7) *Treatment of gain and loss from non-section 1256 positions after disposition of all section 1256 contracts.* Gain or loss on a non-section 1256 position that is part of a section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle and that is held after all section 1256 contracts in the straddle are disposed of shall be treated as short-term capital gain or loss to the extent attributable to the period when the positions were part of such straddle. See § 1.1092(b)-2T for rules concerning the holding period of such positions. This paragraph (b)(7) may be illustrated by the following example. It is assumed that the positions are the only positions held directly or indirectly (through a related person or flowthrough entity) during the taxable years.


(c) *Coordination with loss deferral and wash sale rules of § 1.1092(b)-1T.* This section shall apply prior to the application of the loss deferral and wash sale rules of § 1.1092(b)-1T.


(d) *Identification required*—(1) *In general.* To elect the provisions of this section, a taxpayer must clearly identify on a reasonable and consistently applied economic basis each position that is part of the section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle before the close of the day on which the section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle is established. If the taxpayer disposes of a position that is part of a section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle before the close of the day on which the straddle is established, such identification must be made at or before the time that the taxpayer disposes of the position. In the case of a taxpayer who is an individual, the close of the day is midnight (local time) in the location of the taxpayer's principal residence. In the case of all other taxpayers, the close of the day is midnight (local time) in the location of the taxpayer's principal place of business. Only the person or entity that directly holds all positions of a straddle may make the election under this section.


(2) *Presumptions.* A taxpayer is presumed to have identified a section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle by the time prescribed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section if the taxpayer receives independent verification of the identification (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(4) of this section). The presumption referred to in this paragraph (d)(2) may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.


(3) *Corroborating evidence.* If the presumption of paragraph (d)(2) of this section does not apply, the burden shall be on the taxpayer to establish that an election under paragraph (d)(1) of this section was made by the time specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. If the taxpayer has no evidence of the time when the identification required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section is made, other than the taxpayer's own testimony, the election is invalid unless the taxpayer shows good cause for failure to have evidence other than the taxpayer's own testimony.


(4) *Independent verification.* For purposes of this section, the following constitute independent verification:


(i) *Separate account.* Placement of one or more positions of a section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle in a separate account designated as a *section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle account* that is maintained by a broker (as defined in § 1.6045-1(a)(1)), futures commission merchant (as defined in 7 U.S.C. 2 and 17 CFR 1.3(p)), or similar person and in which notations are made by such person identifying all positions of the section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle and stating the date the straddle is established.


(ii) *Confirmation.* A written confirmation from a person referred to in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, or from the party from which one or more positions of the section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle are acquired, stating the date the straddle is established and identifying the other positions of the straddle.


(iii) *Other methods.* Such other methods of independent verification as the Commissioner may approve at the Commissioner's discretion.


(5) *Section 1092 (b)(2) identified mixed straddles established before February 25, 1985.* Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, relating to the time of identification of a section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddle, a taxpayer may identify straddles that were established before February 25, 1985 as section 1092(b)(2) identified mixed straddles after the time specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section if the taxpayer adopts a reasonable and consistent economic basis for identifying the positions of such straddles.


(e) *Effective date*—(1) *In general.* The provisions of this section shall apply to straddles established on or after January 1, 1984.


(2) *Pre-1984 accrued gain.* If the last business day referred to in paragraph (b)(6) of this section is contained in a period to which paragraph (b)(6) does not apply, the gains and losses from the deemed sale shall be included in the first period to which paragraph (b)(6) applies.
