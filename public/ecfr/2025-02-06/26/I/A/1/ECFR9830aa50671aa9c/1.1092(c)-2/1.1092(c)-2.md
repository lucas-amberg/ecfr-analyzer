# § 1.1092(c)-2   Equity options with flexible terms.

(a) *In general.* Section 1092(c)(4) provides an exception to the general rule that a straddle exists if a taxpayer holds stock and writes a call option on that stock. Under section 1092(c)(4), the ownership of stock and the issuance of a call option meeting certain requirements result in a qualified covered call, which is exempted from the general straddle rules of section 1092. This section addresses the consequences of the availability of equity options with flexible terms under the qualified covered call rules. 


(b) *No effect on lowest qualified bench mark for standardized options.* The availability of strike prices for equity options with flexible terms does not affect the determination of the lowest qualified bench mark, as defined in section 1092(c)(4)(D), for an equity option with standardized terms. 


(c) *Qualified covered call option status*—(1) *Requirements.* An equity option with flexible terms is a qualified covered call option only if— 


(i) The option meets the requirements of section 1092(c)(4)(B) and § 1.1092(c)-1 (taking into account paragraph (c)(2) of this section); 


(ii) The only payments permitted with respect to the option are a single fixed premium paid not later than 5 business days after the day on which the option is granted, and a single fixed strike price, as defined in § 1.1092(c)-4(d), that is payable entirely at (or within 5 business days of) exercise; 


(iii) An equity option with standardized terms is outstanding for the underlying equity; and 


(iv) The underlying security is stock in a single corporation. 


(2) *Lowest qualified bench mark*—(i) *In general.* For purposes of determining whether an equity option with flexible terms is deep in the money within the meaning of section 1092(c)(4)(C), the lowest qualified bench mark under section 1092(c)(4)(D) is the same for an equity option with flexible terms as the lowest qualified bench mark for an equity option with standardized terms on the same stock having the same applicable stock price. 


(ii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the rules set out in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section:


(d) *Effective date*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, this section applies to equity options with flexible terms entered into on or after January 25, 2000.


(2) *Effective date for paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.* Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section apply to equity options with flexible terms entered into on or after July 29, 2002.
