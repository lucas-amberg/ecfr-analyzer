# § 1.752-5   Applicability dates and transition rules.

(a) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in §§ 1.752-1 through 1.752-4, unless a partnership makes an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to apply the provisions of §§ 1.752-1 through 1.752-4 earlier, §§ 1.752-1 through 1.752-4 apply to any liability incurred or assumed by a partnership on or after December 28, 1991, other than a liability incurred or assumed by the partnership pursuant to a written binding contract in effect prior to December 28, 1991 and at all times thereafter. However, § 1.752-4(b)(1)(iv) and (v), (b)(2) and (3), (b)(5)(i) through (iv), (e), and (f) apply to any liability incurred or assumed by a partnership on or after December 2, 2024, other than a liability incurred or assumed by a partnership pursuant to a written binding contract in effect prior to that date. To the extent that the proceeds of a partnership liability (refinancing debt) are allocable under the rules of § 1.163-8T to payments discharging all or part of any other liability (pre-modification liability) of that partnership, the refinancing debt will be treated as though it was incurred or assumed by the partnership prior to December 2, 2024, to the extent of the amount and duration of the pre-modification liability. A partnership may apply § 1.752-4(b)(1)(iv) and (v), (b)(2) and (3), (b)(5)(i) through (iv), (e), and (f) to all of its liabilities (including liabilities incurred or assumed by a partnership prior to December 2, 2024), for any return filed on or after December 2, 2024 provided the partnership consistently applies all the rules in § 1.752-2(a)(2) and (3), (f)(9), and (i) and § 1.752-4(b)(1)(iv) and (v), (b)(2) and (3), (b)(5)(i) through (iv), (e), and (f) to those liabilities. In addition, § 1.752-3(a)(3) fifth, sixth, and seventh sentences, (b), and (c) *Example 3,* do not apply to any liability incurred or assumed by a partnership prior to October 31, 2000. Nevertheless, § 1.752-3(a)(3) fifth, sixth, and seventh sentences, (b), and (c) *Example 3,* may be relied upon for any liability incurred or assumed by a partnership prior to October 31, 2000 for taxable years ending on or after October 31, 2000. In addition, § 1.752-1(f) last sentence and (g) *Example 2,* do not apply to any liability incurred or assumed by a partnership prior to January 4, 2001. Nevertheless, § 1.752-1(f) last sentence and (g) *Example 2,* may be relied on for any liability incurred or assumed by a partnership prior to January 4, 2001 and, unless the partnership makes an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, on or after December 28, 1991, other than a liability incurred or assumed by the partnership pursuant to a written binding contract in effect prior to December 28, 1991 and at all times thereafter. For liabilities incurred or assumed by a partnership prior to December 28, 1991 (or pursuant to a written binding contract in effect prior to December 28, 1991 and at all times thereafter), unless an election to apply these regulations has been made, see §§ 1.752-0T to 1.752-4T, set forth in 26 CFR 1.752-0T through 1.752-4T as contained in 26 CFR edition revised April 1, 1991, (TD 8237, TD 8274, and TD 8355) and § 1.752-1, set forth in 26 CFR 1.752-1 as contained in 26 CFR edition revised April 1, 1988 (TD 6175 and TD 6500).


(b) *Election*—(1) *In general.* A partnership may elect to apply the provisions of §§ 1.752-1 through 1.752-4 to all of its liabilities to which the provisions of those sections do not otherwise apply as of the beginning of the first taxable year of the partnership ending on or after December 28, 1991.


(2) *Time and manner of election.* An election under this paragraph (b) is made by attaching a written statement to the partnership return for the first taxable year of the partnership ending on or after December 28, 1991. The written statement must include the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the partnership making the statement and contain a declaration that an election is being made under this paragraph (b).


(c) *Effect of section 708(b)(1)(B) termination on determining date liabilities are incurred or assumed.* For purposes of applying this section, a termination of the partnership under section 708(b)(1)(B) will not cause partnership liabilities incurred or assumed prior to the termination to be treated as incurred or assumed on the date of the termination.
