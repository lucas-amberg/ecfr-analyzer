# § 1.752-6   Partnership assumption of partner's section 358(h)(3) liability after October 18, 1999, and before June 24, 2003.

(a) *In general.* If, in a transaction described in section 721(a), a partnership assumes a liability (defined in section 358(h)(3)) of a partner (other than a liability to which section 752(a) and (b) apply), then, after application of section 752(a) and (b), the partner's basis in the partnership is reduced (but not below the adjusted value of such interest) by the amount (determined as of the date of the exchange) of the liability. For purposes of this section, the adjusted value of a partner's interest in a partnership is the fair market value of that interest increased by the partner's share of partnership liabilities under §§ 1.752-1 through 1.752-5.


(b) *Exceptions*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the exceptions contained in section 358(h)(2)(A) and (B) apply to this section.


(2) *Transactions described in Notice 2000-44.* The exception contained in section 358(h)(2)(B) does not apply to an assumption of a liability (defined in section 358(h)(3)) by a partnership as part of a transaction described in, or a transaction that is substantially similar to the transactions described in, Notice 2000-44 (2000-2 C.B. 255). See § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter.


(c) *Example.* The following example illustrates the principles of paragraph (a) of this section:


(d) *Effective date*—(1) *In general.* This section applies to assumptions of liabilities occurring after October 18, 1999, and before June 24, 2003.


(2) *Election to apply § 1.752-7.* The partnership may elect, under § 1.752-7(k)(2), to apply the provisions referenced in § 1.752-7(k)(2)(ii) to all assumptions of liabilities by the partnership occurring after October 18, 1999, and before June 24, 2003. Section 1.752-7(k)(2) describes the manner in which the election is made.
