# § 1.752-7   Partnership assumption of partner's § 1.752-7 liability on or after June 24, 2003.

(a) *Purpose and structure.* The purpose of this section is to prevent the acceleration or duplication of loss through the assumption of obligations not described in § 1.752-1(a)(4)(i) in transactions involving partnerships. Under paragraph (c) of this section, any such obligation that is assumed by a partnership from a partner in a transaction governed by section 721(a) is treated as section 704(c) property. Paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section provide rules for situations where a partnership assumes such an obligation from a partner and, subsequently, that partner transfers all or part of the partnership interest, that partner receives a distribution in liquidation of the partnership interest, or another partner assumes part or all of that obligation from the partnership. These rules prevent the duplication of loss by prohibiting the partnership and any person other than the partner from whom the obligation was assumed from claiming a deduction, loss, or capital expense to the extent of the built-in loss associated with the obligation. These rules also prevent the acceleration of loss by deferring the partner's deduction or loss attributable to the obligation (if any) until the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(8) of this section). Paragraph (d) of this section provides a number of exceptions to paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section, including a de minimis exception. Paragraph (i) provides a special rule for situations in which an amount paid to satisfy a § 1.752-7 liability is capitalized into other partnership property. Paragraph (j) of this section provides special rules for tiered partnership transactions.


(b) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:


(1) *Assumption.* The principles of § 1.752-1(d) and (e) apply in determining if a § 1.752-7 liability has been assumed.


(2) *Adjusted value.* The adjusted value of a partner's interest in a partnership is the fair market value of that interest increased by the partner's share of partnership liabilities under §§ 1.752-1 through 1.752-5.


(3) *§ 1.752-7 liability*—(i) *In general.* A § 1.752-7 liability is an obligation described in § 1.752-1(a)(4)(ii) to the extent that either—


(A) The obligation is not described in § 1.752-1(a)(4)(i); or


(B) The amount of the obligation (under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section) exceeds the amount taken into account under § 1.752-1(a)(4)(i).


(ii) *Amount and share of § 1.752-7 liability.* The amount of a § 1.752-7 liability (or, for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the amount of an obligation) is the amount of cash that a willing assignor would pay to a willing assignee to assume the § 1.752-7 liability in an arm's-length transaction. If the obligation arose under a contract in exchange for rights granted to the obligor under that contract, and those contractual rights are contributed to the partnership in connection with the partnership's assumption of the contractual obligation, then the amount of the § 1.752-7 liability or obligation is the amount of cash, if any, that a willing assignor would pay to a willing assignee to assume the entire contract. A partner's share of a partnership's § 1.752-7 liability is the amount of deduction that would be allocated to the partner with respect to the § 1.752-7 liability if the partnership disposed of all of its assets, satisfied all of its liabilities (other than § 1.752-7 liabilities), and paid an unrelated person to assume all of its § 1.752-7 liabilities in a fully taxable arm's-length transaction (assuming such payment would give rise to an immediate deduction to the partnership).


(iii) *Example.* In 2005, A, B, and C form partnership PRS. A contributes $10,000,000 in exchange for a 25% interest in PRS and PRS's assumption of a debt obligation. The debt obligation was issued for cash and the issue price was equal to the stated redemption price at maturity ($5,000,000). The debt obligation bears interest, payable quarterly, at a fixed rate of interest, which was a market rate of interest when the debt obligation was issued. At the time of the assumption, all accrued interest has been paid. Prior to the partnership assuming the obligation, interest rates decrease, resulting in the debt obligation bearing an above-market interest rate. Assume that, as a result of the decline in interest rates, A would have had to pay a willing assignee $6,000,000 to assume the debt obligation. The assumption of the debt obligation by PRS from A is treated as an assumption of a § 1.752-1(a)(4)(i) liability in the amount of $5,000,000 (the portion of the total amount of the debt obligation that has created basis in A's assets, that is, the $5,000,000 that was issued in exchange for the debt obligation) and an assumption of a § 1.752-7 liability in the amount of $1,000,000 (the difference between the total obligation, $6,000,000, and the § 1.752-1(a)(4)(i)liability, $5,000,000).


(4) *§ 1.752-7 liability transfer*—(i) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, a § 1.752-7 liability transfer is any assumption of a § 1.752-7 liability by a partnership from a partner in a transaction governed by section 721(a).


(ii) *Terminations under section 708(b)(1)(B).* In determining if a deemed contribution of assets and assumption of liability as a result of a technical termination is treated as a § 1.752-7 liability transfer, only § 1.752-7 liabilities that were assumed by the terminating partnership as part of an earlier § 1.752-7 liability transfer are taken into account and, then, only to the extent of the remaining built-in loss associated with that § 1.752-7 liability.


(5) *§ 1.752-7 liability partner*—(i) *In general.* A § 1.752-7 liability partner is a partner from whom a partnership assumes a § 1.752-7 liability as part of a § 1.752-7 liability transfer or any person who acquires a partnership interest from the § 1.752-7 liability partner in a transaction to which paragraph (e)(3) of this section applies.


(ii) *Tiered partnerships*—(A) *Assumption by a lower-tier partnership.* If, in a § 1.752-7 liability transfer, a partnership (lower-tier partnership) assumes a § 1.752-7 liability from another partnership (upper-tier partnership), then both the upper-tier partnership and the partners of the upper-tier partnership are § 1.752-7 liability partners. Therefore, paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section apply on a sale or liquidation of any partner's interest in the upper-tier partnership and on a sale or liquidation of the upper-tier partnership's interest in the lower-tier partnership. See paragraph (j)(3) of this section. If, in a § 1.752-7 liability transfer, the upper-tier partnership assumes a § 1.752-7 liability from a partner, and, subsequently, in another § 1.752-7 liability transfer, a lower-tier partnership assumes that § 1.752-7 liability from the upper-tier partnership, then the partner from whom the upper-tier partnership assumed the § 1.752-7 liability continues to be the § 1.752-7 liability partner of the lower-tier partnership with respect to the remaining built-in loss associated with that § 1.752-7 liability. Any new built-in loss associated with the § 1.752-7 liability that is created on the assumption of the § 1.752-7 liability from the upper-tier partnership by the lower-tier partnership is shared by all the partners of the upper-tier partnership in accordance with their interests in the upper-tier partnership, and each partner of the upper-tier partnership is treated as a § 1.752-7 liability partner with respect to that new built-in loss. See paragraph (e)(3)(ii), *Example 3* of this section.


(B) *Distribution of partnership interest.* If, in a transaction described in § 1.752-7(e)(3), an interest in a partnership (lower-tier partnership) that has assumed a § 1.752-7 liability is distributed by a partnership (upper-tier partnership) that is the § 1.752-7 liability partner with respect to that liability, then the persons receiving interests in the lower-tier partnership are § 1.752-7 liability partners with respect to the lower-tier partnership to the same extent that they were prior to the distribution.


(6) *Remaining built-in loss associated with a § 1.752-7 liability.* (i) *In general.* The remaining built-in loss associated with a § 1.752-7 liability equals the amount of the § 1.752-7 liability as of the time of the assumption of the § 1.752-7 liability by the partnership, reduced by the portion of the § 1.752-7 liability previously taken into account by the § 1.752-7 liability partner under paragraph (j)(3) of this section and adjusted as provided in paragraph (c) of this section and § 1.704-3 for—


(A) Any portion of that built-in loss associated with the § 1.752-7 liability that is satisfied by the partnership on or prior to the testing date (whether capitalized or deducted); and


(B) Any assumption of all or part of the § 1.752-7 liability by the § 1.752-7 liability partner (including any assumption that occurs on the testing date).


(ii) *Partial dispositions and assumptions.* In the case of a partial disposition of the § 1.752-7 liability partner's partnership interest or a partial assumption of the § 1.752-7 liability by another partner, the remaining built-in loss associated with § 1.752-7 liability is pro rated based on the portion of the interest sold or the portion of the § 1.752-7 liability assumed.


(7) *§ 1.752-7 liability reduction*—(i) *In general.* The § 1.752-7 liability reduction is the amount by which the § 1.752-7 liability partner is required to reduce the basis in the partner's partnership interest by operation of paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section. The § 1.752-7 liability reduction is the lesser of—


(A) The excess of the § 1.752-7 liability partner's basis in the partnership interest over the adjusted value of that interest (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section); or


(B) The remaining built-in loss associated with the § 1.752-7 liability (as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section without regard to paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section).


(ii) *Partial dispositions and assumptions.* In the case of a partial disposition of the § 1.752-7 liability partner's partnership interest or a partial assumption of the § 1.752-7 liability by another partner, the § 1.752-7 liability reduction is pro rated based on the portion of the interest sold or the portion of the § 1.752-7 liability assumed.


(8) *Satisfaction of § 1.752-7 liability*—*In general.* A § 1.752-7 liability is treated as satisfied (in whole or in part) on the date on which the partnership (or the assuming partner) would have been allowed to take the § 1.752-7 liability into account for federal tax purposes but for this section. For example, a § 1.752-7 liability is treated as satisfied when, but for this section, the § 1.752-7 liability would give rise to—


(i) An increase in the basis of the partnership's or the assuming partner's assets (including cash);


(ii) An immediate deduction to the partnership or to the assuming partner;


(iii) An expense that is not deductible in computing the partnership's or the assuming partner's taxable income and not properly chargeable to capital account; or


(iv) An amount realized on the sale or other disposition of property subject to that liability if the property was disposed of by the partnership or the assuming partner at that time.


(9) *Testing date.* The testing date is—


(i) For purposes of paragraph (e) of this section, the date of the sale, exchange, or other disposition of part or all of the § 1.752-7 liability partner's partnership interest;


(ii) For purposes of paragraph (f) of this section, the date of the partnership's distribution in liquidation of the § 1.752-7 liability partner's partnership interest; and


(iii) For purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, the date of the assumption (or partial assumption) of the § 1.752-7 liability by a partner other than the § 1.752-7 liability partner.


(10) *Trade or business*—(i) *In general.* A trade or business is a specific group of activities carried on by a person for the purpose of earning income or profit, other than a group of activities consisting of acquiring, holding, dealing in, or disposing of financial instruments, if the activities included in that group include every operation that forms a part of, or a step in, the process of earning income or profit. Such group of activities ordinarily includes the collection of income and the payment of expenses. The group of activities must constitute the carrying on of a trade or business under section 162(a) (determined as though the activities were conducted by an individual).


(ii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (b)(10):


(c) *Application of section 704(b) and (c) to assumed § 1.752-7 liabilities*—(1) *In general*—(i) *Section 704(c).* Except as otherwise provided in this section, sections 704(c)(1)(A) and (B), section 737, and the regulations thereunder, apply to § 1.752-7 liabilities. See § 1.704-3(a)(12). However, § 1.704-3(a)(7) does not apply to any person who acquired a partnership interest from a § 1.752-7 liability partner in a transaction to which paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies.


(ii) *Section 704(b).* Section 704(b) and § 1.704-1(b) apply to a post-contribution change in the value of a § 1.752-7 liability. If there is a decrease in the value of a § 1.752-7 liability that is reflected in the capital accounts of the partners under § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(*f*), the amount of the decrease constitutes an item of income for purposes of section 704(b) and § 1.704-1(b). Conversely, if there is an increase in the value of a § 1.752-7 liability that is reflected in the capital accounts of the partners under § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(*f*), the amount of the increase constitutes an item of loss for purposes of section 704(b) and § 1.704-1(b).


(2) *Example.* The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (c): 


(d) *Special rules for transfers of partnership interests, distributions of partnership assets, and assumptions of the § 1.752-7 liability after a § 1.752-7 liability transfer*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (i) of this section, paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section apply to certain partnership transactions occurring after a § 1.752-7 liability transfer.


(2) *Exceptions*—(i) *In general.* Paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section do not apply—


(A) If the partnership assumes the § 1.752-7 liability as part of a contribution to the partnership of the trade or business with which the liability is associated, and the partnership continues to carry on that trade or business after the contribution (for the definition of a trade or business, see paragraph (b)(10) of this section); or


(B) If, immediately before the testing date, the amount of the remaining built-in loss with respect to all § 1.752-7 liabilities assumed by the partnership (other than § 1.752-7 liabilities assumed by the partnership with an associated trade or business) in one or more § 1.752-7 liability transfers is less than the lesser of 10% of the gross value of partnership assets or $1,000,000.


(ii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (d)(2): 


(e) *Transfer of § 1.752-7 liability partner's partnership interest*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2), (e)(3), and (i) of this section, immediately before the sale, exchange, or other disposition of all or a part of a § 1.752-7 liability partner's partnership interest, the § 1.752-7 liability partner's basis in the partnership interest is reduced by the § 1.752-7 liability reduction (as defined in paragraph (b)(7) of this section). No deduction, loss, or capital expense is allowed to the partnership on the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(8) of this section) to the extent of the remaining built-in loss associated with the § 1.752-7 liability (as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section). For purposes of section 705(a)(2)(B) and § 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(*b*) only, the remaining built-in loss associated with the § 1.752-7 liability is not treated as a nondeductible, noncapital expenditure of the partnership. Therefore, the remaining partners' capital accounts and bases in their partnership interests are not reduced by the remaining built-in loss associated with the § 1.752-7 liability. If the partnership (or any successor) notifies the § 1.752-7 liability partner of the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability, then the § 1.752-7 liability partner is entitled to a loss or deduction. The amount of that deduction or loss is, in the case of a partial satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability, the amount that the partnership would, but for this section, take into account on the partial satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability (but not, in total, more than the § 1.752-7 liability reduction) or, in the case of a complete satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability, the remaining § 1.752-7 liability reduction. To the extent of the amount that the partnership would, but for this section, take into account on the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability, the character of that deduction or loss is determined as if the § 1.752-7 liability partner had satisfied the liability. To the extent that the § 1.752-7 liability reduction exceeds the amount that the partnership would, but for this section, take into account on the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability, the character of the § 1.752-7 liability partner's loss is capital.


(2) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the principles of paragraph (e)(1) of this section:


(3) *Exception for nonrecognition transactions*—(i) *In general.* Paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not apply where a § 1.752-7 liability partner transfers all or part of the partner's partnership interest in a transaction in which the transferee's basis in the partnership interest is determined in whole or in part by reference to the transferor's basis in the partnership interest. In addition, paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not apply to a distribution of an interest in the partnership (lower-tier partnership) that has assumed the § 1.752-7 liability by a partnership that is the § 1.752-7 liability partner (upper-tier partnership) if the partners of the upper-tier partnership that were § 1.752-7 liability partners with respect to the lower-tier partnership prior to the distribution continue to be § 1.752-7 liability partners with respect to the lower-tier partnership after the distribution. See paragraphs (b)(4)(ii) and (j)(3) of this section for rules on the application of this section to partners of the § 1.752-7 liability partner.


(ii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (e)(3):


(f) *Distribution in liquidation of § 1.752-7 liability partner's partnership interest*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (i) of this section, immediately before a distribution in liquidation of a § 1.752-7 liability partner's partnership interest, the § 1.752-7 liability partner's basis in the partnership interest is reduced by the § 1.752-7 liability reduction (as defined in paragraph (b)(7) of this section). This rule applies before section 737. No deduction, loss, or capital expense is allowed to the partnership on the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(8) of this section) to the extent of the remaining built-in loss associated with the § 1.752-7 liability (as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section). For purposes of section 705(a)(2)(B) and § 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(*b*) only, the remaining built-in loss associated with the § 1.752-7 liability is not treated as a nondeductible, noncapital expenditure of the partnership. Therefore, the remaining partners' capital accounts and bases in their partnership interests are not reduced by the remaining built-in loss associated with the § 1.752-7 liability. If the partnership (or any successor) notifies the § 1.752-7 liability partner of the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability, then the § 1.752-7 liability partner is entitled to a loss or deduction. The amount of that deduction or loss is, in the case of a partial satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability, the amount that the partnership would, but for this section, take into account on the partial satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability (but not, in total, more than the § 1.752-7 liability reduction) or, in the case of a complete satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability, the remaining § 1.752-7 liability reduction. To the extent of the amount that the partnership would, but for this section, take into account on satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability, the character of that deduction or loss is determined as if the § 1.752-7 liability partner had satisfied the liability. To the extent that the § 1.752-7 liability reduction exceeds the amount that the partnership would, but for this section, take into account on satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability, the character of the § 1.752-7 liability partner's loss is capital.


(2) *Example.* The following example illustrates the provision of this paragraph (f):


(g) *Assumption of § 1.752-7 liability by a partner other than § 1.752-7 liability partner*—(1) *In general.* If this paragraph (g) applies, section 704(c)(1)(B) does not apply to an assumption of a § 1.752-7 liability from a partnership by a partner other than the § 1.752-7 liability partner. The rules of paragraph (g)(2) of this section apply only if the § 1.752-7 liability partner is a partner in the partnership at the time of the assumption of the § 1.752-7 liability from the partnership. The rules of paragraphs (g)(3) and (4) of this section apply to any assumption of the § 1.752-7 liability by a partner other than the § 1.752-7 liability partner, whether or not the § 1.752-7 liability partner is a partner in the partnership at the time of the assumption from the partnership.


(2) *Consequences to § 1.752-7 liability partner.* If, at the time of an assumption of a § 1.752-7 liability from a partnership by a partner other than the § 1.752-7 liability partner, the § 1.752-7 liability partner remains a partner in the partnership, then the § 1.752-7 liability partner's basis in the partnership interest is reduced by the § 1.752-7 liability reduction (as defined in paragraph (b)(7) of this section). If the assuming partner (or any successor) notifies the § 1.752-7 liability partner of the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(8) of this section), then the § 1.752-7 liability partner is entitled to a deduction or loss. The amount of that deduction or loss is, in the case of a partial satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability, the amount that the assuming partner would, but for this section, take into account on the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability (but not, in total, more than the § 1.752-7 liability reduction) or, in the case of a complete satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability, the remaining § 1.752-7 liability reduction. To the extent of the amount that the assuming partner would, but for this section, take into account on the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability, the character of that deduction or loss is determined as if the § 1.752-7 liability partner had satisfied the liability. To the extent that the § 1.752-7 liability reduction exceeds the amount that the assuming partner would, but for this section, take into account on the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability, the character of the § 1.752-7 liability partner's loss is capital.


(3) *Consequences to partnership.* Immediately after the assumption of the § 1.752-7 liability from the partnership by a partner other than the § 1.752-7 liability partner, the partnership must reduce the basis of partnership assets by the remaining built-in loss associated with the § 1.752-7 liability (as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section). The reduction in the basis of partnership assets must be allocated among partnership assets as if that adjustment were a basis adjustment under section 734(b).


(4) *Consequences to assuming partner.* No deduction, loss, or capital expense is allowed to an assuming partner (other than the § 1.752-7 liability partner) on the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability assumed from a partnership to the extent of the remaining built-in loss associated with the § 1.752-7 liability. Instead, upon the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability, the assuming partner must adjust the basis of the partnership interest, any assets (other than cash, accounts receivable, or inventory) distributed by the partnership to the partner, or gain or loss on the disposition of the partnership interest, as the case may be. These adjustments are determined as if the assuming partner's basis in the partnership interest at the time of the assumption were increased by the lesser of the amount paid (or to be paid) to satisfy the § 1.752-7 liability or the remaining built-in loss associated with the § 1.752-7 liability. However, the assuming partner cannot take into account any adjustments to depreciable basis, reduction in gain, or increase in loss until the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability.


(5) *Example.* The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (g):


(h) *Notification by the partnership (or successor) of the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability.* For purposes of paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section, notification by the partnership (or successor) of the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability must be attached to the § 1.752-7 liability partner's return (whether an original or an amended return) for the year in which the loss is being claimed and must include—


(1) The amount paid in satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability, and whether the amounts paid were in partial or complete satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability;


(2) The name and address of the person satisfying the § 1.752-7 liability;


(3) The date of the payment on the § 1.752-7 liability; and


(4) The character of the loss to the § 1.752-7 liability partner with respect to the § 1.752-7 liability.


(i) *Special rule for amounts that are capitalized prior to the occurrence of an event described in paragraphs (e), (f), or (g)*—(1) *In general.* If all or a portion of a § 1.752-7 liability is properly capitalized (capitalized basis) prior to an event described in paragraph (e), (f), or (g) of this section, then, before an event described in paragraph (e), (f), or (g) of this section, the partnership may take the capitalized basis into account for purposes of computing cost recovery and gain or loss on the sale of the asset to which the basis has been capitalized (and for any other purpose for which the basis of the asset is relevant), but after an event described in paragraph (e), (f), or (g) of this section, the partnership may not take any remaining capitalized basis into account for tax purposes.


(2) *Example.* The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (i):


(j) *Tiered partnerships*—(1) *Look-through treatment.* For purposes of this section, a contribution by a partner of an interest in a partnership (lower-tier partnership) to another partnership (upper-tier partnership) is treated as a contribution by the partner of the partner's share of each of the lower-tier partnership's assets and an assumption by the upper-tier partnership of the partner's share of the lower-tier partnership's liabilities (including § 1.752-7 liabilities). See paragraph (e)(3)(ii) *Example 1* of this section. In addition, a partnership is treated as having its share of any § 1.752-7 liabilities of the partnerships in which it has an interest.


(2) *Trade or business exception.* If a partnership (upper-tier partnership) assumes a § 1.752-7 liability of a partner, and, subsequently, another partnership (lower-tier partnership) assumes that § 1.752-7 liability from the upper-tier partnership, then the § 1.752-7 liability is treated as associated only with any trade or business contributed to the upper-tier partnership by the § 1.752-7 liability partner. The same rule applies where a partnership assumes a § 1.752-7 liability of a partner, and, subsequently, the § 1.752-7 liability partner transfers that partnership interest to another partnership. See paragraph (e)(3)(ii) *Example 1* of this section.


(3) *Partnership as a § 1.752-7 liability partner.* If a transaction described in paragraph (e), (f), or (g) of this section occurs with respect to a partnership (upper-tier partnership) that is a § 1.752-7 liability partner of another partnership (lower-tier partnership), then such transaction will also be treated as a transaction described in paragraph (e), (f), or (g) of this section, as appropriate, with respect to the partners of the upper-tier partnership, regardless of whether the upper-tier partnership assumed the § 1.752-7 liability from those partners. (See paragraph (b)(5) of this section for rules relating to the treatment of transactions by the partners of the upper-tier partnership). In such a case, each partner's share of the § 1.752-7 liability reduction in the upper-tier partnership is equal to that partner's share of the § 1.752-7 liability. The partners of the upper-tier partnership at the time of the transaction described in paragraph (e), (f), or (g) of this section, and not the upper-tier partnership, are entitled to the deduction or loss on the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability. Similar principles apply where the upper-tier partnership is itself owned by one or a series of partnerships. This paragraph does not apply to the extent that § 1.752-7(j)(4) applied to the assumption of the § 1.752-7 liability by the lower-tier partnership.


(4) *Transfer of § 1.752-7 liability by partnership to another partnership or corporation after a transaction described in paragraph (e), (f), or (g)*—(i) *In general.* If, after a transaction described in paragraph (e), (f), or (g) of this section with respect to a § 1.752-7 liability assumed by a partnership (the upper-tier partnership), another partnership or a corporation assumes the § 1.752-7 liability from the upper-tier partnership (or the assuming partner) in a transaction in which the basis of property is determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of the property in the hands of the upper-tier partnership (or assuming partner), then—


(A) The upper-tier partnership (or assuming partner) must reduce its basis in any corporate stock or partnership interest received by the remaining built-in loss associated with the § 1.752-7 liability, at the time of the transaction described in paragraph (e), (f), or (g) of this section (but the partners of the upper-tier partnership do not reduce their bases or capital accounts in the upper-tier partnership); and


(B) No deduction, loss, or capital expense is allowed to the assuming partnership or corporation on the satisfaction of the § 1.752-7 liability to the extent of the remaining built-in loss associated with the § 1.752-7 liability.


(ii) *Subsequent transfers.* Similar rules apply to subsequent assumptions of the § 1.752-7 liability in transactions in which the basis of property is determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of the property in the hands of the transferor. If, subsequent to an assumption of the § 1.752-7 liability by a partnership in a transaction to which paragraph (j)(4)(i) of this section applies, the § 1.752-7 liability is assumed from the partnership by a partner other than the partner from whom the partnership assumed the § 1.752-7 liability, then the rules of paragraph (g) of this section apply.


(5) *Example.* The following example illustrates the provisions of paragraphs (j)(3) and (4) of this section:


(k) *Effective dates*—(1) *In general.* This section applies to § 1.752-7 liability transfers occurring on or after June 24, 2003. For assumptions occurring after October 18, 1999, and before June 24, 2003, see § 1.752-6. For § 1.752-7 liability transfers occurring on or after June 24, 2003 and before May 26, 2005, taxpayers may rely on the exception for trading and investment partnerships in paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of § 1.752.7 (2003-28 I.R.B. 46; 68 FR 37434).


(2) *Election to apply this section to assumptions of liabilities occurring after October 18, 1999 and before June 24, 2003*—(i) *In general.* A partnership may elect to apply this section to all assumptions of liabilities (including § 1.752-7 liabilities) occurring after October 18, 1999, and before June 24, 2003. Such an election is binding on the partnership and all of its partners. A partnership making such an election must apply all of the provisions of § 1.752-1 and § 1.752-7, including § 1.358-5T, § 1.358-7, § 1.704-1(b)(1)(ii) and (b)(2)(iv)(*b*), § 1.704-2(b)(3), § 1.704-3(a)(7), (a)(8)(iv), and (a)(12), § 1.704-4(d)(1)(iv), § 1.705-1(a)(8), § 1.732-2(d)(3)(iv), and § 1.737-5.


(ii) *Manner of making election.* A partnership makes an election under this paragraph (k)(2) by attaching the following statement to its timely filed return: [Insert name and employer identification number of electing partnership] elects under § 1.752-7 of the Income Tax Regulations to be subject to the rules of § 1.358-5T, § 1.358-7, § 1.704-1(b)(1)(ii) and (b)(2)(iv)(*b*), § 1.704-2(b)(3), § 1.704-3(a)(7), (a)(8)(iv), and (a)(12), § 1.704-4(d)(1)(iv), § 1.705-1(a)(8), § 1.732-2(d)(3)(iv), and § 1.737-5 with respect to all liabilities (including § 1.752-7 liabilities) assumed by the partnership after October 18, 1999 and before June 24, 2003. In the statement, the partnership must list, with respect to each liability (including each § 1.752-7 liability) assumed by the partnership after October 18, 1999 and before June 24, 2003—


(A) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the partner from whom the liability was assumed;


(B) The date on which the liability was assumed by the partnership;


(C) The amount of the liability as of the time of its assumption; and


(D) A description of the liability.


(iii) *Filing of amended returns.* An election under this paragraph (k)(2) will be valid only if the partnership and its partners promptly amend any returns for open taxable years that would be affected by the election.


(iv) *Time for making election.* An election under this paragraph (k)(2) must be filed with any timely filed Federal income tax return filed by the partnership on or after September 24, 2003 and on or before December 31, 2005.
