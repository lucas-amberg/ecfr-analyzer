# ยง 1.753-1   Partner receiving income in respect of decedent.

(a) *Income in respect of a decedent under section 736(a).* All payments coming within the provisions of section 736(a) made by a partnership to the estate or other successor in interest of a deceased partner are considered income in respect of the decedent under section 691. The estate or other successor in interest of a deceased partner shall be considered to have received income in respect of a decedent to the extent that amounts are paid by a third person in exchange for rights to future payments from the partnership under section 736(a). When a partner who is receiving payments under section 736(a) dies, section 753 applies to any remaining payments under section 736(a) made to his estate or other successor in interest.


(b) *Other income in respect of a decedent.* When a partner dies, the entire portion of the distributive share which is attributable to the period ending with the date of his death and which is taxable to his estate or other successor constitutes income in respect of a decedent under section 691. This rule applies even though that part of the distributive share for the period before death which the decedent withdrew is not included in the value of the decedent's partnership interest for estate tax purposes. See paragraph (c) (3) of ยง 1.706-1.


(c) *Example.* The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following example:


(d) *Effective date.* The provisions of section 753 apply only in the case of payments made with respect to decedents whose death occurred after December 31, 1954. See section 771(b)(4) and paragraph (b)(4) of ยง 1.771-1.
