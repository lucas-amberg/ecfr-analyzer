# § 1.861-17   Allocation and apportionment of research and experimental expenditures.

(a) *Scope.* This section provides rules for the allocation and apportionment of research and experimental expenditures that a taxpayer deducts, or amortizes and deducts, in a taxable year under section 174 or section 59(e) (applicable to expenditures that are allowable as a deduction under section 174(a)) (*R&E expenditures*). R&E expenditures do not include any expenditures that are not deductible expenses by reason of the second sentence under § 1.482-7(j)(3)(i) (relating to CST Payments (as defined in § 1.482-7(b)(1)) owed to a controlled participant in a cost sharing arrangement).


(b) *Allocation*—(1) *In general.* The method of allocation and apportionment of R&E expenditures set forth in this section recognizes that research and experimentation is an inherently speculative activity, that findings may contribute unexpected benefits, and that the gross income derived from successful research and experimentation must bear the cost of unsuccessful research and experimentation. In addition, the method set forth in this section recognizes that successful R&E expenditures ultimately result in the creation of intangible property that will be used to generate income. Therefore, R&E expenditures ordinarily are considered deductions that are definitely related to gross intangible income (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) reasonably connected with the relevant SIC code category (or categories) of the taxpayer and therefore allocable to gross intangible income as a class related to the SIC code category (or categories) and apportioned under the rules in this section. For purposes of the allocation under this paragraph (b)(1), a taxpayer's SIC code category (or categories) are determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. For purposes of this section, the term *intangible property* means intangible property (as defined in section 367(d)(4)), including intangible property either created or acquired by the taxpayer, that is derived from R&E expenditures.


(2) *Definition of gross intangible income.* The term *gross intangible income* means all gross income earned by a taxpayer that is attributable to a sale or license of intangible property (including income from platform contribution transactions described in § 1.482-7(b)(1)(ii), royalty income from the licensing of intangible property, or amounts taken into account under section 367(d) by reason of a transfer of intangible property), and the full amount of gross income from sales or leases of products or services if the income is derived directly or indirectly (in whole or in part) from intangible property. Gross intangible income also includes a distributive share of any amounts described in the previous sentence, but does not include dividends or any amounts included in income under section 951, 951A, or 1293. See § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi) for rules addressing the assignment of gross income, including gross intangible income, to a separate category by reason of certain disregarded payments to or from a taxpayer's foreign branch.


(3) *SIC code categories*—(i) *Allocation based on SIC code categories.* Ordinarily, a taxpayer's R&E expenditures are incurred to produce gross intangible income that is reasonably connected with one or more relevant SIC code categories. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, where research and experimentation is conducted with respect to more than one SIC code category, the taxpayer may aggregate the categories for purposes of allocation and apportionment, provided the categories are in the same Major Group. However, the taxpayer may not subdivide any categories. Where research and experimentation is not clearly related to any SIC code category (or categories), it will be considered conducted with respect to all of the taxpayer's SIC code categories.


(ii) *Use of three digit standard industrial classification codes.* A taxpayer determines the relevant Major Groups and SIC code categories by reference to the two digit and three digit classification, respectively, of the Standard Industrial Classification Manual (SIC code). The SIC Manual is available at *https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/sic_manual.html.*

(iii) *Consistency.* Once a taxpayer selects a SIC code category or Major Group for the first taxable year for which this section applies to the taxpayer, it must continue to use that category in following years unless the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that, due to changes in the relevant facts, a change in the category is appropriate. Therefore, once a taxpayer elects a permissible aggregation of three digit SIC code categories into a two digit Major Group, it must continue to use that two digit category in following years unless the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that, due to changes in the relevant facts, a change is appropriate.


(iv) *Wholesale trade and retail trade categories.* A taxpayer must use a SIC code category within the divisions of “wholesale trade” or “retail trade” if it is engaged solely in sales-related activities with respect to a particular category of products. In the case of a taxpayer that conducts material non-sales-related activities with respect to a particular category of products, all R&E expenditures related to sales of the products must be allocated and apportioned as if the expenditures were reasonably connected to the most closely related three digit SIC code category other than those within the wholesale and retail trade divisions. For example, if a taxpayer engages in both the manufacturing and assembling of cars and trucks (SIC code 371) and in a wholesaling activity related to motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts and supplies (SIC code 501), the taxpayer must allocate and apportion all R&E expenditures related to both activities as if they relate solely to the manufacturing SIC code 371. By contrast, if the taxpayer engages only in the wholesaling activity related to motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts and supplies, the taxpayer must allocate and apportion all R&E expenditures to the wholesaling SIC code 501.


(c) *Exclusive apportionment.* Solely for purposes of applying this section to section 904 as the operative section, an amount equal to fifty percent of a taxpayer's R&E expenditures in a SIC code category (or categories) is apportioned exclusively to the residual grouping of U.S. source gross intangible income if research and experimentation that accounts for at least fifty percent of such R&E expenditures was performed in the United States. Similarly, an amount equal to fifty percent of a taxpayer's R&E expenditures in a SIC code category (or categories) is apportioned exclusively to the statutory grouping (or groupings) of foreign source gross intangible income in that SIC code category if research and experimentation that accounts for more than fifty percent of such R&E expenditures was performed outside the United States. If there are multiple separate categories with foreign source gross intangible income in the SIC code category, the fifty percent of R&E expenditures apportioned under the previous sentence is apportioned ratably to foreign source gross intangible income based on the relative amounts of gross receipts from gross intangible income in the SIC code category in each separate category, as determined under paragraph (d) of this section. Solely for purposes of determining whether fifty percent or more of R&E expenditures in a year are performed within or without the United States under this paragraph (c), a taxpayer's R&E expenditures with respect to a taxable year are determined by taking into account only the R&E expenditures incurred in such taxable year (without regard to whether such expenditures are capitalized under section 59(e) or any other provision in the Code), and do not include amounts that were capitalized in a prior taxable year and are deducted in such taxable year.


(d) *Apportionment based on gross receipts from sales of products or services*—(1) *In general.* A taxpayer's R&E expenditures not apportioned under paragraph (c) of this section are apportioned between the statutory grouping (or among the statutory groupings) within the class of gross intangible income and the residual grouping within such class according to the rules in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section. See paragraph (b) of this section for defining the class of gross intangible income in relation to SIC code categories.


(i) A taxpayer's R&E expenditures not apportioned under paragraph (c) of this section are apportioned in the same proportions that:


(A) The amounts of the taxpayer's gross receipts from sales and leases of products (as measured by gross receipts without regard to cost of goods sold) or services that are related to gross intangible income within the statutory grouping (or statutory groupings) and in the residual grouping bear, respectively; to


(B) The total amount of such gross receipts in the class.


(ii) For purposes of this paragraph (d), gross receipts from sales and leases of products are related to gross intangible income if intangible property is embedded or used in connection with the manufacture or sale of such products, and gross income from services is related to gross intangible income if intangible property is incorporated in or directly or indirectly benefits such services. See paragraph (g)(7) of this section (*Example 7*). The amount of the gross receipts used to apportion R&E expenditures also includes gross receipts from sales and leases of products or services of any controlled or uncontrolled party to the extent described in paragraphs (d)(3) and (4) of this section. A royalty or other amount paid to the taxpayer for intangible property constitutes gross intangible income, but is not considered part of gross receipts arising from the sale or lease of a product or service, and so is not taken into account in apportioning the taxpayer's R&E expenditures to its gross intangible income.


(iii) The statutory grouping (or groupings) or residual grouping to which the gross receipts are assigned is the grouping to which the gross intangible income related to the sale, lease, or service is assigned. In cases where the gross intangible income of the taxpayer is income not described in paragraph (d)(3) or (4) of this section, the grouping to which the taxpayer's gross receipts and the gross intangible income are assigned is the same. In cases where the taxpayer's gross intangible income is related to sales, leases, or services described in paragraph (d)(3) or (4) of this section, the gross receipts that will be used for purposes of this paragraph (d) are the gross receipts of the controlled and uncontrolled parties that are taken into account under paragraphs (d)(3) and (4) of this section. The grouping to which the controlled or uncontrolled parties' gross receipts are assigned is determined based on the grouping of the taxpayer's gross intangible income attributable to the license, sale, or other transfer of intangible property to such controlled or uncontrolled party as described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) or (d)(4)(i) of this section, and not the grouping to which the gross receipts would be assigned if the assignment were based on the income earned by the controlled or uncontrolled party. See paragraph (g)(1) of this section (*Example 1*). For purposes of applying this paragraph (d)(1)(iii) to section 250 or section 904 as the operative section, the assignment of gross receipts to the general and foreign branch categories is made after taking into account the assignment of gross intangible income to those categories as adjusted by reason of disregarded payments under the rules of § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi), and by making similar adjustments to gross receipts under the principles of § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi).


(iv) For purposes of applying this section to section 904 as the operative section, because a United States person's gross intangible income cannot include income assigned to the section 951A category, no R&E expenditures of a United States person are apportioned to foreign source income in the section 951A category.


(2) *Apportionment in excess of gross income.* Amounts apportioned under this section may exceed the amount of gross income related to the SIC code category within the statutory or residual grouping. In such case, the excess is applied against other gross income within the statutory or residual grouping. See § 1.861-8(d)(1) for applicable rules where the apportionment results in an excess of deductions over gross income within the statutory or residual grouping.


(3) *Sales or services of uncontrolled parties*—(i) *In general.* For purposes of the apportionment within a class under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, if a taxpayer reasonably expects an uncontrolled party to (through a license, purchase, or transfer): Acquire intangible property that would arise from the taxpayer's current R&E expenditures; acquire products in which such intangible property is embedded or used in connection with the manufacture or sale of such products; or receive services that incorporate or directly or indirectly benefit from such intangible property, then the gross receipts of the uncontrolled party from sales, licenses, leases, or services of the particular products or services in which the taxpayer's intangible property is embedded or incorporated or which the taxpayer's intangible property directly or indirectly benefitted are taken into account. If the taxpayer has previously licensed, sold, or transferred intangible property related to a SIC code category to an uncontrolled party, the taxpayer is presumed to expect to license, sell, or transfer to that uncontrolled party all future intangible property related to the same SIC code category. The presumption described in the preceding sentence may be rebutted by the taxpayer with facts that demonstrate that the taxpayer reasonably expects not to license, sell, or transfer future intangible property to the uncontrolled party.


(ii) *Definition of uncontrolled party.* For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3), the term *uncontrolled party* means a person that is not a controlled party as defined in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section.


(iii) *Sales of components.* In the case of a sale or lease of a product by an uncontrolled party that is derived from the taxpayer's intangible property but is incorporated as a component of a larger product (for example, where the product incorporating the intangible property is a component of a large machine), only the portion of the gross receipts from the larger product that are attributable to the component derived from the intangible property is included. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a reasonable estimate based on the principles of section 482 must be made. See paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(B)(*3*) of this section (*Example 4*).


(iv) *Reasonable estimates of gross receipts.* If the amount of gross receipts of an uncontrolled party is unknown, a reasonable estimate of gross receipts must be made annually. Appropriate economic analyses, based on the principles of section 482, must be used to estimate gross receipts. See paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(B)(*3*)(*ii*) of this section (*Example 5*).


(4) *Sales or services of controlled parties*—(i) *In general.* For purposes of the apportionment within a class under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, if the controlled party is reasonably expected to (through a license, sale, or transfer): Acquire intangible property that would arise from the taxpayer's current R&E expenditures; acquire products in which such intangible property is embedded or used in connection with the manufacture or sale of such products; or receive services that incorporate or directly or indirectly benefit from such intangible property, then the gross receipts of the controlled party from all of its sales, licenses, leases, or services are taken into account. Except to the extent provided in paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section, if the taxpayer has previously licensed, sold, or transferred intangible property related to a SIC code category to a controlled party, the taxpayer is presumed to expect to license, sell, or transfer to that controlled party all future intangible property related to the same SIC code category. The presumption described in the preceding sentence may be rebutted by the taxpayer with facts that demonstrate that the taxpayer will not license, sell, or transfer future intangible property to the controlled party.


(ii) *Definition of a controlled party.* For purposes of this paragraph (d)(4), the term *controlled party* means any person that has a relationship to the taxpayer specified in section 267(b) or 707(b), or is a member of a controlled group of corporations (within the meaning of section 267(f)) to which the taxpayer belongs. Because an affiliated group is treated as a single taxpayer, a member of an affiliated group is not a controlled party. See paragraph (e) of this section.


(iii) *Gross receipts not to be taken into account more than once.* Sales, licenses, leases, or services among the taxpayer, controlled parties, and uncontrolled parties are not taken into account more than once; in such a situation, the amount of gross receipts of the selling person must be subtracted from the gross receipts of the buying person. Therefore, the gross receipts taken into account under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section generally reflect the gross receipts from sales made to end users.


(iv) *Effect of cost sharing arrangements.* If the controlled party has entered into a cost sharing arrangement, in accordance with the provisions of § 1.482-7, with the taxpayer for the purpose of developing intangible property, then ordinarily the controlled party is not reasonably expected to acquire rights in intangible property that would arise from the taxpayer's share of the R&E expenditures with respect to the cost shared intangibles as defined in § 1.482-7(j)(1)(i); acquire products in which such intangible property is embedded or used in connection with the manufacture or sale of such products; or receive services that incorporate or directly or indirectly benefit from such intangible property. Therefore, solely for purposes of apportioning a taxpayer's R&E expenditures (which do not include the amount of CST Payments received by the taxpayer; see paragraph (a) of this section) that are intangible development costs (as defined in § 1.482-7(d)) with respect to a cost sharing arrangement, the controlled party's gross receipts are not taken into account for purposes of paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(4)(i) of this section. However, the rule in this paragraph (d)(4)(iv) does not apply, and the controlled party's sales are taken into account, to the extent the taxpayer licenses, or has licensed, to the controlled party intangible property resulting from a cost sharing arrangement with the controlled party.


(5) *Application of section 864(e)(3).* Section 864(e)(3) and § 1.861-8(d)(2) do not apply for purposes of this section.


(e) *Affiliated groups.* See § 1.861-14(e)(2) for rules on allocating and apportioning R&E expenditures of an affiliated group (as defined in § 1.861-14(d)).


(f) *Special rules for partnerships*—(1) *R&E expenditures.* For purposes of applying this section, if R&E expenditures are incurred by a partnership in which the taxpayer is a partner, the taxpayer's R&E expenditures include the taxpayer's distributive share of the partnership's R&E expenditures.


(2) *Purpose and location of expenditures.* In applying exclusive apportionment under paragraph (c) of this section, a partner's distributive share of R&E expenditures incurred by a partnership is treated as incurred by the partner for the same purpose and in the same location as incurred by the partnership.


(3) *Apportionment based on gross receipts.* In applying the remaining apportionment under paragraph (d) of this section, if a taxpayer is a partner in a partnership that incurs R&E expenditures described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section and the taxpayer is not reasonably expected to license, sell, or transfer to the partnership (directly or indirectly) intangible property that would arise from the taxpayer's current R&E expenditures, in the manner described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) or (d)(4)(i) of this section, then the taxpayer's gross receipts in a SIC code category include only the taxpayer's share of any gross receipts in the SIC code category of the partnership. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the taxpayer's share of gross receipts is proportionate to the taxpayer's distributive share of the partnership's gross income in the product category. However, if the taxpayer is reasonably expected to license, sell, or transfer to the partnership (directly or indirectly) intangible property that would arise from the taxpayer current R&E expenditures, in the manner described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) or (d)(4)(i) of this section, then the taxpayer's gross receipts in a SIC code category include the full amount of any gross receipts in the SIC code category of the partnership as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(i) or (d)(4)(i) of this section.


(g) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of the rules in this section.


(1) *Example 1: Controlled party and single product*—(i) *Facts.* X, a domestic corporation, is a manufacturer and distributor of small gasoline engines for lawnmowers. Gasoline engines are a product within the category, Engines and Turbines (SIC Industry Group 351). Y, a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of X, also manufactures and sells these engines abroad. X owns no other foreign subsidiaries. During Year 1, X incurred R&E expenditures of $60,000x, which it deducts under section 174 as a current expense, to invent and patent a new and improved gasoline engine. All of the research and experimentation was performed in the United States. Also in Year 1, the domestic gross receipts of X from sales of gasoline engines total $500,000x and foreign gross receipts of Y from sales of gasoline engines total $300,000x. X provides technology for the manufacture of engines to Y through a license that requires the payment of an arm's length royalty. Because X has licensed its intangible property to Y related to the SIC code, it is presumed to reasonably expect to license the intangible property that would be developed from the current research and experimentation. In Year 1, X's gross income is $210,000x, of which $140,000x is U.S. source income from domestic sales of gasoline engines, $40,000x is income included under section 951A, all of which relates to Y's foreign source income from sales of gasoline engines, $20,000x is foreign source royalties from Y, and $10,000x is U.S. source interest income. None of the foreign source royalties are allocable to passive category income of Y, and therefore, under §§ 1.904-4(d) and 1.904-5(c)(3), the foreign source royalties are general category income to X.


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Allocation.* The R&E expenditures were incurred in connection with developing intangible property related to small gasoline engines and they are definitely related to X's items of gross intangible income related to the SIC code category 351, namely gross income from the sale of small gasoline engines in the United States and royalties received from subsidiary Y, a foreign manufacturer of gasoline engines. Accordingly, under paragraph (b) of this section, the R&E expenditures are allocable to the class of gross intangible income related to SIC code category 351, all of which is general category income of X. X's U.S. source interest income and income included under section 951A are not within this class of gross intangible income and, therefore, no portion of the R&E expenditures are allocated to the U.S. source interest income or foreign source income in the section 951A category.


(B) *Apportionment*—(*1*) *In general.* For purposes of applying this section to section 904 as the operative section, the statutory grouping of gross intangible income is foreign source general category income and the residual grouping of gross intangible income is U.S. source income.


(*2*) *Exclusive apportionment.* Under paragraph (c) of this section, because at least 50% of X's research and experimental activity was performed in the United States, 50% of the R&E expenditures, or $30,000x ($60,000x × 50%), is apportioned exclusively to the residual grouping of U.S. source gross intangible income. The remaining 50% of the R&E expenditures is then apportioned between the statutory and residual groupings on the basis of the relative amounts of gross receipts from sales of small gasoline engines by X and Y that are related to the U.S. source sales income and foreign source royalty income, respectively.


(*3*) *Apportionment based on gross receipts.* After taking into account exclusive apportionment, X has $30,000x ($60,000x−$30,000x) of R&E expenditures that must be apportioned between the statutory and residual groupings. Under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, Y's gross receipts within the SIC code are taken into account in apportioning X's R&E expenditures. Although X has gross intangible income of $140,000x from domestic sales and $20,000x in royalties from Y, X's R&E expenditures are apportioned to that gross intangible income on the basis of the relative amounts of gross receipts arising from the sale of products by X and Y (and not the relative amounts of X's gross intangible income) in the statutory and residual groupings. Therefore, under paragraphs (d)(1) and (4) of this section $11,250x ($30,000x × $300,000x/($500,000x + $300,000x)) is apportioned to the statutory grouping of X's gross intangible income attributable to its license of intangible property to Y, or foreign source general category income. No portion of the gross receipts by X or Y are disregarded under section 864(e)(3), regardless of whether the income related to those sales is eligible for a deduction under section 250(a)(1)(A). The remaining $18,750x ($30,000x × $500,000x/($500,000x + $300,000x)) is apportioned to the residual grouping of gross intangible income, or U.S. source income.


(*4*) *Summary.* Accordingly, for purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation, $11,250x of X's R&E expenditures are apportioned to foreign source general category income, and $48,750x ($30,000x + $18,750x) of X's R&E expenditures are apportioned to U.S. source income.


(2) *Example 2: Controlled party and two products in same SIC code category*—(i) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section (the facts in *Example 1*), except that X also spends $30,000x in Year 1 for research on steam turbines, all of which is performed in the United States, and X has steam turbine gross receipts in the United States of $400,000x. X's foreign subsidiary Y neither manufactures nor sells steam turbines. The steam turbine research is in addition to the $60,000x in R&E expenditures incurred by X on gasoline engines for lawnmowers. X thus has $90,000x of R&E expenditures. X's gross income is $260,000x, of which $140,000x is U.S. source income from domestic sales of gasoline engines, $50,000x is U.S. source income from domestic sales of steam turbines, $40,000x is income included under section 951A all of which relates to foreign source income derived from Y's sales of gasoline engines, $20,000x is foreign source royalties from Y, and $10,000x is U.S. source interest income.


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Allocation.* X's R&E expenditures generate gross intangible income from sales of small gasoline engines and steam turbines. Both of these products are in the same three digit SIC code category, Engines and Turbines (SIC Industry Group 351). Therefore, under paragraph (a) of this section, X's R&E expenditures are definitely related to all items of gross intangible income attributable to SIC code category 351. These items of X's gross intangible income are gross income from the sale of small gasoline engines and steam turbines in the United States and royalties from foreign subsidiary Y, a foreign manufacturer and seller of small gasoline engines. X's U.S. source interest income and income included under section 951A is not within this class of gross intangible income and, therefore, no portion of X's R&E expenditures are allocated to the U.S. source interest income or income in the section 951A category.


(B) *Apportionment*—(*1*) *In general.* For purposes of applying this section to section 904 as the operative section, the statutory grouping of gross intangible income is foreign source general category income and the residual grouping of gross intangible income is U.S. source income.


(*2*) *Exclusive apportionment.* Under paragraph (c) of this section, because at least 50% of X's research and experimental activity was performed in the United States, 50% of the R&E expenditures, or $45,000x ($90,000x × 50%), are apportioned exclusively to the residual grouping of U.S. source gross intangible income. The remaining 50% of the R&E expenditures is then apportioned between the statutory and residual groupings on the basis of the relative amounts of gross receipts of small gasoline engines and steam turbines by X and Y with respect to which gross intangible income is foreign source general category income and U.S. source income.


(*3*) *Apportionment based on gross receipts.* After taking into account exclusive apportionment, X has $45,000x ($90,000x−$45,000x) of R&E expenditures that must be apportioned between the statutory and residual groupings. Although X has gross intangible income of $190,000x from domestic sales and $20,000x in royalties from Y, X's R&E expenditures are apportioned to that gross intangible income on the basis of the relative amounts of gross receipts arising from the sale of products by X and Y (and not the relative amounts of X's gross intangible income) in the statutory and residual groupings. Even though a portion of the R&E expenditures that must be apportioned are attributable to research performed with respect to steam turbines, and Y does not sell steam turbines, because Y is reasonably expected to license all intangible property related to SIC code category 351 from X, including intangible property related to steam turbines, under paragraphs (d)(1) and (4) of this section $11,250x ($45,000x × $300,000x/($500,000x + $400,000x + $300,000x)) is apportioned to the statutory grouping of gross intangible income, or foreign source general category income attributable to the royalty income to which the gross receipts of Y are related. The remaining $33,750x ($45,000x × ($500,000x + $400,000x)/($500,000x + $400,000x + $300,000x)) is apportioned to the residual grouping of gross intangible income, or U.S. source gross income.


(*4*) *Summary.* Accordingly, for purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation, $11,250x of X's R&E expenditures are apportioned to foreign source general category income and $78,750x ($45,000x + $33,750x) of X's R&E expenditures are apportioned to U.S. source income.


(3) *Example 3: Cost sharing arrangement*—(i) *Facts*—(A) *Acquisitions and transfers by X.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section (the facts in *Example 1*) except that, in Year 2, X and Y terminate the license for the manufacture of engines that was in place in Year 1 and enter into a cost sharing arrangement, in accordance with the provisions of § 1.482-7, to share the costs and risks of developing the intangible property related to the engines. Pursuant to the cost sharing arrangement, X has the exclusive rights to exploit the cost shared intangibles within the United States, and Y has the exclusive rights to exploit the cost shared intangibles outside the United States. X's and Y's shares of the reasonably anticipated benefits from the cost shared intangibles are 70% and 30%, respectively. In Year 2, Y makes a PCT Payment (as defined in § 1.482-7(b)(1)(ii)) of $50,000x that is characterized and sourced as a royalty for a license of small gasoline engine technology.


(B) *Gross receipts and R&E expenditures.* In Year 2, X and Y continue to sell gasoline engines, with gross receipts of $600,000x in the United States by X and $400,000x abroad by Y. X incurs intangible development costs associated with the cost shared intangibles of $100,000x in Year 2, which consist exclusively of research activities conducted in the United States. Y also makes a $30,000x CST Payment (as defined in § 1.482-7(b)(1)(i)) under the cost sharing arrangement. X is entitled to deduct $70,000x of its intangible development costs ($100,000x less the $30,000x CST Payment by Y) by reason of the second sentence under § 1.482-7(j)(3)(i) (relating to CST Payments).


(C) *Gross income of X.* In Year 2, X's gross income is $360,000x, of which $200,000x is U.S. source income from domestic sales of small gasoline engines, $50,000x is foreign source general category income attributable to the PCT Payment, $100,000x is income included under section 951A (all of which relates to foreign source income derived from engine sales by Y), and $10,000x is U.S. source interest income.


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Allocation.* The $70,000x of R&E expenditures incurred in Year 2 by X in connection with small gasoline engines are definitely related to the items of gross intangible income related to the SIC code category, namely gross income from the sale of small gasoline engines in the United States and PCT Payments from Y. Accordingly, under paragraph (a) of this section, the R&E expenditures are allocable to this class of gross intangible income. X's U.S. source interest income and income included under section 951A are not within this class of gross intangible income and, therefore, no portion of X's R&E expenditures is allocated to X's U.S. source interest income or section 951A category income.


(B) *Apportionment*—(*1*) *In general.* For purposes of applying this section to section 904 as the operative section, the statutory grouping of gross intangible income is foreign source general category income, and the residual grouping of gross intangible income is U.S. source income.


(*2*) *Exclusive apportionment.* Under paragraph (c) of this section, because at least 50% of X's research and experimentation in Year 2 was performed in the United States, 50% of the R&E expenditures, or $35,000x ($70,000x × 50%), is apportioned exclusively to the residual grouping of gross intangible income, U.S. source income.


(*3*) *Apportionment based on gross receipts.* Although X has gross intangible income of $200,000x from domestic sales and $50,000x as a PCT Payment from Y, X's R&E expenditures are apportioned to its gross intangible income on the basis of the relative amounts of gross receipts arising from the sale of products by X (and not the relative amounts of X's gross intangible income) in the statutory and residual groupings. Under paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section, because of the cost sharing arrangement, Y's gross receipts from sales are not taken into account in apportioning X's R&E expenditures that are intangible development costs with respect to the cost sharing arrangement. Because all of the gross receipts from sales that are taken into account under paragraph (d)(1) of this section relate to gross intangible income that is included in the residual grouping, $35,000x is apportioned to the residual grouping of gross intangible income, or U.S. source income.


(*4*) *Summary.* Accordingly, for purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation, $70,000x of X's R&E expenditures are apportioned to U.S. source income.


(4) *Example 4: Uncontrolled party*—(i) *Facts*—(A) *X's R&E expenditures.* X, a domestic corporation, is engaged in continuous research and experimentation to improve the quality of the products that it manufactures and sells, which are floodlights, flashlights, fuse boxes, and solderless connectors. All of these products are in the same three digit SIC code category, Electric Lighting and Wiring Equipment (SIC Industry Group 364). X incurs $100,000x of R&E expenditures in Year 1 that is performed exclusively in the United States. As a result of this research activity, X acquires patents that it uses in its own manufacturing activity.


(B) *License to Y and Z.* In Year 1, X licenses its floodlight patent to Y and Z, uncontrolled parties, for use in their own territories, Countries Y and Z, respectively. Y pays X a royalty of $3,000x plus $0.20x for each unit sold. Gross receipts from sales of floodlights by Y for the taxable year are $135,000x (30,000 units at $4.50x per unit), and the royalty is $9,000x ($3,000x + $0.20x/unit × 30,000 units). Y has sales of other products of $500,000x. Z pays X a royalty of $3,000x plus $0.30x for each unit sold. Z manufactures 30,000 floodlights in the taxable year, and the royalty is $12,000x ($3,000x + $0.30x/unit × 30,000 units). The dollar value of Z's gross receipts from floodlight sales is not known to X because, in this case, the floodlights are not sold separately by Z but are instead used as a component in Z's manufacture of lighting equipment for theaters. However, a reasonable estimate of Z's gross receipts attributable to the floodlights, based on the principles of section 482, is $120,000x. The gross receipts from sales of all Z's products, including the lighting equipment for theaters, are $1,000,000x. Because X has licensed its intangible property to Y and Z related to the SIC code, it is presumed to reasonably expect to license the intangible property that would be developed from the current research and experimentation.


(C) *X's gross receipts and gross income.* X's gross receipts from sales of floodlights for the taxable year are $500,000x and its sales of its other products (flashlights, fuse boxes, and solderless connectors) are $400,000x. X has gross income of $500,000x, consisting of U.S. source gross income from domestic sales of floodlights, flashlights, fuse boxes, and solderless connectors of $479,000x, and foreign source gross income from royalties of $9,000x and $12,000x from foreign corporations Y and Z, respectively. The royalty income is general category income to X under § 1.904-4(b)(2)(ii).


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Allocation.* X's R&E expenditures are definitely related to all of the gross intangible income from the products that it produces, which are floodlights, flashlights, fuse boxes, and solderless connectors. All of these products are in SIC code category 364. Therefore, under paragraph (b) of this section, X's R&E expenditures are definitely related to the class of gross intangible income related to SIC code category 364 and to all items of gross intangible income attributable to the class. These items of X's gross intangible income are gross income from the sale of floodlights, flashlights, fuse boxes, and solderless connectors in the United States and royalties from Corporations Y and Z.


(B) *Apportionment*—(*1*) *In general.* For purposes of applying this section to section 904 as the operative section, the statutory grouping of gross intangible income is foreign source general category income, and the residual grouping of gross intangible income is U.S. source income.


(*2*) *Exclusive apportionment.* Under paragraph (c) of this section, because at least 50% of X's research and experimentation was performed in the United States, 50% of the R&E expenditures, or $50,000x ($100,000x × 50%), is apportioned exclusively to the residual grouping of U.S. source gross intangible income.


(*3*) *Apportionment based on gross receipts.* After taking into account exclusive apportionment, X has $50,000x ($100,000x−$50,000x) of R&E expenditures that must be apportioned between the statutory and residual groupings. Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, gross receipts from sales of Y and Z are taken into account in apportioning X's R&E expenditures. Although X has gross intangible income of $479,000x from domestic sales and $21,000x in royalties from Y and Z, X's R&E expenditures are apportioned to its gross intangible income on the basis of the relative amounts of gross receipts arising from the sale of products by X, Y and Z (and not the relative amounts of X's gross intangible income) in the statutory and residual groupings. In addition, under paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section only the portion of Z's gross receipts that are attributable to the floodlights that incorporate the intangible property licensed from X, rather than Z's total gross receipts, are used for purposes of apportionment. All of X's gross receipts from sales in the entire SIC code category are included for purposes of apportionment on the basis of gross intangible income attributable to those sales. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, $11,039x ($50,000x × ($135,000x + $120,000x)/($900,000x + $135,000x + $120,000x)) is apportioned to the statutory grouping of gross intangible income, or foreign source general category income. The remaining $38,961x ($50,000x × $900,000x/($900,000x + $135,000x + $120,000x)) is apportioned to the residual grouping of gross intangible income, or U.S. source income.


(*4*) *Summary.* Accordingly, for purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation, $11,039x of X's R&E expenditures are apportioned to foreign source general category income and $88,961x ($50,000x + $38,961x) of X's R&E expenditures are apportioned to U.S. source income.


(5) *Example 5: Uncontrolled party and sublicense*—(i) *Facts.* X, a domestic corporation, is a cloud storage service provider. Cloud storage services are a service within the category, Computer Programming, Data Processing, and other Computer Related Services (SIC Industry Group 737). During Year 1, X incurs R&E expenditures of $50,000x to invent and copyright new storage monitoring and management software. All of the research and experimentation is performed in the United States. X uses this software in its own business to provide services to customers. X also licenses a version of the software that can be used by other businesses that provide cloud storage services. X licenses the software to uncontrolled party U, which sub-licenses the software to other businesses that provide cloud storage services to customers. U does not use the software except to sublicense it. As a part of the licensing agreement with U, U and its sub-licensees are only permitted to use the software in certain countries outside of the United States. Under the contract with U, U pays X a royalty of 50% on the amount it receives from its sub-licensees that use the software to provide services to customers. Because X has licensed its intangible property to U related to the SIC code and U has sublicensed it to other businesses, it is presumed that X is reasonably expected to license the intangible property that would be developed from its current research and experimentation to U and that U would sublicense it to other businesses. In Year 1, X earns $300,000x of gross receipts from providing cloud storage services within the United States. Further, in Year 1 U receives $10,000x of royalty income from its sub-licensees and pays a royalty of $5,000x to X. Thus, X earns $300,000x of U.S. source general category gross income and also earns $5,000x of foreign source general category royalty income from licensing its software to U for use outside of the United States.


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Allocation.* The R&E expenditures were incurred in connection with the development of cloud computing software and they are definitely related to the items of gross intangible income related to the SIC Code category, namely gross income from the storage monitoring and management software in the United States and royalties received from U. Accordingly, under paragraph (b) of this section, the R&E expenditures are allocable to this class of gross intangible income.


(B) *Apportionment*—(*1*) *In general.* For purposes of applying this section to section 904 as the operative section, the statutory grouping of gross intangible income is foreign source general category income, and the residual grouping of gross intangible income is U.S. source income.


(*2*) *Exclusive apportionment.* Under paragraph (c) of this section, because at least 50% of X's research and experimental activity was performed in the United States, 50% of the R&E expenditures, or $25,000x ($50,000x × 50%), is apportioned exclusively to the residual grouping of U.S. source gross intangible income.


(*3*) *Apportionment based on gross receipts*—(*i*) *In general.* After taking into account exclusive apportionment, X has $25,000x ($50,000x−$25,000x) of R&E expenditures that must be apportioned between the statutory and residual groupings. Because X has licensed its intangible property related to the SIC code to U and U has licensed it to the sub-licensees, under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, gross receipts from sales of U's sublicensees are taken into account in apportioning X's R&E expenditures. Although X has gross intangible income of $300,000x from domestic sales of services and $5,000x in royalties from U, X's R&E expenditures are apportioned to its gross intangible income on the basis of the relative amounts of gross receipts arising from the sale of services by X and U's sub-licensees (and not the relative amounts of X's gross intangible income) in the statutory and residual groupings.


(*ii*) *Determination of U's sub-licensee's gross receipts.* Under paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section, X can make a reasonable estimate of the gross receipts of U's sub-licensees from services incorporating the intangible property licensed by X by estimating, after an appropriate economic analysis, that U would charge a royalty of 5% of the sub-licensee's sales. U received a royalty of $10,000x from the sub-licensees. X then determines U's sub-licensees' foreign sales by dividing the total royalty payments received by U by the royalty estimated rate ($10,000x/.05 = $200,000x).


(*iii*) *Results of apportionment based on gross receipts.* Therefore, under paragraphs (d)(1) and (3) of this section, $10,000x ($25,000x × $200,000x/($300,000x + $200,000x)) is apportioned to the statutory grouping of gross intangible income, or foreign source general category income. The remaining $15,000x ($25,000x × $300,000x/($300,000x + $200,000x)) is apportioned to the residual grouping of gross intangible income, or U.S. source income.


(*4*) *Summary.* Accordingly, for purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation, $10,000x of X's R&E expenditures are apportioned to foreign source general category income and $40,000x ($25,000x + $15,000x) of X's R&E expenditures are apportioned to U.S. source income.


(6) *Example 6: Foreign branch*—(i) *Facts*—(A) *Overview for X.* X, a domestic corporation, owns FDE, a disregarded entity that is a foreign branch within the meaning of § 1.904-4(f)(3)(vii). FDE conducts activities solely in Country Y. FDE's functional currency is the U.S. dollar. X is a manufacturer and distributor of small gasoline engines for lawnmowers in the United States. Gasoline engines are a product within the category, Engines and Turbines (SIC Industry Group 351). FDE also manufactures and distributes small gasoline engines but only in Country Y. During Year 1, X incurred R&E expenditures of $60,000x, which it deducts under section 174 as a current expense, to invent and patent a new and improved gasoline engine. All of the research and experimentation was performed in the United States. Also in Year 1, the domestic gross receipts of X from gasoline engines total $500,000x. X provides technology for the manufacture of engines to FDE through a license. FDE compensates X for the technology with an arm's length royalty payment of $10,000x, which is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes.


(B) *Overview for FDE.* FDE accrues and records on its books and records $100,000x of gross income from sales of gasoline engines to unrelated persons. FDE's gross income is non-passive category income and is foreign source income. In Year 1, the foreign gross receipts of FDE from sales of gasoline engines total $300,000x. The disregarded royalty payment from FDE to X is not recorded on FDE's separate books and records (as adjusted to conform to Federal income tax principles) within the meaning of paragraph § 1.904-4(f)(2)(i) because it is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes. However, the $10,000x disregarded royalty payment would be allocable to foreign source gross income attributable to FDE under § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi)(B)(*1*)(*ii*). Therefore, under § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi)(A) the amount of foreign source gross income attributable to FDE is adjusted downwards and the amount of foreign source gross income attributable to X is adjusted upward to take the $10,000x disregarded royalty payment into account.


(C) *Assignment of X's gross income to separate categories.* In Year 1, X has U.S. source general category gross income of $140,000x from domestic sales of gasoline engines. After application of § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi)(A) to the disregarded payment made by FDE, X has $10,000x of foreign source general category gross income and X also has $90,000x of foreign source foreign branch category gross income.


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Allocation.* The R&E expenditures were incurred in connection with developing intangible property related to small gasoline engines and are definitely related to the items of gross intangible income related to the SIC code category 351, namely gross income from the sale of small gasoline engines in both the United States and Country Y.


(B) *Apportionment*—(*1*) *In general.* For purposes of applying this section to section 904 as the operative section, the statutory groupings of gross intangible income are foreign source general category income and foreign source foreign branch category income, and the residual grouping of gross intangible income is U.S. source income.


(*2*) *Exclusive apportionment.* Under paragraph (c) of this section, because at least 50% of X's research and experimental activity was performed in the United States, 50% of the R&E expenditures, or $30,000 ($60,000x × 50%), is apportioned exclusively to the residual grouping of U.S. source gross intangible income. The remaining 50% of the R&E expenditures is then apportioned between the statutory and residual groupings on the basis of the relative amounts of gross receipts from sales of small gasoline engines that are related to U.S. source income, foreign source general category income, and foreign source foreign branch category income.


(*3*) *Apportionment based on gross receipts.* After taking into account exclusive apportionment, X has $30,000x ($60,000x−$30,000x) of R&E expenditures that must be apportioned between the statutory and residual groupings. Because X's gross intangible income is not described in paragraph (d)(3) or (4) of this section (that is, there is no gross intangible income related to sales, leases or services from controlled or uncontrolled parties that are incorporating intangible property that was licensed, sold, or transferred to controlled or uncontrolled parties), the groupings to which the taxpayer's gross receipts and gross intangible income are assigned is the same. However, because the assignment of X's gross income to the foreign branch and general categories is made by taking into account disregarded payments under § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi), the assignment of gross receipts between the general category and foreign branch category must be determined by making similar adjustments to X's gross receipts under the principles of § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi). See paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section. Foreign gross receipts of FDE from gasoline engines total $300,000x. However, those gross receipts are adjusted under the principles of § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi) for purposes of apportioning the remaining R&E expenditures by reducing the gross receipts initially assigned to the foreign branch category by an amount equal to the ratio of the royalty income to FDE's gross income that is initially assigned to the foreign branch category. Accordingly, since the disregarded royalty payment of $10,000x caused an adjustment equal to 10% of FDE's initial gross income of $100,000x, 10% of the gross receipts or $30,000x (10% × $300,000x) are similarly assigned to the grouping of foreign source general category income, and the remaining $270,000x of gross receipts are assigned to the grouping of foreign source foreign branch category income. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, $1,125x ($30,000x × $30,000x/($500,000x + $270,000x + $30,000x)) is apportioned to the statutory grouping of X's gross intangible income attributable to foreign source general category income. $10,125x ($30,000x × $270,000x/($500,000x + $270,000x + $30,000x)) is apportioned to the statutory grouping of X's foreign source foreign branch category income. The remaining $18,750x ($30,000x × $500,000x/($500,000x + $270,000x + $30,000x)) is apportioned to the residual grouping of gross intangible income or U.S. source income.


(7) *Example 7: Indirectly derived gross intangible income*—(i) *Facts.* P, a domestic corporation, develops and publishes an internet website that persons use (referred to as “users” and collectively referred to as “user base”) without a fee. P incurs R&E expenditures to update software code and write new software code to maintain the website and develop new products that are incorporated into the website. P's activities consist of services that fall within SIC code category 737 (computer programming, data processing, and other computer related services). P sells space on its website for businesses to advertise to its user base in exchange for a fee. P's technology allows it to collect data on users and to use that data to effectively target advertisements. P does not grant rights to the technology or other intangible property to the businesses advertising on its website. In Year 1, P incurs R&E expenditures of $60,000x, which it deducts under section 174. All the research and experimentation is performed in the United States. Also in Year 1, P earns gross receipts of $200,000x from the sale of advertisements, all of which gives rise to U.S. source gross income.


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Allocation.* The R&E expenditures were incurred in connection with developing intangible property used for P's website. Accordingly, they are definitely related and allocable to gross intangible income derived directly or indirectly (in whole or in part) from that intangible property. Because P's advertising sales are dependent on the users attracted to its website, P's gross income from advertising is indirectly derived from intangible property and is included in gross intangible income. Accordingly, under paragraph (b) of this section, the R&E expenditures are allocable to the class of gross intangible income related to SIC code category 737, which consists of U.S. source income.


(B) *Apportionment.* Because all gross receipts from services that the intangible property directly or indirectly benefits result in U.S. source income, no apportionment is required.


(h) *Applicability date.* This section applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2019. However, taxpayers may choose to apply this section to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and before January 1, 2020, provided they apply this section in its entirety and for any subsequent year beginning before January 1, 2020.
