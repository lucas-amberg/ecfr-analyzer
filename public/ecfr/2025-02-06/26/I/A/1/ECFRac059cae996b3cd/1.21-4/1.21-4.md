# § 1.21-4   Payments to certain related individuals.

(a) *In general.* A credit is not allowed under section 21 for any amount paid by the taxpayer to an individual—


(1) For whom a deduction under section 151(c) (relating to deductions for personal exemptions for dependents) is allowable either to the taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse for the taxable year;


(2) Who is a child of the taxpayer (within the meaning of section 152(f)(1) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004, and section 151(c)(3) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2005) and is under age 19 at the close of the taxable year;


(3) Who is the spouse of the taxpayer at any time during the taxable year; or


(4) Who is the parent of the taxpayer's child who is a qualifying individual described in § 1.21-1(b)(1)(i) or (b)(2)(i).


(b) *Payments to partnerships or other entities.* In general, paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to services performed by partnerships or other entities. If, however, the partnership or other entity is established or maintained primarily to avoid the application of paragraph (a) of this section to permit the taxpayer to claim the credit, for purposes of section 21, the payments of employment-related expenses are treated as made directly to each partner or owner in proportion to that partner's or owner's ownership interest. Whether a partnership or other entity is established or maintained to avoid the application of paragraph (a) of this section is determined based on the facts and circumstances, including whether the partnership or other entity is established for the primary purpose of caring for the taxpayer's qualifying individual or providing household services to the taxpayer.


(c) *Examples.* The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples:
