# § 1.25-2T   Amount of credit (Temporary).

(a) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided, the amount of the credit allowable for any taxable year to an individual who holds a qualified mortgage credit certificate is equal to the product of the certificate credit rate (as defined in paragraph (b)) and the amount of the interest paid or accrued by the taxpayer during the taxable year on the certified indebtedness amount (as defined in paragraph (c)).


(b) *Certificate credit rate*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of §§ 1.25-1T through 1.25-8T, the term “certificate credit rate” means the rate specified by the issuer on the mortgage credit certificate. The certificate credit rate shall not be less than 10 percent nor more than 50 percent.


(2) *Limitation in certain States.* (i) In the case of a State which—


(A) Has a State ceiling for the calendar year in which an election is made that exceeds 20 percent of the average annual aggregate principal amount of mortgages executed during the immediately preceding 3 calendar years for single-family owner-occupied residences located within the jurisdiction of such State, or


(B) Issued qualified mortgage bonds in an aggregate amount less than $150 million for calendar year 1983.


(ii) The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (b)(2):


(c) *Certified indebtedness amount*—(1) *In general.* The term “certified indebtedness amount” means the amount of indebtedness which is—


(i) Incurred by the taxpayer—


(A) To acquire his principal residence, § 1.25-2T(c)(1)(i),


(B) As a qualified home improvement loan, or


(C) As a qualified rehabilitation loan, and


(ii) Specified in the mortgage credit certificate.


(2) *Example.* The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph:


(d) *Limitation on credit*—(1) *Limitation where certificate credit rate exceeds 20 percent.* (i) If the certificate credit rate of any mortgage credit certificate exceeds 20 percent, the amount of the credit allowed to the taxpayer by section 25(a)(1) for any year shall not exceed $2,000. Any amount denied under this paragraph (d)(1) may not be carried forward under section 25(e)(1) and paragraph (d)(2) of this section.


(ii) If two or more persons hold interests in any residence, the limitation of paragraph (d)(1)(i) shall be allocated among such persons in proporation to their respective interests in the residence.


(2) *Carryforward of unused credit.* (i) If the credit allowable under section 25 (a) and § 1.25-2T for any taxable year exceeds the applicable tax limit for that year, the excess (the “unused credit”) will be a carryover to each of the 3 succeeding taxable years and, subject to the limitations of paragraph (d)(2)(ii), will be added to the credit allowable by section 25 (a) and § 1.25-2T for that succeeding year.


(ii) The amount of the unused credit for any taxable year (the “unused credit year”) which may be taken into account under this paragraph (d)(2) for any subsequent taxable year may not exceed the amount by which the applicable tax limit for that subsequent taxable year exceeds the sum of (A) the amount of the credit allowable under section 25 (a) and § 1.25-1T for the current taxable year, and (B) the sum of the unused credits which, by reason of this paragraph (d)(2), are carried to that subsequent taxable year and are attributable to taxable years before the unused credit year. Thus, if by reason of this paragraph (d)(2), unused credits from 2 prior taxable years are carried forward to a subsequent taxable year, the unused credit from the earlier of those 2 prior years must be taken into account before the unused credit from the later of those 2 years is taken into account.


(iii) For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2) the term “applicable tax limit” means the limitation imposed by section 26 (a) for the taxable year reduced by the sum of the credits allowable for that year under section 21, relating to expenses for household and dependent care services necessary for gainful employment, section 22, relating to the credit for the elderly and the permanently disabled, section 23, relating to the residential energy credit, and section 24, relating to contributions to candidates for public office. The limitation imposed by section 26 (a) for any taxable year is equal to the taxpayer's tax liability (as defined in section 26 (b)) for that year.


(iv) The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (d)(2):
