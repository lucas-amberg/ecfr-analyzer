# § 1.25-4T   Qualified mortgage credit certificate program (Temporary).

(a) *In general*—(1) *Definition of qualified mortgage credit certificate program.* For purposes of §§ 1.25-1T through 1.25-8T, the term “qualified mortgage credit certificate program” means a program to issue qualified mortgage credit certificates which meets all of the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section.


(2) *Requirements are a minimum.* Except as otherwise provided in this section, the requirements of this section are minimum requirements. Issuers may establish more stringent criteria for participation in a qualified mortgage credit certificate program. Thus, for example, an issuer may target 30 percent of the proceeds of an issue of mortgage credit certificates to targeted areas. Further, issuers may establish additional eligibility criteria for participation in a qualified mortgage credit certificate program. Thus, for example, issuers may impose an income limitation designed to ensure that only those individuals who could not otherwise purchase a residence will benefit from the credit.


(3) Except as otherwise provided in this section and § 1.25-3T, issuers may use mortgage credit certificates in connection with other Federal, State, and local programs provided that such use complies with the requirements of § 1.25-3T(j). Thus, for example, a mortgage credit certificate may be issued in connection with the qualified rehabilitation of a residence part of the cost of which will be paid from the proceeds of a State grant.


(b) *Establishment of program.* A program meets the requirements of this paragraph only if it is established by a State or political subdivision thereof for any calendar year for which it has the authority to issue qualified mortgage bonds.


(c) *Election not to issue qualified mortgage bonds*—(1) *In general.* A program meets the requirements of this paragraph only if the issuer elects, in the time and manner specified in this paragraph, not to issue an amount of qualified mortgage bonds that it may otherwise issue during the calendar year under section 103A and the regulations thereunder.


(2) *Manner of making election.* On or before the earlier of the date of distribution of mortgage credit certificates under a program or December 31, 1987, the issuer must file an election not to issue an amount of qualified mortgage bonds. The election (and the certification (or affidavit) described in paragraph (d)) shall be filed with the Internal Revenue Service Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19255. The election should be titled “Mortgage Credit Certificate Election” and must include—


(i) The name, address, and TIN of the issuer,


(ii) The issuer's applicable limit, as defined in section 103A (g) and the regulations thereunder,


(iii) The aggregate amount of qualified mortgage bonds issued by the issuing authority during the calendar year,


(iv) The amount of the issuer's applicable limit that it has surrendered to other issuers during the calendar year,


(v) The date and amount of any previous elections under this paragraph for the calendar year, and


(vi) The amount of qualfied mortgage bonds that the issuer elects not to issue.


(3) *Revocation of election.* Any election made under this paragraph may be revoked, in whole or in part, at any time during the calendar year in which the election was made. The revocation, however, may not be made with respect to any part of the nonissued bond amount that has been used to issue mortgage credit certificates pursuant to the election. The revocation shall be filed with the Internal Revenue Service Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19255. The revocation should be titled “Revocation of Mortgage Credit Certificate Election” and must include—


(i) The name, address, and TIN of the issuer,


(ii) The nonissued bond amount as originally elected, and


(iii) The portion of the nonissued bond amount with respect to which the election is being revoked.


(4) *Special rule.* If at the time that an issuer makes an election under this paragraph it does not know its applicable limit, the issuer may elect not to use all of its remaining authority to issue qualified mortgage bonds; this form of election will be treated as meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) if, prior to the later of the end of the calendar year and December 31, 1985, the issuer amends its election so as to indicate the exact amount of qualified mortgage bond authority that it elected not to issue.


(5) *Limitation on nonissued bond amount.* The amount of qualified mortgage bonds which an issuer elects not to issue may not exceed the issuer's applicable limit (as determined under section 103A (g) and the regulations thereunder). For example, a governmental unit that, pursuant to section 103A (g)(3), may issue $10 million of qualified mortgage bonds that elects to trade in $11 million in qualified mortgage bond authority has not met the requirements of this paragraph, and mortgage credit certificates issued pursuant to such election are not qualified mortgage credit certificates.


(d) *State certification requirement*—(1) *In general.* A program meets the requirements of this paragraph only if the State official designated by law (or, where there is no State official, the Governor) certifies, based on facts and circumstances as of the date on which the certification is requested, following a request for such certification, that the issue meets the requirements of section 103A(g) (relating to volume limitation) and the regulations thereunder. A copy of the State certification must be attached to the issuer's election not to issue qualified mortgage bonds, except that, in the case of elections made during calendar year 1984, the certification may be filed with the Service prior to July 8, 1985 provided that mortgage credit certificates may not be distributed until the certification is filed. In the case of any constitutional home rule city, the certification shall be made by the chief executive officer of the city.


(2) *Certification procedure.* The official making the certification described in this paragraph (d) need not perform an independent investigation to determine whether the issuer has met the requirements of section 103A(g). In determining the aggregate amount of qualified mortgage bonds previously issued by that issuer during the calendar year the official may rely on copies of prior elections under paragraph (c) of this section made by the issuer for that year, together with an affidavit executed by an official of the issuer who is responsible for issuing bonds stating that the issuer has not, to date, issued any other issues of qualified mortgage bonds during the calendar year and stating the amount, if any, of the issuer's applicable limit that it has surrendered to other issuers during the calendar year; for any calendar year prior to 1985, the official may rely on an affidavit executed by a duly authorized official of the issuer who states the aggregate amount of qualified mortgage bonds issued by the issuer during the year. In determining the aggregate amount of qualified mortgage bonds that the issuer has previously elected not to issue during that calendar year, the official may rely on copies of any elections not to issue qualified mortgage bonds filed by the issuer for that calendar year, together with an affidavit executed by an official of the issuer responsible for issuing mortgage credit certificates stating that the issuer has not, to date, made any other elections not to issue qualified mortgage bonds. If, based on such information, the certifying official determines that the issuer has not, as of the date on which the certification is provided, exceeded its applicable limit for the year, the official may certify that the issue meets the requirements of section 103A(g). The fact that the certification described in this paragraph (d) is provided does not ensure that the issuer has met the requirements of section 103A(g) and the regulations thereunder, nor does it preclude the application of the penalty for over-issuance of mortgage credit certificates if such over-issuance actually occurs. See § 1.25-5T.


(3) *Special rule.* If within 30 days after the issuer files a proper request for the certification described in this paragraph (d) the issuer has not received from the State official designated by law (or, if there is no State official, the Governor) certification that the issue meets the requirements of section 103A(g) or, in the alternative, a statement that the issue does not meet such requirements, the issuer may submit, in lieu of the certification required by this paragraph (d), an affidavit executed by an officer of the issuer responsible for issuing mortgage credit certificates stating that—


(i) The issue meets the requirements of section 103A(g) and the regulations thereunder,


(ii) At least 30 days before the execution of the affidavit the issuer filed a proper request for the certification described in this paragraph (d), and


(iii) The State official designated by law (or, if there is no State official, the Governor) has not provided the certification described in this paragraph (d) or a statement that the issue does not meet such requirements.


(e) *Information reporting requirement*—(1) *Reports.* With respect to mortgage credit certificates issued after September 30, 1985, a program meets the requirements of this paragraph only if the issuer submits a report containing the information concerning the holders of certificates issued during the preceding reporting period required by this paragraph. The report must be filed for each reporting period in which certificates (other than transferred certificates) are issued under the program. The issuer is not responsible for false information provided by a holder if the issuer did not know or have reason to know that the information was false. The report must be filed on the form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service. If no form is prescribed, or if the form prescribed is not readily available, the issuer may use its own form provided that such form is in the format set forth in this paragraph and contains the information required by this paragraph. The report must be titled “Mortgage Credit Certificate Information Report” and must include the name, address, and TIN of the issuer, the reporting period for which the information is provided, and the following tables containing information concerning the holders of certificates issued during the reporting period for which the report is filed: 


(i) A table titled “Number of Mortgage Credit Certificates by Income and Acquisition Cost” showing the number of mortgage credit certificates issued (other than those issued in connection with qualified home improvement and rehabilitation loans) according to the annualized gross income of the holders (categorized in the following intervals of income:


(A) The aggregate amount of fees charged to holders to cover any administrative costs incurred by the issuer in issuing mortgage credit certificates, and 


(B) The number of holders that—


(*1*) Did not have a present ownership interest in a principal residence at any time during the 3-year period ending on the date the mortgage credit certificate is executed (*i.e.,* satisfied the 3-year requirement) and purchased residences in targeted areas, 


(*2*) Satisfied the 3-year requirement and purchased residences not located in targeted areas, 


(*3*) Did have a present ownership interest in a principal residence at any time during the 3-year period ending on the date the mortgage credit certificate is executed (*i.e.,* did not satisfy the 3-year requirement) and purchased residences in targeted areas, and


(*4*) Did not satisfy the 3-year requirement and purchased residences not located in targeted areas.


(ii) A table titled “Volume of Mortgage Credit Certificates by Income and Acquisition Cost” containing data on—


(A) The total of the certified indebtedness amounts of the certificates issued (other than those issued in connection with qualified home improvement and rehabilitation loans);


(B) The sum of the products of the certified indebtedness amount and the certificate credit rate for each certificate (other than those issued in connection with qualified home improvement and rehabilitation loans) according to annualized gross income (categorized in the same intervals of income as the preceding table) and according to the acquisition cost of the residences acquired in connection with mortgage credit certificates (categorized in the same intervals of acquisition cost as the preceding table); and


(C) For each interval of income and acquisition cost, the information described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) (A) and (B) categorized according to the holders that—


(*1*) Satisfied the 3-year requirement and purchased residences in targeted areas,


(*2*) Satisfied the 3-year requirement and purchased residences not located in targeted areas,


(*3*) Did not satisfy the 3-year requirement and purchased residences in targeted areas, and


(*4*) Did not satisfy the 3-year requirement and purchased residences not located in targeted areas.


(iii) A table titled “Mortgage Credit Certificates for Qualified Home Improvement and Rehabilitation Loans” showing the number of mortgage credit certificates issued in connection with qualified home improvement loans and qualified rehabilitation loans, the total of the certified indebtedness amount with respect to such certificates, and the sum of the products of the certified indebtedness amount and the certificate credit rate for each certificate; the information contained in the table must also be categorized according to whether the residences with respect to which the certificates were provided are located in targeted areas.


(2) *Format.* If no form is prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, or if the prescribed form is not readily available, the issuer must submit the report in the format specified in this paragraph (e)(2). The specified format of the report is the following:


(3) *Definitions and special rules.* (i) For purposes of this paragraph the term “annualized gross income” means the borrower's gross monthly income multiplied by 12. Gross monthly income is the sum of monthly gross pay, any additional income from investments, pensions, Veterans Administration (VA) compensation, part-time employment, bonuses, dividends, interest, current overtime pay, net rental income, etc., and other income (such as alimony and child support, if the borrower chooses to disclose such income). Information with respect to gross monthly income may be obtained from available loan documents, e.g., the sum of lines 23D and 23E on the Application for VA or FmHA Home Loan Guaranty or for HUD/FHA Insured Mortgage (VA Form 26-1802a, HUD 92900, Jan. 1982), or the total line from the Gross Monthly Income section of FHLMC Residential Loan Application form (FHLMC 65 Rev. 8/78).


(ii) For purposes of this paragraph, the term “reporting period” means each one year period beginning July 1 and ending June 30, except that issuers need not provide data with respect to the period prior to October 1, 1985.


(iii) For purposes of this paragraph, verification of information concerning a holder's gross monthly income by utilizing other available information concerning the holder's income (e.g., Federal income tax returns) is not required. In determining whether the holder of a mortgage credit certificate acquiring a residence in a targeted area satisfies the 3-year requirement, the issuer may rely on a statement signed by the holder.


(4) *Time for filing.* The report required by this paragraph shall be filed not later than the 15th day of the second calendar month after the close of the reporting period. The Commissioner may grant an extension of time for the filing of a report required by this paragraph if there is reasonable cause for the failure to file such report in a timely fashion. The report may be filed at any time before such date but must be complete based on facts and reasonable expectations as of the date the report is filed. The report need not be amended to reflect information learned subsequent to the date of filing, or to reflect changed circumstances with respect to any holder. 


(5) *Place for filing.* The report required by this paragraph is to be filed at the Internal Revenue Service Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19255.


(f) *Policy statement.* A program established pursuant to an election under paragraph (c) made after 1984 meets the requirements of this paragraph only if the applicable elected representative of the governmental unit—


(1) Which is the issuer, or


(2) On whose behalf the certificates were issued,


(g) *Targeted areas requirement*—(1) *In general.* A program meets the requirements of this paragraph only if—


(i) The portion of the total proceeds of the issue specified in paragraph (g)(2) is made available to provide mortgage credit certificates in connection with owner financing of targeted area residents for at least 1 year after the date on which mortgage credit certificates are first made available with respect to targeted area residences, and


(ii) The issuer attempts with reasonable diligence to place such proceeds with qualified persons.


(2) *Specified portion.* (i) The specified portion of the total proceeds of an issue is the lesser of—


(A) 20 percent of the total proceeds, or


(B) 8 percent of the average annual aggregate principal amount of mortgages executed during the immediately preceding 3 calendar years for single-family, owner-occupied residences in targeted areas within the jurisdiction of the issuing authority.


(ii) See § 1.25-1T(b)(10)(ii) for the definition of “total proceeds”.


(h) *Fees*—(1) *In general.* A program meets the requirements of this paragraph only if each applicant is required to pay, directly or indirectly, no fee other than those fees permitted under this paragraph.


(2) *Permissible fees.* Applicants may be required to pay the following fees provided that they are reasonable:


(i) Points, origination fees, servicing fees, and other fees in amounts that are customarily charged with respect to mortgages not provided in connection with mortgage credit certificates,


(ii) Application fees, survey fees, credit report fees, insurance fees, or similar settlement or financing costs to the extent such amounts do not exceed the amounts charged in the area in cases where mortgages are not provided in connection with mortgage credit certificates. For example, amounts charged for FHA, VA, or similar private mortgage insurance on an individual's mortgage are permissible so long as such amounts do not exceed the amounts charged in the area with respect to a similar mortgage that is not provided in connection with a mortgage credit certificate, and


(iii) Other fees that, taking into account all the facts and circumstances, are reasonably necessary to cover any administrative costs incurred by the issuer or its agent in issuing mortgage credit certificates.


(i) *Qualified mortgage credit certificate.* A program meets the requirements of this paragraph only if each mortgage credit certificate issued under the program meets each of the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (o) of § 1.25-3T.


(j) *Good faith compliance efforts*—(1) *Eligibility requirements.* (i) A program under which each of the mortgage credit certificates issued does not meet each of the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (o) of § 1.25-3T shall be treated as meeting the requirements of paragraph (i) of this section if each of the requirements of this paragraph (j)(1) is satisfied. A mortgage credit certificate program meets the requirements of this paragraph (j)(1) only if each of the following provisions is met:


(A) The issuer in good faith attempted to issue mortgage credit certificates only to individuals meeting each of the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (o) of § 1.25-3T. Good faith requires that agreements with lenders and agents and other relevant instruments contain restrictions that permit the approval of mortgage credit certificates only in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (o) of § 1.25-3T. In addition, the issuer must establish reasonable procedures to ensure compliance with those requirements. Reasonable procedures include reasonable investigations by the issuer to determine whether individuals satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (o) of § 1.25-3T.


(B) 95 percent or more of the total proceeds of the issue were devoted to individuals with respect to whom, at the time that the certificate was issued, all the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (o) of § 1.25-3T were met. If a holder of a mortgage credit certificate fails to meet more than one of these requirements, the amount of the certificate (*i.e.,* the certificate credit rate multiplied by the certified indebtedness amount) issued to that individual will be taken into account only once in determining whether the 95-percent requirement is met. However, all of the defects in that individual's certificate must be corrected pursuant to paragraph (j)(1)(i)(C).


(C) Any failure to meet the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (o) of § 1.25-3T is corrected within a reasonable period after that failure is discovered. For example, if an individual fails to meet one or more of such requirements those failures can be corrected by revoking that individual's certificate.


(ii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (j)(1):


(2) *Program requirements.* (i) A mortgage credit certificate program which fails to meet one or more of the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section shall be treated as meeting such requirements if the requirements of this paragraph (j)(2) are satisfied. A mortgage credit certificate program meets the requirements of this paragraph (j)(2) only if each of the following provisions is met:


(A) The issuer in good faith attempted to meet all of the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section. This good faith requirement will be met if all reasonable steps are taken by the issuer to ensure that the program complies with these requirements.


(B) Any failure to meet such requirements is due to inadvertent error, e.g., mathematical error, after taking reasonable steps to comply with such requirements.


(ii) The following example illustrate the application of this paragraph (j)(2):
