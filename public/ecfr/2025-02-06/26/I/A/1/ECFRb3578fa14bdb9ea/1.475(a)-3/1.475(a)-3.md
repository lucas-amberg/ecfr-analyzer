(2) A dealer in securities acquires a security that is subject to section 475(a) and the dealer's basis in the security is determined, in whole or in part, by reference to other property held at any time by the dealer. 


(b) *Rules.* If this section applies to a security—


(1) Section 475(a) applies only to changes in value of the security occurring after the acquisition; and
