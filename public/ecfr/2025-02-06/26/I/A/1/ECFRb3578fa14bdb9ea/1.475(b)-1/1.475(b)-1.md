# § 1.475(b)-1   Scope of exemptions from mark-to-market requirement.

(a) *Securities held for investment or not held for sale.* Except as otherwise provided by this section and subject to the identification requirements of section 475(b)(2), a security is held for investment (within the meaning of section 475(b)(1)(A)) or not held for sale (within the meaning of section 475(b)(1)(B)) if it is not held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business. 


(b) *Securities deemed identified as held for investment*—(1) *In general.* The following items held by a dealer in securities are per se held for investment within the meaning of section 475(b)(1)(A) and are deemed to be properly identified as such for purposes of section 475(b)(2)—


(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, stock in a corporation, or a partnership or beneficial ownership interest in a widely held or publicly traded partnership or trust, to which the taxpayer has a relationship specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or 


(ii) A contract that is treated for federal income tax purposes as an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract (see sections 72, 817, and 7702). 


(2) *Relationships*—(i) *General rule.* The relationships specified in this paragraph (b)(2) are—


(A) Those described in section 267(b) (2), (3), (10), (11), or (12); or 


(B) Those described in section 707(b)(1)(A) or (B). 


(ii) *Attribution.* The relationships described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section are determined taking into account sections 267(c) and 707(b)(3), as appropriate. 


(iii) *Trusts treated as partnerships.* For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), the phrase partnership or trust is substituted for the word *partnership* in sections 707(b) (1) and (3), and a reference to beneficial ownership interest is added to each reference to capital interest or profits interest in those sections. 


(3) *Securities traded on certain established financial markets.* Paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section does not apply to a security if—


(i) The security is actively traded within the meaning of § 1.1092(d)-1(a) taking into account only established financial markets identified in § 1.1092(d)-1(b)(1) (i) or (ii) (describing national securities exchanges and interdealer quotation systems); 


(ii) Less than 15 percent of all of the outstanding shares or interests in the same class are held by the taxpayer and all persons having a relationship to the taxpayer that is specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and 


(iii) If the security was acquired (e.g., on original issue) from a person having a relationship to the taxpayer that is specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, then, after the time the security was acquired—


(A) At least one full business day has passed; and 


(B) There has been significant trading involving persons not having a relationship to the taxpayer that is specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. 


(4) *Changes in status*—(i) *Onset of prohibition against marking.* (A) Once paragraph (b)(1) of this section begins to apply to the security and for so long as it continues to apply, section 475(a) does not apply to the security in the hands of the taxpayer. 


(B) If a security has not been timely identified under section 475(b)(2) and, after the last day on which such an identification would have been timely, paragraph (b)(1) of this section begins to apply to the security, then the dealer must recognize gain or loss on the security as if it were sold for its fair market value as of the close of business of the last day before paragraph (b)(1) of this section begins to apply to the security, and gain or loss is taken into account at that time. 


(ii) *Termination of prohibition against marking.* If a taxpayer did not timely identify a security under section 475(b)(2), and paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies to the security on the last day on which such an identification would have been timely but thereafter ceases to apply—


(A) An identification of the security under section 475(b)(2) is timely if made on or before the close of the day paragraph (b)(1) of this section ceases to apply; and 


(B) Unless the taxpayer timely identifies the security under section 475(b)(2) (taking into account the additional time for identification that is provided by paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section), section 475(a) applies to changes in value of the security after the cessation in the same manner as under section 475(b)(3). 


(iii) *Examples.* These examples illustrate this paragraph (b)(4):


(c) *Securities deemed not held for investment; dealers in notional principal contracts and derivatives.* (1) Except as otherwise determined by the Commissioner in a revenue ruling, revenue procedure, or letter ruling, section 475(b)(1)(A) (exempting from mark-to-market accounting certain securities that are held for investment) does not apply to a security if—


(i) The security is described in section 475(c)(2) (D) or (E) (describing certain notional principal contracts and derivative securities); and 


(ii) The taxpayer is a dealer in such securities. 


(2) See § 1.475(d)-1(b) for a rule concerning the character of gain or loss on securities described in this paragraph (c). 


(d) *Special rule for hedges of another member's risk.* A taxpayer may identify under section 475(b)(1)(C) (exempting certain hedges from mark-to-market accounting) a security that hedges a position of another member of the taxpayer's consolidated group if the security meets the following requirements—


(1) The security is a hedging transaction within the meaning of § 1.1221-2(b); 


(2) The security is timely identified as a hedging transaction under § 1.1221-2(f) (including identification of the hedged item); and 


(3) The security hedges a position that is not marked to market under section 475(a). 


(e) *Transitional rules*—(1) *Stock, partnership, and beneficial ownership interests in certain controlled corporations, partnerships, and trusts before January 23, 1997*—(i) *In general.* The following items held by a dealer in securities are per se held for investment within the meaning of section 475(b)(1)(A) and are deemed to be properly identified as such for purposes of section 475(b)(2)—


(A) Stock in a corporation that the taxpayer controls (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section); or 


(B) A partnership or beneficial ownership interest in a widely held or publicly traded partnership or trust that the taxpayer controls (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section).

(A) 50 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote; or 


(B) 50 percent or more of the capital interest, the profits interest, or the beneficial ownership interest in the widely held or publicly traded partnership or trust. 


(iii) *Applicability.* The rules of this paragraph (e)(1) apply only before January 23, 1997. 


(2) *Dealers in notional principal contracts and derivatives acquired before January 23, 1997*—(i) *General rule.* Section 475(b)(1)(A) (exempting certain securities from mark-to-market accounting) does not apply to a security if—


(A) The security is described in section 475(c)(2) (D) or (E) (describing certain notional principal contracts and derivative securities); and 


(B) The taxpayer is a dealer in such securities. 


(ii) *Exception for securities not acquired in dealer capacity.* This paragraph (e)(2) does not apply if the taxpayer establishes unambiguously that the security was not acquired in the taxpayer's capacity as a dealer in such securities.
