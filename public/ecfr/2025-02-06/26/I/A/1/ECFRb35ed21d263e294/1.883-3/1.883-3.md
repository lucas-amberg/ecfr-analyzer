# § 1.883-3   Treatment of controlled foreign corporations.

(a) *General rule.* A foreign corporation satisfies the stock ownership test of § 1.883-1(c)(2) if it satisfies the qualified U.S. person ownership test in paragraph (b) of this section and the substantiation and reporting requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, respectively. A foreign corporation that fails the qualified U.S. person ownership test of paragraph (b) of this section can satisfy the stock ownership test of § 1.883-1(c)(2) if it meets either the publicly-traded test of § 1.883-2(a) or the qualified shareholder stock ownership test of § 1.883-4(a).


(b) *Qualified U.S. person ownership test*—(1) *General rule.* A foreign corporation satisfies the qualified U.S. person ownership test only if the following two conditions are satisfied concurrently during more than half the days in its taxable year:


(i) The foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 957(a)).


(ii) One or more qualified U.S. persons own more than 50 percent of the total value of all the outstanding stock of the foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 958(a) and paragraph (b)(4) of this section).


(2) *Qualified U.S. person.* For purposes of this section, a *qualified U.S. person* is a United States citizen or resident alien, a domestic corporation, or a domestic trust described in section 501(a), but only if the person provides the controlled foreign corporation an ownership statement described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and the controlled foreign corporation meets the reporting requirements of paragraph (d) of this section with respect to that person.


(3) *Treatment of bearer shares.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, any shares of the foreign corporation or of any intermediary corporation that are issued in bearer form, shall be treated as not owned by qualified U.S. persons if the bearer shares are not maintained in a dematerialized or immobilized book-entry system, as described in § 1.883-1(c)(3)(i)(G).


(4) *Ownership attribution through certain domestic entities.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for a domestic partnership, a domestic trust not described in section 501(a), or a domestic estate, shall be treated as owned proportionately by the partners, beneficiaries, grantors, or other interest holders, respectively, under the rules of section 958(a), which shall be applied by treating each domestic entity as a foreign entity. Stock that is considered owned by a person under this paragraph (b)(4) shall, for purposes of applying this paragraph (b)(4) to such person, be treated as actually owned by such person.


(5) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the qualified U.S. person ownership test of paragraph (b)(1) of this section:


(c) *Substantiation of CFC stock ownership*—(1) *In general.* A controlled foreign corporation must establish all of the facts necessary to demonstrate to the Commissioner that it satisfies the qualified U.S. person ownership test of paragraph (b)(1) of this section by obtaining a written ownership statement (described in paragraph (c)(2) or (3) of this section, as applicable), signed under penalties of perjury by an individual authorized to sign that person's Federal tax or information return, from—


(i) Each qualified U.S. person whose ownership of stock of the controlled foreign corporation is taken into account for purposes of meeting the qualified U.S. person ownership test; and


(ii) Each domestic intermediary described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, each foreign intermediary (including a foreign corporation, partnership, trust, or estate), and mere legal owners or record holders acting as nominees in the chain of ownership between each such qualified U.S. person and the controlled foreign corporation, if any.


(2) *Ownership statements from qualified U.S. persons.* An ownership statement from a qualified U.S. person must include—


(i) The qualified U.S. person's name, permanent address, and taxpayer identification number;


(ii) If the qualified U.S. person directly owns shares in the controlled foreign corporation, the number of shares of each class of stock of the controlled foreign corporation owned by the qualified U.S. person, whether any shares are issued in bearer form, whether any bearer shares are maintained in a dematerialized or immobilized book-entry system, as described in § 1.883-1(c)(3)(i)(G), and the period (or periods) in the taxable year of the controlled foreign corporation during which the qualified U.S. person owned the shares;


(iii) If the qualified U.S. person indirectly owns shares in the controlled foreign corporation through a foreign or domestic intermediary described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the name of each intermediary, the amount and nature of the qualified U.S. person's interest in each intermediary, the period (or periods) in the taxable year of the controlled foreign corporation during which the qualified U.S. person held such interest, and, with respect to any intermediary foreign corporation, whether any shares are issued in bearer form and whether any such bearer shares are maintained in a dematerialized or immobilized book-entry system, as described in § 1.883-1(c)(3)(i)(G); and


(iv) Any other information specified in published guidance by the Internal Revenue Service (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).


(3) *Ownership statements from intermediaries.* An ownership statement from a domestic or foreign intermediary must include:


(i) The intermediary's name, permanent address, and taxpayer identification number, if any.


(ii) If the intermediary directly owns stock in the controlled foreign corporation, the number of shares of each class of stock of the controlled foreign corporation owned by the intermediary, whether such shares are issued in bearer form and maintained in a dematerialized or immobilized book-entry system, as described in § 1.883-1(c)(3)(i)(G), and the period (or periods) in the taxable year of the controlled foreign corporation during which the intermediary owned the shares.


(iii) If the intermediary indirectly owns the stock of the controlled foreign corporation, the name and address of each intermediary in the chain of ownership between it and the controlled foreign corporation, the period (or periods) in the taxable year of the controlled foreign corporation during which the intermediary owned the shares, the percentage of its indirect ownership interest in the controlled foreign corporation, and, if any intermediary in the chain of ownership is a foreign corporation, whether any shares of such intermediary are issued in bearer form and if any such bearer shares are maintained in a dematerialized or immobilized book- entry system, as described in § 1.883-1(c)(3)(i)(G).


(iv) Any other information specified in published guidance by the Internal Revenue Service (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).


(4) *Three-year period of validity.* The rules of § 1.883-4(d)(2)(ii) shall apply for determining the validity of the ownership statements required under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.


(5) *Availability and retention of documents for inspection.* The foreign corporation seeking qualified foreign corporation status must retain the ownership statements described in this paragraph (c) until the expiration of the statute of limitations for its taxable year to which the ownership statements relate. The ownership statements must be made available for inspection at such time and place as the Commissioner may request in writing in accordance with § 1.883-1(c)(3)(ii).


(d) *Reporting requirements.* A controlled foreign corporation that relies on this section to satisfy the stock ownership test of § 1.883-1(c)(2) must include the following information (in addition to the information required by § 1.883-1(c)(3)) with its Form 1120-F, “U.S. Income Tax Return of a Foreign Corporation”, filed for its taxable year.

(2) The period (or periods) in the taxable year during which such qualified U.S. persons held such shares;


(3) The period (or periods) in the taxable year during which the foreign corporation was a controlled foreign corporation;


(4) A statement as to whether the controlled foreign corporation or any intermediary corporation had bearer shares outstanding during the taxable year, and whether any such bearer shares taken into account for purposes of satisfying the qualified U.S. person ownership test are maintained in a dematerialized or immobilized book-entry system, as described in § 1.883-1(c)(3)(i)(G); and
