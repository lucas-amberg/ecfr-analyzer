# ยง 1.591-1   Deduction for dividends paid on deposits.

(a) *In general.* (1) In the case of a taxpayer described in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section, whichever is applicable, there are allowed as deductions from gross income amounts which during the taxable year are paid to, or credited to the accounts of, depositors or holders of accounts as dividends or interest on their deposits or withdrawable accounts, if such amounts paid or credited are withdrawable on demand subject only to customary notice of intention to withdraw.


(2) The deduction provided in section 591 is applicable to the taxable year in which amounts credited as dividends or interest become withdrawable by the depositor or holder of an account subject only to customary notice of intention to withdraw. Thus, amounts which, as of the last day of the taxable year, are credited as dividends or interest, but which are not withdrawable by depositors or holders of accounts until the following business day, are deductible under section 591 in the year subsequent to the taxable year in which they were so credited. A deduction under this section will not be denied by reason of the fact that the amounts credited as dividends or interest, otherwise deductible under section 591, are subject to the terms of a pledge agreement between the taxpayer and the depositor or holder of an account. In the case of a domestic building and loan association having nonwithdrawable capital stock represented by shares, no deduction is allowable under this section for amounts paid or credited as dividends on such shares. In the case of a taxable year ending after December 31, 1962, for special rules governing the treatment of dividends or interest paid or credited for periods representing more than 12 months, see section 461(e).


(b) *Serial associations, bonus plans, etc.* If a taxpayer described in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section, whichever is applicable, operates in whole or in part as a serial association, maintains a bonus plan, or issues shares, or accepts deposits, subject to fines, penalties, forfeitures, or other withdrawal fees, it may deduct under section 591 the total amount credited as dividends or interest upon such shares or deposits, credited to a bonus account for such shares or deposits, or allocated to a series of shares for the taxable year, notwithstanding that as a customary condition of withdrawal:


(1) Amounts invested in, and earnings credited to, series shares must be withdrawn in multiples of even shares, or


(2) Such taxpayer has the right, pursuant to bylaw, contract, or otherwise, to retain or recover a portion of the total amount invested in, or credited as earnings upon, such shares or deposits, such bonus account, or series of shares, as a fine, penalty, forfeiture, or other withdrawal fee


(c) *Effective date.* The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall apply to:


(1) Dividends or interest paid or credited after October 16, 1962, by any taxpayer which (at the time of such payment or credit) qualifies as (i) a mutual savings bank not having capital stock represented by shares, (ii) a domestic building and loan association (as defined in section 7701(a)(19)), (iii) a cooperative bank (as defined in section 7701(a)(32)), or (iv) any other savings institution chartered and supervised as a savings and loan or similar association under Federal or State law; and


(2) Dividends paid or credited before October 17, 1962, by any taxpayer which (at the time of such payment or credit) qualifies as (i) a mutual savings bank not having capital stock represented by shares, (ii) a cooperative bank without capital stock organized and operated for mutual purposes and without profit, or (iii) a domestic building and loan association (as defined in section 7701(a)(19) before amendment by section 6(c) of the Revenue Act of 1962 (76 Stat. 982)).
