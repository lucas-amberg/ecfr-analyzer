(ii) With respect to issues issued after December 31, 1984, the issuer must submit a report containing information on the borrowers of the original proceeds of such issues. The report must be filed for each reporting period in which the original proceeds of any of such issues are used to provide mortgages.

The report must be filed on the form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service. If no form is prescribed, or if the form prescribed is not readily available, the issuer may use its own form provided that such form is in the format set forth in paragraph (k)(3) of this section and contains the information required by this paragraph (k)(2)(ii). The report must be titled “Qualified Mortgage Bond Information Report” or “Qualified Veterans' Mortgage Bond Information Report”, and must include the name, address, and TIN of the issuer, the reporting period for which the information is provided, and the following tables containing information concerning the borrowers of the original proceeds of the issues subject to the requirements of this paragraph (k)(2)(ii) with respect to mortgages provided during the reporting period for which the report is filed:


(A) A table titled “Number of Mortgage Loans by Income and Acquisition Cost” showing the number of mortgage loans (other than those issued in connection with qualified home improvement and rehabilitation loans) made during the reporting period according to the annualized gross income of the borrowers (categorized in the following intervals of income:


(*1*) Did not have a present ownership interest in a principal residence at any time during the 3-year period ending on the date the mortgage is executed (*i.e.,* satisfied the 3-year requirement) and purchased residences in targeted areas,


(*2*) Satisfied the 3-year requirement and purchased residences not located in targeted areas,


(*3*) Did have a present ownership interest in a principal residence at any time during the 3-year period ending on the date the mortgage is executed (*i.e.,* did not satisfy the 3-year requirement) and purchased residences in targeted areas, and

For each interval of income and acquisition cost the table must also be categorized according to the total principal amount of the mortgage loans of borrowers that—


(*1*) Satisfied the 3-year requirement and purchased residences in targeted areas,


(*2*) Satisfied the 3-year requirement and purchased residences not located in targeted areas,

(ii) With respect to issues of qualified mortgage bonds, the format of the report specified in this paragraph (k)(3) is the following:


(iii) The format of the report specified in this paragraph (k)(3) for qualified veterans' mortgage bonds is the following:


(4) *Definitions and special rules.* (i) For purposes of this paragraph the term “annualized gross income” means the borrower's gross monthly income muliplied by 12. Gross monthly income is the sum of monthly gross pay, any additional income from investments, pensions, Veterans Administration (VA) compensation, part-time employment, bonuses, dividends, interest, current overtime pay, net rental income, etc., and other income (such as alimony and child support, if the borrower has chosen to disclose such income). Information with respect to gross monthly income may be obtained from available loan documents, e.g., the sum of lines 23D and 23E on the Application for VA or FmHA Home Loan Guaranty or for HUD/FHA Insured Mortgage (VA Form 26-1802a, HUD 92900, Jan. 1982), or the total line from the Gross Monthly Income section of FHLMC Residential Loan Application form (FHLMC 65 Rev. 8/78). With respect to obligations issued prior to October 1, 1985, issuers may submit data based on annualized gross income or, instead, based on the adjusted income (as defined in § 1.167(k)-3(b)(3)) of the mortgagor's family for the previous calendar year. If data is submitted based on adjusted income, the issuer must note this fact in the report.


(ii) For purposes of this paragraph, the term “reporting period” means the following periods:


(A) The period beginning January 1, 1985, and ending on September 30, 1985,


(B) The period beginning on October 1, 1985, and ending on June 30, 1986, and


(C) After June 30, 1986, each 1-year period beginning July 1 and ending June 30.


(iii) See the regulations under section 103(l) for the definitions of the terms “date of issue”, “maturity”, and “term of issue”.


(iv) For purposes of this paragraph, verification of information concernig a borrower's gross monthly income with other available information concerning the borrower's income (e.g., Federal income tax returns) is not required. In determining whether a borrower acquiring a residence in a targeted area satisfies the 3-year requirement, the issuer may rely on a statement signed by the borrower.


(5) *Time for filing.* (i) The report required by paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section shall be filed not later than the 15th day of the second calendar month after the close of the calendar quarter in which the obligation is issued. The statement may be filed at any time before such date but must be complete based on facts and reasonable expectations as of the date of issue. The statement need not be amended to report information learned subsequent to the date of issue or to reflect changed circumstances with respect to the issuer.


(ii) The report required by paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section (relating to use of proceeds) shall be filed not later than the 15th day of the second calendar month after the close of the reporting period, except that the report for the reporting period ending September 30, 1985, is due not later than February 15, 1986. The report may be filed at any time before such date but must be complete based on facts and reasonable expectations as of the date the report is filed. The report need not be amended to reflect information learned subsequent to the date the report is filed or to reflect changed circumstances with respect to any borrower.


(iii) The Commissioner may grant an extension of time for the filing of a report required by paragraph (k)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section if there is reasonable cause for the failure to file such report in a timely fashion.


(iv) An issue of qualified veterans' mortgage bonds issued after July 18, 1984, and prior to January 1, 1985, will be treated as satisfying the information reporting requirement of this paragraph if a Form 8038 with respect to the issue is properly filed not later than February 15, 1985; the report described in paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section need not be filed with respect to such issues.


(6) *Place for filing.* The reports required by paragraph (k)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section are to be filed at the Internal Revenue Service Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19255.


(l) *Policy statement*—(1) *In general.* (i) For obligations issued after December 31, 1984, an issue meets the requirements of this paragraph only if the applicable elected representative of the governmental unit which is the issuer (or on behalf of which the issuing authority is empowered to issue qualified mortgage bonds) has published (after a public hearing following reasonable public notice) the report described in paragraph (l)(3) of this section by the last day of the year preceding the year in which such issue is issued and a copy of such report has been submitted to the Commissioner on or before such last day. The Commissioner may grant an extension of time for publishing and filing the report if there is reasonable cause for the failure to publish or file such report in a timely fashion. The requirements of this paragraph will be treated as met if the issuer in good faith attempted to meet the policy statement requirements of this paragraph.


(ii) With respect to reports required by paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section to be published and submitted to the Commissioner not later than December 31, 1984, the Commissioner has determined that there is reasonable cause for the failure to publish or file such reports in a timely fashion; such a report will be considered published and filed in a timely fashion if, not later than March 11, 1985, the report is published (after a public hearing following reasonable public notice) and a copy is submitted to the Commissioner. In addition, any report submitted not later than December 31, 1984, with respect to which an issuer in good faith attempted to satisfy the requirements of section 103A(j)(5) shall be treated as substantially satisfying the requirements of this paragraph. For example, with respect to a report submitted not later than December 31, 1984, an issuer shall not be treated as failing to satisfy the requirements of section 103A(j)(5) based on the fact that (A) the notice of public hearing failed to state the manner in which affected residents may obtain copies of the proposed report prior to the hearing, or (B) the proposed report was not available prior to or at the public hearing. With respect to reports required to be published and submitted to the Commissioner not later than December 31, 1986, the Commissioner has determined that there is a reasonable cause for the failure to publish and file such reports in a timely fashion; such reports will be considered published and filed in a timely fashion if, not later than December 31, 1987, the report is published (after having a public hearing following reasonable public notice) and a copy is submitted to the Commissioner.


(2) *Definitions and special rules.* (i) In the case of an issuer that issues qualified mortgage bonds on behalf of one or more governmental units, a single report may be filed provided that such report is signed (A) by the applicable elected representative of each governmental unit on whose behalf obligations have been issued during any preceding calendar year or (B) by the Governor of the State in which the issuer is located.


(ii) See notice 103(k)(2)(E) and the regulations thereunder for the definition of the term “applicable elected representative”.


(iii) In the case of qualified mortgage bonds issued by, or on behalf of, a governmental unit that did not reasonably expect during the preceding calendar year to issue (or have issued on its behalf by any other issuer) qualified mortgage bonds during the current calendar year, the requirements of this paragraph will be treated as met if the applicable governmental unit which is the issuer (or on behalf of which the issuing authority is empowered to issue qualified mortgage bonds) has published (after a public hearing following reasonable public notice) the report described in paragraph (l)(3) of this section prior to the issuance of any qualified mortgage bonds and a copy of such report has been submitted to the Commissioner prior to such issuance.


(iv) For purposes of this paragraph a report will be considered to be “published” when the applicable elected representative of the governmental unit has made copies of the report available for distribution to the public. Reasonable public notice of the manner in which copies of the report may be obtained must be provided; such notice may be included as part of the public notice required by paragraph (l)(4) of this section.


(3) *Report.* (i) A report is described in this paragraph (l)(3) if it contains the issuer's name, TIN, and the title “Policy Report Under Section 103A” stated on the cover page of the report and if it includes—


(A) A statement of the policies of the issuer with respect to housing, development, and low-income housing assistance which such issuer is to follow in issuing qualified mortgage bonds and mortgage credit certificates, and


(B) An assessment of the compliance of such issuer during the 1-year period preceding the date of the report with—


(*1*) The statement of policy on qualified mortgage bonds and mortgage credit certificates that was set forth in the previous report, if any, of the issuer, and


(*2*) The intent of Congress that State and local governments are expected to use their authority to issue qualified mortgage bonds and mortgage credit certificates to the greatest extent feasible (taking into account prevailing interest rates and conditions in the housing market) to assist lower income families to afford home ownership before assisting higher income families.


(ii) For example, a report described in this paragraph (l)(3) may (but is not required to) contain—


(A) A specific statement of the policies with respect to housing, development, and low-income housing assistance which the issuer is to follow in issuing qualified mortgage bonds and mortgage credit certificates, including, for example, a statement as to—


(*1*) With respect to housing policies, (*i*) whether the proceeds will be used to provide financing for the acquisition of residences, to provide qualified home improvement loans, or to provide qualified rehabilitation loans; (*ii*) whether all or a portion of the proceeds will be targeted to new, existing, or any other particular class or type of housing; (*iii*) how the existence of a need or absence of a need for such targeting has been determined; (*iv*) the method by which the proceeds will be targeted; (*v*) any other pertinent information relating to the issuer's housing policies; and (*vi*) how the housing policies relate to the issuer's development and low-income housing assistance policies;


(*2*) With respect to development policies, (*i*) whether all or a portion of the proceeds will be targeted to specific areas (including targeted areas as described in § 6a.103A-2(b)(3)); (*ii*) a description of the areas to which the proceeds will be targeted; (*iii*) the reasons for selecting such areas; (*iv*) whether proceeds targeted to each area are to be used to finance redevelopment of existing housing or new construction; (*v*) any other pertinent information relating to the issuer's development policies; and (*vi*) how the development policies relate to the issuer's low-income housing assistance policies; and


(*3*) With respect to low-income housing assistance policies, (*i*) whether all or a portion of the proceeds will be targeted to low-income (*i.e.,* 80 percent of median income), moderate-income (*i.e.,* 100 percent of median income), or any other class of borrowers; (*ii*) the method by which the proceeds will be targeted to such borrowers; and (*iii*) any other pertinent information relating to the issuer's low-income housing assistance policies;


(B) An assessment of the compliance of the governmental unit or issuing authority during the twelve-month period ending with the date of the report with the statement of housing, development, and low-income housing assistance policies with respect to qualified mortgage bonds and mortgage credit certificates that were set forth in the report, if any, published in the preceding year with respect to such governmental unit, including, for example, a statement as to whether the governmental unit or issuing authority successfully implemented its policies and, if not, an analysis of the reasons for such failure; and


(C) An assessment of the compliance of the governmental unit or issuing authority during the twelve-month period ending with the date of the report with the intent of Congress that State and local governments are expected to use their authority to issue qualified mortgage bonds and mortgage credit certificates to the greatest extent feasible (taking into account prevailing interest rates and conditions in the housing market) to assist lower income families to afford home ownership before assisting higher income families, including, for example, a description of (*1*) the method used by the governmental unit or issuing authority to distribute proceeds, (*2*) whether and how that method enabled the governmental unit or issuing authority to assist lower income families before higher income families, and (*3*) any income levels that have been defined and used by the governmental unit or issuing authority in connection with distribution of the proceeds (no specific definition of lower income and higher income is imposed on governmental units or issuing authorities).


(iii) For purposes of the assessments of compliance required by paragraph (l)(3)(i)(B) of this section to be included in the report, the “date of the report” means June 30. For purposes of the report required to be filed prior to January 1, 1986, an issuer need not perform these assessments of compliance with respect to any period prior to January 1, 1985.


(iv) An issuer that fails to establish policies with respect to the criteria provided in paragraph (l)(3)(i) of this section will not be treated as failing to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph. Thus, for example, an issuer may state in its report that none of the proceeds of the issue will be targeted to specific areas. Similarly, an issuer that fails to successfully implement its policies will not be treated as failing to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.


(4) *Public hearing.* The public hearing required by paragraph (l)(1) of this section means a forum providing a reasonable opportunity for interested individuals to express their views, both orally and in writing, on the report that the applicable representative proposes to publish to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (l). A public hearing held prior to January 1, 1985, will not fail to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (l)(4) merely because the proposed policy statement was not available prior to the public hearing. In general, a governmental unit may select its own procedure for the hearing, provided that interested individuals have a reasonable opportunity to express their views. Thus, it may impose reasonable requirements on persons who wish to participate in the hearing, such as a requirement that persons desiring to speak at the hearing so request in writing at least 24 hours before the hearing or that they limit their oral remarks to 10 minutes. For purposes of this public hearing requirement, it is not necessary that the applicable elected representative who will publish the report be present at the hearing, that a report on the hearing be submitted to that official, or that State administrative procedural requirements for public hearings in general be observed. However, compliance with such State procedural requirements (except those at variance with a specific requirement set forth in this paragraph) will generally assure that the hearing satisfies the requirements of this paragraph. The hearing may be conducted by any individual appointed or employed to perform such function by the governmental unit, its agencies, or by the issuer. Thus, for example, for a report to be issued by an issuing authority that acts on behalf of a county, the hearing may be conducted by the issuing authority, the county, or an appointee or employee of either.


(5) *Reasonable public notice.* (i) The reasonable public notice required by paragraph (l)(1) of this section means published notice which is reasonably designed to inform residents of the geographical area within the jurisdiction of the governmental unit that will publish the report. The notice must state the time and place for the hearing and contain the information required by paragraph (l)(5)(ii) of this section. Notice is presumed reasonable if published no fewer than 14 days before the hearing. Notice is presumed reasonably designed to inform affected residents only if published in one or more newspapers of general circulation available to residents of that locality or if announced by radio or televison broadcast to those residents.


(ii) The notice of hearing described in this paragraph (l)(5) must state—


(A) The time and place for the hearing,


(B) Any applicable limitations regarding participation in the hearing,


(C) With respect to any notice of hearing published after December 31, 1984, the manner in which affected residents may obtain copies of the proposed report prior to the hearing, and


(D) With respect to any notice of hearing published after December 31, 1984, that the hearing will involve the issuer's policies with respect to housing, development, and low-income housing assistance which the issuer is to follow in issuing qualified mortgage bonds and mortgage credit certificates.


(6) *Procedure for public hearings of multiple jurisdiction issuers.* In the case of an issuer that issues qualified mortgage bonds on behalf of two or more governmental units (“multiple jurisdiction issuer”), each governmental unit on whose behalf the issuer reasonably expects to issue qualified mortgage bonds during the succeeding calendar year must hold a public hearing following reasonable public notice prior to the publication of the report required by this paragraph. A multiple jurisdiction issuer may hold a combined hearing as long as the combined hearing is a joint undertaking that provides all residents of the participating governmental units (*i.e.,* each governmental unit on whose behalf qualified mortgage bonds were issued by the authority and each governmental unit on whose behalf the authority reasonably expects to issue qualified mortgage bonds during the succeeding calendar year) a reasonable opportunity to be heard. The location of any combined hearing is presumed to provide a reasonable opportunity for all affected residents to be heard if it is no farther than 100 miles from the seat of government of each participating governmental unit beyond whose geographic jurisdiction the hearing is conducted.


(7) *Place for filing.* The report is to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19255.


(m) *State certification requirements*—(1) *In general.* An issue meets the requirements of this paragraph only if the issuer in good faith attempted to meet the State certification requirements of this paragraph. The requirements of this paragraph apply to obligations issued after December 31, 1984; see section 149(e) and the regulations thereunder with respect to obligations issued after December 31, 1986.


(2) *Certification.* (i) An issue satisfied the requirements of section 103A(j)(4) and this paragraph (m)(2) only if the State official designated by law (or, if there is no State official, the Governor) certifies on or before the later of the date of issue or October 3, 1985, following a request for such certification by the issuer, that, as of the date the certification is executed, the issue meets the requirements of section 103A(g) and the regulations thereunder (relating to volume limitation). In the case of any constitutional home rule city, the certification shall be made by the chief executive officer of the city. To the extent consistent with State and local law, the Governor (or the chief executive officer of any constitutional home rule city) may delegate the responsibility to execute the certification required by this paragraph.


(ii) The certifying official need not perform an independent investigation in order to determine whether the issue meets the requirements of section 103A(g). In determining the aggregate amount of qualified mortgage bonds previously issued by an issuer during a calendar year, the certifying official may rely on copies of the reports submitted, to date, by the issuer pursuant to section 103A(j)(3) for other issues of qualified mortgage bonds issued during that year and copies of any elections previously made pursuant to section 25(c)(2) not to issue qualified mortgage bonds, together with an affidavit executed by an officer of the issuer responsible for issuing the bonds stating that the issuer has not, to date during the calendar year, issued any other qualified mortgage bonds, the amount, if any, of the issuer's market limitation that it has, to date during the calendar year, surrendered to other issuing authorities, and that it has not, to date during the calendar year, made any other elections not to issue qualified mortgage bonds. If, based on such information, the certifying official determines that, as of the date the certification is executed, the issue will not exceed the issuer's market limitation for the year, the official may certify that the issue meets the requirements of section 103A(g).


(3) *Special rule.* If 15 days elapse after the issuer files a proper request for the certification described in paragraph (m)(2) of this section and the issuer has not received from the State official designated by law (or, if there is no State official, the Governor) certification that the issue meets the requirements of section 103A(g) and § 6a.103A-2(g) or, in the alternative, a statement that the issue does not meet such requirements, the issuer may, instead, submit an affidavit executed by an officer of the issuer responsible for issuing the bonds stating that—


(i) The issue meets the requirements of section 103(A)(g) and § 6a.103A-2(g),


(ii) At least 15 days before the execution of the affidavit the issuer filed a proper request for the certification described in paragraph (m)(2) of this section, and


(iii) The State official designated by law (or, if there is no State official, the Governor) has not provided the certification described in paragraph (m)(2) of this section.


(4) *Filing.* The certification (or affidavit) required by this paragraph shall be filed with the Internal Revenue Service Center, Philadelphia, PA 19255. The certification (or affidavit) shall be submitted with the Form 8038 required to be filed by section 103A(j)(3) and paragraph (k) of this § 1.103A-2. The Commissioner may grant an extension of time for filing the certification (or affidavit) if there is a reasonable cause for the failure to file such statement in a timely fashion.


(5) *Effect of certification.* The fact that an issuer obtains the certification (or affidavit) described in this paragraph does not ensure that the requirements of paragraph (g) of § 6a.103A-2 are met. Obligations that do not meet the requirements of paragraph (g) of § 6a.103A-2 are not described in section 103(a).
