# § 1.1374-1A   Tax imposed on certain capital gains.

(a) *General rule.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if for a taxable year beginning after 1982 of an S corporation—


(1) The net capital gain of such corporation exceeds $25,000, and


(2) The net capital gain of such corporation exceeds 50 percent of its taxable income (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) for such year, and


(3) The taxable income of such corporation (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) for such year exceeds $25,000,


(b) *Amount of tax.* The amount of tax shall be the lower of—


(1) An amount equal to the tax, determined as provided in section 1201(a)(2), on the amount by which the net capital gain of the corporation for the taxable year exceeds $25,000, or


(2) An amount equal to the tax which would be imposed by section 11 on the taxable income of the corporation (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) for the taxable year were it not an S corporation.


(c) *Exceptions to taxation*—(1) *New corporations and corporations with election in effect for 3 immediately preceding years*—(i) *In general.* If an S corporation would be subject to the tax imposed by section 1374 for a taxable year pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the corporation shall, nevertheless, not be subject to such tax for such year, if:


(A) The election under section 1362(a) which is in effect with respect to such corporation for such year has been in effect for the corporation's three immediately preceding taxable years, or


(B) An election under section 1362(a) has been in effect with respect to such corporation for each of its taxable years for which it has been in existence, unless there is a net capital gain for the taxable year which is attributable to property with a substituted basis within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.


(ii) *Amount of tax on net capital gain attributable to property with a substituted basis.* If for a taxable year of an S corporation either paragraph (c)(1)(i) (A) or (B) of this section is satisfied, but the S corporation has a net capital gain for such taxable year which is attributable to property with a substituted basis (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section), then paragraph (a) of this section shall apply for the taxable year, but the amount of tax determined under paragraph (b) of this section shall not exceed a tax, determined as provided in section 1201 (a), on the net capital gain attributable to property with a substituted basis.


(iii) *Property with substituted basis.* For purposes of this section, the term *property with a substituted basis* means:


(A) Property acquired by a corporation (*the acquiring corporation*) during the period beginning 36 months before the first day of the acquiring corporation's taxable year and ending on the last day of such year;


(B) The basis of such property in the hands of the acquiring corporation is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of any property in the hands of another corporation; and


(C) Such other corporation was not an S corporation throughout the period beginning the later of:


(*1*) 36 months before the first day of the acquiring corporation's taxable year, or


(*2*) The time such other corporation came into existence,


(iv) *Existence of a corporation.* For purposes of this section, a corporation shall not be considered to be in existence for any month which precedes the first month in which such corporation has shareholders or acquires assets or begins business, whichever is first to occur.


(v) *References to prior law included.* For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term *S corporation* shall include an electing small business corporation under prior subchapter S law, and the term *election under section 1362 (a)* shall include an election under section 1372 of prior subchapter S law.


(iv) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(2) *Treatment of certain gains of options and commodities dealers*—(i) *Exclusion of certain capital gains.* For purposes of this section, the net capital gain of any options dealer or commodities dealer shall be determined by not taking into account any gain or loss (in the normal course of the taxpayer's activity of dealing in or trading section 1256 contracts) from any section 1256 contract or property related to such a contract.


(ii) *Definitions.* For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)—


(A) *Options dealer.* The term *options dealer* has the meaning given to such term by section 1256(g)(8).


(B) *Commodities dealer.* The term *commodities dealer* means a person who is actively engaged in trading section 1256 contracts and is registered with a domestic board of trade which is designated as a contract market by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission.

(iii) *Effective dates*—(A) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(2)(iii), this paragraph (c)(2) shall apply to positions established after July 18, 1984, in taxable years ending after such date.


(B) *Special rule for options on regulated futures contracts.* In the case of any option with respect to a regulated futures contract (within the meaning of section 1256), this paragraph (c)(2) shall apply to positions established after October 31, 1983, in taxable years ending after such date.


(C) *Elections with respect to property held on or before July 18, 1984.* See §§ 1.1256 (h)-1T and 1.1256(h)-2T for rules concerning an election to have this paragraph (c)(2) apply to certain property held on or before July 18, 1984.


(d) *Determination of taxable income*—(1) *General rule.* For purposes of this section, taxable income of the corporation shall be determined under section 63(a) as if the corporation were a C corporation rather than an S corporation, except that the following deductions shall not apply in the computation—


(i) The deduction allowed by section 172 (relating to net operating loss deduction), and


(ii) The deductions allowed by part VIII of subchapter B (other than the deduction allowed by section 248, relating to organization expenditures).


(2) *Special rule for net capital gains taxed as excess net passive income under section 1375.* See section 1375 (c) (2) and § 1.1375-1(c)(2) for a special rule that reduces the taxable income of the corporation for purposes of section 1374(b)(2) and § 1.1374-1(b)(2) in cases where a net capital gain is taxed as excess net passive income under section 1375.
