# § 1.243-4   Qualifying dividends.

(a) *Definition of qualifying dividends*—(1) *General.* For purposes of section 243(a)(3), the term *qualifying dividends* means dividends received by a corporation if: 


(i) At the close of the day the dividends are received, such corporation is a member of the same affiliated group of corporations (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) as the corporation distributing the dividends, 


(ii) An election by such affiilated group under section 243(b)(2) and paragraph (c) of this section is effective for the taxable years of its members which include such day, and 


(iii) The dividends are distributed out of earnings and profits specified in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. 


(2) *Earnings and profits.* The earnings and profits specified in this subparagraph are earnings and profits of a taxable year of the distributing corporation (or a predecessor corporation) which satisfies each of the following conditions: 


(i) Such year must end after December 31, 1963; 


(ii) On each day of such year the distributing corporation (or the predecessor corporation) and the corporation receiving the dividends must have been members of the affiliated group of which the distributing corporation and the corporation receiving the dividends are members on the day the dividends are received; and 


(iii) An election under section 1562 (relating to the election of multiple surtax exmptions) was never effective (or is no longer effective pursuant to section 1562(c)) for such year. 


(3) *Special rule for insurance companies.* Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, if an insurance company subject to taxation under section 802 or 821 distributes a dividend out of earnings and profits of a taxable year with respect to which the company would have been a component member of a controlled group of corporations within the meaning of section 1563 were it not for the application of section 1563(b)(2)(D), such dividend shall not be treated as a qualifying dividend unless an election under section 243(b)(2) is effective for such taxable year. 


(4) *Predecessor corporations.* For purposes of this paragraph, a corporation shall be considered to be a predecessor corporation with respect to a distributing corporation if the distributing corporation succeeds to the earnings and profits of such corporation, for example, as the result of a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. A distributing corporation shall, for purposes of this section, maintain, in respect of each predecessor corporation, a separate account for earnings and profits to which it succeeds, and such earnings and profits shall be considered to be earnings and profits of the predecessor's taxable year in which the earnings and profits were accumulated. 


(5) *Mere change in form.* (i) For purposes of subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph, the affiliated group in existence during the taxable year out of the earnings and profits of which the dividend is distributed shall not be considered as a different group from that in existence on the day on which the dividend is received merely because: 


(*a*) The common parent corporation has undergone a mere change in identity, form, or place of organization (within the meaning of section 368(a)(1)(F)), or 


(*b*) A newly organized corporation (the “acquiring corporation”) has acquired substantially all of the outstanding stock of the common parent corporation (the “acquired corporation”) solely in exchange for stock of such acquiring corporation, and the stockholders (immediately before the acquisition) of the acquired corporation, as a result of owning stock of the acquired corporation, own (immediately after the acquisition) all of the outstanding stock of the acquiring corporation. 


(ii) For purposes of subdivision (i) (b) of this subparagraph, if immediately before the acquisition: 


(*a*) The stockholders of the acquired corporation also owned all of the outstanding stock of another corporation (the “second corporation”), and 


(*b*) Stock of the acquired corporation and of the second corporation could be acquired or transferred only as a unit (hereinafter referred to as the “limitation on transferability”), then the second corporation shall be treated as an acquired corporation and such second corporation shall be treated as having been a member of the affiliated group for the entire period (while such group was in existence) during which the limitation on transferability was in existence, and if the second corporation is itself the common parent corporation of an affiliated group (the “second group”) any other member of the second group shall be treated as having been a member of the affiliated group for the entire period during which it was a member of the second group while the limitation on transferability existed. For purposes of (*a*) of this subdivision and subdivision (i)(*b*) of this subparagraph, if the limitation on transferability of stock of the acquired corporation and the second corporation is achieved by using a voting trust, then the stock owned by the trust shall be considered as owned by the holders of the beneficial interests in the trust. 


(6) *Source of distributions.* In determining from what year's earnings and profits a dividend is treated as having been distributed for purposes of this section, the principles of paragraph (a) of § 1.316-2 shall apply. A dividend shall be considered to be distributed, first, out of the earnings and profits of the taxable year which includes the date the dividend is distributed, second, out of the earnings and profits accumulated for the immediately preceding taxable year, third, out of the earnings and profits accumulated for the second preceding taxable year, etc. A deficit in an earnings and profits account for any taxable year shall reduce the most recently accumulated earnings and profits for a prior year in such account. If there are no accumulated earnings and profits in an earnings and profits account because of a deficit incurred in a prior year, such deficit must be restored before earnings and profits can be accumulated in a subsequent year. If a dividend is distributed out of separate earnings and profits accounts (established under the provisions of subparagraph (4) of this paragraph) for two or more taxable years ending on the same day, then the portion of such dividend considered as distributed out of each account shall be the same proportion of the total dividend as the amount of earnings and profits in that account bears to the sum of the earnings and profits in all such accounts. 


(7) *Examples.* The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples: 


(b) *Definition of affiliated group.* For purposes of this section and § 1.243-5, the term *affiliated group* shall have the meaning assigned to it by section 1504(a), except that insurance companies subject to taxation under section 802 or 821 shall be treated as includible corporations (notwithstanding section 1504(b)(2)), and the provisions of section 1504(c) shall not apply. 


(c) *Election*—(1) *Manner and time of making election*—(i) *General.* The election provided by section 243(b)(2) shall be made for an affiliated group by the common parent corporation and shall be made for a particular taxable year of the common parent corporation. Such election may not be made for any taxable year of the common parent corporation for which a multiple surtax exemption election under section 1562 is effective. The election shall be made by means of a statement, signed by any person who is duly authorized to act on behalf of the common parent corporation, stating that the affiliated group elects under section 243(b)(2) for such taxable year. The statement shall be filed with the district director for the internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of business or principal office or agency of the common parent. The statement shall set forth the name, address, taxpayer account number, and taxable year of each corporation (including wholly-owned subsidiaries) that is a member of the affiliated group at the time the election is filed. The statement may be filed at any time, provided that, with respect to each corporation the tax liability of which for its matching taxable year of election (or for any subsequent taxable year) would be increased because of the election, at the time of filing there is at least 1 year remaining in the statutory period (including any extensions thereof) for the assessment of a deficiency against such corporation for such year. (If there is less than 1 year remaining with respect to any taxable year, the district director for the internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of business or principal office or agency of the corporation will ordinarily, upon request, enter into an agreement to extend such statutory period for assessment and collection of deficiencies. 


(ii) *Information statement by common parent.* If a corporation becomes a member of the affiliated group after the date on which the election is filed and during its matching taxable year of election, then the common parent shall file, within 60 days after such corporation becomes a member of the affiliated group, an additional statement containing the name, address, taxpayer account number, and taxable year of such corporation. Such additional statement shall be filed with the internal revenue officer with whom the election was filed. 


(iii) *Definition of matching taxable year of election.* For purposes of this paragraph and paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, the term *matching taxable year of election* shall mean the taxable year of each member (including the common parent corporation) of the electing affiliated group which includes the last day of the taxable year of the common parent corporation for which an election by the affiiliated group is made under section 243(b)(2). 


(2) *Consents by subsidiary corporations*—(i) *General.* Each corporation (other than the common parent corporation) which is a member of the electing affiliated group (including any member which joins in the filing of a consolidated return) at any time during its matching taxable year of election must consent to such election in the manner and time provided in subdivision (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph, whichever is applicable. 


(ii) *Wholly owned subsidiary.* If all of the stock of a corporation is owned by a member or members of the affiliated group on each day of such corporation's matching taxable year of election, then such corporation (referred to in this paragraph as a “wholly owned subsidiary”) shall be deemed to consent to such election. 


(iii) *Other members.* The consent of each member of the affiliated group (other than a wholly owned subsidiary) shall be made by means of a statement, signed by any person who is duly authorized to act on behalf of the consenting member, stating that such member consents to the election under section 243(b)(2). The statement shall set forth the name, address, taxpayer account number, and taxable year of the consenting member and of the common parent corporation, and in the case of a statement filed after December 31, 1968, the identity of the internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of business or principal office or agency of the common parent corporation. The consent of more than one such member may be incorporated in a single statement. The statement (or statements) shall be attached to the election filed by the common parent corporation. The consent of a corporation that, after the date the election was filed and during its matching taxable year of election, either (*a*) becomes a member, or (*b*) ceases to be a wholly owned subsidiary but continues to be a member, shall be filed with the internal revenue officer with whom the election was filed and shall be filed on or before the date prescribed by law (including extensions of time) for the filing of the consenting member's income tax return for such taxable year, or on or before June 10, 1964, whichever is later. 


(iv) *Statement attached to return.* Each corporation that consents to an election by means of a statement described in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph should attach a copy of the statement to its income tax return for its matching taxable year of election, or, if such return has already been filed, to its first income tax return filed on or after the date on which the statement is filed. However, if such return is filed on or before June 10, 1964, a copy of such statement should be filed on or before June 10, 1964, with the district director with whom such return is filed. Each wholly owned subsidiary should attach a statement to its income tax return for its matching taxable year of election, or, if such return has already been filed, to its first income tax return filed on or after the date on which the statement is filed stating that it is subject to an election under section 243(b)(2) and the taxable year to which the election applies, and setting forth the name, address, taxpayer account number, and taxable year of the common parent corporation, and in the case of a statement filed after December 31, 1968, the identity of the internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of business or principal office or agency of the common parent corporation. However, if the due date for such return (including extensions of time) is before June 10, 1964, such statement should be filed on or before June 10, 1964, with the district director with whom such return is filed. 


(3) *Information statement by member.* If a corporation becomes a member of the affiliated group during a taxable year that begins after the last day of the common parent corporation's matching taxable year of election, then (unless such election has been terminated) such corporation should attach a statement to its income tax return for such taxable year stating that it is subject to an election under section 243(b)(2) for such taxable year and setting forth the name, address, taxpayer account number, and taxable year of the common parent corporation, and the identity of the internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of business or principal office or agency of the common parent corporation. In the case of an affiliated group that made an election under the rules provided in Treasury Decision 6721, approved April 8, 1964 (29 FR 4997, C.B. 1964-1 (Part 1), 625), such statement shall be filed, on or before March 15, 1969, with the district director for the internal revenue district in which is located such member's principal place of business or principal office or agency. 


(4) *Years for which election effective*—(i) *General rule.* An election under section 243(b)(2) by an affiliated group shall be effective: 


(*a*) In the case of each corporation which is a member of such group at any time during its matching taxable year of election, for such taxable year, and 


(*b*) In the case of each corporation which is a member of such group at any time during a taxable year ending after the last day of the common parent's taxable year of election but which does not include such last day, for such taxable year, unless the election is terminated under section 243(b)(4) and paragraph (e) of this section. Thus, the election has a continuing effect and need not be renewed annually. 


(ii) *Special rule for certain taxable years ending in 1964.* In the case of a taxable year of a member (other than the common parent corporation) of the affiliated group (*a*) which begins in 1963 and ends in 1964, and (*b*) for which an election is not effective under subdivision (i)(*a*) of this subparagraph, if an election under section 243(b)(2) is effective for the taxable year of the common parent corporation which includes the last day of such taxable year of such member, then such election shall be effective for such taxable year of such member if such member files a separate consent with respect to such taxable year. However, in order for a dividend distributed by such member during such taxable year to meet the requirements of section 243(b)(1), an election under section 243(b)(2) must be effective for the taxable year of each member of the affiliated group which includes the date such dividend is received. See section 243(b)(1)(A) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Accordingly, if the dividend is to qualify for the 100-percent dividends received deduction under section 243(a)(3), a consent must be filed under this subdivision by each member of the affiliated group with respect to its taxable year which includes the day the dividend is received (unless an election is effective for such taxable year under subdivision (i)(*a*) of this subparagraph). For purposes of this subdivision, a consent shall be made by means of a statement meeting the requirements of subparagraph (2)(iii) of this paragraph, and shall be attached to the election made by the common parent corporation for its taxable year which includes the last day of the taxable year of the member with respect to which the consent is made. A copy of the statement should be filed, within 60 days after such election is filed by the common parent corporation, with the district director with whom the consenting member filed its income tax return for such taxable year. 


(iii) *Examples.* The provisions of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, relating to the special rule for certain taxable years ending in 1964, may be illustrated by the following examples: 


(d) *Effect of election.* For restrictions and limitations applicable to corporations which are members of an electing affiliated group on each day of their taxable years, see § 1.243-5. 


(e) *Termination of election*—(1) *In general.* An election under section 243(b)(2) by an affiliated group may be terminated with respect to any taxable year of the common parent corporation after the matching taxable year of election of the common parent corporation. The election is terminated as a result of one of the occurrences described in subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph. For years affected by termination, see subparagraph (4) of this paragraph. 


(2) *Consent of members*—(i) *General.* An election may be terminated for an affiliated group by its common parent corporation with respect to a taxable year of the common parent corporation provided each corporation (other than the common parent) that was a member of the affiliated group at any time during its taxable year that includes the last day of such year of the common parent (the “matching taxable year of termination”) consents to such termination. The statement of termination may be filed by the common parent corporation at any time, provided that, with respect to each corporation the tax liability of which for its matching taxable year of termination (or for any subsequent taxable year) would be increased because of the termination, at the time of filing there is at least 1 year remaining in the statutory period (including any extensions thereof) for the assessment of a deficiency against such corporation for such year. (If there is less than 1 year remaining with respect to any taxable year, the district director for the internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of business or principal office or agency of the corporation will ordinarily, upon request, enter into agreement to extend such statutory period for assessment and collection of deficiencies.) 


(ii) *Statements filed after December 31, 1968.* With respect to statements of termination filed after December 31, 1968: 


(*a*) The statement shall be filed with the district director for the internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of business or principal office or agency of the common parent corporation; 


(*b*) The statement shall be signed by any person who is duly authorized to act on behalf of the common parent corporation and shall state that the affiliated group terminates the election under section 243(b)(2) for such taxable year; 


(*c*) The statement shall set forth the name, address, taxpayer account number, and taxable year of each corporation (including wholly owned subsidiaries) which is a member of the affiliated group at the time the termination is filed; and 


(*d*) The consents to the termination shall be given in accordance with the rules prescribed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, relating to manner and time for giving consents to an election under section 243(b)(2). 


(3) *Refusal by new member to consent*—(i) *Manner of giving refusal.* If any corporation which is a new member of an affiliated group with respect to a taxable year of the common parent corporation (other than the matching taxable year of election of the common parent corporation) files a statement that it does not consent to an election under section 243(b)(2) with respect to such taxable year, then such election shall terminate with respect to such taxable year. Such statement shall be signed by any person who is duly authorized to act on behalf of the new member, and shall be filed with the timely filed income tax return of such new member for its taxable year within which falls the last day of such taxable year of the common parent corporation. In the event of a termination under this subparagraph, each corporation (other than such new member) that is a member of the affiliated group at any time during its taxable year which includes such last day should, within 30 days after such new member files the statement of refusal to consent, notify the district director of such termination. Such notification should be filed with the district director for the internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of business or principal office or agency of the corporation. 


(ii) *Corporation considered as new member.* For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, a corporation shall be considered to be a new member of an affiliated group of corporations with respect to a taxable year of the common parent corporation if such corporation: 


(*a*) Is a member of the affiliated group at any time during such taxable year of the common parent corporation, and 


(*b*) Was not a member of the affiliated group at any time during the common parent corporation's immediately preceding taxable year. 


(4) *Effect of termination.* A termination under subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph is effective with respect to (i) the common parent corporation's taxable year referred to in the particular subparagraph under which the termination occurs, and (ii) the taxable years of the other members of the affiliated group which include the last day of such taxable year of the common parent. An election, once terminated, is no longer effective. Accordingly, the termination is also effective with respect to the succeeding taxable years of the members of the group. However, the affiliated group may make a new election in accordance with the provisions of section 243(b)(2) and paragraph (c) of this section.
