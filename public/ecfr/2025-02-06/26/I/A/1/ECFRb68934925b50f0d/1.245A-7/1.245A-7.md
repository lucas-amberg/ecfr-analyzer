# § 1.245A-7   Coordination rules for simple cases.

(a) *Scope.* This section applies for a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder for which the conditions of § 1.245A-6(b)(1) and (2) are satisfied and for which the section 245A shareholder chooses to apply this section (in lieu of § 1.245A-8).


(b) *Reduction of disqualified basis by reason of an extraordinary disposition amount or tiered extraordinary disposition amount*—(1) *In general.* If, for a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder, an extraordinary disposition account of the section 245A shareholder gives rise to one or more extraordinary disposition amounts or tiered extraordinary disposition amounts, then, with respect to an item of specified property that corresponds to the extraordinary disposition account, the disqualified basis of the item of specified property is, solely for purposes of § 1.951A-2(c)(5), reduced (but not below zero) by an amount (determined in the functional currency in which the extraordinary disposition account is maintained) equal to the product of—


(i) The sum of the extraordinary disposition amounts and the tiered extraordinary disposition amounts; and


(ii) A fraction, the numerator of which is the disqualified basis of the item of specified property, and the denominator of which is the sum of the disqualified basis of each item of specified property that corresponds to the extraordinary disposition account.


(2) *Timing rules regarding disqualified basis.* See § 1.245A-9(b)(2) for timing rules regarding the determination of, and reduction to, disqualified basis of an item of specified property.


(3) *Special rule regarding prior extraordinary disposition amounts.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, to the extent that an extraordinary disposition account of a section 245A shareholder is reduced under § 1.245A-5(c)(3)(i)(A) by reason of a prior extraordinary disposition amount described in § 1.245A-5(c)(3)(i)(D)(*1*)(*i*) through (*iv*), the extraordinary disposition account is considered to give rise to an extraordinary disposition amount or tiered extraordinary disposition amount (and the amount by which the account is reduced is treated as an extraordinary disposition amount or tiered extraordinary disposition amount).


(c) *Reduction of extraordinary disposition account by reason of the allocation and apportionment of deductions or losses attributable to disqualified basis*—(1) *In general.* If, for a taxable year of a CFC, the CFC holds one or more items of specified property that correspond to an extraordinary disposition account of a section 245A shareholder with respect to an SFC, then the extraordinary disposition account is reduced (but not below zero) by the lesser of the amounts described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section (each determined in the functional currency of the CFC).


(i) The excess (if any) of the adjusted earnings of the CFC for the taxable year of the CFC, over the sum of the previously taxed earnings and profits accounts with respect to the CFC for purposes of section 959 (determined as of the end of the taxable year of the CFC and taking into account any adjustments to the accounts for the taxable year).


(ii) The balance of the section 245A shareholder's RGI account with respect to the CFC (determined as of the end of the taxable year of the CFC, but without regard to the application of paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section for the taxable year).


(2) *Timing of reduction to extraordinary disposition account.* See § 1.245A-9(b)(3) for timing rules regarding the reduction to an extraordinary disposition account.


(3) *Adjusted earnings.* The term *adjusted earnings* means, with respect to a CFC and a taxable year of the CFC, the earnings and profits of the CFC, determined as of the end of the CFC's taxable year (taking into account all distributions during the taxable year), and with the adjustments described in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.


(i) The earnings and profits are increased by the amount of any deduction or loss that is or was allocated and apportioned to residual CFC gross income of the CFC solely by reason of § 1.951A-2(c)(5)(i).


(ii) The earnings and profits are decreased by the amount by which an RGI account with respect to the CFC has been decreased pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section for a prior taxable year of the CFC.


(iii) The earnings and profits are determined without regard to income described in section 245(a)(5)(A) or dividends described in section 245(a)(5)(B) (determined without regard to section 245(a)(12)).


(4) *RGI account.* For a taxable year of a CFC, the following rules apply to determine the balance of a section 245A shareholder's RGI account with respect to the CFC:


(i) The balance of the RGI account is increased by the sum of the amounts of deductions and losses of the CFC that, but for § 1.951A-2(c)(5)(i), would have decreased one or more categories of the CFC's positive subpart F income or the CFC's tested income, or increased or given rise to a tested loss or one or more qualified deficits of the CFC.


(ii) The balance of the RGI account is decreased to the extent that, by reason of the application of paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to the taxable year of the CFC, there is a reduction to the extraordinary disposition account of the section 245A shareholder.
