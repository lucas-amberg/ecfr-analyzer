# § 1.245A-8   Coordination rules for complex cases.

(a) *Scope.* This section applies beginning with the first day of the first taxable year of a section 245A shareholder for which § 1.245A-7 does not apply and for all taxable years thereafter, or for a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder for which the section 245A shareholder chooses not to apply § 1.245A-7.


(b) *Reduction of disqualified basis by reason of an extraordinary disposition amount or tiered extraordinary disposition amount*—(1) *In general.* If, for a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder, an extraordinary disposition account of the section 245A shareholder gives rise to one or more extraordinary disposition amounts or tiered extraordinary disposition amounts, then, with respect to an item of specified property that corresponds to the extraordinary disposition account and for which the ownership requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is satisfied for the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder, solely for purposes of § 1.951A-2(c)(5), the disqualified basis of the item of specified property is reduced (but not below zero) by an amount (determined in the functional currency in which the extraordinary disposition account is maintained) equal to the product of—


(i) The excess (if any) of—


(A) The sum of the extraordinary disposition amounts and the tiered extraordinary disposition amounts; over


(B) The basis benefit account with respect to the extraordinary disposition account (determined as of the end of the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder, and without regard to the application of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of this section for the taxable year); and


(ii) A fraction, the numerator of which is the disqualified basis of the item of specified property, and the denominator of which is the sum of the disqualified basis of each item of specified property that corresponds to the extraordinary disposition account and for which the ownership requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is satisfied for the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder.


(2) *Timing rules regarding disqualified basis.* See § 1.245A-9(b)(2) for timing rules regarding the determination of, and reduction to, disqualified basis of an item of specified property.


(3) *Ownership requirement with respect to an item of specified property*—(i) *In general.* For a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder, the ownership requirement of this paragraph (b)(3)(i) is satisfied with respect to an item of specified property if, on at least one day that falls within the taxable year, the item of specified property is held by—


(A) The section 245A shareholder;


(B) A person (other than the section 245A shareholder) that, on at least one day that falls within the section 245A shareholder's taxable year, is a related party with respect to the section 245A shareholder (such a person, a *qualified related party* with respect to the section 245A shareholder for the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder); or


(C) A specified entity at least 10 percent of the interests of which are, on at least one day that falls within the section 245A shareholder's taxable year, owned directly or indirectly through one or more other specified entities by the section 245A shareholder or a qualified related party.


(ii) *Rules for determining an interest in a specified entity.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(C) of this section, the phrase *at least 10 percent of the interests* means—


(A) If the specified entity is a foreign corporation, at least 10 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the foreign corporation;


(B) If the specified entity is a partnership, at least 10 percent of the interests in the capital or profits of the partnership; or


(C) If the specified entity is not a foreign corporation or a partnership, at least 10 percent of the value of the interests in the specified entity.


(4) *Basis benefit account*—(i) *General rules.* The term *basis benefit account* means, with respect to an extraordinary disposition account of a section 245A shareholder, an account of the section 245A shareholder (the initial balance of which is zero), adjusted pursuant to the rules of paragraphs (b)(4)(i)(A) and (B) of this section on the last day of each taxable year of the section 245A shareholder. The basis benefit account must be maintained in the same functional currency as the extraordinary disposition account.


(A) The balance of the basis benefit account is increased to the extent that a basis benefit amount with respect to an item of specified property that corresponds to the section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account is assigned to the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder. However, if the extraordinary disposition ownership percentage applicable to the section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account is less than 100 percent, then, the basis benefit account is instead increased by the amount equal to the basis benefit amount multiplied by the extraordinary disposition ownership percentage.


(B) The balance of the basis benefit account is decreased to the extent that, for a taxable year that includes the date on which the section 245A shareholder's taxable year ends, disqualified basis of an item of specified property would have been reduced pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section but for an amount in the basis benefit account.


(ii) *Rules for determining a basis benefit amount*—(A) *In general.* The term *basis benefit amount* means, with respect to an item of specified property that has disqualified basis, the portion of disqualified basis that, for a taxable year, is directly (or indirectly through one or more specified entities that are not corporations) taken into account for U.S. tax purposes by a U.S. tax resident, a CFC described in § 1.267A-5(a)(17), or a specified foreign person and—


(*1*) Reduces the amount of the U.S. tax resident's taxable income, one or more categories of the CFC's positive subpart F income, the CFC's tested income, or the specified foreign person's ECTI, as applicable; or


(*2*) Prevents a decrease or offset of the amount of the CFC's tested loss or qualified deficits.


(B) *Rules for determining whether disqualified basis of an item of specified property is taken into account.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, disqualified basis of an item of specified property is taken into account for U.S. tax purposes without regard to whether the disqualified basis is reduced or eliminated under § 1.951A-3(h)(2)(ii)(B)(*1*).


(C) *Timing rules when disqualified basis gives rise to a deferred or disallowed loss.* To the extent disqualified basis of an item of specified property gives rise to a deduction or loss during a taxable year that is deferred, then the determination of whether the item of deduction or loss gives rise to a basis benefit amount under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section is made when the item of deduction or loss is no longer deferred. In addition, to the extent disqualified basis of an item of specified property gives rise to a deduction or loss during a taxable year that is disallowed under section 267(a)(1), then a basis benefit amount is treated as occurring in the taxable year when and to the extent that gain is reduced pursuant to section 267(d), and provided that the gain is described in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section.


(iii) *Rules for assigning a basis benefit amount to a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder*—(A) *In general.* For purposes of applying paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section with respect to a section 245A shareholder, a basis benefit amount with respect to an item of specified property is assigned to a taxable year of the section 245A shareholder if—


(*1*) With respect to the item of specified property, the ownership requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is satisfied for the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder; and


(*2*) The basis benefit amount occurs during the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder, or a taxable year of a U.S. tax resident (other than the section 245A shareholder), a CFC described in § 1.267A-5(a)(17), or a specified foreign person, as applicable, that—


(*i*) Ends with or within the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder; or


(*ii*) Begins with or within the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder, but only in a case in which but for this paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A)(*2*)(*ii*) the basis benefit amount would not be assigned to a taxable year of the section 245A shareholder.


(B) *Anti-duplication rule.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section, to the extent that disqualified basis of an item of specified property gives rise to a basis benefit amount that is assigned to a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder under paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, and thereafter such disqualified basis gives rise to an additional basis benefit amount, the additional basis benefit amount cannot be assigned to another taxable year of any section 245A shareholder. Thus, for example, if the entire amount of disqualified basis of an item of specified property gives rise to a basis benefit amount for a particular taxable year of a CFC and is assigned to a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder but, pursuant to § 1.951A-3(h)(2)(ii)(B)(*1*)(*ii*), the disqualified basis is not reduced or eliminated in such taxable year of the CFC (because, for example, the buyer is a CFC that is a related party) and, as a result, the disqualified basis thereafter gives rise to an additional basis benefit amount, then no portion of the additional basis benefit amount is assigned to a taxable year of any section 245A shareholder.


(iv) *Successor rules for basis benefit accounts.* To the extent that an extraordinary disposition account of a section 245A shareholder is adjusted pursuant to § 1.245A-5(c)(4), a basis benefit account with respect to the extraordinary disposition account is adjusted in a similar manner.


(5) *Special rules regarding duplicate DQB of an item of exchanged basis property*—(i) *Adjustments to certain rules in applying paragraph (b)(1) of this section.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section for a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder, the following rules apply with respect to duplicate DQB of an item of exchanged basis property:


(A) Duplicate DQB of the item of exchanged basis property with respect to an item of specified property to which the item of exchanged property relates is not taken into account for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the disqualified basis of the item of specified property is taken into account for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Thus, for example, if for a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder the ownership requirement of paragraph (b)(3) of this section is satisfied with respect to an item of specified property and an item of exchanged basis property that relates to the item of specified property, all of the disqualified basis of which is duplicate DQB with respect to the item of specified property, then only the disqualified basis of the item of specified property is taken into account for purposes of, and is subject to reduction under, paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(B) If, pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) of this section, duplicate DQB of an item of exchanged basis property with respect to an item of specified property is not taken into account for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, then, solely for purposes of § 1.951A-2(c)(5), the duplicate DQB of the item of exchanged basis property is reduced (in the same manner as it would be if the disqualified basis were taken into account for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section) by the product of the amounts described in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(B)(*1*) and (*2*) of this section.


(*1*) The reduction, under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder, to the disqualified basis of the item of specified property to which the item of exchanged basis property relates.


(*2*) A fraction, the numerator of which is the duplicate DQB of the item of exchanged basis property with respect to the item of specified property, and the denominator of which is the sum of the amounts of duplicate DQB with respect to the item of specified property of each item of exchanged basis property that relates to the item of specified property and for which the ownership requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is satisfied for the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder. For purposes of determining this fraction, duplicate DQB of an item of exchanged basis property is determined pursuant to the rules of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section (by replacing the term “paragraph (b)(1)” in that paragraph with the term “paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B)”). In addition, duplicate DQB of an item of exchanged basis property is excluded from the denominator of the fraction to the extent the duplicate DQB is attributable to duplicate DQB of another item of exchanged basis property that is included in the denominator of the fraction.


(ii) *Adjustments to certain rules in applying paragraph (b)(4) of this section.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section, to the extent that disqualified basis of an item of specified property gives rise to a basis benefit amount that is assigned to a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder under paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, and thereafter duplicate DQB attributable to such disqualified basis of the item of specified property gives rise to an additional basis benefit amount, the additional basis benefit amount cannot be assigned to another taxable year of any section 245A shareholder. Similarly, for purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section, to the extent that duplicate DQB attributable to disqualified basis of an item of specified property gives rise to a basis benefit amount that is assigned to a taxable year of a section 245A shareholder under paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, and thereafter such disqualified basis of the item of specified property (or duplicate DQB attributable to such disqualified basis of the item of specified property) gives rise to an additional basis benefit amount, the additional basis benefit amount cannot be assigned to another taxable year of any section 245A shareholder.


(6) *Special rule regarding prior extraordinary disposition amounts.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, to the extent that an extraordinary disposition account of a section 245A shareholder is reduced under § 1.245A-5(c)(3)(i)(A) by reason of a prior extraordinary disposition amount described in § 1.245A-5(c)(3)(i)(D)(*1*)(*i*) through (*iv*), the extraordinary disposition account is considered to give rise to an extraordinary disposition amount or tiered extraordinary disposition amount (and the amount by which the account is reduced is treated as an extraordinary disposition amount or tiered extraordinary disposition amount).


(c) *Reduction of extraordinary disposition account by reason of the allocation and apportionment of deductions or losses attributable to disqualified basis*—(1) *In general.* For a taxable year of a CFC, if there is an RGI account with respect to the CFC that relates to an extraordinary disposition account of a section 245A shareholder with respect to an SFC, and the section 245A shareholder satisfies the ownership requirement of paragraph (c)(5) of this section for the taxable year of the CFC, then, subject to the limitations in paragraphs (c)(6) and (7) of this section, the extraordinary disposition account is reduced (but not below zero) by the lesser of the following amounts (each determined in the functional currency of the CFC)—


(i) The excess (if any) of—


(A) The product of—


(*1*) The adjusted earnings of the CFC for the taxable year of the CFC; and


(*2*) The percentage of stock of the CFC (by value) that, in aggregate, is owned directly or indirectly through one or more specified entities by the section 245A shareholder and any domestic affiliates on the last day of the taxable year of the CFC; over


(B) The sum of—


(*1*) The sum of the balance of the section 245A shareholder's and any domestic affiliates' previously taxed earnings and profits accounts with respect to the CFC for purposes of section 959 (determined as of the end of the taxable year of the CFC and taking into account any adjustments to the accounts for the taxable year);


(*2*) The sum of the balance of the hybrid deduction accounts (as described in § 1.245A(e)-1(d)(1)) with respect to shares of stock of the CFC that the section 245A shareholder and any domestic affiliates own (within the meaning of section 958(a), and determined by treating a domestic partnership as foreign) as of the end of the taxable year of the CFC and taking into account any adjustments to the accounts for the taxable year; and


(*3*) The sum of the balance of the section 245A shareholder's and any domestic affiliates' extraordinary disposition accounts with respect to the CFC (determined as of the end of the taxable year of the CFC and taking into account any adjustments to the accounts for the taxable year). However, if the section 245A shareholder or a domestic affiliate has an RGI account with respect to the CFC that relates to an extraordinary disposition account with respect to the CFC, then only the excess, if any, of the balance of the extraordinary disposition account over the balance of the RGI account that relates to the extraordinary disposition account (determined as of the end of the taxable year of the CFC, but without regard to the application of paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section for the taxable year) is taken into account for purposes of this paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B)(*3*). In addition, for purposes of this paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B)(*3*), an extraordinary disposition account that but for paragraph (e)(1) of this section would be with respect to the CFC for purposes of this section is treated as an extraordinary disposition account with respect to the CFC and thus is taken into account for purposes of this paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B)(*3*).


(ii) The balance of the RGI account with respect to the CFC that relates to the section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account with respect to the SFC (determined as of the end of the taxable year of the CFC, but without regard to the application of paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section for the taxable year).


(2) *Timing of reduction to extraordinary disposition account.* See § 1.245A-9(b)(3) for timing rules regarding the reduction to an extraordinary disposition account.


(3) *Adjusted earnings.* The term *adjusted earnings* means, with respect to a CFC and a taxable year of the CFC, the earnings and profits of the CFC, determined as of the end of the CFC's taxable year (taking into account all distributions during the taxable year, and not taking into account any deficit in earnings and profits subject to § 1.381(c)(2)-1(a)(5)) and with the adjustments described in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section.


(i) The earnings and profits are increased by the amount of any deduction or loss that—


(A) Is or was attributable to disqualified basis of an item of specified property, but only to the extent that gain recognized on the extraordinary disposition of the item of specified property was included in the initial balance of an extraordinary disposition account;


(B) Is or was allocated and apportioned to residual CFC gross income of the CFC (or a predecessor) solely by reason of § 1.951A-2(c)(5)(i); and


(C) Does not or has not given rise to or increased a deficit in earnings and profits subject to § 1.381(c)(2)-1(a)(5), determined as of the end of the taxable year of the CFC.


(ii) The earnings and profits are decreased by the amount by which any RGI account with respect to the CFC has been decreased pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section for a prior taxable year of the CFC.


(iii) The earnings and profits are determined without regard to earnings attributable to income described in section 245(a)(5)(A) or dividends described in section 245(a)(5)(B) (determined without regard to section 245(a)(12)).


(iv) The earnings and profits are decreased by the amount of any deduction or loss that, but for paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C) of this section, would be described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.


(4) *RGI account*—(i) *In general.* For a taxable year of a CFC, the following rules apply to determine the balance of a section 245A shareholder's RGI account that is with respect to the CFC and that relates to an extraordinary disposition account of the section 245A shareholder with respect to an SFC:


(A) The balance of the RGI account is increased by the product of the amounts described in paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(A)(*1*) and (2) of this section for a taxable year of the CFC.


(*1*) The sum of the amounts of deductions and losses of the CFC that—


(*i*) Are attributable to disqualified basis of one or more items of specified property that correspond to the extraordinary disposition account; and


(*ii*) But for § 1.951A-2(c)(5)(i), would have decreased one or more categories of the CFC's positive subpart F income, the CFC's tested income, or the CFC's ECTI, or increased or given rise to a tested loss or one or more qualified deficits of the CFC.


(*2*) The lesser of—


(*i*) A fraction (expressed as a percentage), the numerator of which is the sum of the portions of the CFC's subpart F income and tested income or tested loss (expressed as a positive number) taken into account under sections 951(a)(1)(A) and 951A(a) (as determined under the rules of §§ 1.951-1(b) and (e) and 1.951A-1(d)) by the section 245A shareholder and any domestic affiliates of the section 245A shareholder and the section 245A shareholder's and any domestic affiliates' pro rata shares of the CFC's qualified deficits (expressed as a positive number), and the denominator of which is the sum of the CFC's subpart F income, tested income or tested loss (expressed as a positive number), and qualified deficits (expressed as a positive number), but for purposes of this paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A)(*2*)(*i*) treating ECTI (expressed as a positive number) as if it were subpart F income; and


(*ii*) The extraordinary disposition ownership percentage applicable as to the section 245A shareholder's extraordinary disposition account.


(B) The balance of the RGI account is decreased to the extent that, by reason of the application of paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to the taxable year of the CFC, there is a reduction to the extraordinary disposition account of the section 245A shareholder.


(ii) *Successor rules for RGI accounts.* To the extent that an extraordinary disposition account of a section 245A shareholder is adjusted pursuant to § 1.245A-5(c)(4), an RGI account of a CFC with respect to the extraordinary disposition account is adjusted in a similar manner.


(5) *Ownership requirement with respect to a CFC.* For a taxable year of a CFC, a section 245A shareholder satisfies the ownership requirement of this paragraph (c)(5) if, on the last day of the CFC's taxable year, the section 245A shareholder or a domestic affiliate is a United States shareholder with respect to the CFC.


(6) *Allocation of reductions among multiple extraordinary disposition accounts.* This paragraph (c)(6) applies if, by reason of the application of paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to a taxable year of a CFC (and but for the application of this paragraph (c)(6) and paragraph (c)(7) of this section), the sum of the reductions under paragraph (c)(1) of this section to two or more extraordinary disposition accounts of a section 245A shareholder or a domestic affiliate of the section 245A shareholder would exceed the amount described in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section (the amount of such excess, the *excess amount*). When this paragraph (c)(6) applies, the reduction to each extraordinary disposition account described in the previous sentence is equal to the reduction that would occur but for this paragraph (c)(6) and paragraph (c)(7) of this section, less the product of the excess amount and a fraction, the numerator of which is the balance of the extraordinary disposition account, and the denominator of which is the sum of the balances of all of the extraordinary dispositions accounts described in the previous sentence. For purposes of determining this fraction, the balance of an extraordinary disposition account is determined as of the end of the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder or the domestic affiliate, as applicable, that includes the date on which the CFC's taxable year ends (and after the determination of any extraordinary disposition amounts or tiered extraordinary disposition amounts for the taxable year of the section 245A shareholder or the domestic affiliate, as applicable, and adjustments to the extraordinary disposition account for prior extraordinary disposition amounts).


(7) *Extraordinary disposition account not reduced below balance of basis benefit account.* An extraordinary disposition account of a section 245A shareholder cannot be reduced pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section below the balance of the basis benefit account with respect to the extraordinary disposition account (determined when a reduction to the extraordinary disposition account would occur under paragraph (c)(1) of this section).


(d) *Special rules for determining when specified property corresponds to an extraordinary disposition account*—(1) *Substituted property*—(i) *Treatment as specified property that corresponds to an extraordinary disposition account.* For purposes of this section, an item of substituted property is treated as an item of specified property that corresponds to an extraordinary disposition account to which the related item of specified property (that is, the item of specified property to which the item of substituted property relates, as described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section) corresponds. In addition, in a case in which an item of substituted property relates to an item of specified property that corresponds to a particular extraordinary disposition account and an item of specified property that corresponds to another extraordinary disposition account (such that, pursuant to this paragraph (d)(1)(i), the item of substituted property is treated as corresponding to multiple extraordinary disposition accounts), only the disqualified basis of the item of substituted property attributable to the first item of specified property is taken into account for purposes of applying this section as to the first extraordinary disposition account, and, similarly, only the disqualified basis of the item of substituted property attributable to the second item of specified property is taken into account for purposes of applying this section as to the second extraordinary disposition account.


(ii) *Definition of substituted property.* The term *substituted property* means an item of property the disqualified basis of which is, pursuant to § 1.951A-3(h)(2)(ii)(B)(*2*)(*i*) or (*iii*), increased by reason of a reduction under § 1.951A-3(h)(2)(ii)(*B*)(*1*) in disqualified basis of an item of specified property. An item of substituted property relates to an item of specified property if the disqualified basis of the item of substituted property was increased by reason of a reduction in disqualified basis of the item of specified property.


(2) *Exchanged basis property*—(i) *Treatment as specified property that corresponds to an extraordinary disposition account for certain purposes.* For purposes of this section, an item of exchanged basis property is treated as an item of specified property that corresponds to an extraordinary disposition account to which the related item of specified property (that is, the item of specified property to which the item of exchanged basis property relates) corresponds.


(ii) *Definition of exchanged basis property.* The term *exchanged basis property* means an item of property the disqualified basis of which, pursuant to § 1.951A-3(h)(2)(ii)(B)(*2*)(*ii*), includes disqualified basis of an item of specified property. An item of exchanged basis property relates to an item of specified property if the disqualified basis of the item of exchanged basis property includes disqualified basis of the item of specified property.


(iii) *Definition of duplicate DQB*—(A) *In general.* The term *duplicate DQB* means, with respect to an item of exchanged basis property and the item of specified property to which the exchanged basis property relates, the disqualified basis of the item of exchanged basis property that includes or is attributable to disqualified basis of the item of specified property.


(B) *Certain nonrecognition transfers involving stock or a partnership interest.* To the extent that an item of exchanged basis property that is stock or an interest in a partnership (*lower-tier item*) includes disqualified basis of an item of specified property to which the lower-tier item relates (*contributed item*), and another item of exchanged basis property that is stock or a partnership interest (*upper-tier item*) includes disqualified basis of the lower-tier item that is attributable to disqualified basis of the contributed item, the disqualified basis of the upper-tier item is attributable to disqualified basis of the contributed item and the upper-tier item is an item of exchanged basis property that relates to the contributed item. The principles of the preceding sentence apply each time disqualified basis of an item of exchanged basis property that is stock or an interest in a partnership is included in disqualified basis of another item of exchanged basis property that is stock or an interest in a partnership.


(C) *Multiple nonrecognition transfers of an item of specified property.* To the extent that multiple items of exchanged basis property that are stock or interests in a partnership include disqualified basis of the same item of specified property (*contributed item*) to which the items of exchanged basis property relate, and the issuer of one of the items of exchanged basis property (*upper-tier successor item*) receives the other item of exchanged basis property (*lower-tier successor item*) in exchange for the contributed property, the disqualified basis of the upper-tier successor item is attributable to disqualified basis of the lower-tier successor item and the upper-tier successor item is an item of exchanged basis property that relates to the lower-tier successor item. The principles of the preceding sentence apply each time disqualified basis of an item of specified property to which an item of exchanged basis property that is stock or an interest in partnership relates is included in disqualified basis of another item of exchanged basis property that is stock or an interest in a partnership.


(e) *Special rules when extraordinary disposition accounts are adjusted pursuant to § 1.245A-5(c)(4)*—(1) *Extraordinary disposition account with respect to multiple SFCs.* This paragraph (e)(1) applies if, pursuant to § 1.245A-5(c)(4)(ii) or (iii) (the transaction or transactions by reason of which § 1.245A-5(c)(4)(ii) or (iii) applies, the *adjustment transaction*), an extraordinary disposition account of a section 245A shareholder with respect to an SFC (such extraordinary disposition account, the *transferor ED account;* and such SFC, the *transferor SFC*) gives rise to an increase in the balance of an extraordinary disposition account with respect to another SFC (such extraordinary disposition account, the *transferee ED account;* such SFC, the *transferee SFC;* and such increase, the *adjustment amount*). When this paragraph (e)(1) applies, the following rules apply for purposes of this section:


(i) A ratable portion of the transferee ED account is treated as retaining its status as an extraordinary disposition account with respect to the transferor SFC and is not treated as an extraordinary disposition account with respect to the transferee SFC (the transferee ED account to such extent, the *deemed transferor ED account*), based on the adjustment amount relative to the balance of the transferee ED account (without regard to this paragraph (e)(1)) immediately after the adjustment transaction. Thus, for example, whether or not the transferor SFC is in existence immediately after the transaction, the items of specified property that correspond to the deemed transferor ED account are the same as the items of specified property that correspond to the transferor ED account. As an additional example, whether or not the transferor SFC is in existence immediately after the transaction the extraordinary disposition ownership percentage with respect to the deemed transferor ED account is the same as the extraordinary disposition ownership percentage with respect to the transferor ED account (except to the extent the extraordinary disposition ownership percentage is adjusted pursuant to the rules of paragraph (e)(2) of this section).


(ii) In the case of an amount (such as an extraordinary disposition amount or tiered extraordinary disposition amount) determined by reference to the transferee ED account (without regard to this paragraph (e)(1)), the portion of the amount that is considered attributable to the deemed transferor ED account (and not the transferee ED account) is equal to the product of such amount and a fraction, the numerator of which is the balance of the deemed transferor ED account, and the denominator of which is the balance of the transferee ED account (determined without regard to this paragraph (e)(1)). Thus, for example, if after an adjustment transaction the transferee ED account (without regard to this paragraph (e)(1)) gives rise to an extraordinary disposition amount, and if the fraction (expressed as a percentage) is 40, then, for purposes of this section, 40 percent of the extraordinary disposition amount is treated as attributable to the deemed transferor ED account and the remaining 60 percent of the extraordinary disposition amount is attributable to the transferee ED account, and the balance of each of the deemed transferor ED account and the transferee ED account is correspondingly reduced.


(2) *Extraordinary disposition accounts with respect to a single SFC.* If an extraordinary disposition account of a section 245A shareholder with respect to an SFC is reduced by reason of § 1.245A-5(c)(4), then, except as provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, for purposes of this section, the extraordinary disposition ownership percentage as to the extraordinary disposition account (as well as the extraordinary disposition ownership percentage as to any extraordinary disposition account with respect to the SFC that is increased by reason of the reduction) is adjusted in a similar manner.
