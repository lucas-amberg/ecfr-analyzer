# § 1.250(b)-2   Qualified business asset investment (QBAI).

(a) *Scope.* This section provides general rules for determining the qualified business asset investment of a domestic corporation for purposes of determining its deemed tangible income return under § 1.250(b)-1(c)(4). Paragraph (b) of this section defines qualified business asset investment (QBAI). Paragraph (c) of this section defines tangible property and specified tangible property. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules for determining the portion of property that is specified tangible property when the property is used in the production of both gross DEI and gross income that is not gross DEI. Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules for determining the adjusted basis of specified tangible property. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules for determining QBAI of a domestic corporation with a short taxable year. Paragraph (g) of this section provides rules for increasing the QBAI of a domestic corporation by reason of property owned through a partnership. Paragraph (h) of this section provides an anti-avoidance rule that disregards certain transfers when determining the QBAI of a domestic corporation.


(b) *Definition of qualified business asset investment.* The term *qualified business asset investment (QBAI)* means the average of a domestic corporation's aggregate adjusted bases as of the close of each quarter of the domestic corporation's taxable year in specified tangible property that is used in a trade or business of the domestic corporation and is of a type with respect to which a deduction is allowable under section 167. In the case of partially depreciable property, only the depreciable portion of the property is of a type with respect to which a deduction is allowable under section 167.


(c) *Specified tangible property*—(1) *In general.* The term *specified tangible property* means, with respect to a domestic corporation for a taxable year, tangible property of the domestic corporation used in the production of gross DEI for the taxable year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, tangible property of a domestic corporation is used in the production of gross DEI for a taxable year if some or all of the depreciation or cost recovery allowance with respect to the tangible property is either allocated and apportioned to the gross DEI of the domestic corporation for the taxable year under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2) or capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, some or all of the gross income or loss from the sale of which is taken into account in determining DEI of the domestic corporation for the taxable year.


(2) *Tangible property.* The term *tangible property* means property for which the depreciation deduction provided by section 167(a) is eligible to be determined under section 168 without regard to section 168(f)(1), (2), or (5), section 168(k)(2)(A)(i)(II), (IV), or (V), and the date placed in service.


(d) *Dual use property*—(1) *In general.* The amount of the adjusted basis in dual use property of a domestic corporation for a taxable year that is treated as adjusted basis in specified tangible property for the taxable year is the average of the domestic corporation's adjusted basis in the property multiplied by the dual use ratio with respect to the property for the taxable year.


(2) *Definition of dual use property.* The term *dual use property* means, with respect to a domestic corporation and a taxable year, specified tangible property of the domestic corporation that is used in both the production of gross DEI and the production of gross income that is not gross DEI for the taxable year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, specified tangible property of a domestic corporation is used in the production of gross DEI and the production of gross income that is not gross DEI for a taxable year if less than all of the depreciation or cost recovery allowance with respect to the property is either allocated and apportioned to the gross DEI of the domestic corporation for the taxable year under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2) or capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, the gross income or loss from the sale of which is taken into account in determining the DEI of the domestic corporation for the taxable year.


(3) *Dual use ratio.* The term *dual use ratio* means, with respect to dual use property, a domestic corporation, and a taxable year, a ratio (expressed as a percentage) calculated as—


(i) The sum of—


(A) The depreciation deduction or cost recovery allowance with respect to the property that is allocated and apportioned to the gross DEI of the domestic corporation for the taxable year under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2); and


(B) The depreciation or cost recovery allowance with respect to the property that is capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, the gross income or loss from the sale of which is taken into account in determining the DEI of the domestic corporation for the taxable year; divided by


(ii) The sum of—


(A) The total amount of the domestic corporation's depreciation deduction or cost recovery allowance with respect to the property for the taxable year; and


(B) The total amount of the domestic corporation's depreciation or cost recovery allowance with respect to the property capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, the gross income or loss from the sale of which is taken into account in determining the income or loss of the domestic corporation for the taxable year.


(4) *Example.* The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (d).


(i) *Facts.* DC, a domestic corporation, owns a machine that produces both gross DEI and income that is not gross DEI. The average adjusted basis of the machine for the taxable year in the hands of DC is $4,000x. The depreciation with respect to the machine for the taxable year is $400x, $320x of which is capitalized to inventory of Product A, gross income or loss from the sale of which is taken into account in determining DC's gross DEI for the taxable year, and $80x of which is capitalized to inventory of Product B, gross income or loss from the sale of which is not taken into account in determining DC's gross DEI for the taxable year. DC also owns an office building for its administrative functions with an average adjusted basis for the taxable year of $10,000x. DC does not capitalize depreciation with respect to the office building to inventory or other property held for sale. DC's depreciation deduction with respect to the office building is $1,000x for the taxable year, $750x of which is allocated and apportioned to gross DEI under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2), and $250x of which is allocated and apportioned to income other than gross DEI under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2).


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Dual use property.* The machine and office building are property for which the depreciation deduction provided by section 167(a) is eligible to be determined under section 168 (without regard to section 168(f)(1), (2), or (5), section 168(k)(2)(A)(i)(II), (IV), or (V), and the date placed in service). Therefore, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the machine and office building are tangible property. Furthermore, because the machine and office building are used in the production of gross DEI for the taxable year within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the machine and office building are specified tangible property. Finally, because the machine and office building are used in both the production of gross DEI and the production of gross income that is not gross DEI for the taxable year within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the machine and office building are dual use property. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the amount of DC's adjusted basis in the machine and office building that is treated as adjusted basis in specified tangible property for the taxable year is determined by multiplying DC's adjusted basis in the machine and office building by DC's dual use ratio with respect to the machine and office building determined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.


(B) *Depreciation not capitalized to inventory.* Because none of the depreciation with respect to the office building is capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, DC's dual use ratio with respect to the office building is determined entirely by reference to the depreciation deduction with respect to the office building. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, DC's dual use ratio with respect to the office building for Year 1 is 75 percent, which is DC's depreciation deduction with respect to the office building that is allocated and apportioned to gross DEI under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2) for Year 1 ($750x), divided by the total amount of DC's depreciation deduction with respect to the office building for Year 1 ($1000x). Accordingly, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, $7,500x ($10,000x × 0.75) of DC's average adjusted bases in the office building is taken into account under paragraph (b) of this section in determining DC's QBAI for the taxable year.


(C) *Depreciation capitalized to inventory.* Because all of the depreciation with respect to the machine is capitalized to inventory, DC's dual use ratio with respect to the machine is determined entirely by reference to the depreciation with respect to the machine that is capitalized to inventory and included in cost of goods sold. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, DC's dual use ratio with respect to the machine for the taxable year is 80 percent, which is DC's depreciation with respect to the machine that is capitalized to inventory of Product A, the gross income or loss from the sale of which is taken into account in determining DC's DEI for the taxable year ($320x), divided by DC's depreciation with respect to the machine that is capitalized to inventory, the gross income or loss from the sale of which is taken into account in determining DC's income for Year 1 ($400x). 



Accordingly, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, $3,200x ($4,000x × 0.8) of DC's average adjusted basis in the machine is taken into account under paragraph (b) of this section in determining DC's QBAI for the taxable year.


(e) *Determination of adjusted basis of specified tangible property*—(1) *In general.* The adjusted basis in specified tangible property for purposes of this section is determined by using the cost capitalization methods of accounting used by the domestic corporation for purposes of determining the gross income and deductions of the domestic corporation and the alternative depreciation system under section 168(g), and by allocating the depreciation deduction with respect to such property for the domestic corporation's taxable year ratably to each day during the period in the taxable year to which such depreciation relates. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the period in the taxable year to which such depreciation relates is determined without regard to the applicable convention under section 168(d).


(2) *Effect of change in law.* The adjusted basis in specified tangible property is determined without regard to any provision of law enacted after December 22, 2017, unless such later enacted law specifically and directly amends the definition of QBAI under section 250 or section 951A. For purposes of applying section 250(b)(2)(B) and this paragraph (e), the technical amendment to section 168(g) (to provide a recovery period of 20 years for qualified improvement property for purposes of the alternative depreciation system) enacted in section 2307(a) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, Public Law 116-136 (2020) is treated as enacted on December 22, 2017.


(3) *Specified tangible property placed in service before enactment of section 250.* The adjusted basis in specified tangible property placed in service before December 22, 2017, is determined using the alternative depreciation system under section 168(g), as if this system had applied from the date that the property was placed in service.


(f) *Special rules for short taxable years*—(1) *In general.* In the case of a domestic corporation that has a taxable year that is less than twelve months (a *short taxable year*), the rules for determining the QBAI of the domestic corporation under this section are modified as provided in paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section with respect to the taxable year.


(2) *Determination of when the quarter closes.* For purposes of determining when the quarter closes, in determining the QBAI of a domestic corporation for a short taxable year, the quarters of the domestic corporation for purposes of this section are the full quarters beginning and ending within the short taxable year (if any), determining quarter length as if the domestic corporation did not have a short taxable year, plus one or more short quarters (if any).


(3) *Reduction of qualified business asset investment.* The QBAI of a domestic corporation for a short taxable year is the sum of—


(i) The sum of the domestic corporation's aggregate adjusted bases in specified tangible property as of the close of each full quarter (if any) in the domestic corporation's taxable year divided by four; plus


(ii) The domestic corporation's aggregate adjusted bases in specified tangible property as of the close of each short quarter (if any) in the domestic corporation's taxable year multiplied by the sum of the number of days in each short quarter divided by 365.


(4) *Example.* The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (f).


(i) *Facts.* A, an individual, owns all of the stock of DC, a domestic corporation. A owns DC from the beginning of the taxable year. On July 15 of the taxable year, A sells DC to USP, a domestic corporation that is unrelated to A. DC becomes a member of the consolidated group of which USP is the common parent and as a result, under § 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii), DC's taxable year is treated as ending on July 15. USP and DC both use the calendar year as their taxable year. DC's aggregate adjusted bases in specified tangible property for the taxable year are $250x as of March 31, $300x as of June 30, $275x as of July 15, $500x as of September 30, and $450x as of December 31.


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Determination of short taxable years and quarters.* DC has two short taxable years during the year. The first short taxable year is from January 1 to July 15, with two full quarters (January 1 through March 31 and April 1 through June 30) and one short quarter (July 1 through July 15). The second taxable year is from July 16 to December 31, with one short quarter (July 16 through September 30) and one full quarter (October 1 through December 31).


(B) *Calculation of qualified business asset investment for the first short taxable year.* Under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, for the first short taxable year, DC has three quarter closes (March 31, June 30, and July 15). Under paragraph (f)(3) of this section, the QBAI of DC for the first short taxable year is $148.80x, the sum of $137.50x (($250x + $300x)/4) attributable to the two full quarters and $11.30x ($275x × 15/365) attributable to the short quarter.


(C) *Calculation of qualified business asset investment for the second short taxable year.* Under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, for the second short taxable year, DC has two quarter closes (September 30 and December 31). Under paragraph (f)(3) of this section, the QBAI of DC for the second short taxable year is $217.98x, the sum of $112.50x ($450x/4) attributable to the one full quarter and $105.48x ($500x × 77/365) attributable to the short quarter.


(g) *Partnership property*—(1) *In general.* If a domestic corporation holds an interest in one or more partnerships during a taxable year (including indirectly through one or more partnerships that are partners in a lower-tier partnership), the QBAI of the domestic corporation for the taxable year (determined without regard to this paragraph (g)(1)) is increased by the sum of the domestic corporation's partnership QBAI with respect to each partnership for the taxable year.


(2) *Determination of partnership QBAI.* For purposes of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the term *partnership QBAI* means, with respect to a partnership, a domestic corporation, and a taxable year, the sum of the domestic corporation's partner adjusted basis in each partnership specified tangible property of the partnership for each partnership taxable year that ends with or within the taxable year. If a partnership taxable year is less than twelve months, the principles of paragraph (f) of this section apply in determining a domestic corporation's partnership QBAI with respect to the partnership.


(3) *Determination of partner adjusted basis*—(i) *In general.* For purposes of paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the term *partner adjusted basis* means the amount described in paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section with respect to sole use partnership property or paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section with respect to dual use partnership property. The principles of section 706(d) apply to this determination.


(ii) *Sole use partnership property*—(A) *In general.* The amount described in this paragraph (g)(3)(ii), with respect to sole use partnership property, a partnership taxable year, and a domestic corporation, is the sum of the domestic corporation's proportionate share of the partnership adjusted basis in the sole use partnership property for the partnership taxable year and the domestic corporation's partner-specific QBAI basis in the sole use partnership property for the partnership taxable year.


(B) *Definition of sole use partnership property.* The term *sole use partnership property* means, with respect to a partnership, a partnership taxable year, and a domestic corporation, partnership specified tangible property of the partnership that is used in the production of only gross DEI of the domestic corporation for the taxable year in which or with which the partnership taxable year ends. For purposes of the preceding sentence, partnership specified tangible property of a partnership is used in the production of only gross DEI for a taxable year if all the domestic corporation's distributive share of the partnership's depreciation deduction or cost recovery allowance with respect to the property (if any) for the partnership taxable year that ends with or within the taxable year is allocated and apportioned to the domestic corporation's gross DEI for the taxable year under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2) and, if any of the partnership's depreciation or cost recovery allowance with respect to the property is capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, all the domestic corporation's distributive share of the partnership's gross income or loss from the sale of such inventory or other property for the partnership taxable year that ends with or within the taxable year is taken into account in determining the DEI of the domestic corporation for the taxable year.


(iii) *Dual use partnership property*—(A) *In general.* The amount described in this paragraph (g)(3)(iii), with respect to dual use partnership property, a partnership taxable year, and a domestic corporation, is the sum of the domestic corporation's proportionate share of the partnership adjusted basis in the property for the partnership taxable year and the domestic corporation's partner-specific QBAI basis in the property for the partnership taxable year, multiplied by the domestic corporation's dual use ratio with respect to the property for the partnership taxable year determined under the principles of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, except that the ratio described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section is determined by reference to the domestic corporation's distributive share of the amounts described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.


(B) *Definition of dual use partnership property.* The term *dual use partnership property* means partnership specified tangible property other than sole use partnership property.


(4) *Determination of proportionate share of the partnership's adjusted basis in partnership specified tangible property*—(i) *In general.* For purposes of paragraph (g)(3) of this section, the domestic corporation's proportionate share of the partnership adjusted basis in partnership specified tangible property for a partnership taxable year is the partnership adjusted basis in the property multiplied by the domestic corporation's proportionate share ratio with respect to the property for the partnership taxable year. Solely for purposes of determining the proportionate share ratio under paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section, the partnership's calculation of, and a partner's distributive share of, any income, loss, depreciation, or cost recovery allowance is determined under section 704(b).


(ii) *Proportionate share ratio.* The term *proportionate share ratio* means, with respect to a partnership, a partnership taxable year, and a domestic corporation, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) calculated as—


(A) The sum of—


(*1*) The domestic corporation's distributive share of the partnership's depreciation deduction or cost recovery allowance with respect to the property for the partnership taxable year; and


(*2*) The amount of the partnership's depreciation or cost recovery allowance with respect to the property that is capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, the gross income or loss from the sale of which is taken into account in determining the domestic corporation's distributive share of the partnership's income or loss for the partnership taxable year; divided by


(B) The sum of—


(*1*) The total amount of the partnership's depreciation deduction or cost recovery allowance with respect to the property for the partnership taxable year; and


(*2*) The total amount of the partnership's depreciation or cost recovery allowance with respect to the property capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, the gross income or loss from the sale of which is taken into account in determining the partnership's income or loss for the partnership taxable year.


(5) *Definition of partnership specified tangible property.* The term *partnership specified tangible property* means, with respect to a domestic corporation, tangible property (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) of a partnership that is—


(i) Used in the trade or business of the partnership;


(ii) Of a type with respect to which a deduction is allowable under section 167; and


(iii) Used in the production of gross income included in the domestic corporation's gross DEI.


(6) *Determination of partnership adjusted basis.* For purposes of this paragraph (g), the term *partnership adjusted basis* means, with respect to a partnership, partnership specified tangible property, and a partnership taxable year, the amount equal to the average of the partnership's adjusted basis in the partnership specified tangible property as of the close of each quarter in the partnership taxable year determined without regard to any adjustments under section 734(b) except for adjustments under section 734(b)(1)(B) or section 734(b)(2)(B) that are attributable to distributions of tangible property (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) and for adjustments under section 734(b)(1)(A) or 734(b)(2)(A). The principles of paragraphs (e) and (h) of this section apply for purposes of determining a partnership's adjusted basis in partnership specified tangible property and the proportionate share of the partnership's adjusted basis in partnership specified tangible property.


(7) *Determination of partner-specific QBAI basis.* For purposes of this paragraph (g), the term *partner-specific QBAI basis* means, with respect to a domestic corporation, a partnership, and partnership specified tangible property, the amount that is equal to the average of the basis adjustment under section 743(b) that is allocated to the partnership specified tangible property of the partnership with respect to the domestic corporation as of the close of each quarter in the partnership taxable year. For this purpose, a negative basis adjustment under section 743(b) is expressed as a negative number. The principles of paragraphs (e) and (h) of this section apply for purposes of determining the partner-specific QBAI basis with respect to partnership specified tangible property.


(8) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (g).


(i) *Assumed facts.* Except as otherwise stated, the following facts are assumed for purposes of the examples:


(A) DC, DC1, DC2, and DC3 are domestic corporations.


(B) PRS is a partnership and its allocations satisfy the requirements of section 704.


(C) All properties are partnership specified tangible property.


(D) All persons use the calendar year as their taxable year.


(E) There is no partner-specific QBAI basis with respect to any property.


(ii) *Example 1: Sole use partnership property*—(A) *Facts.* DC is a partner in PRS. PRS owns two properties, Asset A and Asset B. The average of PRS's adjusted basis as of the close of each quarter of PRS's taxable year in Asset A is $100x and in Asset B is $500x. In Year 1, PRS's section 704(b) depreciation deduction is $10x with respect to Asset A and $5x with respect to Asset B, and DC's section 704(b) distributive share of the depreciation deduction is $8x with respect to Asset A and $1x with respect to Asset B. None of the depreciation with respect to Asset A or Asset B is capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale. DC's entire distributive share of the depreciation deduction with respect to Asset A and Asset B is allocated and apportioned to DC's gross DEI for Year 1 under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2).


(B) *Analysis*—(*1*) *Sole use partnership property.* Because all of DC's distributive share of the depreciation deduction with respect to Asset A and B is allocated and apportioned to gross DEI for Year 1, Asset A and Asset B are sole use partnership property within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(B) of this section. Therefore, under paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset A and Asset B is equal to the sum of DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset A and Asset B for Year 1 and DC's partner-specific QBAI basis in Asset A and Asset B for Year 1, respectively.


(*2*) *Proportionate share.* Under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset A and Asset B is PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset A and Asset B for Year 1, multiplied by DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset A and Asset B for Year 1, respectively. Because none of the depreciation with respect to Asset A or Asset B is capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset A and Asset B is determined entirely by reference to the depreciation deduction with respect to Asset A and Asset B. Therefore, DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset A for Year 1 is 80 percent, which is the ratio of DC's section 704(b) distributive share of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation deduction with respect to Asset A for Year 1 ($8x), divided by the total amount of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation deduction with respect to Asset A for Year 1 ($10x). DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset B for Year 1 is 20 percent, which is the ratio of DC's section 704(b) distributive share of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation deduction with respect to Asset B for Year 1 ($1x), divided by the total amount of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation deduction with respect to Asset B for Year 1 ($5x). Accordingly, under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset A is $80x ($100x × 0.8), and DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset B is $100x ($500x × 0.2).


(*3*) *Partner adjusted basis.* Because DC has no partner-specific QBAI basis with respect to Asset A and Asset B, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset A and Asset B is determined entirely by reference to its proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset A and Asset B. Therefore, under paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset A is $80x, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset A, and DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset B is $100x, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset B.


(*4*) *Partnership QBAI.* Under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, DC's partnership QBAI with respect to PRS is $180x, the sum of DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset A ($80x) and DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset B ($100x). Accordingly, under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, DC increases its QBAI for Year 1 by $180x.


(iii) *Example 2: Dual use partnership property*—(A) *Facts.* DC owns a 50 percent interest in PRS. All section 704(b) and tax items are identical and are allocated equally between DC and its other partner. PRS owns three properties, Asset C, Asset D, and Asset E. PRS sells two products, Product A and Product B. All of DC's distributive share of the gross income or loss from the sale of Product A is taken into account in determining DC's DEI, and none of DC's distributive share of the gross income or loss from the sale of Product B is taken into account in determining DC's DEI.


(*1*) *Asset C.* The average of PRS's adjusted basis as of the close of each quarter of PRS's taxable year in Asset C is $100x. In Year 1, PRS's depreciation is $10x with respect to Asset C, none of which is capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale. DC's distributive share of the depreciation deduction with respect to Asset C is $5x ($10x × 0.5), $3x of which is allocated and apportioned to DC's gross DEI under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2).


(*2*) *Asset D.* The average of PRS's adjusted basis as of the close of each quarter of PRS's taxable year in Asset D is $500x. In Year 1, PRS's depreciation is $50x with respect to Asset D, $10x of which is capitalized to inventory of Product A and $40x is capitalized to inventory of Product B. None of the $10x depreciation with respect to Asset D capitalized to inventory of Product A is capitalized to ending inventory. However, of the $40x capitalized to inventory of Product B, $10x is capitalized to ending inventory. Therefore, the amount of depreciation with respect to Asset D capitalized to inventory of Product A that is taken into account in determining DC's distributive share of the income or loss of PRS for Year 1 is $5x ($10x × 0.5), and the amount of depreciation with respect to Asset D capitalized to inventory of Product B that is taken into account in determining DC's distributive share of the income or loss of PRS for Year 1 is $15x ($30x × 0.5).


(*3*) *Asset E.* The average of PRS's adjusted basis as of the close of each quarter of PRS's taxable year in Asset E is $600x. In Year 1, PRS's depreciation is $60x with respect to Asset E. Of the $60x depreciation with respect to Asset E, $20x is allowed as a deduction, $24x is capitalized to inventory of Product A, and $16x is capitalized to inventory of Product B. DC's distributive share of the depreciation deduction with respect to Asset E is $10x ($20x × 0.5), $8x of which is allocated and apportioned to DC's gross DEI under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2). None of the $24x depreciation with respect to Asset E capitalized to inventory of Product A is capitalized to ending inventory. However, of the $16x depreciation with respect to Asset E capitalized to inventory of Product B, $10x is capitalized to ending inventory. Therefore, the amount of depreciation with respect to Asset E capitalized to inventory of Product A that is taken into account in determining DC's distributive share of the income or loss of PRS for Year 1 is $12x ($24x × 0.5), and the amount of depreciation with respect to Asset E capitalized to inventory of Product B that is taken into account in determining DC's distributive share of the income or loss of PRS for Year 1 is $3x ($6x × 0.5).


(B) *Analysis.* Because Asset C, Asset D, and Asset E are not used in the production of only gross DEI in Year 1 within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, Asset C, Asset D, and Asset E are dual use partnership property within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(B) of this section. Therefore, under paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset C, Asset D, and Asset E is the sum of DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset C, Asset D, and Asset E, respectively, for Year 1, and DC's partner-specific QBAI basis in Asset C, Asset D, and Asset E, respectively, for Year 1, multiplied by DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset C, Asset D, and Asset E, respectively, for Year 1, determined under the principles of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, except that the ratio described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section is determined by reference to DC's distributive share of the amounts described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.


(*1*) *Asset C*—(*i*) *Proportionate share.* Under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset C is PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset C for Year 1, multiplied by DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset C for Year 1. Because none of the depreciation with respect to Asset C is capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset C is determined entirely by reference to the depreciation deduction with respect to Asset C. Therefore, DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset C is 50 percent, which is the ratio calculated as the amount of DC's section 704(b) distributive share of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation deduction with respect to Asset C for Year 1 ($5x), divided by the total amount of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation deduction with respect to Asset C for Year 1 ($10x). Accordingly, under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset C is $50x ($100x × 0.5).


(*ii*) *Dual use ratio.* Because none of the depreciation with respect to Asset C is capitalized to inventory or other property held for sale, DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset C is determined entirely by reference to the depreciation deduction with respect to Asset C. Therefore, DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset C is 60 percent, which is the ratio calculated as the amount of DC's distributive share of PRS's depreciation deduction with respect to Asset C that is allocated and apportioned to DC's gross DEI under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2) for Year 1 ($3x), divided by the total amount of DC's distributive share of PRS's depreciation deduction with respect to Asset C for Year 1 ($5x).


(*iii*) *Partner adjusted basis.* Because DC has no partner-specific QBAI basis with respect to Asset C, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset C is determined entirely by reference to DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset C, multiplied by DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset C. Under paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset C is $30x, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset C for Year 1 ($50x), multiplied by DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset C for Year 1 (60 percent).


(*2*) *Asset D*—(*i*) *Proportionate share.* Under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset D is PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset D for Year 1, multiplied by DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset D for Year 1. Because all of the depreciation with respect to Asset D is capitalized to inventory, DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset D is determined entirely by reference to the depreciation with respect to Asset D that is capitalized to inventory and included in cost of goods sold. Therefore, DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset D is 50 percent, which is the ratio calculated as the amount of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation with respect to Asset D capitalized to Product A and Product B that is taken into account in determining DC's section 704(b) distributive share of PRS's income or loss for Year 1 ($20x), divided by the total amount of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation with respect to Asset D capitalized to Product A and Product B that is taken into account in determining PRS's section 704(b) income or loss for Year 1 ($40x). Accordingly, under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset D is $250x ($500x × 0.5).


(*ii*) *Dual use ratio.* Because all of the depreciation with respect to Asset D is capitalized to inventory, DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset D is determined entirely by reference to the depreciation with respect to Asset D that is capitalized to inventory and included in cost of goods sold. Therefore, DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset D is 25 percent, which is the ratio calculated as the amount of depreciation with respect to Asset D capitalized to inventory of Product A and Product B that is taken into account in determining DC's DEI for Year 1 ($5x), divided by the total amount of depreciation with respect to Asset D capitalized to inventory of Product A and Product B that is taken into account in determining DC's income or loss for Year 1 ($20x).


(*iii*) *Partner adjusted basis.* Because DC has no partner-specific QBAI basis with respect to Asset D, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset D is determined entirely by reference to DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset D, multiplied by DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset D. Under paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset D is $62.50x, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset D for Year 1 ($250x), multiplied by DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset D for Year 1 (25 percent).


(*3*) *Asset E*—(*i*) *Proportionate share.* Under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset E is PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset E for Year 1, multiplied by DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset E for Year 1. Because the depreciation with respect to Asset E is partly deducted and partly capitalized to inventory, DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset E is determined by reference to both the depreciation that is deducted and the depreciation that is capitalized to inventory and included in cost of goods sold. Therefore, DC's proportionate share ratio with respect to Asset E is 50 percent, which is the ratio calculated as the sum ($25x) of the amount of DC's section 704(b) distributive share of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation deduction with respect to Asset E for Year 1 ($10x) and the amount of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation with respect to Asset E capitalized to inventory of Product A and Product B that is taken into account in determining DC's section 704(b) distributive share of PRS's income or loss for Year 1 ($15x), divided by the sum ($50x) of the total amount of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation deduction with respect to Asset E for Year 1 ($20x) and the total amount of PRS's section 704(b) depreciation with respect to Asset E capitalized to inventory of Product A and Product B that is taken into account in determining PRS's section 704(b) income or loss for Year 1 ($30x). Accordingly, under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset E is $300x ($600x × 0.5).


(*ii*) *Dual use ratio.* Because the depreciation with respect to Asset E is partly deducted and partly capitalized to inventory, DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset E is determined by reference to the depreciation that is deducted and the depreciation that is capitalized to inventory and included in cost of goods sold. Therefore, DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset E is 80 percent, which is the ratio calculated as the sum ($20x) of the amount of DC's distributive share of PRS's depreciation deduction with respect to Asset E that is allocated and apportioned to DC's gross DEI under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2) for Year 1 ($8x) and the amount of depreciation with respect to Asset E capitalized to inventory of Product A and Product B that is taken into account in determining DC's DEI for Year 1 ($12x), divided by the sum ($25x) of the total amount of DC's distributive share of PRS's depreciation deduction with respect to Asset E for Year 1 ($10x) and the total amount of depreciation with respect to Asset E capitalized to inventory of Product A and Product B that is taken into account in determining DC's income or loss for Year 1 ($15x).


(*iii*) *Partner adjusted basis.* Because DC has no partner-specific QBAI basis with respect to Asset E, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset E is determined entirely by reference to DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset E, multiplied by DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset E. Under paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset E is $240x, DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset E for Year 1 ($300x), multiplied by DC's dual use ratio with respect to Asset E for Year 1 (80 percent).


(*4*) *Partnership QBAI.* Under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, DC's partnership QBAI with respect to PRS is $332.50x, the sum of DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset C ($30x), DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset D ($62.50x), and DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset E ($240x). Accordingly, under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, DC increases its QBAI for Year 1 by $332.50x.


(iv) *Example 3: Sole use partnership specified tangible property; section 743(b) adjustments*—(A) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(8)(ii)(A) of this section (the facts in *Example 1*), except that there is an average of $40x positive adjustment to the adjusted basis in Asset A as of the close of each quarter of PRS's taxable year with respect to DC under section 743(b) and an average of $20x negative adjustment to the adjusted basis in Asset B as of the close of each quarter of PRS's taxable year with respect to DC under section 743(b).


(B) *Analysis.* Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset A is $120x, which is the sum of $80x (DC's proportionate share of PRS's partnership adjusted basis in Asset A as illustrated in paragraph (g)(8)(ii)(B)(*2*) of this section (the analysis in *Example 1*)) and $40x (DC's partner-specific QBAI basis in Asset A). Under paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, DC's partner adjusted basis in Asset B is $80x, the sum of $100x (DC's proportionate share of the partnership adjusted basis in the property as illustrated in paragraph (g)(8)(ii)(B)(*2*) of this section (the analysis in *Example 1*)) and (−$20x) (DC's partner-specific QBAI basis in Asset B). Therefore, under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, DC's partnership QBAI with respect to PRS is $200x ($120x + $80x). Accordingly, under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, DC increases its QBAI for Year 1 by $200x.


(v) *Example 4: Sale of partnership interest before close of taxable year*—(A) *Facts.* DC1 owns a 50 percent interest in PRS on January 1 of Year 1. PRS does not have an election under section 754 in effect. On July 1 of Year 1, DC1 sells its entire interest in PRS to DC2. PRS owns Asset G. The average of PRS's adjusted basis as of the close of each quarter of PRS's taxable year in Asset G is $100x. DC1's section 704(b) distributive share of the depreciation deduction with respect to Asset G is 25 percent with respect to PRS's entire year. DC2's section 704(b) distributive share of the depreciation deduction with respect to Asset G is also 25 percent with respect to PRS's entire year. Both DC1's and DC2's entire distributive shares of the depreciation deduction with respect to Asset G are allocated and apportioned under § 1.250(b)-1(d)(2) to DC1's and DC2's gross DEI, respectively, for Year 1. PRS's allocations satisfy section 706(d).


(B) *Analysis*—(*1*) *DC1.* Because DC1 owns an interest in PRS during DC1's taxable year and receives a distributive share of partnership items of the partnership under section 706(d), DC1 has partnership QBAI with respect to PRS in the amount determined under paragraph (g)(2) of this section. Under paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, DC1's partner adjusted basis in Asset G is $25x, the product of $100x (the partnership's adjusted basis in the property) and 25 percent (DC1's section 704(b) distributive share of depreciation deduction with respect to Asset G). Therefore, DC1's partnership QBAI with respect to PRS is $25x. Accordingly, under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, DC1 increases its QBAI by $25x for Year 1.


(*2*) *DC2.* DC2's partner adjusted basis in Asset G is also $25x, the product of $100x (the partnership's adjusted basis in the property) and 25 percent (DC2's section 704(b) distributive share of depreciation deduction with respect to Asset G). Therefore, DC2's partnership QBAI with respect to PRS is $25x. Accordingly, under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, DC2 increases its QBAI by $25x for Year 1.


(vi) *Example 5: Partnership adjusted basis; distribution of property in liquidation of partnership interest*—(A) *Facts.* DC1, DC2, and DC3 are equal partners in PRS, a partnership. DC1 and DC2 each has an adjusted basis of $100x in its partnership interest. DC3 has an adjusted basis of $50x in its partnership interest. PRS has a section 754 election in effect. PRS owns Asset H with a fair market value of $50x and an adjusted basis of $0, Asset I with a fair market value of $100x and an adjusted basis of $100x, and Asset J with a fair market value of $150x and an adjusted basis of $150x. Asset H and Asset J are tangible property, but Asset I is not tangible property. PRS distributes Asset I to DC3 in liquidation of DC3's interest in PRS. None of DC1, DC2, DC3, or PRS recognizes gain on the distribution. Under section 732(b), DC3's adjusted basis in Asset I is $50x. PRS's adjusted basis in Asset H is increased by $50x to $50x under section 734(b)(1)(B), which is the amount by which PRS's adjusted basis in Asset I immediately before the distribution exceeds DC3's adjusted basis in Asset I.


(B) *Analysis.* Under paragraph (g)(6) of this section, PRS's adjusted basis in Asset H is determined without regard to any adjustments under section 734(b) except for adjustments under section 734(b)(1)(B) or section 734(b)(2)(B) that are attributable to distributions of tangible property and for adjustments under section 734(b)(1)(A) or 734(b)(2)(A). The adjustment to the adjusted basis in Asset H is under section 734(b)(1)(B) and is attributable to the distribution of Asset I, which is not tangible property. Accordingly, for purposes of applying paragraph (g)(1) of this section, PRS's adjusted basis in Asset H is $0.


(h) *Anti-avoidance rule for certain transfers of property*—(1) *In general.* If, with a principal purpose of decreasing the amount of its deemed tangible income return, a domestic corporation transfers specified tangible property (*transferred property*) to a specified related party of the domestic corporation and, within the disqualified period, the domestic corporation or an FDII-eligible related party of the domestic corporation leases the same or substantially similar property from any specified related party, then, solely for purposes of determining the QBAI of the domestic corporation under paragraph (b) of this section, the domestic corporation is treated as owning the transferred property from the later of the beginning of the term of the lease or date of the transfer of the property until the earlier of the end of the term of the lease or the end of the recovery period of the property.


(2) *Rule for structured arrangements.* For purposes of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, a transfer of specified tangible property to a person that is not a related party or lease of property from a person that is not a related party is treated as a transfer to or lease from a specified related party if the transfer or lease is pursuant to a structured arrangement. A structured arrangement exists only if either paragraph (h)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section is satisfied.


(i) The reduction in the domestic corporation's deemed tangible income return is priced into the terms of the arrangement with the transferee.


(ii) Based on all the facts and circumstances, the reduction in the domestic corporation's deemed tangible income return is a principal purpose of the arrangement. Facts and circumstances that indicate the reduction in the domestic corporation's deemed tangible income return is a principal purpose of the arrangement include—


(A) Marketing the arrangement as tax-advantaged where some or all of the tax advantage derives from the reduction in the domestic corporation's deemed tangible income return;


(B) Primarily marketing the arrangement to domestic corporations which earn FDDEI;


(C) Features that alter the terms of the arrangement, including the return, in the event the reduction in the domestic corporation's deemed tangible income return is no longer relevant; or


(D) A below-market return absent the tax effects or benefits resulting from the reduction in the domestic corporation's deemed tangible income return.


(3) *Per se rules for certain transactions.* For purposes of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, a transfer of property by a domestic corporation to a specified related party (including a party deemed to be a specified related party under paragraph (h)(2) of this section) followed by a lease of the same or substantially similar property by the domestic corporation or an FDII-eligible related party from a specified related party (including a party deemed to be a specified related party under paragraph (h)(2) of this section) is treated per se as occurring pursuant to a principal purpose of decreasing the amount of the domestic corporation's deemed tangible income return if both the transfer and the lease occur within a six-month period.


(4) *Definitions related to anti-avoidance rule.* The following definitions apply for purpose of this paragraph (h).


(i) *Disqualified period.* The term *disqualified period* means, with respect to a transfer, the period beginning one year before the date of the transfer and ending the earlier of the end of the remaining recovery period (under the system described in section 951A(d)(3)(A)) of the property or one year after the date of the transfer.


(ii) *FDII-eligible related party.* The term *FDII-eligible related party* means, with respect to a domestic corporation, a member of the same consolidated group as the domestic corporation or a partnership with respect to which at least 80 percent of the interests in partnership capital and profits are owned, directly or indirectly, by the domestic corporation or one or more members of the consolidated group that includes the domestic corporation.


(iii) *Specified related party.* The term *specified related party* means, with respect to a domestic corporation, a related party other than an FDII-eligible related party.


(iv) *Transfer.* The term *transfer* means any disposition, exchange, contribution, or distribution of property, and includes an indirect transfer. For example, a transfer of an interest in a partnership is treated as a transfer of the assets of the partnership. In addition, if paragraph (h)(1) of this section applies to treat a domestic corporation as owning specified tangible property by reason of a lease of property, the termination or lapse of the lease of the property is treated as a transfer of the specified tangible property by the domestic corporation to the lessor.


(5) *Transactions occurring before March 4, 2019.* Paragraph (h)(1) of this section does not apply to a transfer of property that occurs before March 4, 2019.


(6) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (h).


(i) *Example 1: Sale-leaseback with a related party*—(A) *Facts.* DC, a domestic corporation, owns Asset A, which is specified tangible property. DC also owns all the single class of stock of DS, a domestic corporation, and FS1 and FS2, each a controlled foreign corporation. DC and DS are members of the same consolidated group. On January 1, Year 1, DC sells Asset A to FS1. At the time of the sale, Asset A had a remaining recovery period of 10 years under the alternative depreciation system. On February 1, Year 1, FS2 leases Asset B, which is substantially similar to Asset A, to DS for a five-year term ending on January 31, Year 6.


(B) *Analysis.* Because DC transfers specified tangible property (Asset A), to a specified related party of DC (FS1), and, within a six month period (January 1, Year 1 to February 1, Year 1), an FDII-eligible related party of DC (DS) leases a substantially similar property (Asset B) from a specified related party (FS2), DC's transfer of Asset A and lease of Asset B are treated as per se occurring pursuant to a principal purpose of decreasing the amount of its deemed tangible income return. Accordingly, for purposes of determining DC's QBAI, DC is treated as owning Asset A from February 1, Year 1, the later of the date of the transfer of Asset A (January 1, Year 1) and the beginning of the term of the lease of Asset B (February 1, Year 1), until January 31, Year 6, the earlier of the end of the term of the lease of Asset B (January 31, Year 6) or the remaining recovery period of Asset A (December 31, Year 10).


(ii) *Example 2: Sale-leaseback with a related party; lapse of initial lease*—(A) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (h)(6)(i)(A) of this section (the facts in *Example 1*). In addition, DS allows the lease of Asset B to expire on February 1, Year 6. On June 1, Year 6, DS and FS2 renew the lease for a five-year term ending on May 31, Year 11.


(B) *Analysis.* Because DC is treated as owning Asset A under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the lapse of the lease of Asset B is treated as a transfer of Asset A to FS2 on February 1, Year 6, under paragraph (h)(4)(iv) of this section. Further, because DC is deemed to transfer specified tangible property (Asset A) to a specified related party (FS2) upon the lapse of the lease, and within a six month period (February 1, Year 6 to June 1, Year 6), an FDII-eligible related party of DC (DS) leases a substantially similar property (Asset B), DC's deemed transfer of Asset A under paragraph (h)(4)(iv) of this section and lease of Asset B are treated as per se occurring pursuant to a principal purpose of decreasing the amount of its deemed tangible income return. Accordingly, for purposes of determining DC's QBAI, DC is treated as owning Asset A from June 1, Year 6, the later of the date of the deemed transfer of Asset A (February 1, Year 6) and the beginning of the term of the lease of Asset B (June 1, Year 6), until December 31, Year 10, the earlier of the end of the term of the lease of Asset B (May 31, Year 11) or the remaining recovery period of Asset A (December 31, Year 10).
