# § 1.6073-1   Time and place for filing declarations of estimated income tax by individuals.

(a) *Individuals other than farmers or fishermen.* Declarations of estimated tax for the calendar year shall be made on or before April 15th of such calendar year by every individual whose anticipated income for the year meets the requirements of section 6015(a). If, however, the requirements necessitating the filing of the declaration are first met, in the case of an individual on the calendar year basis, after April 1st, but before June 2d of the calendar year, the declaration must be filed on or before June 15th; if such requirements are first met after June 1st and before September 2d, the declaration must be filed on or before September 15th; and if such requirements are first met after September 1st, the declaration must be filed on or before January 15th of the succeeding calendar year. In the case of an individual on the fiscal year basis, see § 1.6073-2. A special rule applies to nonresident aliens who do not have wages subject to withholding under Chapter 24 of the code and are not treated as residents under section 6013 (g) or (h) of the code. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976, these aliens are not required to file a declaration of estimated tax before June 15th.


(b) *Farmers or fishermen*—(1) *In general.* In the case of an individual on a calendar year basis:


(i) If at least two-thirds of the individual's total estimated gross income from all sources for the calendar year is from farming or fishing (including oyster farming), or


(ii) If at least two-thirds of the individual's total gross income from all sources shown on the return for the preceding taxable year was from farming or fishing (including oyster farming) (with respect to declarations of estimated tax for taxable years beginning after November 10, 1978),


(2) *Farmers.* The estimated gross income from farming is the estimated income resulting from oyster farming, the cultivation of the soil, the raising or harvesting of any agricultural or horticultural commodities, and the raising of livestock, bees, or poultry. In other words, the requisite gross income must be derived from the operations of a stock, dairy, poultry, fruit, or truck farm, or plantation, ranch, nursery, range, orchard, or oyster bed. If an individual receives for the use of his land income in the form of a share of the crops produced thereon such income is from farming. As to determination of income of farmers, see sections 61 and 162 and the regulations thereunder.


(3) *Fishermen.* The estimated gross income from fishing is the estimated income resulting from the catching, taking, harvesting, cultivating or farming of any kind of fish, shellfish (for example, clams and mussels), crustacea (for example, lobsters, crabs, and shrimps), sponges, seaweeds, or other aquatic forms of animal and vegetable life. The estimated gross income from fishing includes the income expected to be received by an officer or member of the crew of a vessel while the vessel is engaged in any such activity, whether or not the officer or member of the crew is himself so engaged, and, in the case of an individual who is engaged in any such activity in the employ of any person, the income expected to be received by such individual from such employment. In addition, income expected to be received for services performed as an ordinary incident to any such activity is estimated gross income from fishing. Similarly, for example, the estimated gross income from fishing includes income expected to be received from the shore services of an officer or member of the crew of a vessel engaged in any such activity, if such services are an ordinary incident to any such activity. Services performed as an ordinary incident to such activities include, for example, services performed in such cleaning, icing, and packing of fish as are necessary for the immediate preservation of the catch.


(c) *Nonresident aliens.* Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976, in the case of a nonresident alien described in section 6072(c) (relating to returns of nonresident aliens whose wages are not subject to withholding) whose estimated gross income for the calendar year meets the requirements of section 6015(a), a declaration of estimated tax for the calendar year need not be made before June 15th of such calendar year.


(d) *Place for filing declaration.* Except as provided in paragraph (b) of § 301.6091-1 (relating to hand-carried documents), the declaration of estimated tax shall be filed at the place prescribed by the instructions applicable to such declaration. For example, if the instructions applicable to a declaration provide that the declaration of a taxpayer located in North Carolina be filed with the Director, Internal Revenue Service Center, Chamblee, Ga., such declaration shall be filed with the service center.


(e) *Amendment of declaration.* An amended declaration of estimated tax may be filed during any interval between installment dates prescribed for the taxable year. However, no amended declaration may be filed until after the installment date on or before which the original declaration was filed and only one amended declaration may be filed during each interval between installment dates. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of § 301.6091-1 (relating to hand-carried documents), an amended declaration shall be filed with the internal revenue officer with whom the original declaration was filed.
