# § 1.1361-4   Effect of QSub election.

(a) *Separate existence ignored*—(1) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(6), (a)(7), (a)(8), and (a)(9) of this section, for Federal tax purposes—


(i) A corporation that is a QSub shall not be treated as a separate corporation; and


(ii) All assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit of a QSub shall be treated as assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit of the S corporation.


(2) *Liquidation of subsidiary*—(i) *In general.* If an S corporation makes a valid QSub election with respect to a subsidiary, the subsidiary is deemed to have liquidated into the S corporation. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the tax treatment of the liquidation or of a larger transaction that includes the liquidation will be determined under the Internal Revenue Code and general principles of tax law, including the step transaction doctrine. Thus, for example, if an S corporation forms a subsidiary and makes a valid QSub election (effective upon the date of the subsidiary's formation) for the subsidiary, the transfer of assets to the subsidiary and the deemed liquidation are disregarded, and the corporation will be deemed to be a QSub from its inception. 


(ii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section:


(iii) *Adoption of plan of liquidation.* For purposes of satisfying the requirement of adoption of a plan of liquidation under section 332, unless a formal plan of liquidation that contemplates the QSub election is adopted on an earlier date, the making of the QSub election is considered to be the adoption of a plan of liquidation immediately before the deemed liquidation described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.


(iv) *Example.* The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section:


(v) *Stock ownership requirements of section 332.* The deemed exercise of an option under § 1.1504-4 and any instruments, obligations, or arrangements that are not considered stock under § 1.1361-2(b)(2) are disregarded in determining if the stock ownership requirements of section 332(b) are met with respect to the deemed liquidation provided in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. 


(3) *Treatment of banks*—(i) *In general.* If an S corporation is a bank, or if an S corporation makes a valid QSub election for a subsidiary that is a bank, any special rules applicable to banks under the Internal Revenue Code continue to apply separately to the bank parent or bank subsidiary as if the deemed liquidation of any QSub under paragraph (a)(2) of this section had not occurred (except as other published guidance may apply section 265(b) and section 291(a)(3) and (e)(1)(B) not only to the bank parent or bank subsidiary but also to any QSub deemed to have liquidated under paragraph (a)(2) of this section). For any QSub that is a bank, however, all assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit of the QSub, as determined in accordance with the special bank rules, are treated as assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit of the S corporation. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(3)(i), the term bank has the same meaning as in section 581. 


(ii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (a)(3):


(iii) *Effective date.* This paragraph (a)(3) applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1996. 


(4) *Treatment of stock of QSub.* Except for purposes of section 1361(b)(3)(B)(i) and § 1.1361-2(a)(1), the stock of a QSub shall be disregarded for all Federal tax purposes. 


(5) *Transitional relief*—(i) *General rule.* If an S corporation and another corporation (the related corporation) are persons specified in section 267(b) prior to an acquisition by the S corporation of some or all of the stock of the related corporation followed by a QSub election for the related corporation, the step transaction doctrine will not apply to determine the tax consequences of the acquisition. This paragraph (a)(5) shall apply to QSub elections effective before January 1, 2001. 


(ii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (a)(5):


(6) *Treatment of certain QSubs*—(i) *In general.* A QSub, even though it is generally not treated as a corporation separate from the S corporation, is treated as a separate corporation for purposes of:


(A) Federal tax liabilities of the QSub with respect to any taxable period for which the QSub was treated as a separate corporation.


(B) Federal tax liabilities of any other entity for which the QSub is liable.


(C) Refunds or credits of Federal tax.


(ii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section:


(iii) *Effective date.* This paragraph (a)(6) applies on or after April 1, 2004.


(7) *Treatment of QSubs for purposes of employment taxes*—(i) *In general.* A QSub is treated as a separate corporation for purposes of Subtitle C—Employment Taxes and Collection of Income Tax (Chapters 21, 22, 23, 23A, 24, and 25 of the Internal Revenue Code).


(ii) *Effective/applicability date.* This paragraph (a)(7) applies with respect to wages paid on or after January 1, 2009.


(8) *Treatment of QSubs for purposes of certain excise taxes*—(i) *In general.* A QSub is treated as a separate corporation for purposes of—


(A) Federal tax liabilities imposed by Chapters 31, 32 (other than section 4181), 33, 34, 35, 36 (other than section 4461), 38, and 49 of the Internal Revenue Code, or any floor stocks tax imposed on articles subject to any of these taxes;


(B) Collection of tax imposed by Chapters 33 and 49 of the Internal Revenue Code;


(C) Registration under sections 4101, 4222, and 4412;


(D) Claims of a credit (other than a credit under section 34), refund, or payment related to a tax described in paragraph (a)(8)(i)(A) of this section or under section 6426 or 6427; and


(E) Assessment and collection of an assessable payment imposed by section 4980H and reporting required by section 6056.


(ii) *Effective/applicability date.* (A) Except as provided in this paragraph (a)(8)(ii), paragraph (a)(8) of this section applies to liabilities imposed and actions first required or permitted in periods beginning on or after January 1, 2008.


(B) References to Chapter 49 in paragraph (a)(8) of this section apply to taxes imposed on amounts paid on or after July 1, 2012.


(C) Paragraph (a)(8)(i)(E) of this section applies for periods after December 31, 2014.


(9) *Information returns*—(i) *In general.* Except to the extent provided by the Secretary or Commissioner in guidance (including forms or instructions), paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not apply to part III of subchapter A of chapter 61, relating to information returns.


(ii) *Effective/applicability date.* This paragraph (a)(9) is effective on *August 14, 2008.*

(b) *Timing of the liquidation*—(1) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(3) or (4) of this section, the liquidation described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section occurs at the close of the day before the QSub election is effective. Thus, for example, if a C corporation elects to be treated as an S corporation and makes a QSub election (effective the same date as the S election) with respect to a subsidiary, the liquidation occurs immediately before the S election becomes effective, while the S electing parent is still a C corporation. 


(2) *Application to elections in tiered situations.* When QSub elections for a tiered group of subsidiaries are effective on the same date, the S corporation may specify the order of the liquidations. If no order is specified, the liquidations that are deemed to occur as a result of the QSub elections will be treated as occurring first for the lowest tier entity and proceed successively upward until all of the liquidations under paragraph (a)(2) of this section have occurred. For example, S, an S corporation, owns 100 percent of C, the common parent of an affiliated group of corporations that includes X and Y. C owns all of the stock of X and X owns all of the stock of Y. S elects under § 1.1361-3 to treat C, X and Y as QSubs effective on the same date. If no order is specified for the elections, the following liquidations are deemed to occur as a result of the elections, with each successive liquidation occuring on the same day immediately after the preceding liquidation: Y is treated as liquidating into X, then X is treated as liquidating into C, and finally C is treated as liquidating into S. 


(3) *Acquisitions.* (i) *In general.* If an S corporation does not own 100 percent of the stock of the subsidiary on the day before the QSub election is effective, the liquidation described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section occurs immediately after the time at which the S corporation first owns 100 percent of the stock. 


(ii) *Special rules for acquired S corporations.* Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, if a corporation (Y) for which an election under section 1362(a) was in effect is acquired, and a QSub election is made effective on the day Y is acquired, Y is deemed to liquidate into the S corporation at the beginning of the day the termination of its S election is effective. As a result, if corporation X acquires Y, an S corporation, and makes an S election for itself and a QSub election for Y effective on the day of acquisition, Y liquidates into X at the beginning of the day when X's S election is effective, and there is no period between the termination of Y's S election and the deemed liquidation of Y during which Y is a C corporation. Y's taxable year ends for all Federal income tax purposes at the close of the preceding day. Furthermore, if Y owns Z, a corporation for which a QSub election was in effect prior to the acquisition of Y by X, and X makes QSub elections for Y and Z, effective on the day of acquisition, the transfer of assets to Z and the deemed liquidation of Z are disregarded. See §§ 1.1361-4(a)(2) and 1.1361-5(b)(1)(i). 


(4) *Coordination with section 338 election.* An S corporation that makes a qualified stock purchase of a target may make an election under section 338 with respect to the acquisition if it meets the requirements for the election, and may make a QSub election with respect to the target. If an S corporation makes an election under section 338 with respect to a subsidiary acquired in a qualified stock purchase, a QSub election made with respect to that subsidiary is not effective before the day after the acquisition date (within the meaning of section 338(h)(2)). If the QSub election is effective on the day after the acquisition date, the liquidation under paragraph (a)(2) of this section occurs immediately after the deemed asset purchase by the new target corporation under section 338. If an S corporation makes an election under section 338 (without a section 338(h)(10) election) with respect to a target, the target must file a final return as a C corporation reflecting the deemed sale. *See § 1.338-10(a).* If the target was an S corporation on the day before the acquisition date, the final return as a C corporation must reflect the activities of the target for the acquisition date, including the deemed sale. *See § 1.338-10(a)(3).*

(c) *Carryover of disallowed losses and deductions.* If an S corporation (S1) acquires the stock of another S corporation (S2), and S1 makes a QSub election with respect to S2 effective on the day of the acquisition, see § 1.1366-2(c)(1) for provisions relating to the carryover of losses and deductions with respect to a former shareholder of S2 that may be available to that shareholder as a shareholder of S1. 


(d) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this section:
