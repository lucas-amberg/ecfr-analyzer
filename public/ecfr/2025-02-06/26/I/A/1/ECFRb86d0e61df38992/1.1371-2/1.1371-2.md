# § 1.1371-2   Impact of Audit PTTP on ETSC Period.

(a) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section, the definitions used in § 1.1371-1(a)(2) are applicable. Additionally, the following definitions apply for purposes of this section—


(1) *Audit PTTP.* The term *audit PTTP* means a post-termination transition period described in section 1377(b)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code).


(2) *Initial PTTP.* The term *initial PTTP* means a post-termination transition period described in section 1377(b)(1)(A).


(3) *Intervening audit PTTP.* The term *intervening audit PTTP* means an audit PTTP arising during the ETSC period.


(b) *In general.* If an intervening audit PTTP arises, the ETSC period immediately stops. Immediately following the end of the intervening audit PTTP, the ETSC period resumes if the ETSC's AAA balance is greater than zero. Otherwise, any subsequent distributions by the ETSC are treated in the manner provided in section 301(c) of the Code.


(c) *Examples.* Paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section (*Examples 1* and *2*) illustrate the rules of this section. For purposes of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section (*Examples 1* and *2*), X is a calendar year S corporation. A, an individual, purchased all of the outstanding shares of X in a single transaction at the same price per share prior to December 22, 2017, and was the sole shareholder of X at all times. Pursuant to section 1362(d)(1) of the Code and §§ 1.1362-2 and 1.1362-6, X made a valid revocation of its S election on March 15, 2019, that became effective on January 1, 2019. No amount distributed by X is an extraordinary dividend within the meaning of section 1059.


(1) *Example 1: No ETSC period following initial PTTP*—(i) *Facts.* At the beginning of January 1, 2019, X had AAA of $49,000 and AE&P of $2,000, and A's adjusted basis in its shares of X stock was $50,000. During 2019, the only distribution that X made was a $49,000 distribution of money to A on March 13, 2019. X's CE&P during 2019 was $0, without regard to any diminution by reason of any distributions made during the taxable year.


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Distribution during initial PTTP.* Pursuant to sections 1371(e) and 1377(b)(1)(A), the $49,000 distribution of money on March 13, 2019, is characterized as a distribution of AAA because it was made during the initial PTTP.


(B) *Effect on corporation.* Pursuant to § 1.1368-2(a)(3)(iii), X's AAA is reduced by $49,000 to $0. Following the initial PTTP, even if X satisfies the requirements of section 481(d)(2) of the Code and § 1.481-5(b) to be an ETSC, X does not have an ETSC period because its AAA balance is zero at the end of its initial PTTP. Therefore, section 1371(f) of the Code and § 1.1371-1 will not apply to any subsequent distributions by X.


(C) *Effect on shareholder.* Pursuant to section 1371(e)(1), A reduces its basis in its X stock by $49,000 to $1,000.


(2) *Example 2: Intervening audit PTTP*—(i) *Facts.* The facts are the same as the facts in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. On May 20, 2020, which is after X's initial PTTP, the IRS begins an audit of X's 2018 return. During the audit it is agreed that X overstated its advertising expense deduction by $10,000. On July 6, 2020, A signs a closing agreement whereby X's overstatement results in an additional tax on A's 2018 individual return. As a result, at the beginning of January 1, 2019, X had AAA of $59,000 ($49,000 + $10,000) and AE&P of $2,000. Additionally, at the beginning of January 1, 2019, A's adjusted basis in its shares of X stock was $60,000 ($50,000 + $10,000). During 2020, the only distribution X makes is a $6,000 distribution of money to A on September 1, 2020. X's CE&P during 2020 was $0, without regard to any diminution by reason of any distributions made during the taxable year.


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Analysis of March 13, 2019 distribution.* The treatment of the March 13, 2019, distribution is the same as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, because the amount of the distribution ($49,000) does not exceed X's AAA balance at the beginning of January 1, 2019 ($59,000), and so the entirety of the $49,000 distribution is properly characterized as a distribution of AAA.


(*1*) *Effect on corporation.* As described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, X's AAA ($59,000 at the beginning of January 1, 2019) is reduced by $49,000 to $10,000. At the conclusion of X's initial PTTP (ending on December 31, 2019), X's AAA balance is $10,000. Pursuant to § 1.1371-1(a)(2)(vii), X has an ETSC period. Therefore, section 1371(f) and § 1.1371-1 will apply to any subsequent qualified distributions by X.


(*2*) *Effect on shareholder.* As described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C) of this section, A reduces its basis in its X stock ($60,000 at the beginning of January 1, 2019) by $49,000 to $11,000.


(B) *Intervening audit PTTP.* Pursuant to section 1377(b)(1)(B), X enters an intervening audit PTTP that begins on July 6, 2020, and ends on November 2, 2020. The application of section 1371(f) and § 1.1371-1 to distributions during the intervening audit PTTP is stopped. Instead, sections 1371(e) and 1377(b)(1)(B) and §§ 1.1371-2 and 1.1377-2 apply for the duration of the intervening audit PTTP. During the intervening audit PTTP, the only distribution X made is a $6,000 distribution of money to A on September 1, 2020. Pursuant to sections 1371(e) and 1377(b)(1)(B), the $6,000 distribution is characterized as a distribution of AAA because it was made during the intervening audit PTTP.


(*1*) *Effect on corporation.* Pursuant to § 1.1368-2(a)(3)(iii), X's AAA is reduced by $6,000 to $4,000. Beginning on November 3, 2020, pursuant to § 1.1371-1(a)(2)(vii), X's ETSC period resumes (after the intervening audit PTTP's conclusion) because its AAA balance is greater than zero.


(*2*) *Effect on shareholder.* Pursuant to section 1371(e)(1), A reduces its basis in its X stock by $6,000 to $5,000.


(C) *ETSC period.* Beginning on November 3, 2020, X's ETSC period resumes, and distributions of money are subject to section 1371(f) and § 1.1371-1 until X's AAA balance is zero. For purposes of calculating each of X's AAA and AE&P ratios, X's historical AAA is $59,000 (at the beginning of January 1, 2019, which includes the $10,000 increase as a result of the July 6, 2020, closing agreement).


(d) *Applicability date.* This section applies to taxable years beginning after October 20, 2020. However, a corporation may choose to apply the rules in §§ 1.481-5, 1.1371-1, and 1.1371-2 in their entirety to taxable years that began on or before October 20, 2020. If a corporation makes the choice described in the previous sentence, all shareholders of the corporation must report consistently, and the corporation must continue to apply the rules in §§ 1.481-5, 1.1371-1, and 1.1371-2 in their entirety for the corporation's subsequent taxable years.
