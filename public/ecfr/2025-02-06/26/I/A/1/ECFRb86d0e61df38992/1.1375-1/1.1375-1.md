# § 1.1375-1   Tax imposed when passive investment income of corporation having subchapter C earnings and profits exceed 25 percent of gross receipts.

(a) *General rule.* For taxable years beginning after 1981, section 1375(a) imposes a tax on the income of certain S corporations that have passive investment income. In the case of a taxable year beginning during 1982, an electing small business corporation may elect to have the rules under this section not apply. See the regulations under section 1362 for rules on the election. For purposes of this section, the term *S corporation* shall include an electing small business corporation under prior law. This tax shall apply to an S corporation for a taxable year if the S corporation has—


(1) Subchapter C earnings and profits at the close of such taxable year, and


(2) Gross receipts more than 25 percent of which are passive investment income


(b) *Definitions*—(1) *Excess net passive income*—(i) *In general.* The term *excess net passive income* is defined in section 1375(b)(1), and can be expressed by the following formula:


(ii) *Limitation.* The amount of the excess net passive income for any taxable year shall not exceed the corporation's taxable income for the taxable year (determined in accordance with section 1374(d) and § 1.1374-1(d)).


(2) *Net passive income.* The term *net passive income* means—


(i) Passive investment income, reduced by


(ii) The deductions allowable under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 which are directly connected (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3) of this section) with the production of such income (other than deductions allowable under section 172 and part VIII of subchapter B).


(3) *Directly connected*—(i) *In general.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section to be directly connected with the production of income, an item of deduction must have proximate and primary relationship to the income. Expenses, depreciation, and similar items attributable solely to such income qualify for deduction.


(ii) *Allocation of deduction.* If an item of deduction is attributable (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section) inpart to passive investment income and in part to income other than passive investment income, the deduction shall be allocated between the two types of items on a reasonable basis. The portion of any deduction so allocated to passive investment income shall be treated as proximately and primarily related to such income.


(4) *Other definitions.* The terms *subchapter C earnings and profits, passive investment income,* and *gross receipts* shall have the same meaning given these terms in section 1362(d)(3) and the regulations thereunder.


(c) *Special rules*—(1) *Disallowance of credits.* No credit is allowed under part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code (other than section 34) against the tax imposed by section 1375(a) and this section.


(2) *Coordination with section 1374.* If any gain—


(i) Is taken into account in determining passive income for purposes of this section, and


(ii) Is taken into account under section 1374,


(d) *Waiver of tax in certain cases*—(1) *In general.* If an S corporation establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that—


(i) It determined in good faith that it had no subchapter C earnings and profits at the close of the taxable year, and


(ii) During a reasonable period of time after it was determined that it did have subchapter C earnings and profits at the close of such taxable year such earnings and profits were distributed,


For example, if an S corporation establishes that in good faith and using due diligence it determined that it had no subchapter C earnings and profits at the close of a taxable year, but it was later determined on audit that it did have subchapter C earnings and profits at the close of such taxable year, and if the corporation establishes that it distributed such earnings and profits within a reasonable time after the audit, it may be appropriate for the Commissioner to waive the tax on passive income for such taxable year.


(2) *Corporation's request for a waiver.* A request for waiver of the tax imposed by section 1375 shall be made in writing to the district director and shall contain all relevant facts to establish that the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section are met. Such request shall contain a description of how and on what date the S corporation in good faith and using due diligence determined that it had no subchapter C earnings and profits at the close of the taxable year, a description of how and on what date it was determined that the S corporation had subchapter C earnings and profits at the close of the year and a description (including dates) of any steps taken to distribute such earnings and profits. If the earnings and profits have not yet been distributed, the request shall contain a timetable for distribution and an explanation of why such timetable is reasonable. On the date the waiver is to become effective, all subchapter C earnings and profits must have been distributed.


(e) *Reduction in pass-thru for tax imposed on excess net passive income.* See section 1366(f)(3) for a special rule reducing each item of the corporation's passive investment income for purposes of section 1366(a) if a tax is imposed on the corporation under section 1375.


(f) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the principles of this section:
