# § 1.1502-2   Computation of tax liability.

(a) *Taxes imposed.* The tax liability of a group for a consolidated return year is determined by adding together—


(1) The tax imposed by section 11(a) in the amount described in section 11(b) on the consolidated taxable income for the year (reduced by the taxable income of a member described in paragraphs (a)(5) through (8) of this section);


(2) The tax imposed by section 541 on the consolidated undistributed personal holding company income;


(3) If paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not apply, the aggregate of the taxes imposed by section 541 on the separate undistributed personal holding company income of the members which are personal holding companies;


(4) If neither paragraph (a)(2) nor (3) of this section apply, the tax imposed by section 531 on the consolidated accumulated taxable income (see § 1.1502-43);


(5) The tax imposed by section 594(a) in lieu of the taxes imposed by section 11 on the taxable income of a life insurance department of the common parent of a group which is a mutual savings bank;


(6) The tax imposed by section 801 on consolidated life insurance company taxable income;


(7) The tax imposed by section 831(a) on consolidated insurance company taxable income of the members which are subject to such tax;


(8) Any increase in tax described in section 1351(d)(1) (relating to recoveries of foreign expropriation losses); and

Any increase in tax due to the recapture of a tax credit will be taken into account. See section 59A and the regulations thereunder for credits allowed against the tax described in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.


(c) *Allocation of dollar amounts.* For purposes of this section, if a member or members of the consolidated group are also members of a controlled group that includes corporations that are not members of the consolidated group, any dollar amount described in any section of the Internal Revenue Code is apportioned among all members of the controlled group in accordance with the provisions of the applicable section and the regulations thereunder.
