# § 1.52-1   Trades or businesses that are under common control.

(a) *Apportionment of jobs credit among members of a group of trades or businesses that are under common control*—(1) *Targeted jobs credit.* (i) In the case of a group of trades or businesses that are under common control (within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section) at any time during the calendar year, the amount of the targeted jobs credit (computed under section 51 as if all the organizations that are under common control are one trade or business) under section 4-1B must be apportioned among the members of the group on the basis of each member's proportionate share of the wages giving rise to such credit. If the group of trades or businesses that are under common control have different taxable years, the credit shall be computed as if all the organizations have the same taxable year as the organization for which a determination of the proportionate share of the credit is being made. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1982, the amount of the qualified first-year wages cannot exceed 30 percent of the aggregate unemployment insurance wages paid by the group of trades or businesses under common control during the calendar year ending in the taxable year of the organization for which a determination of the proportionate share of the credit is being made. The limitations in section 53 and the regulations thereunder apply to each organization individually (although, in applying these limitations, an affiliated group of corporations electing to make a consolidated return shall be treated as one organization).


(ii) The application of the subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:


(2) *New jobs credit.* In the case of a group of trades or businesses that are under common control at any time during the calendar year, the amount of the new jobs credit (computed under section 51 as if all the organizations that are under common control are one trade or business) under section 44B (as in effect prior to enactment of the Revenue Act of 1978) must be apportioned among the members of the group on the basis of each member's proportionate contribution to the increase in unemployment insurance wages for the entire group. The limitations in section 53 (as in effect prior to enactment of the Revenue Act of 1978) and the regulations thereunder apply to each organization individually (although, in applying these limitations, an affiliated group of corporations electing to make a consolidated return shall be treated as one organization). The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:


(b) *Trades or businesses that are under common control.* For purposes of this section, the term “trades or businesses that are under common control” means any group of trades or businesses that is either a “parent-subsidiary group under common control” as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, a “brother-sister group under common control” as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, or a “combined group under common control” as defined in paragraph (e) of this section. For purposes of this section and §§ 1.52-2 and 1.52-3, the term “organization” means a sole proprietorship, a partnership, a trust, an estate, or a corporation. An organization may be a member of only one group of trades or businesses under common control. If, without the application of this paragraph, an organization would be a member of more than one such group, that organization shall indicate in its timely filed return the group in which it is being included. If the organization does not so indicate, then the district director with audit jurisdiction of the organization's return will determine the group in which the organization is to be included.


(c) *Parent-subsidiary group under common control*—(1) *In general.* The term “parent-subsidiary group under common control” means one or more chains of organizations conducting trades or businesses that are connected through ownership of a controlling interest with a common parent organization if—

(ii) The common parent organization owns (directly and with the application of § 1.414(c)-4(b)(1), (2), and (3)) a controlling interest in at least one of the other organizations, excluding, in computing the controlling interest, any direct ownership interest by the other organizations.




(2) *Controlling interest defined.* For purposes of this paragraph, the term “controlling interest” means:

(d) *Brother-sister group under common control*—(1) *In general.* The term “brother-sister group under common control” means two or more organizations conducting trades or businesses if—
