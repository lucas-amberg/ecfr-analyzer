# § 1.1502-35   Transfers of subsidiary stock and deconsolidations of subsidiaries.

(a) *In general*—(1) *Purpose.* The purpose of this section is to prevent a group from obtaining more than one tax benefit from a single economic loss. The provisions of this section shall be construed in a manner that is consistent with that purpose and in a manner that reasonably carries out that purpose.


(2) *Dates of applicability.* This section applies if—


(i) On or after March 7, 2002, a member recognizes a loss on the disposition of a share of stock of a subsidiary (or, on or after April 10, 2007, a share of stock of a former subsidiary) or a carryover basis asset (subject to paragraph (c)(6) of this section),


(ii) The member's loss on the share of subsidiary stock or the carryover basis asset is allowed on or before the date that is ten years after the disposition of the share or carryover basis asset, and


(iii) If the disposition is of a share of subsidiary stock, it is not a transfer to which § 1.1502-36 applies.


(b) *Redetermination of basis on certain nondeconsolidating transfers of subsidiary stock and on certain deconsolidations of subsidiaries*—(1) *Redetermination of basis on certain nondeconsolidating transfers of subsidiary stock.* Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, if, immediately after a transfer of stock of a subsidiary that has a basis that exceeds its value, the subsidiary remains a member of the group, then the basis in each share of subsidiary stock owned by each member of the group shall be redetermined in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b)(1) immediately before such transfer. All of the members' bases in the shares of subsidiary stock immediately before such transfer shall be aggregated. Such aggregated basis shall be allocated first to the shares of the subsidiary's preferred stock that are owned by the members of the group immediately before such transfer, in proportion to, but not in excess of, the value of those shares at such time. After allocation of the aggregated basis to all shares of the preferred stock of the subsidiary pursuant to the preceding sentence, any remaining basis shall be allocated among all common shares of subsidiary stock held by members of the group immediately before the transfer, in proportion to the value of such shares at such time. 


(2) *Redetermination of basis on certain deconsolidations of subsidiaries*—(i) *Allocation of reallocable basis amount.* Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, if, immediately before a deconsolidation of a subsidiary, any share of stock of such subsidiary owned by a member of the group has a basis that exceeds its value, then the basis in each share of the subsidiary's stock owned by each member of the group shall be redetermined in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b)(2) immediately before such deconsolidation. The basis in each share of the subsidiary's stock held by members of the group immediately before the deconsolidation that has a basis in excess of value at such time shall be reduced, but not below such share's value, in a manner that, to the greatest extent possible, causes the ratio of the basis to the value of each such share to be the same; provided, however, that the aggregate amount of such reduction shall not exceed the reallocable basis amount (as computed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section). Then, to the extent of the reallocable basis amount, the basis of each share of the preferred stock of the subsidiary that are held by members of the group immediately before the deconsolidation shall be increased, but not above such share's value, in a manner that, to the greatest extent possible, causes the ratio of the basis to the value of each such share to be the same. Then, to the extent that the reallocable basis amount does not increase the basis of shares of preferred stock of the subsidiary pursuant to the third sentence of this paragraph (b)(2)(i), such amount shall increase the basis of all common shares of the subsidiary's stock held by members of the group immediately before the deconsolidation in a manner that, to the greatest extent possible, causes the ratio of the basis to the value of each such share to be the same. 


(ii) *Calculation of reallocable basis amount.* The reallocable basis amount shall equal the lesser of— 


(A) The aggregate of all amounts by which, immediately before the deconsolidation, the basis exceeds the value of a share of subsidiary stock owned by any member of the group at such time; and 


(B) The total of the subsidiary's (and any predecessor's) items of deduction and loss, and the subsidiary's (and any predecessor's) allocable share of items of deduction and loss of all lower-tier subsidiaries, that were taken into account in computing the adjustment under § 1.1502-32 to the bases of shares of stock of the subsidiary (and any predecessor) held by members of the group immediately before the deconsolidation, other than shares that have bases in excess of value immediately before the deconsolidation. 


(3) *Exceptions to application of redetermination rules.* (i) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not apply to a transfer of subsidiary stock if— 


(A) During the taxable year of such transfer, in one or more fully taxable transactions, the members of the group dispose of all of the shares of the subsidiary stock that they own immediately before the transfer, other than the shares the transfer of which would otherwise trigger the application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, to a person or persons that are not members of the group;


(B) During the taxable year of such transfer, the members of the group are allowed a worthless stock loss under section 165(g) (taking into account the provisions of § 1.1502-80(c)) with respect to all of the shares of subsidiary stock that they own immediately before the transfer, other than the shares the transfer of which would otherwise trigger the application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section; or 


(C) Such transfer is to a member of the group and section 332 (provided the stock is transferred to an 80-percent distributee), section 351, section 354, or section 361 applies to such transfer. 


(ii) Paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to a deconsolidation of a subsidiary if—


(A) During the taxable year of such deconsolidation, in one or more fully taxable transactions, the members of the group dispose of all of the shares of the subsidiary stock that they own immediately before the deconsolidation to a person or persons that are not members of the group; 


(B) Such deconsolidation results from a fully taxable disposition, to a person or persons that are not members of the group, of some of the shares of the subsidiary, and, during the taxable year of such deconsolidation, the members of the group are allowed a worthless stock loss under section 165(g) with respect to all of the shares of the subsidiary stock that they own immediately after the deconsolidation; 


(C) The members of the group are allowed a worthless stock loss under section 165(g) with respect to all of the shares of the subsidiary stock that they own immediately before the deconsolidation; 


(D) The deconsolidation of the subsidiary results from the deconsolidation of a higher-tier subsidiary and, immediately after the deconsolidation of the subsidiary, none of the stock of the subsidiary is owned by a group member; or 


(E) The deconsolidation of the subsidiary results from a termination of the group. 


(4) *Special rule for lower-tier subsidiaries.* If, immediately after a transfer of subsidiary stock or a deconsolidation of a subsidiary, a lower-tier subsidiary some of the stock of which is owned by the subsidiary is a member of the group, then, for purposes of applying this paragraph (b), the subsidiary shall be treated as having transferred its stock of the lower-tier subsidiary. This principle shall apply to stock of subsidiaries that are owned by such lower-tier subsidiary. 


(5) *Stock basis adjustments for higher-tier stock.* The basis adjustments required under this paragraph (b) result in basis adjustments to higher-tier member stock. The adjustments are applied in the order of the tiers, from the lowest to highest. For example, if a common parent owns stock of a subsidiary that owns stock of a lower-tier subsidiary and the subsidiary recognizes a loss on the disposition of a portion of its shares of the lower-tier subsidiary stock, the common parent must adjust its basis in its subsidiary stock under the principles of § 1.1502-32 to reflect the adjustments that the subsidiary must make to its basis in its stock of the lower-tier subsidiary. 


(6) *Ordering rules.* (i) The rules of this paragraph (b) apply after the rules of § 1.1502-32 are applied. 


(ii) The rules of this paragraph (b) apply before the rules of § 1.337(d)-2 and paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section are applied. 


(iii) This paragraph (b) (and any resulting basis adjustments to higher-tier member stock made pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section) applies to redetermine the basis of stock of a lower-tier subsidiary before this paragraph (b) applies to a higher-tier member of such lower-tier subsidiary. 


(c) *Loss suspension*—(1) *General rule.* Any loss recognized by a member of a consolidated group with respect to the disposition of a share of subsidiary stock shall be suspended to the extent of the duplicated loss with respect to such share of stock if, immediately after the disposition, the subsidiary is a member of the consolidated group of which it was a member immediately prior to the disposition (or any successor group). 


(2) *Special rule for lower-tier subsidiaries.* This paragraph (c)(2) applies if neither paragraph (c)(1) nor (f) of this section applies to a member's disposition of a share of stock of a subsidiary (the departing member), a loss is recognized on the disposition of such share, and the departing member owns stock of one or more other subsidiaries (a remaining member) that is a member of such group immediately after the disposition. In that case, such loss shall be suspended to the extent the duplicated loss with respect to the departing member stock disposed of is attributable to the remaining member or members. 


(3) *Treatment of suspended loss*—(i) *General rule.* For purposes of the rules of § 1.1502-32, any loss suspended pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section is treated as a noncapital, nondeductible expense of the member that disposes of subsidiary stock, incurred during the taxable year that includes the date of the disposition of stock to which paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section applies. See § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iii)(C). Consequently, the basis of a higher-tier member's stock of the member that disposes of subsidiary stock is reduced by the suspended loss in the year it is suspended.


(ii) *Location of suspended loss following deconsolidation of selling member.* If a member recognizes a loss that is suspended under this paragraph (c) but that member ceases to be a member of the group before the loss is allowable, the common parent is treated as succeeding to the loss in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies.


(4) *Reduction of suspended loss*—(i) *General rule.* The amount of any loss suspended pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of § 1.1502-35 shall be reduced, but not below zero, by the subsidiary's (and any successor's) items of deduction and loss, and the subsidiary's (and any successor's) allocable share of items of deduction and loss of all lower-tier subsidiaries, that are allocable to the period beginning on the date of the disposition that gave rise to the suspended loss and ending on the day before the first date on which the subsidiary (and any successor) is not a member of the group of which it was a member immediately prior to the disposition (or any successor group), and that are taken into account in determining consolidated taxable income (or loss) of such group for any taxable year that includes any date on or after the date of the disposition and before the first date on which the subsidiary (and any successor) is not a member of such group; provided, however, that such reduction shall not exceed the excess of the amount of such items over the amount of such items that are taken into account in determining the basis adjustments made under § 1.1502-32 to stock of the subsidiary (or any successor) owned by members of the group. The preceding sentence shall not apply to items of deduction and loss to the extent that the group can establish that all or a portion of such items was not reflected in the computation of the duplicated loss with respect to the subsidiary on the date of the disposition of stock that gave rise to the suspended loss.


(ii) *Operating rules*—(A) *Year in which deduction or loss is taken into account.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, a subsidiary's (or any successor's) deductions and losses are treated as taken into account when and to the extent they are absorbed by the subsidiary (or any successor) or any other member. To the extent that the subsidiary's (or any successor's) deduction or loss is absorbed in the year it arises or is carried forward and absorbed in a subsequent year (e.g., under section 172, 465, or 1212), the deduction is treated as taken into account in the year in which it is absorbed. To the extent that a subsidiary's (or any successor's) deduction or loss is carried back and absorbed in a prior year (whether consolidated or separate), the deduction or loss is treated as taken into account in the year in which it arises and not in the year in which it is absorbed. 


(B) *Determination of items that are allocable to the post-disposition, pre-deconsolidation period.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the determination of whether a subsidiary's (or any successor's) items of deduction and loss and allocable share of items of deduction and loss of all lower-tier subsidiaries are allocable to the period beginning on the date of the disposition of subsidiary stock that gave rise to the suspended loss and ending on the day before the first date on which the subsidiary (or any successor) is not a member of the consolidated group of which it was a member immediately prior to the disposition (or any successor group) is determined pursuant to the rules of § 1.1502-76(b)(2), without regard to § 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D), as if the subsidiary ceased to be a member of the group at the end of the day before the disposition and filed separate returns for the period beginning on the date of the disposition and ending on the day before the first date on which it is not a member of such group. 


(5) *Allowable loss*—(i) *General rule.* To the extent not reduced under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, any loss suspended pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section shall be allowed, to the extent otherwise allowable under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations, on a return filed by the group of which the subsidiary was a member on the date of the disposition of subsidiary stock that gave rise to the suspended loss (or any successor group) for the taxable year that includes the earlier of—


(A) The day before the first date on which the subsidiary (and any successor) is not a member of such group or the date the group is allowed a worthless stock loss under section 165 (taking into account the provisions of § 1.1502-80(c)) with respect to all of the subsidiary stock owned by members and;


(B) The date that is ten years after the date of the disposition of subsidiary stock that gave rise to the suspended loss.


(ii) *No tiering up of certain adjustments.* No adjustments shall be made to a member's basis of stock of a subsidiary (or any successor) for a suspended loss that is taken into account under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section. See § 1.1502-32(a)(2). 


(iii) *Statement of allowed loss.* Paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section applies only if the separate statement required under this paragraph (c)(5)(iii) is filed with, or as part of, the taxpayer's return for the year in which the loss is allowable. The statement must be entitled “ALLOWED LOSS UNDER § 1.1502-35(c)(5)” and must contain the name and employer identification number of the subsidiary the stock of which gave rise to the loss. 


(6) *Special rule for dispositions of certain carryover basis assets.* If—


(i) A member of a group recognizes a loss on the disposition of an asset other than stock of a subsidiary; 


(ii) Such member's basis in the asset disposed of was determined, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of stock of a subsidiary and, at the time of the determination of the member's basis in the asset disposed of, there was a duplicated loss with respect to such stock of the subsidiary; and 


(iii) Immediately after the disposition, the subsidiary is a member of such group, then such loss shall be suspended pursuant to the principles of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section to the extent of the duplicated loss with respect to such stock at the time of the determination of basis of the asset disposed of. Principles similar to those set forth in paragraphs (c)(3), (c)(4), and (c)(5) of this section shall apply to a loss suspended pursuant to this paragraph (c)(6). 


(7) *Coordination with loss deferral, loss disallowance, and other rules*—(i) *In general.* Loss recognized on the disposition of subsidiary stock or another asset is subject to redetermination, deferral, or disallowance under other applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder, including sections 267(f) and 482. Paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(6) of this section do not apply to a loss that is disallowed under any other provision. If loss is deferred under any other provision, paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(6) of this section apply when the loss would otherwise be taken into account under such other provision. However, if an overriding event described in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section occurs before the deferred loss is taken into account, paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(6) of this section apply to the loss immediately before the event occurs, even though the loss may not be taken into account until a later time. 


(ii) *Overriding events.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section, the following are overriding events—


(A) The stock ceases to be owned by a member of the consolidated group; 


(B) The stock is canceled or redeemed (regardless of whether it is retired or held as treasury stock); or 


(C) The stock is treated as disposed of under § 1.1502-19(c)(1)(ii)(B) or (c)(1)(iii). 


(8) *No elimination of economic loss.* This paragraph (c) shall not be applied in a manner that permanently disallows a deduction for an economic loss, provided that such deduction is otherwise allowable. If the application of any provision of this paragraph (c) results in such a disallowance, proper adjustment may be made to prevent such a disallowance. Whether a provision of this paragraph (c) has resulted in such a disallowance is determined on the date on which the subsidiary (or any successor) the disposition of the stock of which gave rise to a suspended stock loss is not a member of the group or the date the group is allowed a worthless stock loss under section 165(g) (taking into account the provisions of § 1.1502-80(c)) with respect to all of such subsidiary stock owned by members. Proper adjustment in such cases shall be made by restoring the suspended stock loss immediately before the subsidiary ceases to be a member of the group or the group is allowed a worthless stock loss under section 165(g) (taking into account the provisions of § 1.1502-80(c)) with respect to all of such subsidiary stock owned by members, to the extent that its reduction pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section had the result of permanently disallowing a deduction for an economic loss. 


(9) *Ordering rule.* The rules of this paragraph (c) apply after the rules of paragraph (b) of this section and § 1.337(d)-2 are applied. 


(d) *Definitions*—(1) *Disposition* means any event in which gain or loss is recognized, in whole or in part. 


(2) *Deconsolidation* means any event that causes a subsidiary to no longer be a member of the consolidated group. 


(3) *Value* means fair market value.


(4) *Duplicated loss*—(i) *In general.* Duplicated loss is determined immediately after a disposition and equals the excess, if any, of— 


(A) The sum of—


(*1*) The aggregate adjusted basis of the subsidiary's assets other than any stock that subsidiary owns in another subsidiary; 


(*2*) Any losses attributable to the subsidiary and carried to the subsidiary's first taxable year following the disposition; and 


(*3*) Any deductions of the subsidiary that have been recognized but are deferred under a provision of the Internal Revenue Code (such as deductions deferred under section 469); over 


(B) The sum of—


(*1*) The value of the subsidiary's stock; and 


(*2*) Any liabilities of the subsidiary that have been taken into account for tax purposes.


(ii) *Special rules.* (A) The amounts determined under paragraph (d)(4)(i) (other than amounts described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B)(1)) of this section with respect to a subsidiary include its allocable share of corresponding amounts with respect to all lower-tier subsidiaries. If 80 percent or more in value of the stock of a subsidiary is acquired by purchase in a single transaction (or in a series of related transactions during any 12-month period), the value of the subsidiary's stock may not exceed the purchase price of the stock divided by the percentage of the stock (by value) so purchased. For this purpose, stock is acquired by purchase if the transferee is not related to the transferor within the meaning of sections 267(b) and 707(b)(1), using the language “10 percent” instead of “50 percent” each place that it appears, and the transferee's basis in the stock is determined wholly by reference to the consideration paid for such stock. 


(B) The amounts determined under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section are not applied more than once to suspend a loss under this section. 


(5) *Predecessor and successor.* A predecessor is a transferor of assets to a transferee (the successor) in a transaction—


(i) To which section 381(a) applies; 


(ii) In which substantially all of the assets of the transferor are transferred to members in a complete liquidation; 


(iii) In which the successor's basis in assets is determined (directly or indirectly, in whole or in part) by reference to the transferor's basis in such assets, but the transferee is a successor only with respect to the assets the basis of which is so determined; or 


(iv) Which is an intercompany transaction, but only with respect to assets that are being accounted for by the transferor in a prior intercompany transaction. 


(6) *Successor group.* A surviving group is treated as a successor group of a consolidated group (the terminating group) that ceases to exist as a result of—


(i) The acquisition by a member of another consolidated group of either the assets of the common parent of the terminating group in a reorganization described in section 381(a)(2), or the stock of the common parent of the terminating group; or 


(ii) The application of the principles of § 1.1502-75(d)(2) or (3). 


(7) *Preferred stock, common stock.* Preferred stock and common stock shall have the meanings set forth in § 1.1502-32(d)(2) and (3), respectively. 


(8) *Higher-tier.* A subsidiary is higher-tier with respect to a member if or to the extent investment adjustments under § 1.1502-32 with respect to the stock of the latter member would affect investment adjustments with respect to the stock of the former member.


(9) *Lower-tier.* A subsidiary is lower-tier with respect to a member if or to the extent investment basis adjustments under § 1.1502-32 with respect to the stock of the former member would affect investment adjustments with respect to the stock of the latter member.


(e) *Examples.* For purposes of the examples in this section, unless otherwise stated, all groups file consolidated returns on a calendar-year basis, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, all transactions are between unrelated persons, and tax liabilities are disregarded. In addition, all transactions described in section 362(a) are completed before October 22, 2004, and therefore are not subject to section 362(e)(2). The principles of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section are illustrated by the following examples: 


(f) *Worthlessness not followed by separate return years.* Notwithstanding any other provision in the regulations under section 1502, if a member of a group (the claiming group) treats stock of a subsidiary as worthless under section 165 (taking into account the provisions of § 1.1502-80(c)) and, on the day following the last day of the claiming group's taxable year in which the worthless stock deduction is claimed, the subsidiary (or its successor, determined without regard to paragraphs (d)(5)(iii) and (iv) of this section) is a member of a group that includes any corporation that, during that taxable year, was a member of the claiming group (other than a lower-tier subsidiary of the subsidiary) or is a successor (determined without regard to paragraphs (d)(5)(iii) and (iv) of this section) of such a member, then all losses treated as attributable to the subsidiary under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv) shall be treated as expired as of the beginning of the day following the last day of the claiming group's taxable year in which the worthless stock deduction is claimed. In addition, notwithstanding any other provision in the regulations under section 1502, if a member recognizes a loss with respect to subsidiary stock and on the following day the subsidiary is not a member of the group and does not have a separate return year, then all losses treated as attributable to the subsidiary under the principles of § 1.1502-21(b)(2)(iv) shall be treated as expired as of the beginning of the day following the last day of the group's taxable year in which the stock loss is claimed. For purposes of this paragraph (f), the determination of the losses attributable to the subsidiary shall be made after computing the taxable income of the group for the taxable year in which the group treats the stock of the subsidiary as worthless or the subsidiary liquidates and after computing the taxable income for any taxable year to which such losses may be carried back. The loss treated as expired under this paragraph (f) shall not be treated as a noncapital, nondeductible expense under § 1.1502-32(b)(2)(iii). This paragraph (f) applies to worthlessness determinations and liquidations that occur on or after March 10, 2006. For rules applicable to worthless determinations and liquidations before March 10, 2006, see § 1.1502-35T(f)(1) and (2) as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on January 1, 2006. 


(g) *Anti-avoidance rules*—(1) *Transfer of share without a loss in avoidance.* If a share of subsidiary stock has a basis that does not exceed its value and the share is transferred with a view to avoiding application of the rules of paragraph (b) of this section prior to the transfer of a share of subsidiary stock that has a basis that does exceed its value or a deconsolidation of a subsidiary, the rules of paragraph (b) of this section shall apply immediately prior to the transfer of stock that has a basis that does not exceed its value. 


(2) *Transfers of loss property in avoidance.* If a member of a consolidated group contributes an asset with a basis that exceeds its value to a partnership in a transaction described in section 721 or a corporation that is not a member of such group in a transfer described in section 351, such partnership or corporation contributes such asset to a subsidiary in a transfer described in section 351, and such contributions are undertaken with a view to avoiding the rules of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, adjustments must be made to carry out the purposes of this section. 


(3) *Anti-loss reimportation rule*—(i) *Conditions for application.* This paragraph (g)(3) applies when—


(A) A member of a group (selling group) recognized and was allowed a loss with respect to a share of stock of S, a subsidiary or former subsidiary of the selling group;


(B) That stock loss was duplicated (in whole or in part) in S's attributes (duplicating items) at the earlier of the time that the loss was recognized or that S ceased to be a member; and


(C) Within ten years of the date that S ceased to be a member, there is a reimportation event. For this purpose, a reimportation event is any event after which a duplicating item is a reimported item. A reimported item is any duplicating item that is reflected in the attributes of any member of the selling group, including S, or, if not reflected in the attributes, would be properly taken into account by any member of the selling group (for example as the result of a carryback).


(ii) *Effect of application.* Immediately before the time that a reimported item (or any portion of a reimported item) would be properly taken into account (but for the application of this paragraph (g)(3)), such item (or such portion of the item) is reduced to zero and no deduction or loss is allowed, directly or indirectly, with respect to that item.


(iii) *Operating rules.* For purposes of this paragraph (g)(3)—


(A) The terms *member, subsidiary,* and *group* include their predecessors and successors to the extent necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section; and


(B) The reduction of a reimported item (other than duplicating items that are carried back to a consolidated return year of the selling group) is a noncapital, nondeductible expense within the meaning of § 1.1502-32(b)(3)(iii).


(4) *Avoidance of recognition of gain.* (i) If a transaction is structured with a view to, and has the effect of, deferring or avoiding the recognition of gain on a disposition of stock by invoking the application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section to redetermine the basis of stock of a subsidiary, and the stock loss that gives rise to the application of paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not significant, paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall not apply.


(ii) If a transaction is structured with a view to, and has the effect of, deferring or avoiding the recognition of gain on a disposition of stock by invoking the application of paragraph (b)(2) of this section to redetermine the basis of stock of a subsidiary, and the duplicated loss of the subsidiary that is reflected in stock of the subsidiary owned by members of the group immediately before the deconsolidation is not significant, paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall not apply.


(5) *Examples.* For purposes of the examples in this section, all transactions described in section 362(a) are completed before October 22, 2004, and therefore are not subject to section 362(e)(2). The principles of this paragraph (g) are illustrated by the following examples:


(6) *General anti-avoidance rule.* If a taxpayer acts with a view to avoid the purposes of this section, appropriate adjustments will be made to carry out the purposes of this section.


(h) *Application of other rules of law.* See § 1.1502-80(a) regarding the general applicability of other rules of law.


(i) [Reserved]


(j) *Effective/applicability dates.* This section applies after September 16, 2008. For prior law, see §§ 1.1502-35 and 1.1502-35T as contained in 26 CFR part 1 in effect on April 1, 2008.
