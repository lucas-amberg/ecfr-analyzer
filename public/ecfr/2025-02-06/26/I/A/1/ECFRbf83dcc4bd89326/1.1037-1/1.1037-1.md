# § 1.1037-1   Certain exchanges of United States obligations.

(a) *Nonrecognition of gain or loss*—(1) *In general.* Section 1037(a) provides for the nonrecognition of gain or loss on the surrender to the United States of obligations of the United States issued under the Second Liberty Bond Act (31 U.S.C. 774(2)) when such obligations are exchanged solely for other obligations issued under that Act and the Secretary provides by regulations promulgated in connection with the issue of such other obligations that gain or loss is not to be recognized on such exchange. It is not necessary that at the time of the exchange the obligation which is surrendered to the United States be a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. For purposes of section 1037(a) and this subparagraph, a circular of the Treasury Department which offers to exchange obligations of the United States issued under the Second Liberty Bond Act for other obligations issued under that Act shall constitute regulations promulgated by the Secretary in connection with the issue of the obligations offered to be exchanged if such circular contains a declaration by the Secretary that no gain or loss shall be recognized for Federal income tax purposes on the exchange or grants the privilege of continuing to defer the reporting of the income of the bonds exchanged until such time as the bonds received in the exchange are redeemed or disposed of, or have reached final maturity, whichever is earlier. See, for example, regulations of the Bureau of the Public Debt, 31 CFR part 339, or Treasury Department Circular 1066, 26 FR 8647. The application of section 1037(a) and this subparagraph will not be precluded merely because the taxpayer is required to pay money on the exchange. See section 1031 and the regulations thereunder if the taxpayer receives money on the exchange.


(2) *Recognition of gain or loss postponed.* Gain or loss which has been realized but not recognized on the exchange of a U.S. obligation for another such obligation because of the provisions of section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031 (b) or (c) as related to section 1037(a)) shall be recognized at such time as the obligation received in the exchange is disposed of, or redeemed, in a transaction other than an exchange described in section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031 (b) or (c) as relates to section 1037(a)) or reaches final maturity, whichever is earlier, to the extent gain or loss is realized on such later transaction.


(3) *Illustrations.* The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples, in which it is assumed that the taxpayer uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and has never elected under section 454(a) to include in gross income currently the annual increase in the redemption price of non-interest-bearing obligations issued at a discount. In addition, it is assumed that the old obligations exchanged are capital assets transferred in an exchange in respect of which regulations are promulgated pursuant to section 1037(a):


(b) *Application of section 1232 upon disposition or redemption of new obligation*—(1) *Exchanges involving nonrecognition of gain on obligations issued at a discount.* If an obligation, the gain on which is subject to the first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B), because the obligation was originally issued at a discount, is surrendered to the United States in exchange for another obligation and any part of the gain realized on the exchange is not then recognized because of the provisions of section 1037(a) (or because of so much of section 1031(b) as relates to section 1037(a)), the first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B) shall apply to so much of such unrecognized gain as is later recognized upon the disposition or redemption of the obligation which is received in the exchange as though the obligation so disposed of or redeemed were the obligation surrendered, rather than the obligation received, in such exchange. See the first sentence of section 1037(b)(1). Thus, in effect that portion of the gain which is unrecognized on the exchange but is recognized upon the later disposition or redemption of the obligation received from the United States in the exchange shall be considered as ordinary income in an amount which is equal to the gain which, by applying the first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B) upon the earlier surrender of the old obligation to the United States, would have been considered as ordinary income if the gain had been recognized upon such earlier exchange. Any portion of the gain which is recognized under section 1031(b) upon the earlier exchange and is treated at such time as ordinary income shall be deducted from the gain which is treated as ordinary income by applying the first sentence of section 1232(a)(2)(B) pursuant to this subparagraph upon the disposition or redemption of the obligation which is received in the earlier exchange. This subparagraph shall apply only in a case where on the exchange of United States obligations there was some gain not recognized by reason of section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031(b) as relates to section 1037(a)); it shall not apply where, only loss was unrecognized by reason of section 1037(a).


(2) *Rules to apply when a nontransferable obligation is surrendered in the exchange.* For purposes of applying both section 1232(a)(2)(B) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph to the total gain realized on the obligation which is later disposed of or redeemed, if the obligation surrendered to the United States in the earlier exchange is a nontransferable obligation described in section 454 (a) or (c)—


(i) The aggregate amount considered, with respect to the obligation so surrendered in the earlier exchange, as ordinary income shall not exceed the difference between the issue price of the surrendered obligation and the stated redemption price of the surrendered obligation which applied at the time of the earlier exchange, and


(ii) The issue price of the obligation which is received from the United States in the earlier exchange shall be considered to be the stated redemption price of the surrendered obligation which applied at the time of the earlier exchange, increased by the amount of other consideration (if any) paid to the United States as part of the earlier exchange.


(3) *Long-term capital gain.* If, in a case where both subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph are applied, the total gain realized on the redemption or disposition of the obligation which is received from the United States in the exchange to which section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031(b) as related to section 1037(a)) applies exceeds the amount of gain which, by applying such subparagraphs, is treated as ordinary income, the gain in excess of such amount shall be treated as long-term capital gain.


(4) *Illustrations.* The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples, in which it is assumed that the taxpayer uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and has never elected under section 454(a) to include in gross income currently the annual increase in the redemption price of non-interest-bearing obligations issued at a discount. In addition, it is assumed that the old obligations exchanged are capital assets transferred in an exchange in respect of which regulations are promulgated pursuant to section 1037(a):


(5) *Exchanges involving nonrecognition of gain or loss on transferable obligations issued at not less than par*—(i) *In general.* If a transferable obligation of the United States which was originally issued at not less than par is surrendered to the United States for another transferable obligation in an exchange to which the provisions of section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031 (b) or (c) as relates to section 1037(a)) apply, the issue price of the obligation received from the United States in the exchange shall be considered for purposes of applying section 1232 to gain realized on the disposition or redemption of the obligation so received, to be the same as the issue price of the obligation which is surrendered to the United States in the exchange, increased by the amount of other consideration, if any, paid to the United States as part of the exchange. This subparagraph shall apply irrespective of whether there is gain or loss unrecognized on the exchange and irrespective of the fair market value, at the time of the exchange, of either the obligation surrendered to, or the obligation received from, the United States in the exchange.


(ii) *Illustrations.* The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples, in which it is assumed that the taxpayer uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and that the old obligations exchanged are capital assets transferred in an exchange in respect of which regulations are promulgated pursuant to section 1037(a):


(6) *Other rules for applying section 1232.* To the extent not specifically affected by the provisions of section 1037(b) and subparagraphs (1) through (5) of this paragraph, any gain realized on the disposition or redemption of any obligation received from the United States in an exchange to which section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031 (b) or (c) as relates to section 1037(a)) applies shall be treated in the manner provided by section 1232 if the facts and circumstances relating to the acquisition and disposition or redemption of such obligation require the application of section 1232.


(c) *Holding period of obligation received in the exchange.* The holding period of an obligation received from the United States in an exchange to which the provisions of section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031 (b) or (c) as relates to section 1037(a)) apply shall include the period for which the obligation which was surrendered to the United States in the exchange was held by the taxpayer, but only if the obligation so surrendered was at the time of the exchange a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. See section 1223 and the regulations thereunder.


(d) *Basis.* The basis of an obligation received from the United States in an exchange to which the provisions of section 1037(a) (or so much of section 1031 (b) or (c) as relates to section 1037(a)) apply shall be determined as provided in section 1031(d) and the regulations thereunder.


(e) *Effective date.* Section 1.1037 and this section shall apply only for taxable years ending after September 22, 1959.
