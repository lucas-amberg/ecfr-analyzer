# § 1.1039-1   Certain sales of low-income housing projects.

(a) *Nonrecognition of gain.* Section 1039 provides rules under which the taxpayer may elect not to recognize gain in certain cases where a qualified housing project is sold or disposed of after October 9, 1969, in an approved disposition and another such qualified housing project or projects (referred to as the *replacement project*) is acquired, constructed, or reconstructed within a specified reinvestment period. If the requirements of section 1039 are met, and if the taxpayer makes an election in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, then the gain realized upon the sale or disposition is recognized only to the extent that the net amount realized on such sale or disposition exceeds the cost of the replacement project. However, notwithstanding section 1039, gain may be recognized by reason of the application of section 1245 or 1250 to the sale or disposition. (See § 1.1245-6(b) and § 1.1250-3(h). The terms *qualified housing project, approved disposition, reinvestment period,* and *net amount realized* are defined in paragraph (c) of this section.


(b) *Rules of application*—(1) *In general.* The election under section 1039(a) may be made only by the taxpayer owning the qualified housing project disposed of. Thus, if the qualified housing project disposed of is owned by a partnership, the partnership must make the election. (See section 703(b).) Similarly, if the qualified housing project disposed of is owned by a corporation or trust, the corporation or trust must make the election. In addition, the reinvestment of the taxpayer must be in such a manner that the taxpayer would be entitled to a deduction for depreciation on the replacement project. Thus, if the qualified housing project disposed of is owned by individual A, the purchase by A of stock in a corporation owning or constructing such a project or of an interest in a partnership owning or constructing such a project will not be considered as the purchase or construction by A of such a project.


(2) *Special rules.* (i) The cost of a replacement project acquired before the approved disposition of a qualified housing project shall be taken into account under section 1039 only if such property is held by the taxpayer on the date of the approved disposition.


(ii) Except as provided in section 1039 (d), no property acquired by the taxpayer shall be taken into account for purposes of section 1039(a)(2) unless the unadjusted basis of such property is its cost within the meaning of section 1012. For example, if a qualified housing project is acquired in an exchange under section 1031, relating to exchange of property held for productive use or investment, such property will not be taken into account under section 1039(a)(2) because its basis is determined by reference to the basis of the property exchanged. (See section 1031(d).)


(3) *Cost of replacement project.* The taxpayer's cost for the replacement project includes only amounts properly treated as capital expenditures by the taxpayer that are attributable to acquisition, construction, or reconstruction made within the reinvestment period (as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section). See section 263 for rules as to what constitutes capital expenditures. Thus, assume that a calendar year taxpayer realizes gain in 1970 upon the approved disposition of a qualified housing project occurring on January 1, 1970. If the taxpayer had begun construction of another qualified housing project on January 1, 1969, and completes such construction on June 1, 1972, only that portion of the cost attributable to the period before January 1, 1972, constitutes the cost of the replacement project for purposes of section 1039. For purposes of determining the cost of a replacement project attributable to a particular period, the total cost of the project may be allocated to such period on the basis of the portion of the total project actually constructed during such period.


(4) *Election.* (i) An election not to recognize the gain realized upon an approved disposition of a qualified housing project to the extent provided in section 1039(a) may be made by attaching a statement to the income tax return filed for the first taxable year in which any portion of the gain on such disposition is realized. Such a statement shall contain the information required by subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. If the taxpayer does not file such a statement for the first taxable year in which any portion of the gain is realized, but fails to report a portion of the gain realized upon the approved disposition as income for such year or for any subsequent taxable year, then an election shall be deemed to be made under section 1039 (a) with respect to that portion of the gain not reported as income.


(ii) An election may be made under section 1039(a) even though the replacement project has not been acquired or constructed at the time of election. However, if an election has been made and (*a*) a replacement project is not constructed, reconstructed, or acquired, (*b*) the cost of the replacement project is lower than the net amount realized from the approved disposition, or (*c*) a decision is made not to construct, reconstruct, or acquire a replacement project, then the tax liability for the year or years for which the election was made shall be recomputed and an amended return filed. An election may be made even though the taxpayer has filed his return and recognized gain upon the disposition provided that the period of limitation on filing claims for credit or refund prescribed by section 6511 has not expired. In such case, a statement containing the information required by subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph should be filed together with a claim for credit or refund for the taxable year or years in which gain was recognized.


(iii) The statement referred to in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph shall contain the following information:


(*a*) The date of the approved disposition;


(*b*) If a replacement project has been acquired, the date of acquisition and cost of the project;


(*c*) If a replacement project has been constructed or reconstructed by or for the taxpayer, the date construction was begun, the date construction was completed, and the percentage of construction completed within the reinvestment period;


(*d*) If no replacement project has been constructed, reconstructed, or acquired prior to the time of filing of the statement, the estimated cost of such construction, reconstruction, or acquisition;


(*e*) The adjusted basis of the project disposed of; and


(*f*) The amount realized upon the approved disposition and a description of the expenses directly connected with the disposition and the taxes (other than income taxes) attributable to the disposition.


(c) *Definitions*—(1) *General.* The definitions contained in subparagraphs (2) through (5) of this paragraph shall apply for purposes of this section.


(2) *Qualified housing project.* The term *qualified housing project* means a rental or cooperative housing project for lower income families that has been constructed, reconstructed, or rehabilitated pursuant to a mortgage which is insured under section 221(d)(3) or 236 of the National Housing Act, provided that with respect to the housing project disposed of and the replacement project constructed, reconstructed, or acquired, the owner of the project at the time of the approved disposition and prior to the close of the reinvestment period is, under such sections or regulations issued thereunder,


(i) Limited as to rate of return on his investment in the project, and


(ii) Limited as to rentals or occupancy charges for units in the project.


(3) *Approved disposition.* The term *approved disposition* means a sale or other disposition of a qualified housing project to the tenants or occupants of units in such project, or to a nonprofit cooperative or other nonprofit organization formed and operated solely for the benefit of such tenants or occupants, provided that it is approved by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or his delegate under section 221 (d)(3) or 236 of the National Housing Act or regulations issued under such sections. Evidence of such approval should be attached to the tax return or statement in which the election under section 1039 is made.


(4) *Reinvestment period.* (i) The term *reinvestment period* means the period beginning 1 year before the date of the disposition and ending 1 year after the close of the first taxable year in which any part of the gain from such disposition is realized, or at such later date as may be designated pursuant to an application made by the taxpayer. Such application shall be made before the expiration of one year after the close of the first taxable year in which any part of the gain from such disposition is realized, unless the taxpayer can show to the satisfaction of the district director that—


(*a*) Reasonable cause exists for not having filed the application within the required period, and


(*b*) The filing of such application was made within a reasonable time after the expiration of the required period.


(ii) Ordinarily, requests for extension of the reinvestment period will not be granted until near the end of such period and any extension will usually be limited to a period not exceeding one year. Although granting of an extension depends upon the facts and circumstances of a particular case, if a predominant portion of the construction of the replacement project has been completed or is reasonably expected to be completed within the reinvestment period (determined without regard to any extension thereof), an extension of the reinvestment period will ordinarily be granted. The fact that there is a scarcity of replacement property for acquisition will not be considered sufficient grounds for granting an extension.


(5) *Net amount realized.* (i) The *net amount realized* from the approved disposition of a qualified housing project is the amount realized from such disposition, reduced by—


(*a*) The expenses paid or incurred by the taxpayer which are directly connected with the approved disposition, and


(*b*) The amount of taxes (other than income taxes) paid or incurred by the taxpayer which are attributable to the approved disposition.


(ii) Examples of expenses directly connected with an approved disposition of a qualified housing project include amounts paid for sales or other commissions, advertising, and for the preparation of a deed or other legal services in connection with the disposition. An amount paid for a repair to the building will be considered as an expense directly connected with the approved disposition under subdivision (i)(*a*) of this subparagraph only if such repair is required as a condition of sale, or is required by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or his delegate as a condition of approval of the disposition.


(iii) Examples of taxes that are attributable to the approved disposition include local property transfer taxes and stamp taxes. A local real property tax is not so attributable.


(d) *Basis and holding period of replacement project*—(1) *Basis.* If the taxpayer makes an election under section 1039, the basis of the replacement housing project shall be its cost (including costs incurred subsequent to the reinvestment period) reduced by the amount of gain not recognized under section 1039 (a). If the replacement consists of more than one housing project, the basis determined under this subparagraph shall be allocated to the properties in proportion to their respective costs.


(2) *Holding period.* The holding period of the replacement housing project shall begin on the date the taxpayer acquires such project, that is, on the date the taxpayer first acquires possession or control of such project and bears the burdens and enjoys the benefits of ownership of the replacement project. (For special rule regarding the holding period of property for purposes of section 1250, see section 1250(e)(4).)


(e) *Assessment of deficiencies*—(1) *Deficiency attributable to gain.* If a taxpayer makes an election under section 1039(a) with respect to an approved disposition, any deficiency attributable to the gain on such disposition, for any taxable year in which any part of such gain is realized, may be assessed at any time before the expiration of 3 years after the date the district director or director of the regional service center with whom the return for such year has been filed is notified by the taxpayer of the acquisition or the completion of construction or reconstruction of the replacement qualified housing project or of the failure to acquire, construct, or reconstruct a replacement qualified housing project, as the case may be. Such a deficiency may be assessed before the expiration of such 3-year period notwithstanding the provisions of section 6212(c) or the provisions of any other law or rule of law which would otherwise prevent such assessment. If replacement has been made, such notification shall contain the information required by paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section. Such notification shall be attached to the return filed for the taxable year or years in which the replacement occurs, or in which the period for the replacement expires, and a copy of such notification shall be filed with the district director or director of regional service center with whom the election under section 1039(a) was required to be filed, if the return is not filed with such director.


(2) *Deficiency attributable to election.* If gain upon an approved disposition is realized in two (or more) taxable years, and the replacement qualified housing project was acquired, constructed, or reconstructed before the beginning of the last such year, any deficiency, for any taxable year before such last year, which is attributable to an election by the taxpayer under section 1039(a) may be assessed at any time before the expiration of the period within which a deficiency for such last taxable year may be assessed, notwithstanding the provisions of section 6212(c) or 6501 or the provisions of any law or rule of law which would otherwise prevent such assessment. Thus, if gain upon an approved disposition is realized in 1971 and 1975, and if a replacement project is purchased in 1971, any deficiency for 1971 may be assessed within the period for assessing a deficiency for 1975.
