# § 1.1045-1   Application to partnerships.

(a) *Overview of section.* A partnership that holds qualified small business stock (QSB stock) (as defined in paragraph (g)(1) of this section) for more than 6 months, sells such QSB stock, and purchases replacement QSB stock (as defined in paragraph (g)(2) of this section) may elect to apply section 1045. An eligible partner (as defined in paragraph (g)(3) of this section) of a partnership that sells QSB stock, may elect to apply section 1045 if the eligible partner purchases replacement QSB stock directly or through a purchasing partnership (as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section). A taxpayer (other than a C corporation) that holds QSB stock for more than 6 months, sells such QSB stock and purchases replacement QSB stock through a purchasing partnership may elect to apply section 1045. A section 1045 election is revocable only with the prior written consent of the Commissioner. To obtain the Commissioner's prior written consent, the person who made the section 1045 election must submit a request for a private letter ruling. (For further guidance, see Rev. Proc. 2007-1, 2007-1 CB 1 (or any applicable successor) and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(*b*) of this chapter.) Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules for partnerships that elect to apply section 1045. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for certain taxpayers other than C corporations and for eligible partners that elect to apply section 1045. Paragraph (d) of this section provides a limitation on the amount of gain that an eligible partner does not recognize under section 1045. Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules for partnership distributions of QSB stock to an eligible partner. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules for contributions of QSB stock or replacement QSB stock to a partnership. Paragraph (g) of this section provides definitions of certain terms used in section 1045 and this section. Paragraph (h) of this section provides reporting rules for partnerships and partners that elect to apply section 1045. Paragraph (i) of this section provides examples illustrating the provisions of this section. Paragraph (j) of this section contains the effective/applicability date.


(b) *Partnership election*—(1) *Partnership purchase of replacement QSB stock.* A partnership that holds QSB stock for more than 6 months, sells such QSB stock, and purchases replacement QSB stock may elect in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section to apply section 1045. If the partnership elects to apply section 1045, then, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(4) and (d) of this section, each eligible partner shall not recognize its distributive share of any partnership section 1045 gain (as determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section). For this purpose, partnership section 1045 gain equals the partnership's gain from the sale of the QSB stock reduced by the greater of—


(i) The amount of the gain from the sale of the QSB stock that is treated as ordinary income; or


(ii) The excess of the amount realized by the partnership on the sale over the total cost of all replacement QSB stock purchased by the partnership (excluding the cost of any replacement QSB stock purchased by the partnership that is otherwise taken into account under section 1045).


(2) *Partner's distributive share of partnership section 1045 gain.* A partner's distributive share of partnership section 1045 gain shall be in the same proportion as the partner's distributive share of the partnership's gain from the sale of the QSB stock. For this purpose, the partnership's gain from the sale of QSB stock and the partner's distributive share of that gain are determined without regard to basis adjustments under section 743(b) and paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.


(3) *Basis adjustments*—(i) *Partner's interest in a partnership.* The adjusted basis of an eligible partner's interest in a partnership shall not be increased under section 705(a)(1) by gain from a partnership's sale of QSB stock that is not recognized by the partner as the result of a partnership election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.


(ii) *Partnership's replacement QSB stock*—(A) *Rule.* The basis of a partnership's replacement QSB stock is reduced (in the order acquired) by the amount of gain from the partnership's sale of QSB stock that is not recognized by an eligible partner as a result of the partnership's election under section 1045. The basis adjustment with respect to any amount described in this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) constitutes an adjustment to the basis of the partnership's replacement QSB stock with respect to that partner only. The effect of such a basis adjustment is determined under the principles of § 1.743-1(g), (h), and (j) except as modified in this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A). If a partnership sells QSB stock with respect to which a basis adjustment has been made under this paragraph (b)(3)(ii), and the partnership makes an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to the sale and purchases replacement QSB stock, the basis adjustment shall carry over to the replacement QSB stock except to the extent otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(3)(ii). The basis adjustment that carries over to the replacement QSB stock shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the eligible partner's distributive share of the excess, if any, of the greater of the amount determined under paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section from the sale of the QSB stock, over the partnership's gain from the sale of the QSB stock (determined without regard to basis adjustments under section 743 or paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section). The excess amount that reduces the basis adjustment shall be accounted for as gain in accordance with § 1.743-1(j)(3). See *Example 5* of paragraph (i) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(ii), a partnership must presume that a partner did not recognize that partner's distributive share of the partnership section 1045 gain as a result of the partnership's section 1045 election unless the partner notifies the partnership to the contrary as described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. However, if a partnership knows that a particular partner is classified, for Federal tax purposes, as a C corporation, then the partnership may presume that the partner did not defer recognition of its distributive share of the partnership section 1045 gain, even in the absence of a notification by the partner. If a partnership makes an election under section 1045, but an eligible partner opts out of the election under paragraph (b)(4) of this section and provides to the partnership the notification required under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, no basis adjustments under this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) are required with respect to that partner as a result of the section 1045 election by the partnership.


(B) *Tiered-partnership rule.* If a partnership (upper-tier partnership) holds an interest in another partnership (lower-tier partnership) that makes an election under section 1045, the portion of the lower-tier partnership's basis adjustment as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section in the replacement QSB stock must be segregated and allocated to the upper-tier partnership and any eligible partner as defined in paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section. Similarly, that portion of the basis of the upper-tier partnership's interest in the lower-tier partnership attributable to the basis adjustment as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section in the lower-tier partnership's replacement QSB stock must be segregated and allocated solely to any eligible partner as defined in paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section.


(C) *Statement of adjustments.* A partnership that must adjust the basis of replacement QSB stock under this paragraph (b) must attach a statement to the partnership return for the taxable year in which the partnership purchases replacement QSB stock setting forth the computation of the adjustment, the replacement QSB stock to which the adjustment has been made, the date(s) on which such QSB stock was acquired by the partnership, and the amount of the adjustment that is allocated to each partner.


(4) *Eligible partners may opt out of partnership's section 1045 election.* An eligible partner may opt out of the partnership's section 1045 election with respect to QSB stock either by recognizing the partner's distributive share of the partnership section 1045 gain, or by making a partner section 1045 election under paragraph (c) of this section with respect to the partner's distributive share of the partnership section 1045 gain. See paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section for applicable notification requirements. Opting out of a partnership's section 1045 election under this paragraph (b)(4) does not constitute a revocation of the partnership's election, and such election shall continue to apply to other partners of the partnership.


(5) *Notice requirements*—(i) *Partnership notification to partners.* A partnership that makes an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must notify all of its partners of the election and the purchase of replacement QSB stock, in accordance with the applicable forms and instructions, and separately state each partner's distributive share of partnership section 1045 gain from the sale of QSB stock under section 702. Each partner shall determine whether the partner is an eligible partner within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3) of this section and report the partner's distributive share of partnership section 1045 gain from the partnership's sale of QSB stock, including gain not recognized, in accordance with the applicable forms and instructions.


(ii) *Partner notification to partnership.* Any partner that must recognize all or part of the partner's distributive share of partnership section 1045 gain must notify the partnership, in writing, of the amount of partnership section 1045 gain that is recognized by the partner. Similarly, an eligible partner that opts out of a partnership's section 1045 election under paragraph (b)(4) of this section must notify the partnership, in writing, that the partner is opting out of the partnership's section 1045 election.


(c) *Partner election*—(1) *In general*—(i) *Rule.* An eligible partner of a partnership that sells QSB stock (selling partnership) may elect in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section to apply section 1045 if replacement QSB stock is purchased by the eligible partner. An eligible partner of a selling partnership may elect in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section to apply section 1045 if replacement QSB stock is purchased by a partnership in which the taxpayer is a partner (directly or through an upper-tier partnership) on the date on which the partnership acquires the replacement QSB stock (purchasing partnership). A taxpayer other than a C corporation that sells QSB stock held for more than 6 months at the time of the sale may elect in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section to apply section 1045 if replacement QSB stock is purchased by a purchasing partnership (including a selling partnership).


(ii) *Partner purchase of replacement QSB stock.* Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, an eligible partner of a selling partnership that elects to apply section 1045 with respect to the eligible partner's purchase of replacement QSB stock must recognize its distributive share of gain from the sale of QSB stock by the selling partnership only to the extent of the greater of—


(A) The amount of the eligible partner's distributive share of the selling partnership's gain from the sale of the QSB stock that is treated as ordinary income; or


(B) The excess of the eligible partner's share of the selling partnership's amount realized (as determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) on the sale by the selling partnership of the QSB stock (excluding the cost of any replacement QSB stock purchased by the selling partnership) over the cost of any replacement QSB stock purchased by the eligible partner (excluding the cost of any replacement QSB stock that is otherwise taken into account under section 1045).


(iii) *Partnership purchase of replacement QSB stock—(A) Partner of a selling partnership.* Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, an eligible partner that treats its interest in QSB stock purchased by a purchasing partnership as a purchase of replacement QSB stock by the eligible partner and that elects to apply section 1045 with respect to such purchase must recognize its total gain (the eligible partner's distributive share of gain from the selling partnership's sale of QSB stock and any gain taken into account under paragraph (c)(5) of this section from the sale of replacement QSB stock) only to the extent of the greater of—


(*1*) The amount of the eligible partner's distributive share of the selling partnership's gain from the sale of the QSB stock that is treated as ordinary income; or


(*2*) The excess of the eligible partner's share of the selling partnership's amount realized (as determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) on the sale by the selling partnership of the QSB stock (excluding the cost of any replacement QSB stock purchased by the selling partnership) over the eligible partner's share of the purchasing partnership's cost of the replacement QSB stock, as determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section (excluding the cost of any QSB stock that is otherwise taken into account under section 1045).


(B) *Taxpayer other than a C corporation.* Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, a taxpayer other than a C corporation that treats its interest in QSB stock purchased by a purchasing partnership with respect to which the taxpayer is a partner as a purchase of replacement QSB stock by the taxpayer must recognize its gain from the sale of the QSB stock only to the extent of the greater of—


(*1*) The amount of gain from the sale of the QSB stock that is treated as ordinary income; or


(*2*) The excess of the amount realized by the taxpayer on the sale of the QSB stock over the partner's share of the purchasing partnership's cost of the replacement QSB stock, as determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section (excluding the cost of any QSB stock that is otherwise taken into account under section 1045).


(2) *Eligible partner's share of amount realized by partnership*—(i) *General rule.* The eligible partner's share of the amount realized by the selling partnership is the amount realized by the partnership on the sale of the QSB stock (excluding the cost of any replacement QSB stock otherwise taken into account under section 1045) multiplied by the following fraction—


(A) The numerator of which is the eligible partner's distributive share of the partnership's realized gain from the sale of the QSB stock; and


(B) The denominator of which is the partnership's realized gain on the sale of the QSB stock.


(ii) *General rule modified for determining eligible partner's share of amount realized by purchasing partnership upon a sale of replacement QSB stock in certain situations*—(A) *No gain realized or loss realized on sale of replacement QSB stock.* If a purchasing partnership does not realize a gain or realizes a loss from the sale of replacement QSB stock for which an election under this section was made for purposes of applying paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, the eligible partner's share of the amount realized is—


(*1*) The greater of—


(*i*) The amount determined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section from a prior sale of QSB stock (that is not otherwise taken into account under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) in which the eligible partner had a distributive share of gain allocated to the eligible partner that was not recognized under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section; or


(*ii*) The amount realized by a taxpayer other than a C corporation from a prior sale of QSB stock (that is not otherwise taken into account under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) in which the taxpayer realized gain that was not recognized under paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section; less


(*2*) The eligible partner's distributive share of any loss recognized on the sale of replacement QSB stock, if applicable.


(B) *Eligible partner's interest in purchasing partnership is reduced and gain realized on sale of replacement QSB stock.* If an eligible partner's interest in a purchasing partnership is reduced subsequent to the sale of QSB stock and the purchasing partnership realizes a gain from the sale of the replacement QSB stock, the eligible partner's share of the amount realized upon a sale of replacement QSB stock must be determined under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section based on the distributive share of the partnership's realized gain that would have been allocated to the eligible partner if the eligible partner's interest in the partnership had not been reduced.


(iii) *Eligible partner's share of the amount realized.* For purposes of determining the eligible partner's share of the amount realized by the partnership, the partnership's realized gain from the sale of QSB stock and the eligible partner's distributive share of that gain are determined without regard to basis adjustments under section 743(b) and paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (c) of this section.


(3) *Partner's share of the cost of QSB stock purchased by a purchasing partnership.* The partner's share of the cost (adjusted basis) of replacement QSB stock purchased by a purchasing partnership is the percentage of the partnership's future income and gain, if any, that is reasonably expected to be allocated to the partner (determined without regard to any adjustment under section 1045) with respect to the replacement QSB stock that was purchased by the partnership, multiplied by the cost of that replacement QSB stock. The assumptions made by a partnership in determining the reasonably expected allocation of income and gain must be consistent for each partner. For example, a partnership may not treat the same item of income or gain as being reasonably expected to be allocated to more than one partner.


(4) *Basis adjustments*—(i) *Eligible partner's interest in selling partnership.* Under section 705(a)(1), the adjusted basis of an eligible partner's interest in a selling partnership that sells QSB stock is increased by the partner's distributive share of gain without regard to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. However, if the selling partnership is also a purchasing partnership, the adjusted basis of an eligible partner's interest in a partnership that sells QSB stock may be reduced under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section.


(ii) *Replacement QSB stock.* A partner's basis in any replacement QSB stock that is purchased by the partner, as well as the adjusted basis of any replacement QSB stock that is purchased by a purchasing partnership and that is treated as the partner's replacement QSB stock must be reduced (in the order replacement QSB stock is acquired by the partner and purchasing partnership, as applicable) by the partner's distributive share of the gain on the sale of the selling partnership's QSB stock that is not recognized by the partner under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or by the gain on a sale of QSB stock by the partner that is not recognized by the partner under section 1045, as applicable. If replacement QSB stock is purchased by the purchasing partnership, the purchasing partnership shall maintain its adjusted basis in the replacement QSB stock without regard to any basis adjustments required by this paragraph (c)(4)(ii). The eligible partner, however, shall in computing its distributive share of income, gain, loss and deduction from the purchasing partnership with respect to the replacement QSB stock take into account the variation between the adjusted basis in the QSB stock as determined under this paragraph (c)(4)(ii) and the adjusted basis determined without regard to this paragraph (c)(4)(ii). A partner must retain records setting forth the computation of this basis adjustment, the replacement QSB stock to which the adjustment has been made, and the date(s) on which such stock was acquired. See *Examples 7* and *8* of paragraph (i) of this section.


(iii) *Partner's basis in purchasing partnership interest.* A partner that treats the partner's interest in QSB stock purchased by a purchasing partnership as the partner's replacement QSB stock must reduce (in the order replacement QSB stock is acquired) the adjusted basis of the partner's interest in the purchasing partnership by the partner's distributive share of the gain on the sale of the selling partnership's QSB stock that is not recognized by the partner pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or by the gain on a sale of QSB stock by the partner that is not recognized by the partner under section 1045, as applicable. Similarly, a partner of an upper-tier partnership that treats the partner's interest in QSB stock purchased by a lower-tier purchasing partnership as the partner's replacement QSB stock must reduce (in the order replacement QSB stock is acquired) the adjusted basis of the partner's interest in the upper-tier partnership by the partner's distributive share of the gain on the sale of the selling partnership's QSB stock that is not recognized by the partner pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or by the gain on a sale of QSB stock by the partner that is not recognized by the partner under section 1045, as applicable.


(iv) *Increase in basis on sale of QSB stock by purchasing partnership.* A partner that recognizes gain under paragraph (c)(5) of this section must increase the adjusted basis of the partner's interest in the purchasing partnership under section 705(a)(1) by the amount of the gain recognized by that partner. Similarly, a partner in an upper-tier partnership that recognizes gain under paragraph (c)(5) of this section must increase the adjusted basis of the partner's interest in the upper-tier partnership under section 705(a)(1) by the amount of the gain recognized by that partner.


(5) *Partner recognition of gain.* At the time that either the partner or the purchasing partnership (whichever applies) sells or exchanges replacement QSB stock, the amount recognized by the partner is determined by taking into account the basis adjustments described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section. Similarly, a partner of an upper-tier partnership that owns an interest in a lower-tier partnership that holds replacement QSB stock must take into account the basis adjustments described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section in determining the amount recognized by the partner on a sale of the interest in the lower-tier partnership by the upper-tier partnership or the partner's distributive share of gain from the upper-tier partnership. See paragraph (e)(4) of this section for rules applicable to certain distributions of replacement QSB stock.


(d) *Nonrecognition limitation*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of this section, the amount of gain that an eligible partner does not recognize under paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1) of this section cannot exceed the nonrecognition limitation. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the nonrecognition limitation is equal to the product of—


(i) The partnership's realized gain from the sale of the QSB stock, determined without regard to any basis adjustment under section 734(b) or section 743(b) (other than basis adjustments described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section); and


(ii) The eligible partner's smallest percentage interest in partnership capital as determined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. See *Example 9* of paragraph (i) of this section.


(2) *Eligible partner's smallest percentage interest in partnership capital.* An eligible partner's smallest percentage interest in partnership capital is the eligible partner's percentage share of capital determined at the time of the acquisition of the QSB stock as adjusted prior to the time the QSB stock is sold to reflect any reduction in the capital of the eligible partner including a reduction as a result of a disproportionate capital contribution by other partners, a disproportionate capital distribution to the eligible partner or the transfer of an interest by the eligible partner, but excluding income and loss allocations.


(3) *Special rule for tiered partnerships.* For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, if an eligible partner is treated as owning an interest in a lower-tier purchasing partnership through an upper-tier partnership, the eligible partner's percentage interest in the purchasing partnership shall be proportionately adjusted to reflect the eligible partner's percentage interest in the upper-tier partnership.


(e) *Partnership distribution of QSB stock to a partner*—(1) *In general.* Subject to paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, in the case of a partnership distribution of QSB stock to a partner, the partner shall be treated for purposes of this section as—


(i) Having acquired such stock in the same manner as the partnership; and


(ii) Having held such stock during any continuous period immediately preceding the distribution during which it was held by the partnership. See *Examples 10* and *11* of paragraph (i) of this section.


(2) *Eligibility under section 1202(c).* Paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not apply unless all eligibility requirements with respect to QSB stock as defined in section 1202(c) are met by the distributing partnership with respect to its investment in QSB stock.


(3) *Distribution nonrecognition limitation*—(i) *Generally.* The amount of gain that an eligible partner does not recognize under this section on the sale of QSB stock that was distributed by the partnership to the partner cannot exceed the distribution nonrecognition limitation. For this purpose, the distribution nonrecognition limitation is—


(A) The partner's section 1045 amount realized (determined under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section); reduced by


(B) The partner's section 1045 adjusted basis (determined under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section).


(ii) *Section 1045 amount realized*—(A) *QSB stock received in liquidation of partner's interest and in certain nonliquidating distributions.* If a partner receives QSB stock from the partnership in a distribution in liquidation of the partner's interest in the partnership or as part of a series of related distributions by the partnership in which the partnership distributes all of the partnership's QSB stock of a particular type, then the partner's section 1045 amount realized is the partner's amount realized from the sale of the distributed QSB stock, multiplied by a fraction—


(*1*) The numerator of which is the partner's smallest percentage interest in partnership capital determined under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section; and


(*2*) The denominator of which is the partner's percentage interest in that type of QSB stock immediately after the distribution (determined under paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section).


(B) *Partner's smallest percentage interest in partnership capital.* A partner's smallest percentage interest in partnership capital is the partner's percentage share of capital determined at the time of the acquisition of the QSB stock as adjusted prior to the time the QSB stock is distributed to the partner to reflect any reduction in the capital of the partner including a reduction as a result of a disproportionate capital contribution by other partners, a disproportionate capital distribution to the partner, or the transfer of a capital interest by the partner, but excluding income and loss allocations.


(C) *QSB stock received in other distributions.* If a partner receives QSB stock in a distribution from the partnership that is not described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, the partner's section 1045 amount realized is the partner's amount realized from the sale of the distributed QSB stock multiplied by the partner's smallest percentage interest in partnership capital determined under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.


(iii) *Section 1045 adjusted basis*—(A) *QSB stock received in liquidation of partner's interest and in certain nonliquidating distributions.* If a partner receives QSB stock from the partnership in a distribution in liquidation of the partner's interest in the partnership or as part of a series of related distributions by the partnership in which the partnership distributes all of the partnership's QSB stock of a particular type, then the partner's section 1045 adjusted basis is the product of—


(*1*) The partnership's basis in all of the QSB stock of the type distributed (without regard to basis adjustments under section 734(b) or section 743(b), other than basis adjustments described in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (c)(4)(ii) of this section);


(*2*) The partner's smallest percentage interest in partnership capital determined under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section; and


(*3*) The proportion of the distributed QSB stock that was sold by the partner.


(B) *QSB stock received in other distributions.* If a partner receives QSB stock in a distribution from the partnership that is not described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, the partner's section 1045 adjusted basis is the product of—


(*1*) The partnership's basis in the QSB stock sold by the partner (without regard to basis adjustments under section 734(b) or section 743(b), other than basis adjustments described in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (c)(4)(ii) of this section); and


(*2*) The partner's smallest percentage interest in partnership capital determined under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.


(iv) *Partner's percentage interest in distributed QSB stock.* For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), a partner's percentage interest in a type of QSB stock immediately after a partnership distribution is the value (as of the date of the distribution) of the QSB stock distributed to the partner divided by the value (as of the date of the distribution) of all of that type of QSB stock that was acquired by the partnership.


(v) *QSB stock of the same type.* For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), QSB stock will be of the same type as the distributed QSB stock if it has the same issuer and the same rights and preferences as the distributed QSB stock and was acquired by the partnership at original issue.


(4) *Distribution of replacement QSB stock to a partner that reduces another partner's interest in the replacement QSB stock.* For purposes of this section, a partner must recognize gain upon a distribution of replacement QSB stock to another partner that reduces the partner's share of the replacement QSB stock held by a partnership. The amount of gain that the partner must recognize is determined based on the amount of gain that the partner would recognize upon a sale of the distributed replacement QSB stock for its fair market value on the date of the distribution but not to exceed the amount that was previously not recognized by the partner under section 1045 with respect to the distributed replacement QSB stock. Any gain recognized by a partner whose interest is reduced must be taken into account in determining the adjusted basis of the partner's interest in the partnership and also taken into account in determining the partnership's adjusted basis in the QSB stock distributed to another partner under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.


(f) *Contribution of QSB stock or replacement QSB stock to a partnership.* Section 721 applies to a contribution of QSB stock to a partnership. Except as provided in section 721(b), any gain that was not recognized by the taxpayer under section 1045 is not recognized when the taxpayer contributes QSB stock to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest. Stock that is contributed to a partnership is not QSB stock in the hands of the partnership. See *Example 12* of paragraph (i) of this section.


(g) *Definitions.* For purposes of section 1045 and this section, the following terms are defined as follows:


(1) *Qualified small business stock.* The term *qualified small business stock* (QSB stock) has the meaning provided in section 1202(c). The term “QSB stock” does not include an interest in a partnership that purchases or holds QSB stock. See *Example 1* of paragraph (i) of this section.


(2) *Replacement QSB stock.* The term *replacement QSB stock* is any QSB stock purchased within 60 days beginning on the date of a sale of QSB stock.


(3) *Eligible partner*—(i) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(1), (g)(3)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of this section, an eligible partner with respect to QSB stock is a taxpayer other than a C corporation that holds an interest in a partnership on the date the partnership acquires the QSB stock and at all times thereafter for more than 6 months until the partnership sells or distributes the QSB stock.


(ii) *Acquisition by gift or at death.* For purposes of paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, a taxpayer who acquires from a partner (other than a C corporation) by gift or at death an interest in a partnership that holds QSB stock is treated as having held the acquired interest in the partnership during the period the partner (other than a C corporation) held the interest in the partnership.


(iii) *Tiered partnership.* For purposes of paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, if a partnership (upper-tier partnership) holds an interest in another partnership (lower-tier partnership) that holds QSB stock, then the upper-tier partnership's ownership of the lower-tier partnership is disregarded and each partner of the upper-tier partnership is treated as owning the interest in the lower-tier partnership directly. The partner of the upper-tier partnership is treated as owning the interest in the lower-tier partnership during the period in which both—


(A) The partner of the upper-tier partnership held an interest in the upper-tier partnership; and


(B) The upper-tier partnership held an interest in the lower-tier partnership. See *Examples 3* and *4* of paragraph (i) of this section.


(iv) *Multiple tiers of partnerships.* Principles similar to those described in paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section apply where a taxpayer holds an interest in a lower-tier partnership through multiple tiers of partnerships.


(4) *Month(s).* For purposes of this section, the term *month(s)* means a period commencing on the same numerical day of any calendar month as the day on which the QSB stock is sold and ending with the close of the day preceding the numerically corresponding day of the succeeding calendar month or, if there is no corresponding day, with the last day of the succeeding calendar month.


(h) *Reporting and election rules*—(1) *Time and manner of making election.* A partnership making an election under section 1045 (as described under paragraph (b)(1) of this section) must do so on the partnership's timely filed (including extensions) Federal income tax return for the taxable year during which the sale of QSB stock occurs. A partner making an election under section 1045 (as described under paragraph (c)(1) of this section) must do so on the partner's timely filed (including extensions) Federal income tax return for the taxable year during which the partner's distributive share of the partnership's gain from the sale of the QSB stock is taken into account by such partner under section 706.
