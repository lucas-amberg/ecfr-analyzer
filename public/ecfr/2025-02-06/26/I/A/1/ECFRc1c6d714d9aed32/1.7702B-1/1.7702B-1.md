# § 1.7702B-1   Consumer protection provisions.

(a) *In general.* Under sections 7702B(b)(1)(F), 7702B(g), and 4980C, qualified long-term care insurance contracts and issuers of those contracts are required to satisfy certain provisions of the Long-Term Care Insurance Model Act (Model Act) and Long-Term Care Insurance Model Regulation (Model Regulation) promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), as adopted as of January 1993. The requirements for qualified long-term care insurance contracts under section 7702B(b)(1)(F) and (g) relate to guaranteed renewal or noncancellability, prohibitions on limitations and exclusions, extension of benefits, continuation or conversion of coverage, discontinuance and replacement of policies, unintentional lapse, disclosure, prohibitions against post-claims underwriting, minimum standards, inflation protection, prohibitions against pre-existing conditions exclusions and probationary periods, and prior hospitalization. The requirements for qualified long-term care insurance contracts under section 4980C relate to application forms and replacement coverage, reporting requirements, filing requirements for marketing, standards for marketing, appropriateness of recommended purchase, standard format outline of coverage, delivery of a shopper's guide, right to return, outline of coverage, certificates under group plans, policy summary, monthly reports on accelerated death benefits, and incontestability period.


(b) *Coordination with State requirements*—(1) *Contracts issued in a State that imposes more stringent requirements.* If a State imposes a requirement that is more stringent than the analogous requirement imposed by section 7702B(g) or 4980C, then, under section 4980C(f), compliance with the more stringent requirement of State law is considered compliance with the parallel requirement of section 7702B(g) or 4980C. The principles of paragraph (b)(3) of this section apply to any case in which a State imposes a requirement that is more stringent than the analogous requirement imposed by section 7702B(g) or 4980C (as described in this paragraph (b)(1)), but in which there has been a failure to comply with that State requirement.


(2) *Contracts issued in a State that has adopted the model provisions.* If a State imposes a requirement that is the same as the parallel requirement imposed by section 7702B(g) or 4980C, compliance with that requirement of State law is considered compliance with the parallel requirement of section 7702B(g) or 4980C, and failure to comply with that requirement of State law is considered failure to comply with the parallel requirement of section 7702B(g) or 4980C.


(3) *Contracts issued in a State that has not adopted the model provisions or more stringent requirements.* If a State has not adopted the Model Act, the Model Regulation, or a requirement that is the same as or more stringent than the analogous requirement imposed by section 7702B(g) or 4980C, then the language, caption, format, and content requirements imposed by sections 7702B(g) and 4980C with respect to contracts, applications, outlines of coverage, policy summaries, and notices will be considered satisfied for a contract subject to the law of that State if the language, caption, format, and content are substantially similar to those required under the parallel provision of the Model Act or Model Regulation. Only nonsubstantive deviations are permitted in order for language, caption, format, and content to be considered substantially similar to the requirements of the Model Act or Model Regulation.


(c) *Effective date.* This section applies with respect to contracts issued after December 10, 1999.
