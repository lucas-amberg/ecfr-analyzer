**Authority:** Sections 1.9003 to 1.9003-5 issued under sec. 302(c), 74 Stat. 292, as amended; 26 U.S.C. 613 note.




(a) *By whom election is to be made*—(1) *In general.* Generally, the taxpayer to whom the Act applies will exercise the elections provided therein. In the case of a partnership or a corporation electing under the provisions of subchapter S, chapter 1 of the Code, the election shall be exercised by the persons specified in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, respectively.


(2) *Partnerships.* In the case of a partnership, the election under section 3 or 4(a) of the Act shall be exercised by the partnership. If an election is made by the partnership under section 4(a) of the Act, any election under section 4(b) of the Act to pay the net increase in tax in installments shall be made by each partner separately. The determination as to whether the net increase in tax resulting from the election under section 4(a) of the Act exceeds $2,500 shall be made with reference to the increase or decrease in the tax of each partner attributable to the adjustment to his distributive share of the partnership income resulting from the election.


(3) *Subchapter S corporations.* In the case of an electing small business corporation under subchapter S, chapter 1 of the Code, the election under section 3 or 4(a) of the Act shall be made by such corporation. An election under section 4(b) of the Act to pay the net increase in tax in installments shall, to the extent the net increase in tax resulting from the election is attributable to adjustments to income for taxable years for which the corporation was not an electing small business corporation, be made by the corporation. The determination as to whether the net increase in tax for such taxable years exceeds $2,500 shall be made with reference to the increase or decrease in tax of the corporation. Any election under section 4(b) of the Act to pay the net increase in tax in installments shall, to the extent the increase in tax is attributable to years for which the corporation was an electing small business corporation, be made by the shareholders separately. The determination in such a case as to whether the net increase in tax for such taxable years exceeds $2,500 shall be made with reference to the increases or decreases in the tax of each shareholder attributable to the adjustments to taxable income of the electing small business corporation resulting from the election.


(b) *Time and manner of making elections*—(1) *In general.* Any election made under the Act shall be made by the taxpayers described in paragraph (a) of this section before September 1, 1960, by filing a statement with the district director with whom such taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year in which the election is made is required to be filed. A copy of the statement of election shall be attached to and filed with such taxpayer's income tax return for such taxable year.


(2) *Election to have section 481 apply.* An election under section 3 of the Act shall be made in the form of a statement which shall include the following: 


(i) A clear indication that an election is being made under section 3 of the Act;

(iii) The year of change as defined in section 3(b) of the Act.

(ii) Information sufficient to establish eligibility to make the election; and


(iii) The taxable years to which the election applies.


(4) *Election to pay tax in installments.* (i) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, if the taxpayer making the election under section 4(a) of the Act also desires to make the election under section 4(b) of the Act to pay the increase in tax in installments, then the statement of election shall include the following additional information:

(*b*) A summary of the total increases and decreases in tax, together with interest thereon, in sufficient detail to establish eligibility to make the election; and


(*c*) The number of annual installments in which the taxpayer elects to pay the net increase in tax.


(ii) Where a partnership or electing small business corporation under subchapter S, chapter 1 of the Code, has made an election under section 4(a) of the Act, and any partner or shareholder, as the case may be, desires to make an election under section 4(b) of the Act, a statement of election shall be filed by such partner or shareholder containing the following information:


(*a*) A clear indication that an election is being made under section 4(b) of the Act; 


(*b*) A summary of the total increases and decreases in tax, together with interest thereon, of such partner or shareholder in sufficient detail to establish eligibility to make the election;


(*c*) The number of annual installments in which the partner or shareholder elects to pay the net increase in tax; and
