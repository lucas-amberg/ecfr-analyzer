# § 1.9004-2   Effect of election.

(a) *In general.* If a taxpayer makes the election described in paragraph (b) of § 1.9004-1, he shall be deemed to have consented to the application of the Act with respect to all the clay and shale described in that paragraph for all taxable years for which the election is effective whether or not the taxpayer is litigating the issue for any of such years. Thus, in applying section 613 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (and corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) to those years:


(1) The “gross income from the property” for purposes of section 613(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (and corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) shall be 50 percent of the amount for which the mineowner or operator sold, during the taxable year, the building or paving brick, drainage and roofing tile, sewer pipe, flower pots, and kindred products manufactured from the clay and shale described in paragraph (b) of § 1.9004-1, but shall not exceed an amount equal to $12.50 multiplied by the number of short tons of all such clay or shale mined and used by the mineowner or operator in the manufacture of the products sold during the taxable year; and


(2) The “taxable income from the property” (computed without allowance for depletion) for purposes of section 613(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (and corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) shall be 50 percent of the taxable income from the manufactured products sold during the taxable year (computed without allowance for depletion).


(b) *Effect on depletion rates and other items.* The election shall have no effect on the applicable rate of percentage depletion for the taxable years to which the election is effective. In applying the election to the years affected there shall be taken into account the effect that any adjustments resulting from the election shall have on other items affected thereby, such as charitable contributions, foreign tax credit, net operating loss, and the effect that adjustments to any such items shall have on other taxable years. The provisions of the Act are applicable with respect to taxable years subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for purposes of applying sections 450 and 453 of that Code.
