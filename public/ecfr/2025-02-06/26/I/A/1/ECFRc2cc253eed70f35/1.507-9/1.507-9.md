# ยง 1.507-9   Abatement of taxes.

(a) *General rule.* The Commissioner may at his discretion abate the unpaid portion of the assessment of any tax imposed by section 507(c), or any liability in respect thereof, if:


(1) The private foundation distributes all of its net assets to one or more organizations described in section 170(b)(1)(A) (other than in clauses (vii) or (viii)) each of which has been in existence and so described for a continuous period of at least 60 calendar months, or


(2) Effective assurance is given to the Commissioner in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section that the assets of the organization which are dedicated to charitable purposes will, in fact, be used for charitable purposes


(b) *State proceedings.* (1) The Commissioner may at his discretion abate the unpaid portion of the assessment of any tax imposed by section 507(c), or any liability in respect thereof, under the procedures outlined in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph. Such tax may not be abated by the Commissioner unless he determines that corrective action as defined in paragraph (c) of this section has been taken. The Commissioner may not abate by reason of section 507(g) any amount of such tax which has already been collected since only the unpaid portion thereof can be abated.


(2) The appropriate State officer shall have 1 year from the date of notification prescribed in section 6104(c) that a notice of deficiency of tax imposed under section 507(c) has been issued with respect to a foundation, to advise the Commissioner that corrective action has been initiated pursuant to State law as may be ordered or approved by a court of competent jurisdiction. Corrective action may be initiated either by the appropriate State officer or by an organization described in section 509(a) (1), (2), or (3) which is a beneficiary of the private foundation and has enforceable rights against such foundation under State law. Copies of all pleadings and other documents filed with the court at the initial stages of the proceedings shall be attached to the notification made by the State officer to the Commissioner. Prior to notification by the appropriate State officer that corrective action has been initiated, the Commissioner shall follow those procedures which would apply with respect to the assessment and collection of the tax imposed under section 507(c) without regard to section 507(g)(2). Subsequent to notification by the appropriate State officer that corrective action has been initiated, the Commissioner shall suspend action with respect to the assessment or collection of tax imposed under section 507(c) until notified of the final determination of such corrective action, as long as any such resulting delay does not jeopardize the collection of such tax and does not cause collection to be barred by operation of law or any rule of law. In any case where collection of such tax is about to be barred by operation of section 6502 and the Commissioner has not been advised of the final determination of corrective action, the Commissioner should make every effort to obtain appropriate agreements with the foundation subject to such tax to extend the period of limitations under section 6502(a)(2). Where such agreements are obtained, action with respect to the assessment and collection of such tax may be suspended to the extent not inconsistent with this subparagraph.


(3) Upon receipt of certification from the appropriate State officer that action has been ordered or approved by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Commissioner may abate the unpaid portion of the assessment of tax imposed by section 507(c), or any liability in respect thereof, if in his judgment such action is corrective action within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section. In the event that such action is not corrective action, the Commissioner may in his discretion again suspend action on the assessment and collection of such tax until corrective action is obtained, or if in his judgment corrective action cannot be obtained, he may resume the assessment and collection of such tax.


(c) *Corrective action.* The term *corrective action* referred to in paragraph (b) of this section means vigorous enforcement of State laws sufficient to assure implementation of the provisions of chapter 42 and insure that the assets of such private foundation are preserved for such charitable or other purposes specified in section 501(c)(3). Except where assets of the terminated private foundation are transferred to an organization described in section 509(a) (1) through (4) the State is required to take such action to assure that the provisions of section 508(e)(1) (A) and (B) are applicable to the terminated foundation (or any transferee) with respect to such assets as if such organization were a private foundation. Thus, the governing instrument of such organization must include provisions with respect to such assets:


(1) Requiring its income therefrom for each taxable year to be distributed at such time and in such manner as not to subject such organization to tax under section 4942 (as if the organization were a private foundation),


(2) Prohibiting such organization from engaging in any act of self-dealing (as defined in section 4941(d) as if the organization were a private foundation),


(3) Prohibiting such organization from retaining any excess business holdings (as defined in section 4943(c) as if the organization were a private foundation),


(4) Prohibiting such organization from making any investments in such manner as to subject such organization to tax under section 4944 (as if the organization were a private foundation), and


(5) Prohibiting such organization from making any taxable expenditures (as defined in section 4945(d) as if the organization were a private foundation). Consequently, in cases where the preceding sentence applies, although the private foundation status of an organization is terminated for tax purposes, it is contemplated that its status under State law would remain unchanged, because the tax under section 507(c) has been abated solely because the Commissioner has been given effective assurance that there is vigorous enforcement of State laws sufficient to assure implementation of the provisions of chapter 42. Therefore, in such a case while chapter 42 will not apply to acts occurring subsequent to termination which previously would have resulted in the imposition of tax under chapter 42, it is contemplated that there will be vigorous enforcement of State laws (including laws made applicable by the provisions in the governing instrument) with respect to such acts. Notwithstanding the preceding three sentences, no amendment to the organization's governing instrument is necessary where there are provisions of State law which have the effect of requiring a terminated private foundation to which the rules of subparagraphs (1) through (5) of this paragraph apply to be subject to such rules whether or not there are such provisions in such terminated private foundation's governing instrument.
