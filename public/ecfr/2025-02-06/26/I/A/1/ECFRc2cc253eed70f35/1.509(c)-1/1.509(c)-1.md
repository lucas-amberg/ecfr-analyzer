# ยง 1.509(c)-1   Status of organization after termination of private foundation status.

(a) *In general.* For purposes of part II of subchapter F of this chapter, an organization whose status as a private foundation is terminated under section 507 shall be treated as an organization created on the day after the date of such termination. An organization whose private foundation status has been terminated under the provisions of section 507(a) will, if it continues to operate, be treated as a new organization and must, if it desires to be classified under section 501(c)(3), give notification that it is applying for recognition of section 501(c)(3) status pursuant to the provisions of section 508(a).


(b) *Effect upon section 507(d)(1).* If the private foundation status of an organization has been terminated under section 507(b)(1)(B) and the regulations thereunder, and:


(1) Such organization does not continue at all times thereafter to meet the requirements of section 509(a) (1), (2), or (3) (and is therefore no longer excluded from the definition of a private foundation); and


(2) The status of such organization as a private foundation is thereafter terminated under section 507(a)
