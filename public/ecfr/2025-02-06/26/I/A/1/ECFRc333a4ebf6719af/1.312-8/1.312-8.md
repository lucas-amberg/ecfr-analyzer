# ยง 1.312-8   Effect on earnings and profits of receipt of tax-free distributions requiring adjustment or allocation of basis of stock.

(a) In order to determine the effect on earnings and profits, where a corporation receives (after February 28, 1913) from a second corporation a distribution which (under the law applicable to the year in which the distribution was made) was not a taxable dividend to the shareholders of the second corporation, section 312(f) prescribes certain rules. It provides that the amount of such distribution shall not increase the earnings and profits of the first or receiving corporation in the following cases: (1) No such increase shall be made in respect of the part of such distribution which (under the law applicable to the year in which the distribution was made) is directly applied in reduction of the basis of the stock in respect of which the distribution was made and (2) no such increase shall be made if (under the law applicable to the year in which the distribution was made) the distribution causes the basis of the stock in respect of which the distribution was made to be allocated between such stock and the property received (or such basis would but for section 307(b) be so allocated). Where, therefore, the law (applicable to the year in which the distribution was made, as, for example, a distribution in 1934 from earnings and profits accumulated before March 1, 1913) requires that the amount of such distribution shall be applied against and reduce the basis of the stock with respect to which the distribution was made, there is no increase in the earnings and profits by reason of the receipt of such distribution. Similarly, where there is received by a corporation a distribution from another corporation in the form of a stock dividend and the law applicable to the year in which such distribution was made requires the allocation, as between the old stock and the stock received as a dividend, of the basis of the old stock (or such basis would but for section 307(b) be so allocated), then there is no increase in the earnings and profits by reason of the receipt of such stock dividend even though such stock dividend constitutes income within the meaning of the sixteenth amendment to the Constitution. 


(b) The principles set forth in paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:
