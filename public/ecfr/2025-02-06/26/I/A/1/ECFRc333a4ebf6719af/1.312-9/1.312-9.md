(a) In order to determine, for the purpose of ascertaining the source of dividend distributions, that part of the earnings and profits which is represented by increase in value of property accrued before, but realized on or after, March 1, 1913, section 312(g) prescribes certain rules. 


(b)(1) Section 312(g)(1) sets forth the general rule with respect to computing the increase to be made in that part of the earnings and profits consisting of increase in value of property accrued before, but realized on or after, March 1, 1913.

If the amount so applied in reduction of the loss exceeds such loss, the excess over such loss shall increase that part of the earnings and profits consisting of increase in value of property accrued before, but realized on or after March 1, 1913.
