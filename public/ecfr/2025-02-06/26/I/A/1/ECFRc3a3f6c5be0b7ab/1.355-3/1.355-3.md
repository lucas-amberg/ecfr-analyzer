# § 1.355-3   Active conduct of a trade or business.

(a) *General requirements*—(1) *Application of section 355.* Under section 355(b)(1), a distribution of stock, or stock and securities, of a controlled corporation qualifies under section 355 only if—


(i) The distributing and the controlled corporations are each engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business immediately after the distribution (section 355(b)(1)(A)), or


(ii) Immediately before the distribution, the distributing corporation had no assets other than stock or securities of the controlled corporations, and each of the controlled corporations is engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business immediately after the distribution (section 355(b)(1)(B)). A *de minimis* amount of assets held by the distributing corporation shall be disregarded for purposes of this paragraph (a)(1)(ii).


(2) *Examples.* Paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:


(b) *Active conduct of a trade or business defined*—(1) *In general.* Section 355(b)(2) provides rules for determining whether a corporation is treated as engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business for purposes of section 355(b)(1). Under section 355(b)(2)(A), a corporation is treated as engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business if it is itself engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business or if substantially all of its assets consist of the stock, or stock and securities, of a corporation or corporations controlled by it (immediately after the distribution) each of which is engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business.


(2) *Active conduct of a trade or business immediately after distribution*—(i) *In general.* For purposes of section 355(b), a corporation shall be treated as engaged in the “active conduct of a trade or business” immediately after the distribution if the assets and activities of the corporation satisfy the requirements and limitations described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section.


(ii) *Trade or business.* A corporation shall be treated as engaged in a trade or business immediately after the distribution if a specific group of activities are being carried on by the corporation for the purpose of earning income or profit, and the activities included in such group include every operation that forms a part of, or a step in, the process of earning income or profit. Such group of activities ordinarily must include the collection of income and the payment of expenses.


(iii) *Active conduct.* For purposes of section 355(b), the determination whether a trade or business is actively conducted will be made from all of the facts and circumstances. Generally, the corporation is required itself to perform active and substantial management and operational functions. Generally, activities performed by the corporation itself do not include activities performed by persons outside the corporation, including independent contractors. A corporation may satisfy the requirements of this subdivision (iii) through the activities that it performs itself, even though some of its activities are performed by others. Separations of real property all or substantially all of which is occupied prior to the distribution by the distributing or the controlled corporation (or by any corporation controlled directly or indirectly by either of those corporations) will be carefully scrutinized with respect to the requirements of section 355(b) and this § 1.355-3.


(iv) *Limitations.* The active conduct of a trade or business does not include— 


(A) The holding for investment purposes of stock, securities, land, or other property, or 


(B) The ownership and operation (including leasing) of real or personal property used in a trade or business, unless the owner performs significant services with respect to the operation and management of the property. 


(3) *Active conduct for five-year period preceding distribution.* Under section 355(b)(2)(B), a trade or business that is relied upon to meet the requirements of section 355(b) must have been actively conducted throughout the five-year period ending on the date of the distribution. For purposes of this subparagraph (3)— 


(i) Activities which constitute a trade or business under the tests described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be treated as meeting the requirement of the preceding sentence if such activities were actively conducted throughout the 5-year period ending on the date of distribution, and 


(ii) The fact that a trade or business underwent change during the five-year period preceding the distribution (for example, by the addition of new or the dropping of old products, changes in production capacity, and the like) shall be disregarded, provided that the changes are not of such a character as to constitute the acquisition of a new or different business. In particular, if a corporation engaged in the active conduct of one trade or business during that five-year period purchased, created, or otherwise acquired another trade or business in the same line of business, then the acquisition of that other business is ordinarily treated as an expansion of the original business, all of which is treated as having been actively conducted during that five-year period, unless that purchase, creation, or other acquisition effects a change of such a character as to constitute the acquisition of a new or different business. 


(4) *Special rules for acquisition of a trade or business (Prior to the Revenue Act of 1987 and Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988)*—(i) *In general.* Under section 355(b)(2)(C), a trade or business relied upon to meet the requirements of section 355(b) must not have been acquired by the distributing corporation, the controlled corporation, or another member of the affiliated group during the five-year period ending on the date of the distribution unless it was acquired in a transaction in which no gain or loss was recognized. Similarly, under section 355(b)(2)(D), the trade or business must not have been indirectly acquired by any of those corporations (or a predecessor in interest of any of those corporations) during that five-year period in a transaction in which gain or loss was recognized in whole or in part and which consisted of the acquisition of control of the corporation directly engaged in the trade or business, or the indirect acquisition of control of that corporation through the direct or indirect acquisition of control of one or more other corporations. A trade or business acquired, directly or indirectly, within the five-year period ending on the date of the distribution in a transaction in which the basis of the assets acquired was not determined in whole or in part by reference to the transferor's basis does not qualify under section 355(b)(2), even though no gain or loss was recognized by the transferor. 


(ii) *Example.* Paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:


(iii) *Gain or loss recognized in certain transactions.* The requirements of section 355(b)(2)(C) and (D) are intended to prevent the direct or indirect acquisition of a trade or business by a corporation in anticipation of a distribution by the corporation of that trade of business in a distribution to which section 355 would otherwise apply. A direct or indirect acquisition of a trade or business by one member of an affiliated group from another member of the group is not the type of transaction to which section 355(b)(2)(C) and (D) is intended to apply. Therefore, in applying section 355(b)(2)(C) or (D), such an acquisition, even though taxable, shall be disregarded. 


(iv) *Affiliated group.* For purposes of this subparagraph (4), the term *affiliated group* means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) (without regard to section 1504(b)), except that the term *stock* includes nonvoting stock described in section 1504(a)(4). 


(5) *Special rules for acquisition of a trade or business (After the Revenue Act of 1987 and Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988).* [Reserved]


(c) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate section 355(b)(2)(A) and (B) and paragraph (b)(1), (2), and (3) of this section. However, a transaction that satisfies these active business requirements will qualify under section 355 only if it satisfies the other requirements of section 355 (a) and (b).
