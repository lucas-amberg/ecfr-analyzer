# § 1.355-6   Recognition of gain on certain distributions of stock or securities in controlled corporation.

(a) *Conventions*—(1) *Examples.* For purposes of the examples in this section, unless otherwise stated, assume that P, S, T, X, Y, N, HC, D, D1, D2, D3, and C are corporations, A and B are individuals, shareholders are not treated as one person under section 355(d)(7), stock has been owned for more than five years and section 355(d)(6) and paragraph (e)(4) of this section do not apply, no election under section 338 (if available) is made, and all transactions described are respected under general tax principles, including the step transaction doctrine. No inference should be drawn from any example as to whether any requirements of section 355 other than those of section 355(d), as specified, are satisfied. 


(2) *Five-year period.* For purposes of this section, the term five-year period means the five-year period (determined after applying section 355(d)(6) and paragraph (e)(4) of this section) ending on the date of the distribution, but in no event beginning earlier than October 10, 1990. 


(3) *Distributing securities.* For purposes of determining if stock of any controlled corporation received in the distribution is disqualified stock described in section 355(d)(3)(B)(ii)(II) (relating to a distribution of controlled corporation stock on any securities in the distributing corporation acquired by purchase during the five-year period), references in this section to stock of a corporation that is or becomes a distributing corporation includes securities of the corporation. Similarly, a reference to stock in paragraph (c)(4) of this section (relating to a plan or arrangement) includes securities. 


(4) *Marketable securities.* Unless otherwise stated, any reference in this section to marketable stock includes marketable securities. 


(b) *General rules and purposes of section 355(d)*—(1) *Disqualified distributions in general.* In the case of a disqualified distribution, any stock or securities in the controlled corporation shall not be treated as qualified property for purposes of section 355(c)(2) or 361(c)(2). In general, a disqualified distribution is any distribution to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates thereto) applies if, immediately after the distribution— 


(i) Any person holds disqualified stock in the distributing corporation that constitutes a 50 percent or greater interest in such corporation; or


(ii) Any person holds disqualified stock in the controlled corporation (or, if stock of more than one controlled corporation is distributed, in any controlled corporation) that constitutes a 50 percent or greater interest in such corporation.


(2) *Disqualified stock*—(i) *In general. Disqualified stock* is— 


(A) Any stock in the distributing corporation acquired by purchase during the five-year period; and


(B) Any stock in any controlled corporation— 


(*1*) Acquired by purchase during the five-year period; or


(*2*) Received in the distribution to the extent attributable to distributions on any stock in the distributing corporation acquired by purchase during the five-year period. 


(ii) *Purchase.* For the definition of a purchase for purposes of section 355(d) and this section, see section 355(d)(5) and paragraph (d) of this section. 


(iii) *Exceptions*—(A) *Purchase eliminated.* Stock (or an interest in another entity) that is acquired by purchase (including stock (or another interest) that is treated as acquired by purchase under paragraph (e)(2), (3), or (4) of this section) ceases to be acquired by that purchase if (and when) the basis resulting from the purchase is eliminated. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii), basis resulting from the purchase is basis in the stock (or in an interest in another entity) that is directly purchased during the five-year period or that is treated as acquired by purchase during such period under paragraph (e)(2), (3), or (4) of this section. 


(B) *Deemed purchase eliminated.* Stock (or an interest in another entity) that is deemed purchased under section 355(d)(8) or paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall cease to be treated as purchased if (and when) the basis resulting from the purchase that effects the deemed purchase is eliminated. 


(C) *Elimination of basis*—(*1*) *General rule.* Basis in the stock of a corporation (or in an interest in another entity) is eliminated if (and when) it would no longer be taken into account by any person in determining gain or loss on a sale or exchange of any stock of such corporation (or an interest in the other entity). Basis is not eliminated, however, if it is allocated between stock of two corporations under § 1.358-2(a). 


(*2*) *Special rule for transferred and exchanged basis property.* Basis of stock (or an interest in another entity) resulting from a purchase (the first purchase) is eliminated if (and when) such stock (or other interest) is subsequently transferred to another person in an exchange or other transfer to which paragraph (e)(2) or (3) of this section applies (the second purchase). The elimination of basis in stock (or in another interest) resulting from the first purchase, however, does not eliminate the basis resulting from the second purchase in the stock (or other interest) that is treated as acquired by purchase by the acquirer in a transaction to which paragraph (e)(2) of this section applies or by the person making the exchange in a transaction to which paragraph (e)(3) of this section applies. 


(*3*) *Special rule for Split-offs and Split-ups.* Under section 355(d)(3)(B)(ii) and paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B)(*2*) of this section, disqualified stock includes controlled corporation stock received in exchange for distributing corporation stock acquired by purchase. Solely for purposes of determining whether controlled corporation stock received in a distribution in exchange for distributing corporation stock is disqualified stock described in that section and paragraph immediately after the distribution, paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(C)(*2*) of this section does not apply to the exchange to eliminate basis resulting from a purchase of that distributing corporation stock (notwithstanding that paragraph (e)(3) of this section applies to the exchange). 


(D) *Special rule if basis allocated between two corporations.* If the shareholder of a distributing corporation, pursuant to § 1.358-2, allocates basis resulting from a purchase between the stock of two or more corporations then, following such allocation, the determination of whether such basis has been eliminated shall be made separately with respect to the stock of each such corporation. 


(3) *Certain distributions not disqualified distributions because purposes of section 355(d) not violated*—(i) *In general.* Notwithstanding the provisions of section 355(d)(2) and this paragraph (b), a distribution is not a disqualified distribution if the distribution does not violate the purposes of section 355(d) as provided in this paragraph (b)(3). A distribution does not violate the purposes of section 355(d) if the effect of the distribution is neither— 


(A) To increase ownership (combined direct and indirect) in the distributing corporation or any controlled corporation by a disqualified person; nor 


(B) To provide a disqualified person with a purchased basis in the stock of any controlled corporation. 


(ii) *Disqualified person.* A disqualified person is any person (taking into account section 355(d)(7) and paragraph (c)(4) of this section) that, immediately after a distribution, holds (directly or indirectly under section 355(d)(8) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section) disqualified stock in the distributing corporation or controlled corporation that— 


(A) The person— 


(*1*) Acquired by purchase under section 355(d)(5) or (8) and paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section during the five-year period, or


(*2*) Received in the distribution to the extent attributable to distributions on any stock in the distributing corporation acquired by purchase under section 355(d)(5) or (8) and paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section by that person during the five-year period; and


(B) Constitutes a 50 percent or greater interest in such corporation (under section 355(d)(4) and paragraph (c) of this section). 


(iii) *Purchased basis.* In general, a purchased basis is basis in controlled corporation stock that is disqualified stock. However, basis in controlled corporation stock that is disqualified stock will not be treated as purchased basis if the controlled corporation stock and any distributing corporation stock with respect to which the controlled corporation stock is distributed are treated as acquired by purchase solely under the attribution rules of section 355(d)(8) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The prior sentence will not apply, however, if the distributing corporation stock is treated as acquired by purchase under the attribution rules as a result of the acquisition of an interest in a partnership (the purchased partnership), and following the distribution, the controlled corporation stock is directly held by the purchased partnership (or a chain of partnerships that includes the purchased partnership). 


(iv) *Increase in interest because of payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares.* Any increase in direct or indirect ownership in the distributing corporation or any controlled corporation by a disqualified person because of a payment of cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares will be disregarded for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section if the payment of the cash is solely to avoid the expense and inconvenience of issuing fractional share interests, and does not represent separately bargained for consideration. 


(v) *Other exceptions.* The Commissioner may provide by guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin that other distributions are not disqualified distributions because they do not violate the purposes of section 355(d). 


(vi) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate this paragraph (b)(3):


(4) *Anti-avoidance rule*—(i) *In general.* Notwithstanding any provision of section 355(d) or this section, the Commissioner may treat any distribution as a disqualified distribution under section 355(d)(2) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the distribution or another transaction or transactions are engaged in or structured with a principal purpose to avoid the purposes of section 355(d) or this section with respect to the distribution. Without limiting the preceding sentence, the Commissioner may determine that the existence of a related person, intermediary, pass-through entity, or similar person (an intermediary) should be disregarded, in whole or in part, if the intermediary is formed or availed of with a principal purpose to avoid the purposes of section 355(d) or this section. 


(ii) *Example.* The following example illustrates this paragraph (b)(4):


(c) *Whether a person holds a 50 percent or greater interest*—(1) *In general.* Under section 355(d)(4), 50 percent or greater interest means stock possessing at least 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 50 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock. 


(2) *Valuation.* For purposes of section 355(d)(4) and this section, all shares of stock within a single class are considered to have the same value. But see paragraph (c)(3)(vii)(A) of this section (determination of whether it is reasonably certain that an option will be exercised). 


(3) *Effect of options, warrants, convertible obligations, and other similar interests*—(i) *Application.* This paragraph (c)(3) provides rules to determine when an option is treated as exercised for purposes of section 355(d) (other than section 355(d)(6)). Except as provided in this paragraph (c)(3), an option is not treated as exercised for purposes of section 355(d). This paragraph (c)(3) does not affect the determination of whether an instrument is an option or stock under general principles of tax law (such as substance over form). 


(ii) *General rule.* In determining whether a person has acquired by purchase a 50 percent or greater interest under section 355(d)(4), an option to acquire stock (as described in paragraphs (c)(3)(v) and (vi) of this section) that has not been exercised when a distribution occurs is treated as exercised on the date it was issued or most recently transferred if— 


(A) Its exercise (whether by itself or in conjunction with the deemed exercise of one or more other options) would cause a person to become a disqualified person; and 


(B) Immediately after the distribution, it is reasonably certain (as described in paragraph (c)(3)(vii) of this section) that the option will be exercised. 


(iii) *Options deemed newly issued and substituted options*—(A) *Exchange, adjustment, or alteration of existing option.* For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), each of the following is treated as a new issuance or transfer of an existing option only if it materially increases the likelihood that an option will be exercised— 


(*1*) An exchange of an option for another option or options; 


(*2*) An adjustment to the terms of an option (including an adjustment pursuant to the terms of the option); 


(*3*) An adjustment to the terms of the underlying stock (including an adjustment pursuant to the terms of the stock); 


(*4*) A change to the capital structure of the issuing corporation; and 


(*5*) An alteration to the fair market value of issuing corporation stock through an asset transfer (other than regular, ordinary dividends) or through any other means. 


(B) *Certain compensatory options.* An option described in paragraph (c)(3)(vi)(B)(*2*) of this section is treated as issued on the date it becomes transferable. 


(C) *Substituted options.* If an option (existing option) is exchanged for another option or options (substituted option or options) and paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section does not apply to treat such exchange as a new issuance or transfer of the existing option, the substituted option or options will be treated as issued or most recently transferred on the date that the existing option was issued or most recently transferred. 


(iv) *Effect of treating an option as exercised*—(A) *In general.* For purposes of section 355(d), an option that is treated as exercised under this paragraph (c)(3) is treated as exercised both for purposes of determining the percentage of the voting power of stock owned by the holder and for purposes of determining the percentage of the value of stock owned by the holder. 


(B) *Stock purchase agreement or similar arrangement.* If a stock purchase agreement or similar arrangement is deemed exercised, the purchaser is treated as having purchased the stock under the terms of the agreement or arrangement as though all covenants had been satisfied and all contingencies met. The agreement or arrangement is deemed to have been exercised as of the date it is entered into or most recently assigned. 


(v) *Instruments treated as options.* For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), except to the extent provided in paragraph (c)(3)(vi) of this section, the following are treated as options: A call option, warrant, convertible obligation, the conversion feature of convertible stock, put option, redemption agreement (including a right to cause the redemption of stock), notional principal contract (as defined in § 1.446-3(c)) that provides for the payment of amounts in stock, stock purchase agreement or similar arrangement, or any other instrument that provides for the right to purchase, issue, redeem, or transfer stock (including an option on an option). 


(vi) *Instruments generally not treated as options.* For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), the following are not treated as options, unless issued, transferred, or listed with a principal purpose to avoid the application of section 355(d) or this section: 


(A) *Escrow, pledge, or other security agreements.* An option that is part of a security arrangement in a typical lending transaction (including a purchase money loan), if the arrangement is subject to customary commercial conditions. For this purpose, a security arrangement includes, for example, an agreement for holding stock in escrow or under a pledge or other security agreement, or an option to acquire stock contingent upon a default under a loan. 


(B) *Compensatory options*—(1) *General rule.* An option to acquire stock in a corporation with customary terms and conditions, provided to an employee, director, or independent contractor in connection with the performance of services for the corporation or a person related to it under section 355(d)(7)(A) (and that is not excessive by reference to the services performed) and that— 


(*i*) Is nontransferable within the meaning of § 1.83-3(d); and 


(*ii*) Does not have a readily ascertainable fair market value as defined in § 1.83-7(b). 


(*2*) *Exception.* Paragraph (c)(3)(vi)(B)(*1*) of this section ceases to apply to an option that becomes transferable. 


(C) *Certain stock conversion features.* The conversion feature of convertible stock, provided that— 


(*1*) The stock is not convertible for at least five years after issuance or transfer; and 


(*2*) The terms of the conversion feature do not require the tender of any consideration other than the stock being converted. 


(D) *Options exercisable only upon death, disability, mental incompetency, or separation from service.* Any option entered into between stockholders of a corporation (or a stockholder and the corporation) with respect to the stock of either stockholder that is exercisable only upon the death, disability, mental incompetency of the stockholder, or, in the case of stock acquired in connection with the performance of services for the corporation or a person related to it under section 355(d)(7)(A) (and that is not excessive by reference to the services performed), the stockholder's separation from service. 


(E) *Rights of first refusal.* A bona fide right of first refusal regarding the corporation's stock with customary terms, entered into between stockholders of a corporation (or between the corporation and a stockholder). 


(F) *Other enumerated instruments.* Any other instruments specified in regulations, a revenue ruling, or a revenue procedure. See § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter. 


(vii) *Reasonably certain that the option will be exercised*—(A) *In general.* The determination of whether, immediately after the distribution, an option is reasonably certain to be exercised is based on all the facts and circumstances. In applying the previous sentence, the fair market value of stock underlying an option is determined by taking into account control premiums and minority and blockage discounts. 


(B) *Stock purchase agreement or similar arrangement.* A stock purchase agreement or similar arrangement is treated as reasonably certain to be exercised if the parties' obligations to complete the transaction are subject only to reasonable closing conditions. 


(viii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate this paragraph (c)(3): 


(4) *Plan or arrangement*—(i) *In general.* Under section 355(d)(7)(B), if two or more persons act pursuant to a plan or arrangement with respect to acquisitions of stock in the distributing corporation or controlled corporation, those persons are treated as one person for purposes of section 355(d). 


(ii) *Understanding.* For purposes of section 355(d)(7)(B), two or more persons who are (or will after an acquisition become) shareholders (or are treated as shareholders under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section) act pursuant to a plan or arrangement with respect to an acquisition of stock only if they have a formal or informal understanding among themselves to make a coordinated acquisition of stock. A principal element in determining if such an understanding exists is whether the investment decision of each person is based on the investment decision of one or more other existing or prospective shareholders. However, the participation by creditors in formulating a plan for an insolvency workout or a reorganization in a title 11 or similar case (whether as members of a creditors' committee or otherwise) and the receipt of stock by creditors in satisfaction of indebtedness pursuant to the workout or reorganization do not cause the creditors to be considered as acting pursuant to a plan or arrangement. 


(iii) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section: 


(iv) *Exception*—(A) *Subsequent disposition.* If two or more persons do not act pursuant to a plan or arrangement within the meaning of this paragraph (c)(4) with respect to an acquisition of stock in a corporation (the first corporation), a subsequent acquisition in which such persons exchange their stock in the first corporation for stock in another corporation (the second corporation) in a transaction in which the basis of the second corporation's stock in the hands of such persons is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of their stock in the first corporation, will not result in such persons being treated as one person, even if the acquisition of the second corporation's stock is pursuant to a plan or arrangement. 


(B) *Example.* The following example illustrates this paragraph (c)(4)(iv): 


(d) *Purchase*—(1) *In general*—(i) *Definition of purchase under section 355(d)(5)(A).* Under section 355(d)(5)(A), except as otherwise provided in section 355(d)(5)(B) and (C), a *purchase* means any acquisition, but only if— 


(A) The basis of the property acquired in the hands of the acquirer is not determined— 


(*1*) In whole or in part by reference to the adjusted basis of such property in the hands of the person from whom acquired; or 


(*2*) Under section 1014(a) or 1022; and


(B) The property is not acquired in an exchange to which section 351, 354, 355, or 356 applies. 


(ii) *Section 355 distributions.* Paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) of this section includes all section 355 distributions, whether in exchange (in whole or in part) for stock or pro rata. 


(iii) *Example.* The following example illustrates this paragraph (d)(1):


(2) *Exceptions to definition of purchase under section 355(d)(5)(A).* The following acquisitions are not treated as purchases under section 355(d)(5)(A): 


(i) *Acquisition of stock in a transaction which includes other property or money*—(A) *Transferors and shareholders of transferor or distributing corporations*—(*1*) *In general.* An acquisition of stock permitted to be received by a transferor of property without the recognition of gain under section 351(a), or permitted to be received without the recognition of gain under section 354, 355, or 356 is not a purchase to the extent section 358(a)(1) applies to determine the recipient's basis in the stock received, whether or not the recipient recognizes gain under section 351(b) or 356. But see paragraph (e)(3) of this section (interest received in exchange for purchased interest in exchanged basis transaction treated as purchased). 


(*2*) *Exception.* To the extent there is received in the exchange or distribution, in addition to stock described in paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A)(*1*) of this section, stock that is other property under section 351(b) or 356(a)(1), the stock is treated as purchased on the date of the exchange or distribution for purposes of section 355(d). 


(B) *Transferee corporations*—(*1*) *In general.* An acquisition of stock by a corporation is not a purchase to the extent section 334(b) or 362(a) or (b) applies to determine the corporation's basis in the stock received. But see section 355(d)(5)(C) and paragraph (e)(2) of this section (purchased property transferred in transferred basis transaction is treated as purchased by transferee). 


(*2*) *Exception.* If a corporation acquires stock, the stock is treated as purchased on the date of the stock acquisition for purposes of section 355(d)— 


(*i*) If the liquidating corporation recognizes gain or loss with respect to the transferred stock as described in section 334(b)(1); or


(*ii*) To the extent the basis of the transferred stock is increased through the recognition of gain by the transferor under section 362(a) or (b). 


(C) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate this paragraph (d)(2)(i):


(ii) *Acquisition of stock in a distribution to which section 305(a) applies.* An acquisition of stock in a distribution qualifying under section 305(a) is not a purchase to the extent section 307(a) applies to determine the recipient's basis. However, to the extent the distribution is of rights to acquire stock, see paragraph (c)(3) of this section for rules regarding options, warrants, convertible obligations, and other similar interests. 


(iii) *Section 1036(a) exchange.* An exchange of stock qualifying under section 1036(a) is not a purchase by either party to the exchange to the extent the basis of the property acquired equals that of the property exchanged under section 1031(d). 


(iv) *Section 338 elections*—(A) *In general.* Stock acquired in a qualified stock purchase with respect to which a section 338 election (or a section 338(h)(10) election) is made is not treated as a purchase for purposes of section 355(d)(5)(A). However, any stock (or an interest in another entity) held by old target that is treated as purchased by new target is treated as acquired by purchase for purposes of section 355(d)(5)(A) unless a section 338 election or section 338(h)(10) election also is made for that stock. See § 1.338-2T(c) for the definitions of section 338 election, section 338(h)(10) election, old target, and new target. 


(B) *Example.* The following example illustrates this paragraph (d)(2)(iv):


(v) *Partnership distributions*—(A) *Section 732(b).* An acquisition of stock (or an interest in another entity) in a liquidation of a partner's interest in a partnership in which basis is determined pursuant to section 732(b) is a purchase at the time of the liquidation. 


(B) *Section 734(b).* If the adjusted basis of stock (or an interest in another entity) held by a partnership is increased under section 734(b), a proportionate amount of the stock (or other interest) will be treated as purchased at the time of the basis adjustment, determined by reference to the amount of the basis adjustment (but not in excess of the fair market value of the stock (or other interest) at the time of the adjustment) over the fair market value of the stock (or other interest) at the time of the adjustment. 


(3) *Certain section 351 exchanges treated as purchases*—(i) *In general*—(A) *Treatment of stock received by transferor.* Under section 355(d)(5)(B), a purchase includes any acquisition of property in an exchange to which section 351 applies to the extent the property is acquired in exchange for any cash or cash item, any marketable stock, or any debt of the transferor. The property treated as acquired by purchase is the property received by the transferor in the exchange. 


(B) *Multiple classes of stock.* If the transferor in a transaction described in section 355(d)(5)(B) receives stock or securities of more than one class, or receives both stock and securities, then the amount of stock or securities purchased is determined in a manner that corresponds to the allocation of basis to the stock or securities under section 358. See § 1.358-2(b). 


(ii) *Cash item, marketable stock.* For purposes of section 355(d)(5)(B) and this paragraph (d)(3), either or both of the terms cash item and marketable stock include personal property within the meaning of section 1092(d)(1) and § 1.1092(d)-1, without giving effect to section 1092(d)(3). 


(iii) *Exception for certain acquisitions*—(A) *In general.* Except to the extent provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section (interest received in exchange for purchased interest in exchanged basis transaction treated as purchased), an acquisition of stock in a corporation in a section 351 transaction by one or more persons in exchange for an amount of stock in another corporation (the transferred corporation) that meets the requirements of section 1504(a)(2) is not a purchase by the transferor or transferors, regardless of whether the stock of the transferred corporation is marketable stock under section 355(d)(5)(B)(ii) and paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. 


(B) *Example.* The following example illustrates this paragraph (d)(3)(iii):


(iv) *Exception for assets transferred as part of an active trade or business*—(A) *In general.* Except to the extent provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, an acquisition not described in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section of stock in exchange for any cash or cash item, any marketable stock, or any debt of the transferor in a section 351 transaction is not a purchase if— 


(*1*) The transferor is engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business under paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(B) of this section and the transferred items (including debt incurred in the ordinary course of the trade or business) are used in the trade or business; 


(*2*) The transferred items do not exceed the reasonable needs of the trade or business under paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(C) of this section; 


(*3*) The transferor transfers the items as part of the trade or business; and 


(*4*) The transferee continues the active conduct of the trade or business. 


(B) *Active conduct of a trade or business.* For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(iv), whether, with respect to the trade or business at issue, the transferor and transferee are engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business is determined under § 1.355-3(b)(2) and (3), except that— 


(*1*) Conduct is tested before the transfer (with respect to the transferor) and after the transfer (with respect to the transferee) rather than immediately after a distribution; and 


(*2*) The trade or business need not have been conducted for five years before its transfer, but it must have been conducted for a sufficient period of time to establish that it is a viable and ongoing trade or business.


(C) *Reasonable needs of the trade or business.* For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(iv), the reasonable needs of the trade or business include only the amount of cash or cash items, marketable stock, or debt of the transferor that a prudent business person apprised of all relevant facts would consider necessary for the present and reasonably anticipated future needs of the business. Transferred items may be considered necessary for reasonably anticipated future needs only if the transferor and transferee have specific, definite, and feasible plans for their use. Those plans must require that items intended for anticipated future needs rather than present needs be used as expeditiously as possible consistent with the business purpose for retention of the items. Future needs are not reasonably anticipated if they are uncertain or vague or where the execution of the plan for their use is substantially postponed. The reasonable needs of a trade or business are generally its needs at the time of the transfer of the business including the items. However, for purposes of applying section 355(d) to a distribution, events and conditions after the transfer and through the date immediately after the distribution (including whether plans for the use of transferred items have been consummated or substantially postponed) may be considered to determine whether at the time of the transfer the items were necessary for the present and reasonably anticipated future needs of the business. 


(D) *Consideration of all facts and circumstances.* All facts and circumstances are considered in determining whether this paragraph (d)(3)(iv) applies. 


(E) *Successive transfers.* A transfer of assets does not fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(A)(*4*) of this section solely because the transferee transfers the assets directly (or indirectly through other members) to another member of the transferee's affiliated group, as defined in § 1.355-3(b)(4)(iv) (the final transferee), if the requirements of paragraphs (d)(3)(iv)(A)(*1*), (*2*), (*3*) and (*4*) of this section would be met if the transferor had transferred the assets directly to the final transferee. 


(v) *Exception for transfer between members of the same affiliated group*—(A) *In general.* Except to the extent provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, an acquisition of stock (whether actual or constructive) not described in paragraphs (d)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section in exchange for any cash or cash item, marketable stock, or debt of the transferor in a section 351 transaction is not a purchase if— 


(*1*) The transferor corporation or corporations and the transferee corporation (whether formed in the transaction or already existing) are members of the same affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) before the section 351 transaction (if the transferee corporation is in existence before the transaction); 


(*2*) The cash or cash item, marketable stock or debt of the transferor are not included in assets that are acquired (or treated as acquired) by the transferor (or another member of the transferor's affiliated group) from a nonmember in a related transaction in which section 362(a) or (b) applies to determine the basis in the acquired assets; and 


(*3*) The transferor corporation or corporations, the transferee corporation, and any distributed controlled corporation of the transferee corporation do not cease to be members of such affiliated group in any transaction pursuant to a plan that includes the section 351 transaction (including any distribution of a controlled corporation by the transferee corporation). But see paragraph (b)(4) of this section where the transfer is made for a principal purpose to avoid the purposes of section 355(d). 


(B) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate this paragraph (d)(3)(v):


(4) *Triangular asset reorganizations*—(i) *Definition. A triangular asset reorganization* is a reorganization that qualifies under— 


(A) Section 368(a)(1)(A) or (G) by reason of section 368(a)(2)(D); 


(B) Section 368(a)(1)(A) by reason of section 368(a)(2)(E) (regardless of whether section 368(a)(3)(E) applies), unless the transaction also qualifies as either a section 351 transfer or a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(B); or


(C) Section 368(a)(1)(C), and stock of the controlling corporation rather than the acquiring corporation is exchanged for the acquired corporation's properties. 


(ii) *Treatment.* Notwithstanding section 355(d)(5)(A), for purposes of section 355(d), the controlling corporation in a triangular asset reorganization is treated as having— 


(A) Acquired the assets of the acquired corporation (and as having assumed any liabilities assumed by the controlling corporation's subsidiary corporation or to which the acquired corporation's assets were subject (the acquired liabilities)) in a transaction in which the controlling corporation's basis in the acquired corporation's assets was determined under section 362(b); and 


(B) Transferred the acquired assets and acquired liabilities to its subsidiary corporation in a section 351 transfer. 


(iii) *Example.* The following example illustrates this paragraph (d)(4):


(5) *Reverse triangular reorganizations other than triangular asset reorganizations*—(i) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section, if a transaction qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(A) by reason of section 368(a)(2)(E) and also as either a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(B) or a section 351 transfer, then either section 355(d)(5)(B) (and paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section) or 355(d)(5)(C) (and paragraph (e)(2) of this section) applies. Regardless of which method the controlling corporation employs to determine its basis in the surviving corporation stock under § 1.358-6(c)(2)(ii) or § 1.1502-30(b), the total amount of surviving corporation stock treated as purchased by the controlling corporation will equal the higher of— 


(A) The amount of surviving corporation stock that would be treated as purchased (on the date of the deemed section 351 transfer) by the controlling corporation if the controlling corporation acquired the surviving corporation's assets and assumed its liabilities in a transaction in which the controlling corporation's basis in the surviving corporation assets was determined under section 362(b), and then transferred the acquired assets and liabilities to the surviving corporation in a section 351 transfer (see §§ 1.358-6(c)(1) and (2)(ii)(A), and 1.1502-30(b)); or 


(B) The amount of surviving corporation stock that would be treated as purchased (on the date the surviving corporation shareholders purchased their surviving corporation stock) if the controlling corporation acquired the stock of the surviving corporation in a transaction in which the basis in the surviving corporation's stock was determined under section 362(b) (see §§ 1.358-6(c)(2)(ii)(B) and 1.1502-30(b)). 


(ii) *Letter ruling and closing agreement.* If a controlling corporation obtains a letter ruling and enters into a closing agreement under section 7121 in which it agrees to determine its basis in surviving corporation stock under § 1.358-6(c)(2)(ii)(A), or under § 1.1502-30(b) by applying § 1.358-6(c)(2)(ii)(A) (deemed asset acquisition and transfer by controlling corporation), then section 355(d)(5)(B) and paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section apply, and section 355(d)(5)(C) and paragraph (e)(2) of this section do not apply. If a controlling corporation obtains a letter ruling and enters into a closing agreement under section 7121 under which it agrees to determine its basis in surviving corporation stock under § 1.358-6(c)(2)(ii)(B), or under § 1.1502-30(b) by applying § 1.358-6(c)(2)(ii)(B) (deemed stock acquisition), then section 355(d)(5)(C) and paragraph (e)(2) of this section apply, and section 355(d)(5)(B) and paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section do not apply. 


(iii) *Example.* The following example illustrates this paragraph (d)(5):


(6) *Treatment of group structure changes*—(i) *In general.* Notwithstanding section 355(d)(5)(A), for purposes of section 355(d), if a corporation succeeds another corporation as the common parent of a consolidated group in a group structure change to which § 1.1502-31 applies, the new common parent is treated as having acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities of the former common parent in a transaction in which the new common parent's basis in the former common parent's assets was determined under section 362(b), and then transferred the acquired assets and liabilities to the former common parent (or, if the former common parent does not survive, to the new common parent's subsidiary) in a section 351 transfer, with the new common parent and former common parent being treated as not in the same affiliated group at the time of the transfer for purposes of applying paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section (notwithstanding § 1.1502-31(c)(2)). 


(ii) *Adjustments to basis of higher-tier members.* A higher-tier member that indirectly owns all or part of the former common parent's stock after a group structure change is treated as having purchased the stock of an immediate subsidiary to the extent that the higher-tier member's basis in the subsidiary is increased under § 1.1502-31(d)(4). 


(iii) *Example.* The following example illustrates this paragraph (d)(6): 


(7) *Special rules for triangular asset reorganizations, other reverse triangular reorganizations, and group structure changes.* The amount of acquiring subsidiary, surviving corporation, or former common parent stock that is treated as purchased under paragraph (c)(4), (5)(i)(A), or (6) of this section (by operation of section 355(d)(5)(B) and paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section) is adjusted to reflect any basis adjustment under— 


(i) Section 1.358-6(c)(2)(i)(B) and (C) (reduction of basis adjustment in reverse triangular reorganization where controlling corporation acquires less than all of the surviving corporation stock), § 1.1502-30(b) (applying § 1.358-6(c)(2)(i)(B) and (C) to a consolidated group), and § 1.1502-31(d)(2)(ii) (reduction of basis adjustment in group structure change where new common parent acquires less than all of the former common parent stock); or 


(ii) Section 1.358-6(d) (reduction of basis adjustment in any triangular reorganization to the extent controlling corporation does not provide consideration), § 1.1502-30(b) (applying § 1.358-6(d) (except § 1.358-6(d)(2)) to a consolidated group), and § 1.1502-31(d)(1) (reduction of basis adjustment in group structure change to the extent new common parent does not provide consideration). 


(e) *Deemed purchase and timing rules*—(1) *Attribution and aggregation*—(i) *In general.* Under section 355(d)(8)(B), if any person acquires by purchase an interest in any entity, and the person is treated under section 355(d)(8)(A) as holding any stock by reason of holding the interest, the stock shall be treated as acquired by purchase on the later of the date of the purchase of the interest in the entity or the date the stock is acquired by purchase by such entity. 


(ii) *Purchase of additional interest.* If a person and an entity are treated as a single person under section 355(d)(7), and the person later purchases an additional interest in the entity, the person is treated as purchasing on the date of the later purchase the amount of stock attributed from the entity to the person under section 355(d)(8)(A) as a result of the additional interest. 


(iii) *Purchase between persons treated as one person.* If two persons are treated as one person under section 355(d)(7), and one later purchases stock from the other, the date of the later purchase is used for purposes of determining when the five-year period commences. 


(iv) *Purchase by a person already treated as holding stock under section 355(d)(8)(A).* If a person who is already treated as holding stock under section 355(d)(8)(A) later directly purchases such stock, the date of the later direct purchase is used for purposes of determining when the five-year period commences. 


(v) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate this paragraph (e)(1):


(2) *Transferred basis rule.* If any person acquires property from another person who acquired the property by purchase (determined with regard to section 355(d)(5) and paragraphs (d) and (e)(2), (3) and (4) of this section, but without regard to section 355(d)(8) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section), and the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the acquirer is determined in whole or in part by reference to the adjusted basis of the property in the hands of the other person, the acquirer is treated as having acquired the property by purchase on the date it was so acquired by the other person. The rule in this paragraph (e)(2) applies, for example, where stock of a corporation acquired by purchase is subsequently acquired in a section 351 transfer or a reorganization qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(B), but does not apply if the stock of a former common parent is acquired in a group structure change to which § 1.1502-31 applies. But see paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B)(*2*) of this section for situations where the stock is treated as purchased on the date of a transfer. 


(3) *Exchanged basis rule*—(i) *In general.* If any person acquires an interest in an entity (the first interest) by purchase (determined with regard to section 355(d)(5) and paragraphs (d) and (e)(2), (3) and (4) of this section, but without regard to section 355(d)(8) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section), and the first interest is exchanged for an interest in the same or another entity (the second interest) where the adjusted basis of the second interest is determined in whole or in part by reference to the adjusted basis of the first interest, then the second interest is treated as having been purchased on the date the first interest was purchased. The rule in this paragraph (e)(3) applies only to exchanges that are not otherwise treated as purchases under section 355(d)(5) and paragraph (d) of this section. The rule in this paragraph (e)(3) applies, for example, where stock of a corporation acquired by purchase is subsequently exchanged for other stock in a section 351, 354, or 1036(a) exchange. But see paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A)(*2*) of this section for situations where the stock is treated as purchased on the date of an exchange or distribution. 


(ii) *Example.* The following example illustrates this paragraph (e)(3):


(4) *Certain section 355 or section 305 distributions*—(i) *Section 355.* If a distributing corporation distributes any stock of a controlled corporation with respect to recently purchased distributing stock in a distribution that qualifies under section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355), such controlled corporation stock is deemed to be acquired by purchase by the distributee on the date the distributee acquired the recently purchased distributing stock. Recently purchased distributing stock is stock in the distributing corporation acquired by purchase (determined with regard to section 355(d)(5) and paragraphs (d) and (e)(2), (3), and (4) of this section, but without regard to section 355(d)(8) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section) by the distributee during the five-year period with respect to that distribution. 


(ii) *Section 305.* If a corporation distributes its stock in a distribution that qualifies under section 305(a), the stock received in the distribution (to the extent section 307(a) applies to determine the recipient's basis) is deemed to be acquired by purchase by the recipient on the date (if any) that the recipient acquired by purchase (determined with regard to section 355(d)(5) and paragraphs (d) and (e)(2), (3), and (4) of this section), the stock with respect to which the distribution is made. 


(5) *Substantial diminution of risk*—(i) *In general.* If section 355(d)(6) applies to any stock for any period, the running of any five-year period set forth in section 355(d)(3) is suspended during such period. 


(ii) *Property to which suspension applies.* Section 355(d)(6) applies to any stock for any period during which the holder's risk of loss with respect to such stock, or with respect to any portion of the activities of the corporation, is (directly or indirectly) substantially diminished by an option, a short sale, any special class of stock, or any other device or transaction. 


(iii) *Risk of loss substantially diminished.* Whether a holder's risk of loss is substantially diminished under section 355(d)(6) and paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section will be determined based on all facts and circumstances relating to the stock, the corporate activities, and arrangements for holding the stock. 


(iv) *Special class of stock.* For purposes of section 355(d)(6) and paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section, the term special class of stock includes a class of stock that grants particular rights to, or bears particular risks for, the holder or the issuer with respect to the earnings, assets, or attributes of less than all the assets or activities of a corporation or any of its subsidiaries. The term includes, for example, tracking stock and stock (or any related instruments or arrangements) the terms of which provide for the distribution (whether or not at the option of any party or in the event of any contingency) of any controlled corporation or other specified assets to the holder or to one or more persons other than the holder. 


(f) *Duty to determine stockholders*—(1) *In general.* In determining whether section 355(d) applies to a distribution of controlled corporation stock, a distributing corporation must determine whether a disqualified person holds its stock or the stock of any distributed controlled corporation. This paragraph (f) provides rules regarding this determination and the extent to which a distributing corporation must investigate whether a disqualified person holds stock. 


(2) *Deemed knowledge of contents of securities filings.* A distributing corporation is deemed to have knowledge of the existence and contents of all schedules, forms, and other documents filed with or under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation any Schedule 13D or 13G (or any similar schedules) and amendments, with respect to any relevant corporation. 


(3) *Presumption as to securities filings.* Absent actual knowledge to the contrary, in determining whether section 355(d) applies to a distribution, a distributing corporation may presume, with respect to stock that is reporting stock (while such stock is reporting stock), that every shareholder or other person required to file a schedule, form, or other document with or under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission as of a given date has filed the schedule, form, or other document as of that date and that the contents of filed schedules, forms, or other documents are accurate and complete. Reporting stock is stock that is described in Rule 13d-1(i) of Regulation 13D (17 CFR 240.13d-1(i)) (or any rule or regulation to generally the same effect) promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a *et seq.*). 


(4) *Presumption as to less-than-five-percent shareholders.* Absent actual knowledge (or deemed knowledge under paragraph (f)(2) of this section) immediately after the distribution to the contrary with regard to a particular shareholder, a distributing corporation may presume that no less-than-five-percent shareholder of a corporation acquired stock or securities by purchase under section 355(d)(5) or (8) and paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section during the five-year period. For purposes of this paragraph (f), a less-than-five-percent shareholder is a person that, at no time during the five-year period, holds directly (or by application of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, but not by application of section 355(d)(7) or (8)) stock possessing five percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or the total value of shares of all classes of stock of a corporation. However, this presumption does not apply to any less-than-five-percent shareholder that, at any time during the five-year period— 


(i) Is related under section 355(d)(7)(A) to a shareholder in the corporation that is, at any time during the five-year period, not a less-than-five-percent shareholder; 


(ii) Acted pursuant to a plan or arrangement, with respect to acquisitions of the corporation's stock or securities under section 355(d)(7)(B) and paragraph (c)(4) of this section, with a shareholder in the corporation that is, at any time during the five-year period, not a less-than-five-percent shareholder; or 


(iii) Holds stock or securities that is attributed under section 355(d)(8)(A) to a shareholder in the corporation that is, at any time during the five-year period, not a less-than-five-percent shareholder. 


(5) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate this paragraph (f):


(g) *Effective/applicability dates.* This section applies to distributions occurring after December 20, 2000, except that they do not apply to any distributions occurring pursuant to a written agreement that is (subject to customary conditions) binding on December 20, 2000, and at all later times. The provisions of paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A)(*2*) of this section relating to section 1022 are effective on and after January 19, 2017.
