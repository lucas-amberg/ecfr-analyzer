# § 1.356-7   Rules for treatment of nonqualified preferred stock and other preferred stock received in certain transactions.

(a) *Stock issued prior to effective date.* Stock described in section 351(g)(2) is nonqualified preferred stock (NQPS) regardless of the date on which the stock is issued. However, sections 351(g), 354(a)(2)(C), 355(a)(3)(D), 356(e), and 1036(b) do not apply to any transaction occurring prior to June 9, 1997, or to any transaction occurring after June 8, 1997, that is described in section 1014(f)(2) of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, Public Law 105-34 (111 Stat. 788, 921). For purposes of this section, preferred stock that is not NQPS is referred to as Qualified Preferred Stock (QPS). 


(b) *Receipt of preferred stock in exchange for (or distribution on) substantially identical preferred stock*—(1) *General rule.* For purposes of sections 354(a)(2)(C)(i), 355(a)(3)(D), and 356(e)(2), preferred stock is QPS, even though it is described in section 351(g)(2), if it is received in exchange for (or in a distribution with respect to) preferred stock (the original preferred stock) that is QPS, provided—


(i) The original preferred stock is QPS solely because, on its issue date, either a right or obligation described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of section 351(g)(2)(A) was not exercisable until after a 20-year period beginning on the issue date, or the right or obligation was exercisable within the 20-year period beginning on the issue date but was subject to a contingency which made remote the likelihood of the redemption or purchase, or the issuer's (or a related party's) right to redeem or purchase the stock was not more likely than not to be exercised within a 20-year period beginning on the issue date, or because of any combination of these reasons; and


(ii) The stock received is substantially identical to the original preferred stock. 


(2) *Substantially identical.* The stock received is substantially identical to the original preferred stock if— 


(i) The stock received does not contain any term or terms that, in relation to any term or terms of the original preferred stock, either decrease the period in which a right or obligation described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of section 351(g)(2)(A) can be exercised, or increase the likelihood that such a right or obligation will be exercised, or accelerate the timing of the returns from the stock instrument, including the timing of actual or deemed dividends or other distributions received on the stock; and


(ii) As a result of the exchange or distribution, exercise of the right or obligation does not become more likely than not to occur within a 20-year period beginning on the issue date of the original preferred stock. 


(3) *Treatment of stock received.* The stock received will continue to be treated as QPS in subsequent transactions involving such stock, and the principles of this paragraph (b) apply to such transactions as though the stock received is the original preferred stock issued on the same date as the original preferred stock. 


(c) *Stock transferred for services.* For purposes of sections 351(g)(1), 354(a)(2)(C)(i), 355(a)(3)(D), and 356(e)(2), preferred stock containing a right or obligation described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of section 351(g)(2)(A) that is exercisable only upon the holder's separation from service from the issuer or a related person (as described in section 351(g)(3)(B)) will be treated as transferred in connection with the performance of services (and representing reasonable compensation) within the meaning of section 351(g)(2)(C)(i)(II), if such preferred stock is received in exchange for (or in a distribution with respect to) existing stock containing a similar right or obligation (exercisable only upon separation from service) and the existing stock was transferred in connection with the performance of services for the issuer or a related person (and represented reasonable compensation when transferred). In applying the rules relating to NQPS, the preferred stock received will continue to be treated as transferred in connection with the performance of services (and representing reasonable compensation) in subsequent transactions involving such stock, and the principles of this paragraph (c) apply to such transactions. 


(d) *Rights to acquire stock.* For purposes of § 1.356-6, the principles of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section apply. 


(e) *Examples.* In the examples in this paragraph (e), T and P are corporations, A is a shareholder of T, and A surrenders and receives (in addition to the stock exchanged in the examples) common stock in the reorganizations described. The following examples illustrate paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section:


(f) *Effective dates.* This section applies to transactions occurring on or after October 2, 2000.
