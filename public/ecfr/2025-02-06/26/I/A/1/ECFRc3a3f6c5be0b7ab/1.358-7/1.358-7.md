# § 1.358-7   Transfers by partners and partnerships to corporations.

(a) *Transfers by partners of partnership interests.* For purposes of section 358(h), a transfer of a partnership interest to a corporation is treated as a transfer of the partner's share of each of the partnership's assets and an assumption by the corporation of the partner's share of partnership liabilities (including section 358(h) liabilities, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section). See paragraph (e) *Example 2* of this section.


(b) *Transfers by partnerships.* If a corporation assumes a section 358(h) liability from a partnership in an exchange to which section 358(a) applies, then, for purposes of applying section 705 (determination of basis of partner's interest) and § 1.704-1(b), any reduction, under section 358(h)(1), in the partnership's basis in corporate stock received in the transaction is treated as an expenditure of the partnership described in section 705(a)(2)(B). See paragraph (e) *Example 1* of this section. This expenditure must be allocated among the partners in accordance with section 704(b) and (c) and § 1.752-7(c). If a partner's share of the reduction, under section 358(h)(1), in the partnership's basis in corporate stock exceeds the partner's basis in the partnership interest, then the partner recognizes gain equal to the excess, which is treated as gain from the sale or exchange of a partnership interest. This paragraph does not apply to the extent that § 1.752-7(j)(4) applies to the assumption of the § 1.752-7 liability by the corporation.


(c) *Assumption of section 358(h) liability by partnership followed by transfer of partnership interest or partnership property to a corporation—trade or business exception.* Where a partnership assumes a section 358(h) liability from a partner and, subsequently, the partner transfers all or part of the partner's partnership interest to a corporation in an exchange to which section 358(a) applies, then, for purposes of applying section 358(h)(2), the section 358(h) liability is treated as associated only with the contribution made to the partnership by that partner. See paragraph (e) *Example 2* of this section. Similar rules apply where a partnership assumes a section 358(h) liability of a partner and a corporation subsequently assumes that section 358(h) liability from the partnership in an exchange to which section 358(a) applies.


(d) *Section 358(h) liabilities defined.* For purposes of this section, section 358(h) liabilities are liabilities described in section 358(h)(3).


(e) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section. Assume, for purposes of these examples, that the obligation assumed by the corporation does not reduce the shareholder's basis in the corporate stock under section 358(d). The examples are as follows:


(f) *Effective date.* This section applies to assumptions of liabilities by a corporation occurring on or after June 24, 2003.
