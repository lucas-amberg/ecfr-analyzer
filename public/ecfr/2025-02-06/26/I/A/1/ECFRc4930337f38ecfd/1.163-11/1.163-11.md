# § 1.163-11   Allocation of certain prepaid qualified mortgage insurance premiums.

(a) *Allocation*—(1) *In general.* As provided in section 163(h)(3)(E), premiums paid or accrued for qualified mortgage insurance during the taxable year in connection with acquisition indebtedness with respect to a qualified residence (as defined in section 163(h)(4)(A)) of the taxpayer shall be treated as qualified residence interest (as defined in section 163(h)(3)(A)). If an individual taxpayer pays such a premium that is properly allocable to a mortgage the payment of which extends to periods beyond the close of the taxable year in which the premium is paid, the taxpayer must allocate the premium to determine the amount treated as qualified residence interest for each taxable year. The premium must be allocated ratably over the shorter of—


(i) The stated term of the mortgage; or


(ii) A period of 84 months, beginning with the month in which the insurance was obtained.


(2) *Limitation.* If a mortgage is satisfied before the end of its stated term, no deduction as qualified residence interest shall be allowed for any amount of the premium that is allocable to periods after the mortgage is satisfied.


(b) *Scope.* The allocation requirement in paragraph (a) of this section applies only to mortgage insurance provided by the Federal Housing Administration or private mortgage insurance (as defined by section 2 of the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 (12 U.S.C. 4901) as in effect on December 20, 2006). It does not apply to mortgage insurance provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Rural Housing Service. Paragraph (a) of this section applies whether the qualified mortgage insurance premiums are paid in cash or are financed, without regard to source.


(c) *Limitation on the treatment of mortgage insurance premiums as interest.* This section applies to prepaid qualified mortgage insurance premiums described in paragraph (a) of this section that are paid or accrued on or after January 1, 2011, and during periods to which section 163(h)(3)(E) is applicable. This section does not apply to any amount of prepaid qualified mortgage insurance premiums that are allocable to any periods to which section 163(h)(3)(E) is not applicable.


(d) *Effective/applicability date.* This section is applicable on and after January 1, 2011. For regulations applicable before January 1, 2011, see § 1.163-11T in effect prior to January 1, 2011 (§ 1.163-11T as contained in 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 2011).
