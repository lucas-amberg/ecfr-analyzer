# § 1.165-12   Denial of deduction for losses on registration-required obligations not in registered form.

(a) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, nothing in section 165(a) and the regulations thereunder, or in any other provision of law, shall be construed to provide a deduction for any loss sustained on any registration-required obligation held after December 31, 1982, unless the obligation is in registered form or the issuance of the obligation was subject to tax under section 4701. The term “registration-required obligation” has the meaning given to that term in section 163(f)(2), except that clause (iv) of subparagraph (A) thereof shall not apply. Therefore, although an obligation that is not in registered form is described in § 1.163-5(c)(1), the holder of such an obligation shall not be allowed a deduction for any loss sustained on such obligation unless paragraph (c) of this section applies. The term “holder” means the person that would be denied a loss deduction under section 165(j)(1) or denied capital gain treatment under section 1287(a). For purposes of this section, the term *United States* means the United States and its possessions within the meaning of § 1.163-5(c)(2)(iv).


(b) *Registered form*—(1) *Obligations issued after September 21, 1984.* With respect to any obligation originally issued after September 21, 1984, the term “registered form” has the meaning given that term in section 103(j)(3) and the regulations thereunder. Therefore, an obligation that would otherwise be in registered form is not considered to be in registered form if it can be transferred at that time or at any time until its maturity by any means not described in § 5f.103-1(c). An obligation that, as of a particular time, is not considered to be in registered form because it can be transferred by any means not described in § 5f.103-1(c) is considered to be in registered form at all times during the period beginning with a later time and ending with the maturity of the obligation in which the obligation can be transferred only by a means described in § 5f.103-1(c).


(2) *Obligations issued after December 31, 1982 and on or before September 21, 1984.* With respect to any obligation originally issued after December 31, 1982 and on or before September 21, 1984 or an obligation originally issued after September 21, 1984 pursuant to the exercise of a warrant or the conversion of a convertible obligation, which warrant or obligation (including conversion privilege) was issued after December 31, 1982 and on or before September 21, 1984, that obligation will be considered in registered form if it satisfied § 5f.163-1 or the proposed regulations provided in § 1.163-5(c) and published in the _Federal Register_ on September 2, 1983 (48 FR 39953).


(c) *Registration-required obligations not in registered form which are not subject to section 165(j)(1).* Notwithstanding the fact that an obligation is a registration-required obligation that is not in registered form, the holder will not be subject to section 165(j)(1) if the holder meets the conditions of any one of the following subparagraphs (1), (2), (3), or (4) of this paragraph (c).


(1) *Persons permitted to hold in connection with the conduct of a trade or business.* (i) The holder is an underwriter, broker, dealer, bank, or other financial institution (defined in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)) that holds such obligation in connection with its trade or business conducted outside the United States; or the holder is a broker-dealer (registered under Federal or State law or exempted from registration by the provisions of such law because it is a bank) that holds such obligation for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business.


(ii) The holder must offer to sell, sell and deliver the obligation in bearer form only outside of the United States except that a holder that is a registered broker-dealer as described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section may offer to sell and sell the obligation in bearer form inside the United States to a financial institution as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section for its own account or for the account of another financial institution or of an exempt organization as defined in section 501(c)(3).


(iii) The holder may deliver an obligation in bearer form that is offered or sold inside the United States only if the holder delivers it to a financial institution that is purchasing for its own account, or for the account of another financial institution or of an exempt organization, and the financial institution or organization that purchases the obligation for its own account or for whose account the obligation is purchased represents that it will comply with the requirements of section 165(j)(3) (A), (B), or (C). Absent actual knowledge that the representation is false, the holder may rely on a written statement provided by the financial institution or exempt organization, including a statement that is delivered in electronic form. The holder may deliver a registration-required obligation in bearer form that is offered and sold outside the United States to a person other than a financial institution only if the holder has evidence in its records that such person is not a U.S. citizen or resident and does not have actual knowledge that such evidence is false. Such evidence may include a written statement by that person, including a statement that is delivered electronically. For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term *deliver* includes a transfer of an obligation evidenced by a book entry including a book entry notation by a clearing organization evidencing transfer of the obligation from one member of the organization to another member. For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term *deliver* does not include a transfer of an obligation to the issuer or its agent for cancellation or extinguishment. The record-retention provisions in § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(iii) shall apply to any statement that a holder receives pursuant to this paragraph (c)(1)(iii).


(iv) For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, the term “financial institution” means a person which itself is, or more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of whose stock entitled to vote is owned by a person which is—


(A) Engaged in the conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business within the meaning of section 954(c)(3)(B) as in effect before the Tax Reform Act of 1986, and the regulations thereunder;


(B) Engaged in business as a broker or dealer in securities;


(C) An insurance company;


(D) A person that provides pensions or other similar benefits to retired employees;


(E) Primarily engaged in the business of rendering investment advice;


(F) A regulated investment company or other mutual fund; or


(G) A finance corporation a substantial part of the business of which consists of making loans (including the acquisition of obligations under a lease which is entered into primarily as a financing transaction), acquiring accounts receivable, notes or installment obligations arising out of the sale of tangible personal property or the performing of services, or servicing debt obligations.


(2) *Persons permitted to hold obligations for their own investment account.* The holder is a financial institution holding the obligation for its own investment account that satisfies the conditions set forth in subdivisions (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of his paragraph (c) (2).


(i) The holder reports on its Federal income tax return for the taxable year any interest payments received (including original issue discount includable in gross income for such taxable year) with respect to such obligation and gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of such obligation;


(ii) The holder indicates on its Federal income tax return that income, gain or loss described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) is attributable to registration-required obligations held in bearer form for its own account;


(iii) The holder of a bearer obligation that resells the obligation inside the United States resells the obligation only to another financial institution for its own account or for the account of another financial institution or exempt organization; and


(iv) The holder delivers such obligation in bearer form to any other person in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section.


(3) *Persons permitted to hold through financial institutions.* The holder is any person that purchases and holds a registration-required obligation in bearer form through a financial institution with which the holder maintains a customer, custodial or nominee relationship and such institution agrees to satisfy, and does in fact satisfy, the conditions set forth in subdivisions (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of this paragraph (c)(3).


(i) The financial institution makes a return of information to the Internal Revenue Service with respect to any interest payments received. The financial institution must report original issue discount includable in the holder's gross income for the taxable year on any obligation so held, but only if the obligation appears in an Internal Revenue Service publication of obligations issued at an original issue discount and only in an amount determined in accordance with information contained in that publication. An information return for any interest payment shall be made on a Form 1099 for the calendar year. It shall indicate the aggregate amount of the payment received, the name, address and taxpayer identification number of the holder, and such other information as is required by the form. No return of information is required under this subdivision if the financial institution reports payments under section 6041 or 6049.


(ii) The financial institution makes a return of information on Form 1099B with respect to any disposition by the holder of such obligation. The return shall show the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the holder of the obligation, Committee on Uniform Security Information Procedures (CUSIP), gross proceeds, sale date, and such other information as may be required by the form. No return of information is required under this subdivision if such financial institution reports with respect to the disposition under section 6045.


(iii) In the case of a bearer obligation offered for resale or resold in the United States, the financial institution may resell the obligation only to another financial institution for its own account or for the account of an exempt organization.


(iv) The financial institution covenants with the holder that the financial institution will deliver the obligation in bearer form in accordance with the requirements set forth in paragraph (c)(1) (ii) and (iii).


(v) The financial institution delivers the obligation in bearer form in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) (ii) and (iv) as if the financial institution delivering the obligation were the holder referred to in such paragraph.


(4) *Conversion of obligations into registered form.* The holder is not a person described in paragraph (c) (1), (2), or (3) of this section, and within thirty days of the date when the seller or other transferor is reasonably able to make the bearer obligation available to the holder, the holder surrenders the obligation to a transfer agent or the issuer for conversion of the obligation into registered form. If such obligation is not registered within such 30 day period, the holder shall be subject to sections 165(j) and 1287(a).


(d) *Effective date.* These regulations apply generally to obligations issued after January 20, 1987. However, a taxpayer may choose to apply the rules of § 1.165-12 with respect to an obligation issued after December 31, 1982 and on or before January 20, 1987, which obligation is held after January 20, 1987.
