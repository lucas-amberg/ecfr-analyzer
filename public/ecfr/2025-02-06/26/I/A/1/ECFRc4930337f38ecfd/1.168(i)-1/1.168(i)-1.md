# § 1.168(i)-1   General asset accounts.

(a) *Scope.* This section provides rules for general asset accounts under section 168(i)(4). The provisions of this section apply only to assets for which an election has been made under paragraph (l) of this section.


(b) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:


(1) *Unadjusted depreciable basis* has the same meaning given such term in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3).


(2) *Unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account* is the sum of the unadjusted depreciable bases of all assets included in the general asset account.


(3) *Adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account* is the unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account less the adjustments to basis described in section 1016(a)(2) and (3).


(4) *Building* has the same meaning as that term is defined in § 1.48-1(e)(1).


(5) *Expensed cost* is the amount of any allowable credit or deduction treated as a deduction allowable for depreciation or amortization for purposes of section 1245 (for example, a credit allowable under section 30 or a deduction allowable under section 179, section 179A, or section 190). Expensed cost does not include any additional first year depreciation deduction.


(6) *Mass assets* is a mass or group of individual items of depreciable assets—


(i) That are not necessarily homogenous;


(ii) Each of which is minor in value relative to the total value of the mass or group;


(iii) Numerous in quantity;


(iv) Usually accounted for only on a total dollar or quantity basis;


(v) With respect to which separate identification is impracticable; and


(vi) Placed in service in the same taxable year.


(7) *Portion of an asset* is any part of an asset that is less than the entire asset as determined under paragraph (e)(2)(viii) of this section.


(8) *Remaining adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account* is the unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account less the amount of the additional first year depreciation deduction allowed or allowable, whichever is greater, for the general asset account.


(9) *Structural component* has the same meaning as that term is defined in § 1.48-1(e)(2).


(c) *Establishment of general asset accounts*—(1) *Assets eligible for general asset accounts*—(i) *General rules.* Assets that are subject to either the general depreciation system of section 168(a) or the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) may be accounted for in one or more general asset accounts. An asset is included in a general asset account only to the extent of the asset's unadjusted depreciable basis. However, an asset is not to be included in a general asset account if the asset is used both in a trade or business or for the production of income and in a personal activity at any time during the taxable year in which the asset is placed in service by the taxpayer or if the asset is placed in service and disposed of during the same taxable year.


(ii) *Special rules for assets generating foreign source income.* (A) Assets that generate foreign source income, both United States and foreign source income, or combined gross income of a foreign sales corporation (as defined in former section 922), domestic international sales corporation (as defined in section 992(a)), or possession corporation (as defined in section 936) and its related supplier may be included in a general asset account if the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section are satisfied. If, however, the inclusion of these assets in a general asset account results in a substantial distortion of income, the Commissioner may disregard the general asset account election and make any reallocations of income or expense necessary to clearly reflect income.


(B) A general asset account shall be treated as a single asset for purposes of applying the rules in § 1.861-9T(g)(3) (relating to allocation and apportionment of interest expense under the asset method). A general asset account that generates income in more than one grouping of income (statutory and residual) is a multiple category asset (as defined in § 1.861-9T(g)(3)(ii)), and the income yield from the general asset account must be determined by applying the rules for multiple category assets as if the general asset account were a single asset.


(2) *Grouping assets in general asset accounts*—(i) *General rules.* If a taxpayer makes the election under paragraph (l) of this section, assets that are subject to the election are grouped into one or more general asset accounts. Assets that are eligible to be grouped into a single general asset account may be divided into more than one general asset account. Each general asset account must include only assets that—


(A) Have the same applicable depreciation method;


(B) Have the same applicable recovery period;


(C) Have the same applicable convention; and


(D) Are placed in service by the taxpayer in the same taxable year.


(ii) *Special rules.* In addition to the general rules in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the following rules apply when establishing general asset accounts—


(A) Assets subject to the mid-quarter convention may only be grouped into a general asset account with assets that are placed in service in the same quarter of the taxable year;


(B) Assets subject to the mid-month convention may only be grouped into a general asset account with assets that are placed in service in the same month of the taxable year;


(C) Passenger automobiles for which the depreciation allowance is limited under section 280F(a) must be grouped into a separate general asset account;


(D) Assets not eligible for any additional first year depreciation deduction, including assets for which the taxpayer elected not to deduct the additional first year depreciation, provided by, for example, section 168(k), section 168(l), section 168(m), section 168(n), section 1400L(b), or section 1400N(d), must be grouped into a separate general asset account;


(E) Assets eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction may only be grouped into a general asset account with assets for which the taxpayer claimed the same percentage of the additional first year depreciation (for example, 30 percent, 50 percent, or 100 percent);


(F) Except for passenger automobiles described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, listed property (as defined in section 280F(d)(4)) must be grouped into a separate general asset account;


(G) Assets for which the depreciation allowance for the placed-in-service year is not determined by using an optional depreciation table (for further guidance, see section 8 of Rev. Proc. 87-57, 1987-2 CB 687, 693 (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter)) must be grouped into a separate general asset account;


(H) Mass assets that are or will be subject to paragraph (j)(2)(i)(D) of this section (disposed of or converted mass asset is identified by a mortality dispersion table) must be grouped into a separate general asset account; and


(I) Assets subject to paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(A) of this section (change in use results in a shorter recovery period or a more accelerated depreciation method) for which the depreciation allowance for the year of change (as defined in § 1.168(i)-4(a)) is not determined by using an optional depreciation table must be grouped into a separate general asset account.


(3) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c):


(d) *Determination of depreciation allowance*—(1) *In general.* Depreciation allowances are determined for each general asset account. The depreciation allowances must be recorded in a depreciation reserve account for each general asset account. The allowance for depreciation under this section constitutes the amount of depreciation allowable under section 167(a).


(2) *Assets in general asset account are eligible for additional first year depreciation deduction.* If all the assets in a general asset account are eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction, the taxpayer first must determine the allowable additional first year depreciation deduction for the general asset account for the placed-in-service year and then must determine the amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for the general asset account for the placed-in-service year and any subsequent taxable year. The allowable additional first year depreciation deduction for the general asset account for the placed-in-service year is determined by multiplying the unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account by the additional first year depreciation deduction percentage applicable to the assets in the account (for example, 30 percent, 50 percent, or 100 percent). The remaining adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account then is depreciated using the applicable depreciation method, recovery period, and convention for the assets in the account.


(3) *No assets in general asset account are eligible for additional first year depreciation deduction.* If none of the assets in a general asset account are eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction, the taxpayer must determine the allowable depreciation deduction for the general asset account for the placed-in-service year and any subsequent taxable year by using the applicable depreciation method, recovery period, and convention for the assets in the account.


(4) *Special rule for passenger automobiles.* For purposes of applying section 280F(a), the depreciation allowance for a general asset account established for passenger automobiles is limited for each taxable year to the amount prescribed in section 280F(a) multiplied by the excess of the number of automobiles originally included in the account over the number of automobiles disposed of during the taxable year or in any prior taxable year in a transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) (disposition of an asset in a qualifying disposition), paragraph (e)(3)(iv) (transactions subject to section 168(i)(7)), paragraph (e)(3)(v) (transactions subject to section 1031 or section 1033), paragraph (e)(3)(vi) (technical termination of a partnership), paragraph (e)(3)(vii) (anti-abuse rule), paragraph (g) (assets subject to recapture), or paragraph (h)(1) (conversion to any personal use) of this section.


(e) *Dispositions from a general asset account*—(1) *Scope and definition*—(i) *In general.* This paragraph (e) provides rules applicable to dispositions of assets included in a general asset account. For purposes of this paragraph (e), an asset in a general asset account is disposed of when ownership of the asset is transferred or when the asset is permanently withdrawn from use either in the taxpayer's trade or business or in the production of income. A disposition includes the sale, exchange, retirement, physical abandonment, or destruction of an asset. A disposition also occurs when an asset is transferred to a supplies, scrap, or similar account, or when a portion of an asset is disposed of as described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. If a structural component, or a portion thereof, of a building is disposed of in a disposition described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a disposition also includes the disposition of such structural component or such portion thereof.


(ii) *Disposition of a portion of an asset.* For purposes of applying paragraph (e) of this section, a disposition includes a disposition of a portion of an asset in a general asset account as a result of a casualty event described in section 165, a disposition of a portion of an asset in a general asset account for which gain, determined without regard to section 1245 or section 1250, is not recognized in whole or in part under section 1031 or section 1033, a transfer of a portion of an asset in a general asset account in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7)(B), a sale of a portion of an asset in a general asset account, or a disposition of a portion of an asset in a general asset account in a transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(vii)(B) of this section. For other transactions, a disposition includes a disposition of a portion of an asset in a general asset account only if the taxpayer makes the election under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section to terminate the general asset account in which that disposed portion is included or makes the election under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section for that disposed portion.


(2) *General rules for a disposition*—(i) *No immediate recovery of basis.* Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, immediately before a disposition of any asset in a general asset account or a disposition of a portion of such asset as described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, the asset or the portion of the asset, as applicable, is treated as having an adjusted depreciable basis (as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(4)) of zero for purposes of section 1011. Therefore, no loss is realized upon the disposition of an asset from the general asset account or upon the disposition of a portion of such asset as described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. Similarly, where an asset or a portion of an asset, as applicable, is disposed of by transfer to a supplies, scrap, or similar account, the basis of the asset or the portion of the asset, as applicable, in the supplies, scrap, or similar account will be zero.


(ii) *Treatment of amount realized.* Any amount realized on a disposition is recognized as ordinary income, notwithstanding any other provision of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), to the extent the sum of the unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account and any expensed cost (as defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section) for assets in the account exceeds any amounts previously recognized as ordinary income upon the disposition of other assets in the account or upon the disposition of portions of such assets as described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. The recognition and character of any excess amount realized are determined under other applicable provisions of the Code other than sections 1245 and 1250 or provisions of the Code that treat gain on a disposition as subject to section 1245 or section 1250.


(iii) *Effect of disposition on a general asset account.* Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the unadjusted depreciable basis and the depreciation reserve of the general asset account are not affected as a result of a disposition of an asset from the general asset account or of a disposition of a portion of such asset as described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.


(iv) *Coordination with nonrecognition provisions.* For purposes of determining the basis of an asset or a portion of an asset, as applicable, acquired in a transaction, other than a transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) (pertaining to transactions subject to section 168(i)(7)), paragraph (e)(3)(v) (pertaining to transactions subject to section 1031 or section 1033), and paragraph (e)(3)(vi) (pertaining to technical terminations of partnerships) of this section, to which a nonrecognition section of the Code applies, determined without regard to this section, the amount of ordinary income recognized under this paragraph (e)(2) is treated as the amount of gain recognized on the disposition.


(v) *Manner of disposition.* The manner of disposition (for example, normal retirement, abnormal retirement, ordinary retirement, or extraordinary retirement) is not taken into account in determining whether a disposition occurs or gain or loss is recognized.


(vi) *Disposition by transfer to a supplies account.* If a taxpayer made an election under § 1.162-3(d) to treat the cost of any rotable spare part, temporary spare part, or standby emergency spare part (as defined in § 1.162-3(c)) as a capital expenditure subject to the allowance for depreciation and also made an election under paragraph (l) of this section to include that rotable, temporary, or standby emergency spare part in a general asset account, the taxpayer can dispose of the rotable, temporary, or standby emergency spare part by transferring it to a supplies account only if the taxpayer has obtained the consent of the Commissioner to revoke the § 1.162-3(d) election. If a taxpayer made an election under § 1.162-3T(d) to treat the cost of any material and supply (as defined in § 1.162-3T(c)(1)) as a capital expenditure subject to the allowance for depreciation and also made an election under paragraph (l) of this section to include that material and supply in a general asset account, the taxpayer can dispose of the material and supply by transferring it to a supplies account only if the taxpayer has obtained the consent of the Commissioner to revoke the § 1.162-3T(d) election. See § 1.162-3(d)(3) for the procedures for revoking a § 1.162-3(d) or a § 1.162-3T(d) election.


(vii) *Leasehold improvements.* The rules of paragraph (e) of this section also apply to—


(A) A lessor of leased property that made an improvement to that property for the lessee of the property, has a depreciable basis in the improvement, made an election under paragraph (l) of this section to include the improvement in a general asset account, and disposes of the improvement, or disposes of a portion of the improvement as described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, before or upon the termination of the lease with the lessee. See section 168(i)(8)(B); and


(B) A lessee of leased property that made an improvement to that property, has a depreciable basis in the improvement, made an election under paragraph (l) of this section to include the improvement in a general asset account, and disposes of the improvement, or disposes of a portion of the improvement as described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, before or upon the termination of the lease.


(viii) *Determination of asset disposed of*—(A) *General rules.* For purposes of applying paragraph (e) of this section to the disposition of an asset in a general asset account, instead of the disposition of the general asset account, the facts and circumstances of each disposition are considered in determining what is the appropriate asset disposed of. The asset for disposition purposes may not consist of items placed in service by the taxpayer on different dates, without taking into account the applicable convention. For purposes of determining what is the appropriate asset disposed of, the unit of property determination under § 1.263(a)-3(e) or in published guidance in the Internal Revenue Bulletin under section 263(a) (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) and the distinct asset determination under § 1.1031(a)-3(a)(4) do not apply. 


(B) *Special rules.* In addition to the general rules in paragraph (e)(2)(viii)(A) of this section, the following rules apply for purposes of applying paragraph (e) of this section to the disposition of an asset in a general asset account instead of the disposition of the general asset account:


(*1*) Each building, including its structural components, is the asset, except as provided in § 1.1250-1(a)(2)(ii) or in paragraph (e)(2)(viii)(B)(*2*) or (*4*) of this section.


(*2*) If a building has two or more condominium or cooperative units, each condominium or cooperative unit, including its structural components, is the asset, except as provided in § 1.1250-1(a)(2)(ii) or in paragraph (e)(2)(viii)(B)(*4*) of this section.


(*3*) If a taxpayer properly includes an item in one of the asset classes 00.11 through 00.4 of Rev. Proc. 87-56 (1987-2 CB 674) (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) or properly classifies an item in one of the categories under section 168(e)(3), except for a category that includes buildings or structural components (for example, retail motor fuels outlet, qualified leasehold improvement property, qualified restaurant property, and qualified retail improvement property), each item is the asset, provided that paragraph (e)(2)(viii)(B)(*4*) of this section does not apply to the item. For example, each desk is the asset, each computer is the asset, and each qualified smart electric meter is the asset.


(*4*) If the taxpayer places in service an improvement or addition to an asset after the taxpayer placed the asset in service, the improvement or addition and, if applicable, its structural components are a separate asset.


(ix) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e)(2):


(3) *Special rules*—(i) *In general.* This paragraph (e)(3) provides the rules for terminating general asset account treatment upon certain dispositions. While the rules under paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section are optional rules, the rules under paragraphs (e)(3)(iv), (v), (vi), and (vii) of this section are mandatory rules. A taxpayer elects to apply paragraph (e)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section by reporting the gain, loss, or other deduction on the taxpayer's timely filed original Federal tax return, including extensions, for the taxable year in which the disposition occurs. However, if the loss is on account of the demolition of a structure to which section 280B and § 1.280B-1 apply, a taxpayer elects to apply paragraph (e)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section by ending depreciation for the structure at the time of the disposition of the structure, taking into account the convention applicable to the general asset account in which the demolished structure was included, and reporting the amount of depreciation for that structure for the taxable year in which the disposition occurs on the taxpayer's timely filed original Federal tax return, including extensions, for that taxable year. A taxpayer may revoke the election to apply paragraph (e)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section only by filing a request for a private letter ruling and obtaining the Commissioner's consent to revoke the election. The Commissioner may grant a request to revoke this election if the taxpayer acted reasonably and in good faith, and the revocation will not prejudice the interests of the Government. See generally § 301.9100-3 of this chapter. The election to apply paragraph (e)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section may not be made or revoked through the filing of an application for change in accounting method. For purposes of applying paragraphs (e)(3)(iii) through (vii) of this section, see paragraph (j) of this section for identifying an asset disposed of and its unadjusted depreciable basis. Solely for purposes of applying paragraphs (e)(3)(iii), (e)(3)(iv)(C), (e)(3)(v)(B), and (e)(3)(vii) of this section, the term *asset* is:


(A) The asset as determined under paragraph (e)(2)(viii) of this section; or


(B) The portion of such asset that is disposed of in a disposition described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.


(ii) *Disposition of all assets remaining in a general asset account*—(A) *Optional termination of a general asset account.* Upon the disposition of all of the assets, the last asset, or the remaining portion of the last asset in a general asset account, a taxpayer may apply this paragraph (e)(3)(ii) to recover the adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account rather than having paragraph (e)(2) of this section apply. Under this paragraph (e)(3)(ii), the general asset account terminates and the amount of gain or loss for the general asset account is determined under section 1001(a) by taking into account the adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account at the time of the disposition, as determined under the applicable convention for the general asset account. Whether and to what extent gain or loss is recognized is determined under other applicable provisions of the Code, including section 280B and § 1.280B-1. The character of the gain or loss is determined under other applicable provisions of the Code, except that the amount of gain subject to section 1245 is limited to the excess of the depreciation allowed or allowable for the general asset account, including any expensed cost, over any amounts previously recognized as ordinary income under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, and the amount of gain subject to section 1250 is limited to the excess of the additional depreciation allowed or allowable for the general asset account, over any amounts previously recognized as ordinary income under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.


(B) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e)(3)(ii):


(iii) *Disposition of an asset in a qualifying disposition*—(A) *Optional determination of the amount of gain, loss, or other deduction.* In the case of a qualifying disposition (described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B) of this section) of an asset, a taxpayer may elect to apply this paragraph (e)(3)(iii) rather than having paragraph (e)(2) of this section apply. Under this paragraph (e)(3)(iii), general asset account treatment for the asset terminates as of the first day of the taxable year in which the qualifying disposition occurs, and the amount of gain, loss, or other deduction for the asset is determined under § 1.168(i)-8 by taking into account the asset's adjusted depreciable basis at the time of the disposition. The adjusted depreciable basis of the asset at the time of the disposition, as determined under the applicable convention for the general asset account in which the asset was included, equals the unadjusted depreciable basis of the asset less the greater of the depreciation allowed or allowable for the asset. The allowable depreciation is computed by using the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the general asset account in which the asset was included and by including the portion of the additional first year depreciation deduction claimed for the general asset account that is attributable to the asset disposed of. Whether and to what extent gain, loss, or other deduction is recognized is determined under other applicable provisions of the Code, including section 280B and § 1.280B-1. The character of the gain, loss, or other deduction is determined under other applicable provisions of the Code, except that the amount of gain subject to section 1245 or section 1250 is limited to the lesser of—


(*1*) The depreciation allowed or allowable for the asset, including any expensed cost or, in the case of section 1250 property, the additional depreciation allowed or allowable for the asset; or


(*2*) The excess of—


(*i*) The original unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account plus, in the case of section 1245 property originally included in the general asset account, any expensed cost; over


(*ii*) The cumulative amounts of gain previously recognized as ordinary income under either paragraph (e)(2) of this section or section 1245 or section 1250.


(B) *Qualifying dispositions.* A *qualifying disposition* is a disposition that does not involve all the assets, the last asset, or the remaining portion of the last asset remaining in a general asset account and that is—


(*1*) A direct result of a fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty, or from theft;


(*2*) A charitable contribution for which a deduction is allowable under section 170;


(*3*) A direct result of a cessation, termination, or disposition of a business, manufacturing or other income producing process, operation, facility, plant, or other unit, other than by transfer to a supplies, scrap, or similar account; or


(*4*) A transaction, other than a transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) (pertaining to transactions subject to section 168(i)(7)), paragraph (e)(3)(v) (pertaining to transactions subject to section 1031 or section 1033), paragraph (e)(3)(vi) (pertaining to technical terminations of partnerships), or paragraph (e)(3)(vii) (anti-abuse rule) of this section, to which a nonrecognition section of the Internal Revenue Code applies (determined without regard to this section).


(C) *Effect of a qualifying disposition on a general asset account.* If the taxpayer elects to apply this paragraph (e)(3)(iii) to a qualifying disposition of an asset, then—


(*1*) The asset is removed from the general asset account as of the first day of the taxable year in which the qualifying disposition occurs. For that taxable year, the taxpayer accounts for the asset in a single asset account in accordance with the rules under § 1.168(i)-7(b);


(*2*) The unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account is reduced by the unadjusted depreciable basis of the asset as of the first day of the taxable year in which the disposition occurs;


(*3*) The depreciation reserve of the general asset account is reduced by the greater of the depreciation allowed or allowable for the asset as of the end of the taxable year immediately preceding the year of disposition. The allowable depreciation is computed by using the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the general asset account in which the asset was included and by including the portion of the additional first year depreciation deduction claimed for the general asset account that is attributable to the asset disposed of; and


(*4*) For purposes of determining the amount of gain realized on subsequent dispositions that is subject to ordinary income treatment under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the amount of any expensed cost with respect to the asset is disregarded.


(D) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e)(3)(iii):


(iv) *Transactions subject to section 168(i)(7)*—(A) *In general.* If a taxpayer transfers one or more assets, or a portion of such asset, in a general asset account in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7)(B) (pertaining to treatment of transferees in certain nonrecognition transactions), the taxpayer (the transferor) and the transferee must apply this paragraph (e)(3)(iv) to the asset or the portion of such asset, instead of applying paragraph (e)(2), (e)(3)(ii), or (e)(3)(iii) of this section. The transferee is bound by the transferor's election under paragraph (l) of this section for the portion of the transferee's basis in the asset or the portion of such asset that does not exceed the transferor's adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account or the asset or the portion of such asset, as applicable, as determined under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B)(*2*) or (C)(*2*) of this section, as applicable.


(B) *All assets remaining in general asset account are transferred.* If a taxpayer transfers all the assets, the last asset, or the remaining portion of the last asset in a general asset account in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7)(B)—


(*1*) The taxpayer (the transferor) must terminate the general asset account on the date of the transfer. The allowable depreciation deduction for the general asset account for the transferor's taxable year in which the section 168(i)(7)(B) transaction occurs is computed by using the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the general asset account. This allowable depreciation deduction is allocated between the transferor and the transferee on a monthly basis. This allocation is made in accordance with the rules in § 1.168(d)-1(b)(7)(ii) for allocating the depreciation deduction between the transferor and the transferee;


(*2*) The transferee must establish a new general asset account for all the assets, the last asset, or the remaining portion of the last asset, in the taxable year in which the section 168(i)(7)(B) transaction occurs for the portion of its basis in the assets that does not exceed the transferor's adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account in which all the assets, the last asset, or the remaining portion of the last asset, were included. The transferor's adjusted depreciable basis of this general asset account is equal to the adjusted depreciable basis of that account as of the beginning of the transferor's taxable year in which the transaction occurs, decreased by the amount of depreciation allocable to the transferor for the year of the transfer, as determined under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B)(*1*) of this section. The transferee is treated as the transferor for purposes of computing the allowable depreciation deduction for the new general asset account under section 168. The new general asset account must be established in accordance with the rules in paragraph (c) of this section, except that the unadjusted depreciable bases of all the assets, the last asset, or the remaining portion of the last asset, and the greater of the depreciation allowed or allowable for all the assets, the last asset, or the remaining portion of the last asset, including the amount of depreciation for the transferred assets that is allocable to the transferor for the year of the transfer, are included in the newly established general asset account. Consequently, this general asset account in the year of the transfer will have a beginning balance for both the unadjusted depreciable basis and the depreciation reserve of the general asset account; and


(*3*) For purposes of section 168 and this section, the transferee treats the portion of its basis in the assets that exceeds the transferor's adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account in which all the assets, the last asset, or the remaining portion of the last asset, were included, as determined under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B)(*2*) of this section, as a separate asset that the transferee placed in service on the date of the transfer. The transferee accounts for this asset under § 1.168(i)-7 or may make an election under paragraph (l) of this section to include the asset in a general asset account.


(C) *Not all assets remaining in general asset account are transferred.* If a taxpayer transfers an asset in a general asset account in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7)(B) and if paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B) of this section does not apply to this asset—


(*1*) The taxpayer (the transferor) must remove the transferred asset from the general asset account in which the asset is included, as of the first day of the taxable year in which the section 168(i)(7)(B) transaction occurs. In addition, the adjustments to the general asset account described in paragraphs (e)(3)(iii)(C)(*2*) through (*4*) of this section must be made. The allowable depreciation deduction for the asset for the transferor's taxable year in which the section 168(i)(7)(B) transaction occurs is computed by using the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the general asset account in which the asset was included. This allowable depreciation deduction is allocated between the transferor and the transferee on a monthly basis. This allocation is made in accordance with the rules in § 1.168(d)-1(b)(7)(ii) for allocating the depreciation deduction between the transferor and the transferee;


(*2*) The transferee must establish a new general asset account for the asset in the taxable year in which the section 168(i)(7)(B) transaction occurs for the portion of its basis in the asset that does not exceed the transferor's adjusted depreciable basis of the asset. The transferor's adjusted depreciable basis of this asset is equal to the adjusted depreciable basis of the asset as of the beginning of the transferor's taxable year in which the transaction occurs, decreased by the amount of depreciation allocable to the transferor for the year of the transfer, as determined under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(C)(*1*) of this section. The transferee is treated as the transferor for purposes of computing the allowable depreciation deduction for the new general asset account under section 168. The new general asset account must be established in accordance with the rules in paragraph (c) of this section, except that the unadjusted depreciable basis of the asset, and the greater of the depreciation allowed or allowable for the asset, including the amount of depreciation for the transferred asset that is allocable to the transferor for the year of the transfer, are included in the newly established general asset account. Consequently, this general asset account in the year of the transfer will have a beginning balance for both the unadjusted depreciable basis and the depreciation reserve of the general asset account; and


(*3*) For purposes of section 168 and this section, the transferee treats the portion of its basis in the asset that exceeds the transferor's adjusted depreciable basis of the asset, as determined under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(C)(*2*) of this section, as a separate asset that the transferee placed in service on the date of the transfer. The transferee accounts for this asset under § 1.168(i)-7 or may make an election under paragraph (l) of this section to include the asset in a general asset account.


(v) *Transactions subject to section 1031 or section 1033*—(A) *Like-kind exchange or involuntary conversion of all assets remaining in a general asset account.* If all the assets, the last asset, or the remaining portion of the last asset in a general asset account are transferred by a taxpayer in a like-kind exchange (as defined under § 1.168-6(b)(11)) or in an involuntary conversion (as defined under § 1.168-6(b)(12)), the taxpayer must apply this paragraph (e)(3)(v)(A) instead of applying paragraph (e)(2), (e)(3)(ii), or (e)(3)(iii) of this section. Under this paragraph (e)(3)(v)(A), the general asset account terminates as of the first day of the year of disposition (as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(5)) and—


(*1*) The amount of gain or loss for the general asset account is determined under section 1001(a) by taking into account the adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account at the time of disposition (as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(3)). The depreciation allowance for the general asset account in the year of disposition is determined in the same manner as the depreciation allowance for the relinquished MACRS property (as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(2)) in the year of disposition is determined under § 1.168(i)-6. The recognition and character of gain or loss are determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, notwithstanding that paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section is an optional rule; and


(*2*) The adjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account at the time of disposition is treated as the adjusted depreciable basis of the relinquished MACRS property.


(B) *Like-kind exchange or involuntary conversion of less than all assets remaining in a general asset account.* If an asset in a general asset account is transferred by a taxpayer in a like-kind exchange or in an involuntary conversion and if paragraph (e)(3)(v)(A) of this section does not apply to this asset, the taxpayer must apply this paragraph (e)(3)(v)(B) instead of applying paragraph (e)(2), (e)(3)(ii), or (e)(3)(iii) of this section. Under this paragraph (e)(3)(v)(B), general asset account treatment for the asset terminates as of the first day of the year of disposition (as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(5)), and—


(*1*) The amount of gain or loss for the asset is determined by taking into account the asset's adjusted depreciable basis at the time of disposition (as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(3)). The adjusted depreciable basis of the asset at the time of disposition equals the unadjusted depreciable basis of the asset less the greater of the depreciation allowed or allowable for the asset. The allowable depreciation is computed by using the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the general asset account in which the asset was included and by including the portion of the additional first year depreciation deduction claimed for the general asset account that is attributable to the relinquished asset. The depreciation allowance for the asset in the year of disposition is determined in the same manner as the depreciation allowance for the relinquished MACRS property (as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(2)) in the year of disposition is determined under § 1.168(i)-6. The recognition and character of the gain or loss are determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, notwithstanding that paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section is an optional rule; and


(*2*) As of the first day of the year of disposition, the taxpayer must remove the relinquished asset from the general asset account and make the adjustments to the general asset account described in paragraphs (e)(3)(iii)(C)(*2*) through (*4*) of this section.


(vi) *Technical termination of a partnership.* In the case of a technical termination of a partnership under section 708(b)(1)(B), the terminated partnership must apply this paragraph (e)(3)(vi) instead of applying paragraph (e)(2), (e)(3)(ii), or (e)(3)(iii) of this section. Under this paragraph (e)(3)(vi), all of the terminated partnership's general asset accounts terminate as of the date of its termination under section 708(b)(1)(B). The terminated partnership computes the allowable depreciation deduction for each of its general asset accounts for the taxable year in which the technical termination occurs by using the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the general asset account. The new partnership is not bound by the terminated partnership's election under paragraph (l) of this section.


(vii) *Anti-abuse rule*—(A) *In general.* If an asset in a general asset account is disposed of by a taxpayer in a transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(vii)(B) of this section, general asset account treatment for the asset terminates as of the first day of the taxable year in which the disposition occurs. Consequently, the taxpayer must determine the amount of gain, loss, or other deduction attributable to the disposition in the manner described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, notwithstanding that paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section is an optional rule, and must make the adjustments to the general asset account described in paragraphs (e)(3)(iii)(C)(*1*) through (*4*) of this section.


(B) *Abusive transactions.* A transaction is described in this paragraph (e)(3)(vii)(B) if the transaction is not described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv), (e)(3)(v), or (e)(3)(vi) of this section, and if the transaction is entered into, or made, with a principal purpose of achieving a tax benefit or result that would not be available absent an election under this section. Examples of these types of transactions include—


(*1*) A transaction entered into with a principal purpose of shifting income or deductions among taxpayers in a manner that would not be possible absent an election under this section to take advantage of differing effective tax rates among the taxpayers; or


(*2*) An election made under this section with a principal purpose of disposing of an asset from a general asset account to utilize an expiring net operating loss or credit if the transaction is not a bona fide disposition. The fact that a taxpayer with a net operating loss carryover or a credit carryover transfers an asset to a related person or transfers an asset pursuant to an arrangement where the asset continues to be used or is available for use by the taxpayer pursuant to a lease or otherwise indicates, absent strong evidence to the contrary, that the transaction is described in this paragraph (e)(3)(vii)(B).


(f) *Assets generating foreign source income*—(1) *In general.* This paragraph (f) provides the rules for determining the source of any income, gain, or loss recognized, and the appropriate section 904(d) separate limitation category or categories for any foreign source income, gain, or loss recognized on a disposition (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(1) of this section) of an asset in a general asset account that consists of assets generating both United States and foreign source income. These rules apply only to a disposition to which paragraph (e)(2) (general disposition rules), paragraph (e)(3)(ii) (disposition of all assets remaining in a general asset account), paragraph (e)(3)(iii) (disposition of an asset in a qualifying disposition), paragraph (e)(3)(v) (transactions subject to section 1031 or section 1033), or paragraph (e)(3)(vii) (anti-abuse rule) of this section applies. Solely for purposes of applying this paragraph (f), the term *asset* is:


(i) The asset as determined under paragraph (e)(2)(viii) of this section; or


(ii) The portion of such asset that is disposed of in a disposition described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.


(2) *Source of ordinary income, gain, or loss*—(i) *Source determined by allocation and apportionment of depreciation allowed.* The amount of any ordinary income, gain, or loss that is recognized on the disposition of an asset in a general asset account must be apportioned between United States and foreign sources based on the allocation and apportionment of the—


(A) Depreciation allowed for the general asset account as of the end of the taxable year in which the disposition occurs if paragraph (e)(2) of this section applies to the disposition;


(B) Depreciation allowed for the general asset account as of the time of disposition if the taxpayer applies paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section to the disposition of all assets, the last asset, or the remaining portion of the last asset, in the general asset account, or if all the assets, the last asset, or the remaining portion of the last asset, in the general asset account are disposed of in a transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(v)(A) of this section; or


(C) Depreciation allowed for the asset disposed of for only the taxable year in which the disposition occurs if the taxpayer applies paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section to the disposition of the asset in a qualifying disposition, if the asset is disposed of in a transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(v)(B) of this section (like-kind exchange or involuntary conversion), or if the asset is disposed of in a transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(vii) of this section (anti-abuse rule).


(ii) *Formula for determining foreign source income, gain, or loss.* The amount of ordinary income, gain, or loss recognized on the disposition that shall be treated as foreign source income, gain, or loss must be determined under the formula in this paragraph (f)(2)(ii). For purposes of this formula, the allowed depreciation deductions are determined for the applicable time period provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. The formula is:


(3) *Section 904(d) separate categories.* If the assets in the general asset account generate foreign source income in more than one separate category under section 904(d)(1) or another section of the Code (for example, income treated as foreign source income under section 904(g)(10)), or under a United States income tax treaty that requires the foreign tax credit limitation to be determined separately for specified types of income, the amount of foreign source income, gain, or loss from the disposition of an asset, as determined under the formula in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, must be allocated and apportioned to the applicable separate category or categories under the formula in this paragraph (f)(3). For purposes of this formula, the allowed depreciation deductions are determined for the applicable time period provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. The formula is:


(g) *Assets subject to recapture.* If the basis of an asset in a general asset account is increased as a result of the recapture of any allowable credit or deduction (for example, the basis adjustment for the recapture amount under section 30(e)(5), 50(c)(2), 168(l)(6), 168(n)(4), 179(d)(10), 179A(e)(4), or 1400N(d)(5)), general asset account treatment for the asset terminates as of the first day of the taxable year in which the recapture event occurs. Consequently, the taxpayer must remove the asset from the general asset account as of that day and must make the adjustments to the general asset account described in paragraphs (e)(3)(iii)(C)(*2*) through (*4*) of this section.


(h) *Changes in use*—(1) *Conversion to any personal use.* An asset in a general asset account becomes ineligible for general asset account treatment if a taxpayer uses the asset in any personal activity during a taxable year. Upon a conversion to any personal use, the taxpayer must remove the asset from the general asset account as of the first day of the taxable year in which the change in use occurs (the year of change) and must make the adjustments to the general asset account described in paragraphs (e)(3)(iii)(C)(*2*) through (*4*) of this section.


(2) *Change in use results in a different recovery period and/or depreciation method*—(i) *No effect on general asset account election.* A change in the use described in § 1.168(i)-4(d) (change in use results in a different recovery period or depreciation method) of an asset in a general asset account shall not cause or permit the revocation of the election made under this section.


(ii) *Asset is removed from the general asset account.* Upon a change in the use described in § 1.168(i)-4(d), the taxpayer must remove the asset from the general asset account as of the first day of the year of change (as defined in § 1.168(i)-4(a)) and must make the adjustments to the general asset account described in paragraphs (e)(3)(iii)(C)(*2*) through (*4*) of this section. If, however, the result of the change in use is described in § 1.168(i)-4(d)(3) (change in use results in a shorter recovery period or a more accelerated depreciation method) and the taxpayer elects to treat the asset as though the change in use had not occurred pursuant to § 1.168(i)-4(d)(3)(ii), no adjustment is made to the general asset account upon the change in use.


(iii) *New general asset account is established*—(A) *Change in use results in a shorter recovery period or a more accelerated depreciation method.* If the result of the change in use is described in § 1.168(i)-4(d)(3) (change in use results in a shorter recovery period or a more accelerated depreciation method) and adjustments to the general asset account are made pursuant to paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section, the taxpayer must establish a new general asset account for the asset in the year of change in accordance with the rules in paragraph (c) of this section, except that the adjusted depreciable basis of the asset as of the first day of the year of change is included in the general asset account. For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the applicable depreciation method, recovery period, and convention are determined under § 1.168(i)-4(d)(3)(i).


(B) *Change in use results in a longer recovery period or a slower depreciation method.* If the result of the change in use is described in § 1.168(i)-4(d)(4) (change in use results in a longer recovery period or a slower depreciation method), the taxpayer must establish a separate general asset account for the asset in the year of change in accordance with the rules in paragraph (c) of this section, except that the unadjusted depreciable basis of the asset, and the greater of the depreciation of the asset allowed or allowable in accordance with section 1016(a)(2), as of the first day of the year of change are included in the newly established general asset account. Consequently, this general asset account as of the first day of the year of change will have a beginning balance for both the unadjusted depreciable basis and the depreciation reserve of the general asset account. For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the applicable depreciation method, recovery period, and convention are determined under § 1.168(i)-4(d)(4)(ii).


(i) *Redetermination of basis.* If, after the placed-in-service year, the unadjusted depreciable basis of an asset in a general asset account is redetermined due to a transaction other than that described in paragraph (g) of this section (for example, due to contingent purchase price or discharge of indebtedness), the taxpayer's election under paragraph (l) of this section for the asset also applies to the increase or decrease in basis resulting from the redetermination. For the taxable year in which the increase or decrease in basis occurs, the taxpayer must establish a new general asset account for the amount of the increase or decrease in basis in accordance with the rules in paragraph (c) of this section. For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the applicable recovery period for the increase or decrease in basis is the recovery period of the asset remaining as of the beginning of the taxable year in which the increase or decrease in basis occurs, the applicable depreciation method and applicable convention for the increase or decrease in basis are the same depreciation method and convention applicable to the asset that applies for the taxable year in which the increase or decrease in basis occurs, and the increase or decrease in basis is deemed to be placed in service in the same taxable year as the asset.


(j) *Identification of disposed or converted asset*—(1) *In general.* The rules of this paragraph (j) apply when an asset in a general asset account is disposed of or converted in a transaction described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) (disposition of an asset in a qualifying disposition), paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B) (transactions subject to section 168(i)(7)), paragraph (e)(3)(v)(B) (transactions subject to section 1031 or section 1033), paragraph (e)(3)(vii) (anti-abuse rule), paragraph (g) (assets subject to recapture), or paragraph (h)(1) (conversion to any personal use) of this section.


(2) *Identifying which asset is disposed of or converted*—(i) *In general.* For purposes of identifying which asset in a general asset account is disposed of or converted, a taxpayer must identify the disposed of or converted asset by using—


(A) The specific identification method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, the taxpayer can determine the particular taxable year in which the disposed of or converted asset was placed in service by the taxpayer;


(B) A first-in, first-out method of accounting if the taxpayer can readily determine from its records the total dispositions of assets with the same recovery period during the taxable year but the taxpayer cannot readily determine from its records the unadjusted depreciable basis of the disposed of or converted asset. Under this method of accounting, the taxpayer identifies the general asset account with the earliest placed-in-service year that has the same recovery period as the disposed of or converted asset and that has assets at the beginning of the taxable year of the disposition or conversion, and the taxpayer treats the disposed of or converted asset as being from that general asset account. To determine which general asset account has assets at the beginning of the taxable year of the disposition or conversion, the taxpayer reduces the number of assets originally included in the account by the number of assets disposed of or converted in any prior taxable year in a transaction to which this paragraph (j) applies;


(C) A modified first-in, first-out method of accounting if the taxpayer can readily determine from its records the total dispositions of assets with the same recovery period during the taxable year and the unadjusted depreciable basis of the disposed of or converted asset. Under this method of accounting, the taxpayer identifies the general asset account with the earliest placed-in-service year that has the same recovery period as the disposed of or converted asset and that has assets at the beginning of the taxable year of the disposition or conversion with the same unadjusted depreciable basis as the disposed of or converted asset, and the taxpayer treats the disposed of or converted asset as being from that general asset account. To determine which general asset account has assets at the beginning of the taxable year of the disposition or conversion, the taxpayer reduces the number of assets originally included in the account by the number of assets disposed of or converted in any prior taxable year in a transaction to which this paragraph (j) applies;


(D) A mortality dispersion table if the asset is a mass asset accounted for in a separate general asset account in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(H) of this section and if the taxpayer can readily determine from its records the total dispositions of assets with the same recovery period during the taxable year. The mortality dispersion table must be based upon an acceptable sampling of the taxpayer's actual disposition and conversion experience for mass assets or other acceptable statistical or engineering techniques. To use a mortality dispersion table, the taxpayer must adopt recordkeeping practices consistent with the taxpayer's prior practices and consonant with good accounting and engineering practices; or


(E) Any other method as the Secretary may designate by publication in the _Federal Register_ or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) on or after September 19, 2013. See paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section regarding the last-in, first-out method of accounting.


(ii) *Disposition of a portion of an asset.* If a taxpayer disposes of a portion of an asset and paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section applies to that disposition, the taxpayer may identify the asset by using any applicable method provided in paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section, after taking into account paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section.


(iii) *Last-in, first-out method of accounting.* For purposes of paragraph (j)(2) of this section, a last-in, first-out method of accounting may not be used. Examples of a last-in, first-out method of accounting include the taxpayer identifying the general asset account with the most recent placed-in-service year that has the same recovery period as the disposed of or converted asset and that has assets at the beginning of the taxable year of the disposition or conversion, and the taxpayer treating the disposed of or converted asset as being from that general asset account, or the taxpayer treating the disposed portion of an asset as being from the general asset account with the most recent placed-in-service year that has assets that are the same as the asset of which the disposed portion is a part.


(3) *Basis of disposed of or converted asset.* (i) Solely for purposes of this paragraph (j)(3), the term *asset* is the asset as determined under paragraph (e)(2)(viii) of this section or the portion of such asset that is disposed of in a disposition described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. After identifying which asset in a general asset account is disposed of or converted, the taxpayer must determine the unadjusted depreciable basis of, and the depreciation allowed or allowable for, the disposed of or converted asset. If it is impracticable from the taxpayer's records to determine the unadjusted depreciable basis of the disposed of or converted asset, the taxpayer may use any reasonable method that is consistently applied to all assets in the same general asset account for purposes of determining the unadjusted depreciable basis of the disposed of or converted asset in that general asset account. Examples of a reasonable method include, but are not limited to, the following:


(A) If the replacement asset is a restoration (as defined in § 1.263(a)-3(k)), and is not a betterment (as defined in § 1.263(a)-3(j)) or an adaptation to a new or different use (as defined in § 1.263(a)-3(l)), discounting the cost of the replacement asset to its placed-in-service year cost using the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods or its successor, the Producer Price Index for Final Demand, or any other index designated by guidance in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) for purposes of this paragraph (j)(3);


(B) A pro rata allocation of the unadjusted depreciable basis of the general asset account based on the replacement cost of the disposed asset and the replacement cost of all of the assets in the general asset account; and


(C) A study allocating the cost of the asset to its individual components.


(ii) The depreciation allowable for the disposed of or converted asset is computed by using the depreciation method, recovery period, and convention applicable to the general asset account in which the disposed of or converted asset was included and by including the additional first year depreciation deduction claimed for the disposed of or converted asset.


(k) *Effect of adjustments on prior dispositions.* The adjustments to a general asset account under paragraph (e)(3)(iii), (e)(3)(iv), (e)(3)(v), (e)(3)(vii), (g), or (h) of this section have no effect on the recognition and character of prior dispositions subject to paragraph (e)(2) of this section.


(l) *Election*—(1) *Irrevocable election.* If a taxpayer makes an election under this paragraph (l), the taxpayer consents to, and agrees to apply, all of the provisions of this section to the assets included in a general asset account. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A), (e)(3), (g), or (h) of this section or except as otherwise expressly provided by other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), an election made under this section is irrevocable and will be binding on the taxpayer for computing taxable income for the taxable year for which the election is made and for all subsequent taxable years. An election under this paragraph (l) is made separately by each person owning an asset to which this section applies (for example, by each member of a consolidated group, at the partnership level and not by the partner separately, or at the S corporation level and not by the shareholder separately).


(l)(2) *Time for making election.* The election to apply this section shall be made on the taxpayer's timely filed (including extensions) income tax return for the taxable year in which the assets included in the general asset account are placed in service by the taxpayer.


(3) *Manner of making election.* In the year of election, a taxpayer makes the election under this section by typing or legibly printing at the top of the Form 4562, “GENERAL ASSET ACCOUNT ELECTION MADE UNDER SECTION 168(i)(4),” or in the manner provided for on Form 4562 and its instructions. The taxpayer shall maintain records (for example, “General Asset Account #1—all 1995 additions in asset class 00.11 for Salt Lake City, Utah facility”) that identify the assets included in each general asset account, that establish the unadjusted depreciable basis and depreciation reserve of the general asset account, and that reflect the amount realized during the taxable year upon dispositions from each general asset account. (But see section 179(c) and § 1.179-5 for the recordkeeping requirements for section 179 property.) The taxpayer's recordkeeping practices should be consistently applied to the general asset accounts. If Form 4562 is revised or renumbered, any reference in this section to that form shall be treated as a reference to the revised or renumbered form.


(m) *Effective/applicability dates*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (m)(5) of this section, this section applies to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014. Except as provided in paragraphs (m)(2), (m)(3), and (m)(4) of this section, § 1.168(i)-1 as contained in 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 2011, applies to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2014.


(2) *Early application of this section.* A taxpayer may choose to apply the provisions of this section to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2012.


(3) *Early application of regulation project REG-110732-13.* A taxpayer may rely on the provisions of this section in regulation project REG-110732-13 (2013-43 IRB 404) (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2012. However, a taxpayer may not rely on the provisions of this section in regulation project REG-110732-13 for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014.


(4) *Optional application of TD 9564.* A taxpayer may choose to apply § 1.168(i)-1T as contained in 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 2014, to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2012. However, a taxpayer may not apply § 1.168(i)-1T as contained in 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 2014, to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2014.


(5) *Application of paragraph (e)(2)(viii)(A).* The language “and the distinct asset determination under § 1.1031(a)-3(a)(4) do not apply.” in the last sentence of paragraph (e)(2)(viii)(A) of this section applies on or after December 2, 2020. Paragraph (e)(2)(viii)(A) of this section as contained in 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 2020, applies before December 2, 2020.


(6) *Change in method of accounting.* A change to comply with this section for depreciable assets placed in service in a taxable year ending on or after December 30, 2003, is a change in method of accounting to which the provisions of section 446(e) and the regulations under section 446(e) apply. A taxpayer also may treat a change to comply with this section for depreciable assets placed in service in a taxable year ending before December 30, 2003, as a change in method of accounting to which the provisions of section 446(e) and the regulations under section 446(e) apply. This paragraph (m)(5) does not apply to a change to comply with paragraph (e)(3)(ii), (e)(3)(iii), or (l) of this section, except as otherwise expressly provided by other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
