# § 1.168(k)-2   Additional first year depreciation deduction for property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017.

(a) *Scope and definitions*—(1) *Scope.* This section provides rules for determining the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable under section 168(k) for qualified property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.


(2) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section—


(i) *Act* is the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Public Law 115-97 (131 Stat. 2054 (December 22, 2017));


(ii) *Applicable percentage* is the percentage provided in section 168(k)(6);


(iii) *Initial live staged performance* is the first commercial exhibition of a production to an audience. However, the term *initial live staged performance* does not include limited exhibition prior to commercial exhibition to general audiences if the limited exhibition is primarily for purposes of publicity, determining the need for further production activity, or raising funds for the completion of production. For example, an initial live staged performance does not include a preview of the production if the preview is primarily to determine the need for further production activity; and


(iv) *Predecessor* includes—


(A) A transferor of an asset to a transferee in a transaction to which section 381(a) applies;


(B) A transferor of the asset to a transferee in a transaction in which the transferee's basis in the asset is determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of the transferor;


(C) A partnership that is considered as continuing under section 708(b)(2) and § 1.708-1; or


(D) The decedent in the case of an asset acquired by the estate. 


(b) *Qualified property*—(1) *In general.* Qualified property is depreciable property, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(1), that meets all the following requirements in the first taxable year in which the property is subject to depreciation by the taxpayer whether or not depreciation deductions for the property are allowable:


(i) The requirements in § 1.168(k)-2(b)(2) (description of qualified property);


(ii) The requirements in § 1.168(k)-2(b)(3) (original use or used property acquisition requirements);


(iii) The requirements in § 1.168(k)-2(b)(4) (placed-in-service date); and


(iv) The requirements in § 1.168(k)-2(b)(5) (acquisition of property).


(2) *Description of qualified property*—(i) *In general.* Depreciable property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(2) if the property is—


(A) MACRS property, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(2), that has a recovery period of 20 years or less. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) and section 168(k)(2)(A)(i)(I), the recovery period is determined in accordance with section 168(c) regardless of any election made by the taxpayer under section 168(g)(7). This paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) includes the following MACRS property that is acquired by the taxpayer after September 27, 2017, and placed in service by the taxpayer after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2018:


(*1*) Qualified leasehold improvement property as defined in section 168(e)(6) as in effect on the day before amendment by section 13204(a)(1) of the Act;


(*2*) Qualified restaurant property, as defined in section 168(e)(7) as in effect on the day before amendment by section 13204(a)(1) of the Act, that is qualified improvement property as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(5)(i)(C) and (a)(5)(ii); and


(*3*) Qualified retail improvement property as defined in section 168(e)(8) as in effect on the day before amendment by section 13204(a)(1) of the Act;


(B) Computer software as defined in, and depreciated under, section 167(f)(1) and § 1.167(a)-14;


(C) Water utility property as defined in section 168(e)(5) and depreciated under section 168;


(D) Qualified improvement property as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(5)(i)(C) and (a)(5)(ii) and depreciated under section 168;


(E) A qualified film or television production, as defined in section 181(d) and § 1.181-3, for which a deduction would have been allowable under section 181 and §§ 1.181-1 through 1.181-6 without regard to section 181(a)(2) and (g), § 1.181-1(b)(1)(i) and (ii), and (b)(2)(i), or section 168(k). Only production costs of a qualified film or television production are allowable as a deduction under section 181 and §§ 1.181-1 through 1.181-6 without regard, for purposes of section 168(k), to section 181(a)(2) and (g), § 1.181-1(b)(1)(i) and (ii), and (b)(2)(i). The taxpayer that claims the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section for the production costs of a qualified film or television production must be the owner, as defined in § 1.181-1(a)(2), of the qualified film or television production. See § 1.181-1(a)(3) for the definition of production costs;


(F) A qualified live theatrical production, as defined in section 181(e), for which a deduction would have been allowable under section 181 and §§ 1.181-1 through 1.181-6 without regard to section 181(a)(2) and (g), § 1.181-1(b)(1)(i) and (ii), and (b)(2)(i), or section 168(k). Only production costs of a qualified live theatrical production are allowable as a deduction under section 181 and §§ 1.181-1 through 1.181-6 without regard, for purposes of section 168(k), to section 181(a)(2) and (g), § 1.181-1(b)(1)(i) and (ii), and (b)(2)(i). The taxpayer that claims the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section for the production costs of a qualified live theatrical production must be the owner, as defined in § 1.181-1(a)(2), of the qualified live theatrical production. In applying § 1.181-1(a)(2)(ii) to a person that acquires a finished or partially-finished qualified live theatrical production, such person is treated as an owner of that production, but only if the production is acquired prior to its initial live staged performance. Rules similar to the rules in § 1.181-1(a)(3) for the definition of production costs of a qualified film or television production apply for defining production costs of a qualified live theatrical production; or


(G) A specified plant, as defined in section 168(k)(5)(B), for which the taxpayer has properly made an election to apply section 168(k)(5) for the taxable year in which the specified plant is planted, or grafted to a plant that has already been planted, by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's farming business, as defined in section 263A(e)(4) (for further guidance, see paragraph (f) of this section).


(ii) *Property not eligible for additional first year depreciation deduction.* Depreciable property will not meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(2) if the property is—


(A) Described in section 168(f) (for example, automobiles for which the taxpayer uses the optional business standard mileage rate);


(B) Required to be depreciated under the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) pursuant to section 168(g)(1)(A), (B), (C), (D), (F), or (G), or other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (for example, property described in section 263A(e)(2)(A) if the taxpayer or any related person, as defined in section 263A(e)(2)(B), has made an election under section 263A(d)(3), or property described in section 280F(b)(1)). If section 168(h)(6) applies to the property, only the tax-exempt entity's proportionate share of the property, as determined under section 168(h)(6), is treated as tax-exempt use property described in section 168(g)(1)(B) and in this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B). This paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) does not apply to property for which the adjusted basis is required to be determined using the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) pursuant to section 250(b)(2)(B) or 951A(d)(3), as applicable, or to property for which the adjusted basis is required to be determined using the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) for allocating business interest expense between excepted and non-excepted trades or businesses under section 163(j), but only if the property is not required to be depreciated under the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) pursuant to section 168(g)(1)(A), (B), (C), (D), (F), or (G), or other provisions of the Code, other than section 163(j), 250(b)(2)(B), or 951A(d)(3), as applicable;


(C) Included in any class of property for which the taxpayer elects not to deduct the additional first year depreciation (for further guidance, see paragraph (f) of this section);


(D) A specified plant that is placed in service by the taxpayer during the taxable year and for which the taxpayer made an election to apply section 168(k)(5) for a prior taxable year;


(E) Included in any class of property for which the taxpayer elects to apply section 168(k)(4). This paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(E) applies to property placed in service by the taxpayer in any taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018;


(F) Primarily used in a trade or business described in section 163(j)(7)(A)(iv) and §§ 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i) and 1.163(j)-10(c)(3)(iii)(C)(*3*), and placed in service by the taxpayer in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017. For purposes of section 168(k)(9)(A) and this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(F), the term *primarily used* has the same meaning as that term is used in § 1.167(a)-11(b)(4)(iii)(*b*) and (e)(3)(iii) for classifying property. This paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(F) does not apply to property that is leased to a lessee's trade or business described in section 163(j)(7)(A)(iv) and §§ 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i) and 1.163(j)-10(c)(3)(iii)(C)(*3*), by a lessor's trade or business that is not described in section 163(j)(7)(A)(iv) and §§ 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i) and 1.163(j)-10(c)(3)(iii)(C)(*3*) for the taxable year; or


(G) Used in a trade or business that has had floor plan financing indebtedness, as defined in section 163(j)(9)(B) and § 1.163(j)-1(b)(18), if the floor plan financing interest expense, as defined in section 163(j)(9)(A) and § 1.163(j)-1(b)(19), related to such indebtedness is taken into account under section 163(j)(1)(C) for the taxable year. Such property also must be placed in service by the taxpayer in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017. Solely for purposes of section 168(k)(9)(B) and this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(G), floor plan financing interest expense is taken into account for the taxable year by a trade or business that has had floor plan financing indebtedness only if the business interest expense, as defined in section 163(j)(5) and § 1.163(j)-1(b)(3), of the trade or business for the taxable year (which includes floor plan financing interest expense) exceeds the sum of the amounts calculated under section 163(j)(1)(A) and (B) for the trade or business for the taxable year. If the trade or business has taken floor plan financing interest expense into account pursuant to this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(G) for a taxable year, this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(G) applies to any property placed in service by that trade or business in that taxable year. This paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(G) does not apply to property that is leased to a lessee's trade or business that has had floor plan financing indebtedness, by a lessor's trade or business that has not had floor plan financing indebtedness during the taxable year or that has had floor plan financing indebtedness but did not take into account floor plan financing interest expense for the taxable year pursuant to this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(G).


(iii) *Examples.* The application of this paragraph (b)(2) is illustrated by the following examples. Unless the facts specifically indicate otherwise, assume that the parties are not related within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) and § 1.179-4(c), and are not described in section 163(j)(3):


(A) *Example 1.* On February 8, 2018, *A* finishes the production of a qualified film, as defined in § 1.181-3. On June 4, 2018, *B* acquires this finished production from *A.* The initial release or broadcast, as defined in § 1.181-1(a)(7), of this qualified film is on July 28, 2018. Because *B* acquired the qualified film before its initial release or broadcast, *B* is treated as the owner of the qualified film for purposes of section 181 and § 1.181-1(a)(2). Assuming all other requirements of this section are met and all requirements of section 181 and §§ 1.181-1 through 1.181-6, other than section 181(a)(2) and (g), and § 1.181-1(b)(1)(i) and (ii), and (b)(2)(i), are met, *B'*s acquisition cost of the qualified film qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(B) *Example 2.* The facts are the same as in *Example 1* of paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, except that *B* acquires a limited license or right to release the qualified film in Europe. As a result, *B* is not treated as the owner of the qualified film pursuant to § 1.181-1(a)(2). Accordingly, paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E) of this section is not satisfied, and *B'*s acquisition cost of the license or right does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction.


(C) *Example 3. C* owns a film library. All of the films in this film library are completed and have been released or broadcasted. In 2018, *D* buys this film library from *C*. Because *D* acquired the films after their initial release or broadcast, *D'*s acquisition cost of the film library does not qualify for a deduction under section 181. As a result, paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E) of this section is not satisfied, and *D'*s acquisition cost of the film library does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction.


(D) *Example 4.* During 2019, E Corporation, a domestic corporation, acquired new equipment for use in its manufacturing trade or business in Mexico. To determine its qualified business asset investment for purposes of section 250, E Corporation must determine the adjusted basis of the new equipment using the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) pursuant to sections 250(b)(2)(B) and 951A(d)(3). E Corporation also is required to depreciate the new equipment under the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) pursuant to section 168(g)(1)(A). As a result, the new equipment does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.


(E) *Example 5.* The facts are the same as in *Example 4* of paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(D) of this section, except E Corporation acquired the new equipment for use in its manufacturing trade or business in California. The new equipment is not described in section 168(g)(1)(A), (B), (C), (D), (F), or (G). No other provision of the Internal Revenue Code, other than section 250(b)(2)(B) or 951A(d)(3), requires the new equipment to be depreciated using the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g). To determine its qualified business asset investment for purposes of section 250, E Corporation must determine the adjusted basis of the new equipment using the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) pursuant to sections 250(b)(2)(B) and 951A(d)(3). Because E Corporation is not required to depreciate the new equipment under the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g), paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section does not apply to this new equipment. Assuming all other requirements are met, the new equipment qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(F) *Example 6.* In 2019, a financial institution buys new equipment for $1 million and then leases this equipment to a lessee that primarily uses the equipment in a trade or business described in section 163(j)(7)(A)(iv) and §§ 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i) and 1.163(j)-10(c)(3)(iii)(C)(*3*). The financial institution is not described in section 163(j)(7)(A)(iv) and §§ 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i) and § 1.163(j)-10(c)(3)(iii)(C)(*3*). As a result, paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(F) of this section does not apply to this new equipment. Assuming all other requirements are met, the financial institution's purchase price of $1 million for the new equipment qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(G) *Example 7.* During its taxable year beginning in 2020, *F,* a corporation that is an automobile dealer, buys new computers for $50,000 for use in its trade or business of selling automobiles. For purposes of section 163(j), *F* has the following for 2020: $700 of adjusted taxable income, $40 of business interest income, $400 of business interest expense (which includes $100 of floor plan financing interest expense). The sum of the amounts calculated under section 163(j)(1)(A) and (B) for *F* for 2020 is $390 ($40 + ($700 × 50 percent)). *F'*s business interest expense, which includes floor plan financing interest expense, for 2020 is $400. As a result, *F'*s floor plan financing interest expense is taken into account by *F* for 2020 pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(G) of this section. Accordingly, *F'*s purchase price of $50,000 for the computers does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(H) *Example 8.* The facts are the same as in *Example 7* in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(G) of this section, except *F* buys new computers for $30,000 for use in its trade or business of selling automobiles and, for purposes of section 163(j), *F* has $1,300 of adjusted taxable income. The sum of the amounts calculated under section 163(j)(1)(A) and (B) for *F* for 2020 is $690 ($40 + ($1,300 × 50 percent)). *F'*s business interest expense, which includes floor plan financing interest expense, for 2020 is $400. As a result, *F'*s floor plan financing interest expense is not taken into account by *F* for 2020 pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(G) of this section. Assuming all other requirements are met, *F'*s purchase price of $30,000 for the computers qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(I) *Example 9.* (*1*) *G,* a calendar-year taxpayer, owns an office building for use in its trade or business and *G* placed in service such building in 2000. In November 2018, *G* made and placed in service an improvement to the inside of such building at a cost of $100,000. In January 2019, *G* entered into a written contract with *H* for *H* to construct an improvement to the inside of the building. In March 2019, *H* completed construction of the improvement at a cost of $750,000 and *G* placed in service such improvement. Both improvements to the building are section 1250 property and are not described in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(5)(ii).


(*2*) Both the improvement to the office building made by *G* in November 2018 and the improvement to the office building that was constructed by *H* for *G* in 2019 are improvements made by *G* under § 1.168(b)-1(a)(5)(i)(A). Further, each improvement is made to the inside of the office building, is section 1250 property, and is not described in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(5)(ii). As a result, each improvement meets the definition of qualified improvement property in section 168(e)(6) and § 1.168(b)-1(a)(5)(i)(A) and (a)(5)(ii). Accordingly, each improvement is 15-year property under section 168(e)(3) and is described in § 1.168(k)-2(b)(2)(i)(A). Assuming all other requirements of this section are met, each improvement made by *G* qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for *G* under this section.


(3) *Original use or used property acquisition requirements*—(i) *In general.* Depreciable property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(3) if the property meets the original use requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section or if the property meets the used property acquisition requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section.


(ii) *Original use*—(A) *In general.* Depreciable property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) if the original use of the property commences with the taxpayer. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section, original use means the first use to which the property is put, whether or not that use corresponds to the use of the property by the taxpayer. Additional capital expenditures paid or incurred by a taxpayer to recondition or rebuild property acquired or owned by the taxpayer satisfy the original use requirement. However, the cost of reconditioned or rebuilt property does not satisfy the original use requirement (but may satisfy the used property acquisition requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section). The question of whether property is reconditioned or rebuilt property is a question of fact. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A), property that contains used parts will not be treated as reconditioned or rebuilt if the cost of the used parts is not more than 20 percent of the total cost of the property, whether acquired or self-constructed.


(B) *Conversion to business or income-producing use*—(*1*) *Personal use to business or income-producing use.* If a taxpayer initially acquires new property for personal use and subsequently uses the property in the taxpayer's trade or business or for the taxpayer's production of income, the taxpayer is considered the original user of the property. If a person initially acquires new property for personal use and a taxpayer subsequently acquires the property from the person for use in the taxpayer's trade or business or for the taxpayer's production of income, the taxpayer is not considered the original user of the property.


(*2*) *Inventory to business or income-producing use.* If a taxpayer initially acquires new property and holds the property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's business and subsequently withdraws the property from inventory and uses the property primarily in the taxpayer's trade or business or primarily for the taxpayer's production of income, the taxpayer is considered the original user of the property. If a person initially acquires new property and holds the property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the person's business and a taxpayer subsequently acquires the property from the person for use primarily in the taxpayer's trade or business or primarily for the taxpayer's production of income, the taxpayer is considered the original user of the property. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B)(*2*), the original use of the property by the taxpayer commences on the date on which the taxpayer uses the property primarily in the taxpayer's trade or business or primarily for the taxpayer's production of income.


(C) *Fractional interests in property.* If, in the ordinary course of its business, a taxpayer sells fractional interests in new property to third parties unrelated to the taxpayer, each first fractional owner of the property is considered as the original user of its proportionate share of the property. Furthermore, if the taxpayer uses the property before all of the fractional interests of the property are sold but the property continues to be held primarily for sale by the taxpayer, the original use of any fractional interest sold to a third party unrelated to the taxpayer subsequent to the taxpayer's use of the property begins with the first purchaser of that fractional interest. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C), persons are not related if they do not have a relationship described in section 267(b) and § 1.267(b)-1, or section 707(b) and § 1.707-1.


(iii) *Used property acquisition requirements*—(A) *In general.* Depreciable property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii) if the acquisition of the used property meets the following requirements:


(*1*) Such property was not used by the taxpayer or a predecessor at any time prior to such acquisition;


(*2*) The acquisition of such property meets the requirements of section 179(d)(2)(A), (B), and (C), and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv); or § 1.179-4(c)(2) (property is acquired by purchase); and


(*3*) The acquisition of such property meets the requirements of section 179(d)(3) and § 1.179-4(d) (cost of property) (for further guidance regarding like-kind exchanges and involuntary conversions, see paragraph (g)(5) of this section).


(B) *Property was not used by the taxpayer at any time prior to acquisition*—(*1*) *In general.* Solely for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*1*) of this section, the property is treated as used by the taxpayer or a predecessor at any time prior to acquisition by the taxpayer or predecessor if the taxpayer or the predecessor had a depreciable interest in the property at any time prior to such acquisition, whether or not the taxpayer or the predecessor claimed depreciation deductions for the property. To determine if the taxpayer or a predecessor had a depreciable interest in the property at any time prior to the acquisition, only the five calendar years immediately prior to the current calendar year in which the property is placed in service by the taxpayer, and the portion of such current calendar year before the placed-in-service date of the property without taking into account the applicable convention, are taken into account (lookback period). If either the taxpayer or a predecessor, or both, have not been in existence for the entire lookback period, only the portion of the lookback period during which the taxpayer or a predecessor, or both, as applicable, have been in existence is taken into account to determine if the taxpayer or a predecessor had a depreciable interest in the property at any time prior to the acquisition. If a lessee has a depreciable interest in the improvements made to leased property and subsequently the lessee acquires the leased property of which the improvements are a part, the unadjusted depreciable basis, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3), of the acquired property that is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction, assuming all other requirements are met, must not include the unadjusted depreciable basis attributable to the improvements.


(*2*) *Taxpayer has a depreciable interest in a portion of the property.* If a taxpayer initially acquires a depreciable interest in a portion of the property and subsequently acquires a depreciable interest in an additional portion of the same property, such additional depreciable interest is not treated as used by the taxpayer at any time prior to its acquisition by the taxpayer under paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*1*) and (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*1*) of this section. This paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*2*) does not apply if the taxpayer or a predecessor previously had a depreciable interest in the subsequently acquired additional portion. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*2*), a portion of the property is considered to be the percentage interest in the property. If a taxpayer holds a depreciable interest in a portion of the property, sells that portion or a part of that portion, and subsequently acquires a depreciable interest in another portion of the same property, the taxpayer will be treated as previously having a depreciable interest in the property up to the amount of the portion for which the taxpayer held a depreciable interest in the property before the sale.


(*3*) *Substantial renovation of property.* If a taxpayer acquires and places in service substantially renovated property and the taxpayer or a predecessor previously had a depreciable interest in the property before it was substantially renovated, the taxpayer's or predecessor's depreciable interest in the property before it was substantially renovated is not taken into account for determining whether the substantially renovated property was used by the taxpayer or a predecessor at any time prior to its acquisition by the taxpayer under paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*1*) and (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*1*) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*3*), property is substantially renovated if the cost of the used parts is not more than 20 percent of the total cost of the substantially renovated property, whether acquired or self-constructed.


(*4*) *De minimis use of property.* If a taxpayer acquires and places in service property, the taxpayer or a predecessor did not previously have a depreciable interest in the property, the taxpayer disposes of the property to an unrelated party within 90 calendar days after the date the property was originally placed in service by the taxpayer, without taking into account the applicable convention, and the taxpayer reacquires and again places in service the property, then the taxpayer's depreciable interest in the property during that 90-day period is not taken into account for determining whether the property was used by the taxpayer or a predecessor at any time prior to its reacquisition by the taxpayer under paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*1*) and (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*1*) of this section. If the taxpayer originally acquired the property before September 28, 2017, as determined under § 1.168(k)-1(b)(4), and the taxpayer reacquires and again places in service the property during the same taxable year the taxpayer disposed of the property to the unrelated party, then this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*4*) does not apply. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*4*), an *unrelated party* is a person not described in section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B), and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) or (iii) or (c)(2).

	


(C) *Special rules for a series of related transactions*—(*1*) *In general.* Solely for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, each transferee in a series of related transactions tests its relationship under section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) with the transferor from which the transferee directly acquires the depreciable property (immediate transferor) and with the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series. The transferee is treated as related to the immediate transferor or the original transferor if the relationship exists either when the transferee acquires, or immediately before the first transfer of, the depreciable property in the series. A series of related transactions may include, for example, a transfer of partnership assets followed by a transfer of an interest in the partnership that owned the assets; or a disposition of property and a disposition, directly or indirectly, of the transferor or transferee of the property. For special rules that may apply when the transferor and transferee of the property are members of a consolidated group, as defined in § 1.1502-1(h), see § 1.1502-68.


(*2*) *Special rules*—(*i*) *Property placed in service and disposed of in same taxable year or property not placed in service.* Any party in a series of related transactions that is neither the original transferor nor the ultimate transferee is disregarded (disregarded party) for purposes of testing the relationships under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(*1*) of this section if the party places in service and disposes of the depreciable property subject to the series, other than in a transaction described in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section, during the party's same taxable year, or if the party does not place in service the depreciable property subject to the series for use in the party's trade or business or production of income. In either case, the party to which the disregarded party disposed of the depreciable property tests its relationship with the party from which the disregarded party acquired the depreciable property and with the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series. If the series has consecutive disregarded parties, the party to which the last disregarded party disposed of the depreciable property tests its relationship with the party from which the first disregarded party acquired the depreciable property and with the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series. The rules for testing the relationships in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(*1*) of this section continue to apply for the other transactions in the series.


(*ii*) *All section 168(i)(7) transactions.* This paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C) does not apply if all transactions in a series of related transactions are described in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section (section 168(i)(7) transactions in which property is transferred in the same taxable year that the property is placed in service by the transferor).


(*iii*) *One or more section 168(i)(7) transactions.* Any step in a series of related transactions that is neither the original step nor the ultimate step is disregarded (disregarded step) for purposes of testing the relationships under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(*1*) of this section if the step is a transaction described in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section. In this case, the relationship is not tested between the transferor and transferee of that transaction. Instead, the relationship is tested between the transferor in the disregarded step and the party to which the transferee in the disregarded step disposed of the depreciable property, the transferee in the disregarded step and the party to which the transferee in the disregarded step disposed of the depreciable property, and the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series and the party to which the transferee in the disregarded step disposed of the depreciable property. If the series has consecutive disregarded steps, the relationship is tested between the transferor in the first disregarded step and the party to which the transferee in the last disregarded step disposed of the depreciable property, the transferee in the last disregarded step and the party to which the transferee in the last disregarded step disposed of the depreciable property, and the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series and the party to which the transferee in the last disregarded step disposed of the depreciable property. The rules for testing the relationships in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(*1*) of this section continue to apply for the other transactions in the series.


(*iv*) *Syndication transaction.* This paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C) does not apply to a syndication transaction described in paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section.


(*v*) *Certain relationships disregarded.* If a party acquires depreciable property in a series of related transactions in which the party acquires stock, meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2), of a corporation in a fully taxable transaction followed by a liquidation of the acquired corporation under section 331, any relationship created as part of such series of related transactions is disregarded in determining whether any party is related to such acquired corporation for purposes of testing the relationships under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(*1*) of this section.


(*vi*) *Transferors that cease to exist for Federal tax purposes.* Any transferor in a series of related transactions that ceases to exist for Federal tax purposes during the series is deemed, for purposes of testing the relationships under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(*1*) of this section, to be in existence at the time of any transfer in the series.


(*vii*) *Newly created party.* If a transferee in a series of related transactions acquires depreciable property from a transferor that was not in existence immediately prior to the first transfer of such property in such series (new transferor), the transferee tests its relationship with the party from which the new transferor acquired such property and with the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(*1*) of this section. If the series has consecutive new transferors, the party to which the last new transferor disposed of the depreciable property tests its relationship with the party from which the first new transferor acquired the depreciable property and with the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series. The rules for testing the relationships in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(*1*) of this section continue to apply for the other transactions in the series.


(*viii*) *Application of paragraph (g)(1) of this section.* Paragraph (g)(1) of this section applies to each step in a series of related transactions.


(iv) *Application to partnerships*—(A) *Section 704(c) remedial allocations.* Remedial allocations under section 704(c) do not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. See § 1.704-3(d)(2).


(B) *Basis determined under section 732.* Any basis of distributed property determined under section 732 does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.


(C) *Section 734(b) adjustments.* Any increase in basis of depreciable property under section 734(b) does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.


(D) *Section 743(b) adjustments*—(*1*) *In general.* For purposes of determining whether the transfer of a partnership interest meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, each partner is treated as having a depreciable interest in the partner's proportionate share of partnership property. Any increase in basis of depreciable property under section 743(b) satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section if—


(*i*) At any time prior to the transfer of the partnership interest that gave rise to such basis increase, neither the transferee partner nor a predecessor of the transferee partner had any depreciable interest in the portion of the property deemed acquired to which the section 743(b) adjustment is allocated under section 755 and § 1.755-1; and


(*ii*) The transfer of the partnership interest that gave rise to such basis increase satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*2*) and (*3*) of this section.


(*2*) *Relatedness tested at partner level.* Solely for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(D)(*1*)(*ii*) of this section, whether the parties are related or unrelated is determined by comparing the transferor and the transferee of the transferred partnership interest.


(v) *Application to members of a consolidated group.* For rules applicable to the acquisition of depreciable property by a member of a consolidated group, see § 1.1502-68.


(vi) *Syndication transaction.* If new property is acquired and placed in service by a lessor, or if used property is acquired and placed in service by a lessor and the lessor or a predecessor did not previously have a depreciable interest in the used property, and the property is sold by the lessor or any subsequent purchaser within three months after the date the property was originally placed in service by the lessor (or, in the case of multiple units of property subject to the same lease, within three months after the date the final unit is placed in service, so long as the period between the time the first unit is placed in service and the time the last unit is placed in service does not exceed 12 months), and the user of the property after the last sale during the three-month period remains the same as when the property was originally placed in service by the lessor, the purchaser of the property in the last sale during the three-month period is considered the taxpayer that acquired the property for purposes of applying paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section. The purchaser of the property in the last sale during the three-month period is treated, for purposes of applying paragraph (b)(3) of this section, as—


(A) The original user of the property in this transaction if the lessor acquired and placed in service new property; or


(B) The taxpayer having the depreciable interest in the property in this transaction if the lessor acquired and placed in service used property.


(vii) *Examples.* The application of this paragraph (b)(3) is illustrated by the following examples. Unless the facts specifically indicate otherwise, assume that the parties are not related within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) and § 1.179-4(c), no corporation is a member of a consolidated or controlled group, and the parties do not have predecessors:


(A) *Example 1.* (*1*) On August 1, 2018, *A* buys a new machine for $35,000 from an unrelated party for use in *A'*s trade or business. On July 1, 2020, *B* buys that machine from *A* for $20,000 for use in *B'*s trade or business. On October 1, 2020, *B* makes a $5,000 capital expenditure to recondition the machine. *B* did not have any depreciable interest in the machine before *B* acquired it on July 1, 2020.


(*2*) *A'*s purchase price of $35,000 satisfies the original use requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and, assuming all other requirements are met, qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(*3*) *B'*s purchase price of $20,000 does not satisfy the original use requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, but it does satisfy the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Assuming all other requirements are met, the $20,000 purchase price qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section. Further, *B'*s $5,000 expenditure satisfies the original use requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and, assuming all other requirements are met, qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, regardless of whether the $5,000 is added to the basis of the machine or is capitalized as a separate asset.


(B) *Example 2. C,* an automobile dealer, uses some of its automobiles as demonstrators in order to show them to prospective customers. The automobiles that are used as demonstrators by *C* are held by *C* primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its business. On November 1, 2017, *D* buys from *C* an automobile that was previously used as a demonstrator by *C. D* will use the automobile solely for business purposes. The use of the automobile by *C* as a demonstrator does not constitute a “use” for purposes of the original use requirement and, therefore, *D* will be considered the original user of the automobile for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. Assuming all other requirements are met, *D'*s purchase price of the automobile qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for *D* under this section, subject to any limitation under section 280F.


(C) *Example 3.* On April 1, 2015, *E* acquires a horse to be used in *E'*s thoroughbred racing business. On October 1, 2018, *F* buys the horse from *E* and will use the horse in *F'*s horse breeding business. *F* did not have any depreciable interest in the horse before *F* acquired it on October 1, 2018. The use of the horse by *E* in its racing business prevents *F* from satisfying the original use requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. However, *F'*s acquisition of the horse satisfies the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Assuming all other requirements are met, *F'*s purchase price of the horse qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for *F* under this section.


(D) *Example 4.* In the ordinary course of its business, *G* sells fractional interests in its aircraft to unrelated parties. *G* holds out for sale eight equal fractional interests in an aircraft. On October 1, 2017, *G* sells five of the eight fractional interests in the aircraft to *H* and *H* begins to use its proportionate share of the aircraft immediately upon purchase. On February 1, 2018, *G* sells to *I* the remaining unsold 
3/8 fractional interests in the aircraft. *H* is considered the original user as to its 
5/8 fractional interest in the aircraft and *I* is considered the original user as to its 
3/8 fractional interest in the aircraft. Thus, assuming all other requirements are met, *H'*s purchase price for its 
5/8 fractional interest in the aircraft qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section and *I'*s purchase price for its 
3/8 fractional interest in the aircraft qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(E) *Example 5.* On September 1, 2017, *J,* an equipment dealer, buys new tractors that are held by *J* primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its business. On October 15, 2017, *J* withdraws the tractors from inventory and begins to use the tractors primarily for producing rental income. The holding of the tractors by *J* as inventory does not constitute a “use” for purposes of the original use requirement and, therefore, the original use of the tractors commences with *J* on October 15, 2017, for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. However, the tractors are not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section because *J* acquired the tractors before September 28, 2017.


(F) *Example 6. K* is in the trade or business of leasing equipment to others. During 2016, *K* buys a new machine (Machine #1) and then leases it to *L* for use in *L'*s trade or business. The lease between *K* and *L* for Machine #1 is a true lease for Federal income tax purposes. During 2018, *L* enters into a written binding contract with *K* to buy Machine #1 at its fair market value on May 15, 2018. *L* did not have any depreciable interest in Machine #1 before *L* acquired it on May 15, 2018. As a result, *L'*s acquisition of Machine #1 satisfies the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Assuming all other requirements are met, *L'*s purchase price of Machine #1 qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for *L* under this section.


(G) *Example 7.* The facts are the same as in *Example 6* of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(F) of this section, except that *K* and *L* are related parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) and § 1.179-4(c). As a result, *L'*s acquisition of Machine #1 does not satisfy the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Thus, Machine #1 is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction for *L.*

(H) *Example 8.* The facts are the same as in *Example 6* of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(F) of this section, except *L* incurred capital expenditures of $5,000 to improve Machine #1 on September 5, 2017, and has a depreciable interest in such improvements. *L'*s purchase price of $5,000 for the improvements to Machine #1 satisfies the original use requirement of § 1.168(k)-1(b)(3)(i) and, assuming all other requirements are met, qualifies for the 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction. Because *L* had a depreciable interest only in the improvements to Machine #1, *L'*s acquisition of Machine #1, excluding *L'*s improvements to such machine, satisfies the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Assuming all other requirements are met, *L'*s unadjusted depreciable basis of Machine #1, excluding the amount of such unadjusted depreciable basis attributable to *L'*s improvements to Machine #1, qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for *L* under this section.


(I) *Example 9.* During 2016, *M* and *N* purchased used equipment for use in their trades or businesses and each own a 50 percent interest in such equipment. Prior to this acquisition, *M* and *N* did not have any depreciable interest in the equipment. Assume this ownership arrangement is not a partnership. During 2018, *N* enters into a written binding contract with *M* to buy *M'*s interest in the equipment. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*2*) of this section, *N* is not treated as using *M'*s interest in the equipment prior to *N'*s acquisition of *M'*s interest. As a result, *N'*s acquisition of *M'*s interest in the equipment satisfies the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Assuming all other requirements are met, *N'*s purchase price of *M'*s interest in the equipment qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for *N* under this section.


(J) *Example 10.* The facts are the same as in *Example 9* of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(I) of this section, except *N* had a 100-percent depreciable interest in the equipment during 2011 through 2015, and *M* purchased from *N* a 50-percent interest in the equipment during 2016. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*1*) of this section, the lookback period is 2013 through 2017 to determine if *N* had a depreciable interest in *M'*s 50-percent interest in the equipment *N* acquired from *M* in 2018. Because *N* had a 100-percent depreciable interest in the equipment during 2013 through 2015, *N* had a depreciable interest in *M'*s 50-percent interest in the equipment during the lookback period. As a result, *N'*s acquisition of *M'*s interest in the equipment during 2018 does not satisfy the used property acquisition requirements of paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*1*) and (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*1*) of this section. Paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*2*) of this section does not apply because *N* initially acquired a 100-percent depreciable interest in the equipment. Accordingly, *N'*s purchase price of *M'*s interest in the equipment during 2018 does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction for *N.*

(K) *Example 11.* The facts are the same as in *Example 9* of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(I) of this section, except *N* had a 100-percent depreciable interest in the equipment only during 2011, and *M* purchased from *N* a 50-percent interest in the equipment during 2012. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*1*) of this section, the lookback period is 2013 through 2017 to determine if *N* had a depreciable interest in *M'*s 50-percent interest in the equipment *N* acquired from *M* in 2018. Because *N* had a depreciable interest in only its 50-percent interest in the equipment during this lookback period, *N'*s acquisition of *M'*s interest in the equipment during 2018 satisfies the used property acquisition requirements of paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*1*) and (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*1*) of this section. Assuming all other requirements are met, *N'*s purchase price of *M'*s interest in the equipment during 2018 qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for *N* under this section.


(L) *Example 12.* The facts are the same as in *Example 9* of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(I) of this section, except during 2018, *M* also enters into a written binding contract with *N* to buy *N'*s interest in the equipment. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*2*) of this section, both *M* and *N* are treated as previously having a depreciable interest in a 50-percent portion of the equipment. Accordingly, the acquisition by *M* of *N'*s 50-percent interest and the acquisition by *N* of *M'*s 50-percent interest in the equipment during 2018 do not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction.


(M) *Example 13. O* and *P* form an equal partnership, *OP,* in 2018. *O* contributes cash to *OP,* and *P* contributes equipment to *OP. OP'*s basis in the equipment contributed by *P* is determined under section 723. Because *OP'*s basis in such equipment is determined in whole or in part by reference to *P'*s adjusted basis in such equipment, *OP'*s acquisition of such equipment does not satisfy section 179(d)(2)(C) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iv) and, thus, does not satisfy the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Accordingly, *OP'*s acquisition of such equipment is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction.


(N) *Example 14. Q,**R,* and *S* form an equal partnership, *QRS,* in 2019. Each partner contributes $100, which *QRS* uses to purchase a retail motor fuels outlet for $300. Assume this retail motor fuels outlet is *QRS'* only property and is qualified property under section 168(k)(2)(A)(i). *QRS* makes an election not to deduct the additional first year depreciation for all qualified property placed in service during 2019. *QRS* has a section 754 election in effect. *QRS* claimed depreciation of $15 for the retail motor fuels outlet for 2019. During 2020, when the retail motor fuels outlet's fair market value is $600, *Q* sells all of its partnership interest to *T* in a fully taxable transaction for $200. *T* never previously had a depreciable interest in the retail motor fuels outlet. *T* takes an outside basis of $200 in the partnership interest previously owned by *Q. T'*s share of the partnership's previously taxed capital is $95. Accordingly, *T'*s section 743(b) adjustment is $105 and is allocated entirely to the retail motor fuels outlet under section 755. Assuming all other requirements are met, *T'*s section 743(b) adjustment qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(O) *Example 15.* The facts are the same as in *Example 14* of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(N) of this section, except that *Q* sells his partnership interest to *U,* a related person within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) and § 1.179-4(c). *U'*s section 743(b) adjustment does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction.


(P) *Example 16.* The facts are the same as in *Example 14* of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(N) of this section, except that *Q* dies and his partnership interest is transferred to *V. V* takes a basis in *Q'*s partnership interest under section 1014. As a result, section 179(d)(2)(C)(ii) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iv) are not satisfied, and *V'*s section 743(b) adjustment does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction.


(Q) *Example 17.* The facts are the same as in *Example 14* of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(N) of this section, except that *QRS* purchased the retail motor fuels outlet from *T* prior to *T* purchasing *Q'*s partnership interest in *QRS. T* had a depreciable interest in such retail motor fuels outlet. Because *T* had a depreciable interest in the retail motor fuels outlet before *T* acquired its interest in *QRS, T'*s section 743(b) adjustment does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction.


(R) *Example 18.* (*1*) *W,* a freight transportation company, acquires and places in service a used aircraft during 2019 (Airplane #1). Prior to this acquisition, *W* never had a depreciable interest in this aircraft. During September 2020, *W* enters into a written binding contract with a third party to renovate Airplane #1. The third party begins to renovate Airplane #1 in October 2020 and delivers the renovated aircraft (Airplane #2) to *W* in February 2021. To renovate Airplane #1, the third party used mostly new parts but also used parts from Airplane #1. The cost of the used parts is not more than 20 percent of the total cost of the renovated airplane, Airplane #2. *W* uses Airplane #2 in its trade or business.


(*2*) Although Airplane #2 contains used parts, the cost of the used parts is not more than 20 percent of the total cost of Airplane #2. As a result, Airplane #2 is not treated as reconditioned or rebuilt property, and *W* is considered the original user of Airplane #2, pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements are met, the amount paid or incurred by *W* for Airplane #2 qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for *W* under this section.


(S) *Example 19.* (*1*) *X,* a freight transportation company, acquires and places in service a new aircraft in 2019 (Airplane #1). During 2022, *X* sells Airplane #1 to *AB* and *AB* uses Airplane #1 in its trade or business. Prior to this acquisition, *AB* never had a depreciable interest in Airplane #1. During January 2023, *AB* enters into a written binding contract with a third party to renovate Airplane #1. The third party begins to renovate Airplane #1 in February 2023 and delivers the renovated aircraft (Airplane #2) to *AB* in June 2023. To renovate Airplane #1, the third party used mostly new parts but also used parts from Airplane #1. The cost of the used parts is not more than 20 percent of the total cost of the renovated airplane, Airplane #2. *AB* uses Airplane #2 in its trade or business. During 2025, *AB* sells Airplane #2 to *X* and *X* uses Airplane #2 in its trade or business.


(*2*) With respect to *X'*s purchase of Airplane #1 in 2019, *X* is the original user of this airplane pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements are met, *X'*s purchase price for Airplane #1 qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for *X* under this section.


(*3*) Because *AB* never had a depreciable interest in Airplane #1 prior to its acquisition in 2022, the requirements of paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*1*) and (b)(3)(ii)(B)(*1*) of this section are satisfied. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements are met, *AB'*s purchase price for Airplane #1 qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for *AB* under this section.


(*4*) Although Airplane #2 contains used parts, the cost of the used parts is not more than 20 percent of the total cost of Airplane #2. As a result, Airplane #2 is not treated as reconditioned or rebuilt property, and *AB* is considered the original user of Airplane #2, pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements are met, the amount paid or incurred by *AB* for Airplane #2 qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for *AB* under this section.


(*5*) With respect to *X'*s purchase of Airplane #2 in 2025, Airplane #2 is substantially renovated property pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*3*) of this section. Also, pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*3*) of this section, *X'*s depreciable interest in Airplane #1 is not taken into account for determining if *X* previously had a depreciable interest in Airplane #2 prior to its acquisition during 2025. As a result, Airplane #2 is not treated as used by *X* at any time before its acquisition of Airplane #2 in 2025 pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*3*) of this section. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements are met, *X'*s purchase price of Airplane #2 qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for *X* under this section.


(T) *Example 20.* In November 2017, AA Corporation purchases a used drill press costing $10,000 and is granted a trade-in allowance of $2,000 on its old drill press. The used drill press is qualified property under section 168(k)(2)(A)(i). The old drill press had a basis of $1,200. Under sections 1012 and 1031(d), the basis of the used drill press is $9,200 ($1,200 basis of old drill press plus cash expended of $8,000). Only $8,000 of the basis of the used drill press satisfies the requirements of section 179(d)(3) and § 1.179-4(d) and, thus, satisfies the used property acquisition requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. The remaining $1,200 of the basis of the used drill press does not satisfy the requirements of section 179(d)(3) and § 1.179-4(d) because it is determined by reference to the old drill press. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements are met, only $8,000 of the basis of the used drill press is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(U) *Example 21.* (*1*) M Corporation acquires and places in service a used airplane on March 26, 2018. Prior to this acquisition, M Corporation never had a depreciable interest in this airplane. On March 26, 2018, M Corporation also leases the used airplane to N Corporation, an airline company. On May 27, 2018, M Corporation sells to O Corporation the used airplane subject to the lease with N Corporation. M Corporation and O Corporation are related parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) and § 1.179-4(c). As of May 27, 2018, N Corporation is still the lessee of the used airplane. Prior to this acquisition, O Corporation never had a depreciable interest in the used airplane. O Corporation is a calendar-year taxpayer.


(*2*) The sale transaction of May 27, 2018, satisfies the requirements of a syndication transaction described in paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section. As a result, O Corporation is considered the taxpayer that acquired the used airplane for purposes of applying the used property acquisition requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. In applying these rules, the fact that M Corporation and O Corporation are related parties is not taken into account because O Corporation, not M Corporation, is treated as acquiring the used airplane. Also, O Corporation, not M Corporation, is treated as having the depreciable interest in the used airplane. Further, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section, the used airplane is treated as originally placed in service by O Corporation on May 27, 2018. Because O Corporation never had a depreciable interest in the used airplane and assuming all other requirements are met, O Corporation's purchase price of the used airplane qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for O Corporation under this section.


(V) *Example 22.* (*1*) The facts are the same as in *Example 21* of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(U)(*1*) of this section. Additionally, on September 5, 2018, O Corporation sells to P Corporation the used airplane subject to the lease with N Corporation. Prior to this acquisition, P Corporation never had a depreciable interest in the used airplane.


(*2*) Because O Corporation, a calendar-year taxpayer, placed in service and disposed of the used airplane during 2018, the used airplane is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction for O Corporation pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section.


(*3*) Because P Corporation never had a depreciable interest in the used airplane and assuming all other requirements are met, P Corporation's purchase price of the used airplane qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for P Corporation under this section.


(W) *Example 23.* (*1*) The facts are the same as in *Example 21* of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(U)(*1*) of this section, except M Corporation and O Corporation are not related parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) and § 1.179-4(c). Additionally, on March 26, 2020, O Corporation sells to M Corporation the used airplane subject to the lease with N Corporation.


(*2*) The sale transaction of May 27, 2018, satisfies the requirements of a syndication transaction described in paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section. As a result, O Corporation is considered the taxpayer that acquired the used airplane for purposes of applying the used property acquisition requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Also, O Corporation, not M Corporation, is treated as having the depreciable interest in the used airplane. Further, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section, the used airplane is treated as originally placed in service by O Corporation on May 27, 2018. Because O Corporation never had a depreciable interest in the used airplane before its acquisition in 2018 and assuming all other requirements are met, O Corporation's purchase price of the used airplane qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for O Corporation under this section.


(*3*) Prior to its acquisition of the used airplane on March 26, 2020, M Corporation never had a depreciable interest in the used airplane pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section. Assuming all other requirements are met, M Corporation's purchase price of the used airplane on March 26, 2020, qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for M Corporation under this section.


(X) *Example 24.* (*1*) J, K, and L are corporations that are unrelated parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) and § 1.179-4(c). None of J, K, or L is a member of a consolidated group. J has a depreciable interest in Equipment #5. During 2018, J sells Equipment #5 to K. During 2020, J merges into L in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(A). In 2021, L acquires Equipment #5 from K.


(*2*) Because J is the predecessor of L, and because J previously had a depreciable interest in Equipment #5, L's acquisition of Equipment #5 does not satisfy paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*1*) and (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*1*) of this section. Thus, L's acquisition of Equipment #5 does not satisfy the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Accordingly, L's acquisition of Equipment #5 is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction.


(Y) *Example 25.* (*1*) *JL* is a fiscal year taxpayer with a taxable year ending June 30. On April 22, 2020, *JL* acquires and places in service a new machine for use in its trade or business. On May 1, 2022, *JL* sells this machine to *JM,* an unrelated party, for use in *JM*'s trade or business. *JM* is a fiscal year taxpayer with a taxable year ending March 31. On February 1, 2023, *JL* buys the machine from *JM* and places the machine in service. *JL* uses the machine in its trade or business for the remainder of its taxable year ending June 30, 2023.


(*2*) *JL*'s acquisition of the machine on April 22, 2020, satisfies the original use requirement in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. Assuming all other requirements are met, *JL*'s purchase price of the machine qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for *JL* for the taxable year ending June 30, 2020, under this section.


(*3*) *JM* placed in service the machine on May 1, 2022, and disposed of it on February 1, 2023. As a result, *JM* placed in service and disposed of the machine during the same taxable year (*JM*'s taxable year beginning April 1, 2022, and ending March 31, 2023). Accordingly, *JM*'s acquisition of the machine on May 1, 2022, does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section.


(*4*) Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*1*) of this section, the lookback period is calendar years 2018 through 2022 and January 1, 2023, through January 31, 2023, to determine if *JL* had a depreciable interest in the machine when *JL* reacquired it on February 1, 2023. As a result, *JL*'s depreciable interest in the machine during the period April 22, 2020, to April 30, 2022, is taken into account for determining whether the machine was used by *JL* or a predecessor at any time prior to its reacquisition by *JL* on February 1, 2023. Accordingly, the reacquisition of the machine by *JL* on February 1, 2023, does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction.


(Z) *Example 26.* (*1*) *EF* has owned and had a depreciable interest in Property since 2012. On January 1, 2016, *EF* contributes assets (not including Property) to existing *Partnership T* in a transaction described in section 721, in exchange for a partnership interest in *Partnership T,* and *Partnership T* placed in service these assets for use in its trade or business. On July 1, 2016, *EF* sells Property to *EG,* a party unrelated to either *EF* or *Partnership T.* On April 1, 2018, *Partnership T* buys Property from *EG* and places it in service for use in its trade or business.


(*2*) *EF* is not *Partnership T*'s predecessor with respect to Property within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*1*) of this section, the lookback period is 2013-2017, plus January through March 2018, to determine if *Partnership T* had a depreciable interest in Property that *Partnership T* acquired on April 1, 2018. *EF* need not be examined in the lookback period to see if *EF* had a depreciable interest in Property, because *EF* is not *Partnership T*'s predecessor. Because *Partnership T* did not have a depreciable interest in Property in the lookback period prior to its acquisition of Property on April 1, 2018, *Partnership T*'s acquisition of Property on April 1, 2018, satisfies the used property acquisition requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*1*) of this section. Assuming all other requirements of this section are satisfied, *Partnership T*'s purchase price of Property qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(AA) *Example 27.* (*1*) The facts are the same as in *Example 26* of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(Z)(*1*) of this section, except that on January 1, 2016, *EF*'s contribution of assets to *Partnership T* includes Property. On July 1, 2016, *Partnership T* sells Property to *EG.*

(*2*) *Partnership T*'s acquisition of Property on January 1, 2016, does not satisfy the original use requirement of § 1.168(k)-1(b)(3) and is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under section 168(k) as in effect prior to the enactment of the Act.


(*3*) With respect to *Partnership T*'s acquisition of Property on April 1, 2018, *EF* is *Partnership T*'s predecessor with respect to Property within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*1*) of this section, the lookback period is 2013-2017, plus January through March 2018, to determine if *EF* or *Partnership T* had a depreciable interest in Property that *Partnership T* acquired on April 1, 2018. Because *EF* had a depreciable interest in Property from 2013 to 2015 and *Partnership T* had a depreciable interest in Property from January through June 2016, *Partnership T*'s acquisition of Property on April 1, 2018, does not satisfy the used property acquisition requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*1*) of this section and is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction.


(BB) *Example 28.* (*1*) X Corporation has owned and had a depreciable interest in Property since 2012. On January 1, 2015, X Corporation sold Property to *Q,* an unrelated party. Y Corporation is formed July 1, 2015. On January 1, 2016, Y Corporation merges into X Corporation in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(A). On April 1, 2018, X Corporation buys Property from *Q* and places it in service for use in its trade or business.


(*2*) Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, Y Corporation is X Corporation's predecessor. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*1*) of this section, the lookback period is 2013-2017, plus January through March 2018, to determine if Y Corporation or X Corporation had a depreciable interest in Property that X Corporation acquired on April 1, 2018. Y Corporation did not have a depreciable interest in Property at any time during the lookback period. Because X Corporation had a depreciable interest in Property from 2013 through 2014, X Corporation's acquisition of Property on April 1, 2018, does not satisfy the used property acquisition requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*1*) of this section and is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction.


(CC) *Example 29.* (*1*) Y Corporation has owned and had a depreciable interest in Property since 2012. On January 1, 2015, Y Corporation sells Property to *Q,* an unrelated party. X Corporation is formed on July 1, 2015. On January 1, 2016, Y Corporation merges into X Corporation in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(A). On April 1, 2018, X Corporation buys Property from *Q* and places it in service for use in its trade or business.


(*2*) Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, Y Corporation is X Corporation's predecessor. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*1*) of this section, the lookback period is 2013-2017, plus January through March 2018, to determine if X Corporation or Y Corporation had a depreciable interest in Property that X Corporation acquired on April 1, 2018. Because Y Corporation had a depreciable interest in Property from 2013 through 2014, X Corporation's acquisition of Property on April 1, 2018, does not satisfy the used property acquisition requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*1*) of this section and is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction.


(DD) *Example 30.* (*1*) On September 5, 2017, *Y,* a calendar-year taxpayer, acquires and places in service a new machine (Machine #1), and begins using Machine #1 in its manufacturing trade or business. On November 1, 2017, *Y* sells Machine #1 to *Z,* then *Z* leases Machine #1 back to *Y* for 4 years, and *Y* continues to use Machine #1 in its manufacturing trade or business. The lease agreement contains a purchase option provision allowing *Y* to buy Machine #1 at the end of the lease term. On November 1, 2021, *Y* exercises the purchase option in the lease agreement and buys Machine #1 from *Z.* The lease between *Y* and *Z* for Machine #1 is a true lease for Federal tax purposes.


(*2*) Because *Y,* a calendar-year taxpayer, placed in service and disposed of Machine #1 during 2017, Machine #1 is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction for *Y* pursuant to § 1.168(k)-1(f)(1)(i).


(*3*) The use of Machine #1 by *Y* prevents *Z* from satisfying the original use requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. However, *Z*'s acquisition of Machine #1 satisfies the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Assuming all other requirements are met, *Z*'s purchase price of Machine #1 qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for *Z* under this section.


(*4*) During 2017, *Y* sold Machine #1 within 90 calendar days of placing Machine #1 in service originally on September 5, 2017. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*4*) of this section, *Y*'s depreciable interest in Machine #1 during that 90-day period is not taken into account for determining whether Machine #1 was used by *Y* or a predecessor at any time prior to its reacquisition by *Y* on November 1, 2021. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements are met, *Y*'s purchase price of Machine #1 on November 1, 2021, qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for *Y* under this section.


(EE) *Example 31.* (*1*) On October 15, 2019, *FA,* a calendar-year taxpayer, buys and places in service a new machine for use in its trade or business. On January 10, 2020, *FA* sells this machine to *FB* for use in *FB*'s trade or business. *FB* is a calendar-year taxpayer and is not related to *FA.* On March 30, 2020, *FA* buys the machine from *FB* and places the machine in service. *FA* uses the machine in its trade or business for the remainder of 2020.


(*2*) *FA*'s acquisition of the machine on October 15, 2019, satisfies the original use requirement in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. Assuming all other requirements are met, *FA*'s purchase price of the machine qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for *FA* for the 2019 taxable year under this section.


(*3*) Because *FB* placed in service the machine on January 10, 2020, and disposed of it on March 30, 2020, *FB*'s acquisition of the machine on January 10, 2020, does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction pursuant to § 1.168(k)-2(g)(1)(i).


(*4*) *FA* sold the machine to *FB* in 2020 and within 90 calendar days of placing the machine in service originally on October 15, 2019. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*4*) of this section, *FA*'s depreciable interest in the machine during that 90-day period is not taken into account for determining whether the machine was used by *FA* or a predecessor at any time prior to its reacquisition by *FA* on March 30, 2020. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements are met, *FA*'s purchase price of the machine on March 30, 2020, qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for *FA* for the 2020 taxable year under this section.


(FF) *Example 32.* (*1*) The facts are the same as in *Example 31* of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(EE)(*1*) of this section, except that on November 1, 2020, *FB* buys the machine from *FA* and places the machine in service. *FB* uses the machine in its trade or business for the remainder of 2020.


(*2*) Because *FA* placed in service the machine on March 30, 2020, and disposed of it on November 1, 2020, *FA*'s reacquisition of the machine on March 30, 2020, does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section.


(*3*) During 2020, *FB* sold the machine to *FA* within 90 calendar days of placing the machine in service originally on January 10, 2020. After *FB* reacquired the machine on November 1, 2020, *FB* did not dispose of the property during the remainder of 2020. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*4*) of this section, *FB*'s depreciable interest in the machine during that 90-day period is not taken into account for determining whether the machine was used by *FB* or a predecessor at any time prior to its reacquisition by *FB* on November 1, 2020. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements are met, *FB*'s purchase price of the machine on November 1, 2020, qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction for *FB* under this section.


(GG) *Example 33.* (*1*) The facts are the same as in *Example 32* of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(FF)(*1*) of this section, except *FB* sells the machine to *FC,* an unrelated party, on December 31, 2020.


(*2*) Because *FB* placed in service the machine on November 1, 2020, and disposed of it on December 31, 2020, *FB*'s reacquisition of the machine on November 1, 2020, does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section.


(*3*) *FC*'s acquisition of the machine on December 31, 2020, satisfies the used property acquisition requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*2*) of this section. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements of this section are satisfied, *FC*'s purchase price of the machine qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(HH) *Example 34.* (*1*) In August 2017, *FD,* a calendar-year taxpayer, entered into a written binding contract with *X* for *X* to manufacture a machine for *FD* for use in its trade or business. Before September 28, 2017, *FD* incurred more than 10 percent of the total cost of the machine. On February 8, 2020, *X* delivered the machine to *FD* and *FD* placed in service the machine. The machine is property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act. *FD*'s entire unadjusted depreciable basis of the machine is attributable to the machine's manufacture before January 1, 2020. *FD* uses the safe harbor test in § 1.168(k)-1(b)(4)(iii)(B)(*2*) to determine when manufacturing of the machine began. On March 26, 2020, *FD* sells the machine to *FE* for use in *FE*'s trade or business. *FE* is a calendar-year taxpayer and is not related to *FD.* On November 7, 2020, *FD* buys the machine from *FE* and places in service the machine. *FD* uses the machine in its trade or business for the remainder of 2020.


(*2*) Because *FD* incurred more than 10 percent of the cost of the machine before September 28, 2017, and *FD* uses the safe harbor test in § 1.168(k)-1(b)(4)(iii)(B)(*2*) to determine when the manufacturing of the machine began, *FD* acquired the machine before September 28, 2017. If *FD* had not disposed of the machine on March 26, 2020, the cost of the machine would have qualified for the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction pursuant to section 168(k)(8), assuming all requirements are met under section 168(k)(2) as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act. However, because *FD* placed in service the machine on February 8, 2020, and disposed of it on March 26, 2020, FD's acquisition of the machine on February 8, 2020, does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction pursuant to § 1.168(k)-1(f)(1)(i).


(*3*) Because *FE* placed in service the machine on March 26, 2020, and disposed of it on November 7, 2020, *FE*'s acquisition of the machine on March 26, 2020, does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section.


(*4*) During 2020, *FD* sold the machine to *FE* within 90 calendar days of placing the machine in service originally on February 8, 2020. After *FD* reacquired the machine on November 7, 2020, *FD* did not dispose of the machine during the remainder of 2020. *FD* originally acquired this machine before September 28, 2017. As a result, paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*4*) of this section does not apply. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*1*) of this section, the lookback period is 2015 through 2019 and January 1, 2020, through November 6, 2020, to determine if *FD* had a depreciable interest in the machine when *FD* reacquired it on November 7, 2020. As a result, *FD*'s depreciable interest in the machine during the period February 8, 2020, to March 26, 2020, is taken into account for determining whether the machine was used by *FD* or a predecessor at any time prior to its reacquisition by *FD* on November 7, 2020. Accordingly, the reacquisition of the machine by *FD* on November 7, 2020, does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction.


(II) *Example 35.* (*1*) In a series of related transactions, a father sells a machine to an unrelated individual on December 15, 2019, who sells the machine to the father's daughter on January 2, 2020, for use in the daughter's trade or business. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(*1*) of this section, a transferee tests its relationship with the transferor from which the transferee directly acquires the depreciable property, and with the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series. The relationship is tested when the transferee acquires, and immediately before the first transfer of, the depreciable property in the series. As a result, the following relationships are tested under section 179(d)(2)(A): The unrelated individual tests its relationship to the father as of December 15, 2019; and the daughter tests her relationship to the unrelated individual as of January 2, 2020, and December 15, 2019, and to the father as of January 2, 2020, and December 15, 2019.


(*2*) Because the individual is not related to the father within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) as of December 15, 2019, the individual's acquisition of the machine satisfies the used property acquisition requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*2*) of this section. Accordingly, assuming the unrelated individual placed the machine in service for use in its trade or business in 2019 and all other requirements of this section are satisfied, the unrelated individual's purchase price of the machine qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(*3*) The individual and the daughter are not related parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) as of January 2, 2020, or December 15, 2019. However, the father and his daughter are related parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) as of January 2, 2020, or December 15, 2019. Accordingly, the daughter's acquisition of the machine does not satisfy the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction.


(JJ) *Example 36.* (*1*) The facts are the same as in *Example 35* of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(II)(*1*) of this section, except that instead of selling to an unrelated individual, the father sells the machine to his son on December 15, 2019, who sells the machine to his sister (the father's daughter) on January 2, 2020. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(*1*) of this section, a transferee tests its relationship with the transferor from which the transferee directly acquires the depreciable property, and with the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series. The relationship is tested when the transferee acquires, and immediately before the first transfer of, the depreciable property in the series. As a result, the following relationships are tested under section 179(d)(2)(A): The son tests his relationship to the father as of December 15, 2019; and the daughter tests her relationship to her brother as of January 2, 2020, and December 15, 2019, and to the father as of January 2, 2020, and December 15, 2019.


(*2*) Because the father and his son are related parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) as of December 15, 2019, the son's acquisition of the machine does not satisfy the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Accordingly, the son's acquisition of the machine is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction.


(*3*) The son and his sister are not related parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) as of January 2, 2020, or December 15, 2019. However, the father and his daughter are related parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) as of January 2, 2020, or December 15, 2019. Accordingly, the daughter's acquisition of the machine does not satisfy the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction.


(KK) *Example 37.* (*1*) In June 2018, *BA,* an individual, bought and placed in service a new machine from an unrelated party for use in its trade or business. In a series of related transactions, *BA* sells the machine to *BB* and *BB* places it in service on October 1, 2019, *BB* sells the machine to *BC* and *BC* places it in service on December 1, 2019, and *BC* sells the machine to *BD* and *BD* places it in service on January 2, 2020. *BA* and *BB* are related parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii). *BB* and *BC* are related parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iii). *BC* and *BD* are not related parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii), or section 179(d)(2)(B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iii). *BA* is not related to *BC* or to *BD* within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii). All parties are calendar-year taxpayers.


(*2*) *BA*'s purchase of the machine in June 2018 satisfies the original use requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and, assuming all other requirements of this section are met, *BA*'s purchase price of the machine qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(*3*) Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(*1*) of this section, a transferee tests its relationship with the transferor from which the transferee directly acquires the depreciable property, and with the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series. The relationship is tested when the transferee acquires, and immediately before the first transfer of, the depreciable property in the series. However, because *BB* placed in service and disposed of the machine in the same taxable year, *BB* is disregarded pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(*2*)(*i*) of this section. As a result, the following relationships are tested under section 179(d)(2)(A) and (B): *BC* tests its relationship to *BA* as of December 1, 2019, and October 1, 2019; and *BD* tests its relationship to *BC* as of January 2, 2020, and October 1, 2019, and to *BA* as of January 2, 2020, and October 1, 2020.


(*4*) Because *BA* is not related to *BC* within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) as of December 1, 2019, or October 1, 2019, *BC*'s acquisition of the machine satisfies the used property acquisition requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*2*) of this section. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements of this section are satisfied, *BC*'s purchase price of the machine qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(*5*) Because *BC* is not related to *BD* and *BA* is not related to *BD* within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii), or section 179(d)(2)(B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iii) as of January 2, 2020, or October 1, 2019, *BD*'s acquisition of the machine satisfies the used property acquisition requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*2*) of this section. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements of this section are satisfied, *BD*'s purchase price of the machine qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(LL) *Example 38.* (*1*) In June 2018, *CA,* an individual, bought and placed in service a new machine from an unrelated party for use in his trade or business. In a series of related transactions, *CA* sells the machine to *CB* and *CB* places it in service on September 1, 2019, *CB* transfers the machine to *CC* in a transaction described in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section and *CC* places it in service on November 1, 2019, and *CC* sells the machine to *CD* and *CD* places it in service on January 2, 2020. *CA* and *CB* are not related parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii). *CB* and *CC* are related parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iii). *CB* and *CD* are related parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii), or section 179(d)(2)(B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iii). *CC* and *CD* are not related parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii), or section 179(d)(2)(B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iii). *CA* is not related to *CC* or to *CD* within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii). All parties are calendar-year taxpayers.


(*2*) *CA*'s purchase of the machine in June 2018 satisfies the original use requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and, assuming all other requirements of this section are met, *CA*'s purchase price of the machine qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(*3*) Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(*1*) of this section, a transferee tests its relationship with the transferor from which the transferee directly acquires the depreciable property, and with the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series. The relationship is tested when the transferee acquires, and immediately before the first transfer of, the depreciable property in the series. However, because *CB* placed in service and transferred the machine in the same taxable year in a transaction described in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section, the section 168(i)(7) transaction between *CB* and *CC* is disregarded pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(*2*)(*iii*) of this section. As a result, the following relationships are tested under section 179(d)(2)(A) and (B): *CB* tests its relationship to *CA* as of September 1, 2019; and *CD* tests its relationship to *CB, CC,* and *CA* as of January 2, 2020, and September 1, 2019.


(*4*) Because *CA* is not related to *CB* within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) as of September 1, 2019, *CB*'s acquisition of the machine satisfies the used property acquisition requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*2*) of this section. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements of this section are satisfied, *CB*'s purchase price of the machine qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section. Pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section, *CB* is allocated 2/12 of its 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction for the machine, and *CC* is allocated the remaining portion of *CB*'s 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction for the machine.


(*5*) *CC* is not related to *CD* and *CA* is not related to *CD* within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii), or section 179(d)(2)(B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iii) as of January 2, 2020, or September 1, 2019. However, *CB* and *CD* are related parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii), or section 179(d)(2)(B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iii) as of January 2, 2020, or September 1, 2019. Accordingly, *CD*'s acquisition of the machine does not satisfy the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction.


(MM) *Example 39.* (*1*) In a series of related transactions, on January 2, 2018, *DA,* a corporation, bought and placed in service a new machine from an unrelated party for use in its trade or business. As part of the same series, *DB* purchases 100 percent of the stock of *DA* on January 2, 2019, and such stock acquisition meets the requirements of section 1504(a)(2). *DB* and *DA* were not related prior to the acquisition within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) or section 179(d)(2)(B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iii). Immediately after acquiring the *DA* stock, and *DB* liquidates *DA* under section 331. In the liquidating distribution, *DB* receives the machine that was acquired by *DA* on January 2, 2018. As part of the same series, on March 1, 2020, *DB* sells the machine to *DC* and *DC* places it in service. Throughout the series, *DC* is not related to *DB* or *DA* within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) or section 179(d)(2)(B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iii).


(*2*) *DA*'s purchase of the machine on January 2, 2018, satisfies the original use requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and, assuming all other requirements of this section are met, *DA*'s purchase price of the machine qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(*3*) Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(*1*) of this section, a transferee tests its relationship with the transferor from which the transferee directly acquires the depreciable property, and with the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series. The relationship is tested when the transferee acquires, and immediately before the first transfer of, the depreciable property in the series. Although *DA* is no longer in existence as of the date *DC* acquires the machine, pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(*2*)(*vi*) of this section, *DA* is deemed to be in existence at the time of each transfer for purposes of testing relationships under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(*1*). As a result, the following relationships are tested under section 179(d)(2)(A) and (B): *DB* tests its relationship to *DA* as of January 2, 2019, and January 2, 2018; and *DC* tests its relationship to *DB* and *DA* as of March 1, 2020, and January 2, 2018.


(*4*) Because *DB* acquired the machine in a series of related transactions in which *DB* acquired stock, meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2), of *DA* followed by a liquidation of *DA* under section 331, the relationship of *DB* and *DA* created thereof is disregarded for purposes of testing the relationship pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(*2*)(*v*) of this section. Therefore, *DA* is not related to *DB* within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) or section 179(d)(2)(B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iii) as of January 2, 2019, or January 2, 2018, and *DB*'s acquisition of the machine satisfies the used property acquisition requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*2*) of this section. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements of this section are satisfied, *DB*'s depreciable basis of the machine as a result of the liquidation of *DA* qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(*5*) Because *DC* is not related to *DB* or *DA* within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(ii) or section 179(d)(2)(B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iii) as of March 1, 2020, or January 2, 2018, *DC* 's acquisition of the machine satisfies the used property acquisition requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*2*) of this section. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements of this section are satisfied, *DC* 's purchase price of the machine qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction.


(NN) *Example 40.* (*1*) Pursuant to a series of related transactions, on January 2, 2018, *EA* bought and placed in service a new machine from an unrelated party for use in its trade or business. As part of the same series, *EA* sells the machine to *EB* and *EB* places it in service on January 2, 2019. As part of the same series, *EB* sells the machine to *EC* and *EC* places it in service on January 2, 2020. Throughout the series, *EA* is not related to *EB* or* EC* within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iii). *EB* and *EC* were related parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iii) until July 1, 2019, at which time, they ceased to be related.


(*2*) *EA*'s purchase of the machine on January 2, 2018, satisfies the original use requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and, assuming all other requirements of this section are met, *EA*'s purchase price of the machines qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(*3*) Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(*1*) of this section, a transferee tests its relationship with the transferor from which the transferee directly acquires the depreciable property, and with the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series. The relationship is tested when the transferee acquires, and immediately before the first transfer of, the depreciable property in the series. As a result, the following relationships are tested under section 179(d)(2)(A) and (B): *EB* tests its relationship to *EA* as of January 2, 2019, and January 2, 2018; and *EC* tests its relationship to *EA* and *EB* as of January 2, 2020, and January 2, 2018.


(*4*) Because *EA* is not related to *EB* within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iii) as of January 2, 2019, or January 2, 2018, *EB*'s acquisition of the machine satisfies the used property acquisition requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*2*) of this section. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements of this section are satisfied, *EB*'s purchase price of the machine qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(*5*) *EC* and *EA* are not related parties within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iii) as of January 2, 2020, or January 2, 2018. Within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iii), *EC* is not related to *EB* as of January 2, 2020; however, *EC* is related to *EB* as of January 2, 2018. Accordingly, *EC* 's acquisition of the machine does not satisfy the used property acquisition requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction.


(OO) *Example 41.* (*1*) The facts are the same as in *Example 40* of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(NN)(*1*) of this section, except that instead of selling to *EC, EB* sells the machine to *EE,* and *EE* places in service on January 2, 2020, and *EE* sells the machine to *EC* and *EC* places in service on January 2, 2021. *EE* was not in existence until July 2019 and is not related to *EA* or *EB.*

(*2*) *EA*'s purchase of the machine on January 2, 2018, satisfies the original use requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and, assuming all other requirements of this section are met, *EA*'s purchase price of the machine qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(*3*) Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(*1*) of this section, a transferee tests its relationship with the transferor from which the transferee directly acquires the depreciable property, and with the original transferor of the depreciable property in the series. The relationship is tested when the transferee acquires, and immediately before the first transfer of, the depreciable property in the series. However, because *EE* was not in existence immediately prior to the first transfer of the depreciable property in the series, *EC* tests its relationship with *EB* and *EA* pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C)(*2*)(*vii*) of this section. As a result, the following relationships are tested under section 179(d)(2)(A) and (B): *EB* tests its relationship to *EA* as of January 2, 2019, and January 2, 2018; *EE* tests its relationship to *EA* and *EB* as of January 2, 2020, and January 2, 2018; and *EC* tests its relationship to *EA* and *EB* as of January 2, 2021, and January 2, 2018.


(*4*) Because *EA* is not related to *EB* within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iii) as of January 2, 2019, or January 2, 2018, *EB*'s acquisition of the machine satisfies the used property acquisition requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*2*) of this section. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements of this section are satisfied, *EB*'s purchase price of the machine qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(*5*) Because *EE* is not related to *EA* or *EB* within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iii) as of January 2, 2020, or January 2, 2018, *EE*'s acquisition of the machine satisfies the used property acquisition requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*2*) of this section. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements of this section are satisfied, *EE* 's purchase price of the machine qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(*6*) Within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(B) and § 1.179-4(c)(1)(iii), *EC* is not related to *EA* as of January 2, 2021, or January 2, 2018; however, *EC* is related to *EB* as of January 2, 2018. Accordingly, *EC* 's acquisition of the machine does not satisfy the used property acquisition requirement of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction.


(4) *Placed-in-service date*—(i) *In general.* Depreciable property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(4) if the property is placed in service by the taxpayer for use in its trade or business or for production of income after September 27, 2017; and, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) and (D) of this section, before January 1, 2027, or, in the case of property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C), before January 1, 2028.


(ii) *Specified plant.* If the taxpayer has properly made an election to apply section 168(k)(5) for a specified plant, the requirements of this paragraph (b)(4) are satisfied only if the specified plant is planted before January 1, 2027, or is grafted before January 1, 2027, to a plant that has already been planted, by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's farming business, as defined in section 263A(e)(4).


(iii) *Qualified film, television, or live theatrical production*—(A) *Qualified film or television production.* For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4), a qualified film or television production is treated as placed in service at the time of initial release or broadcast as defined under § 1.181-1(a)(7). The taxpayer that places in service a qualified film or television production must be the owner, as defined in § 1.181-1(a)(2), of the qualified film or television production.


(B) *Qualified live theatrical production.* For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4), a qualified live theatrical production is treated as placed in service at the time of the initial live staged performance. The taxpayer that places in service a qualified live theatrical production must be the owner, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(F) of this section and in § 1.181-1(a)(2), of the qualified live theatrical production.


(iv) *Syndication transaction.* If new property is acquired and placed in service by a lessor, or if used property is acquired and placed in service by a lessor and the lessor and any predecessor did not previously have a depreciable interest in the used property, and the property is sold by the lessor or any subsequent purchaser within three months after the date the property was originally placed in service by the lessor (or, in the case of multiple units of property subject to the same lease, within three months after the date the final unit is placed in service, so long as the period between the time the first unit is placed in service and the time the last unit is placed in service does not exceed 12 months), and the user of the property after the last sale during this three-month period remains the same as when the property was originally placed in service by the lessor, the property is treated as originally placed in service by the purchaser of the property in the last sale during the three-month period but not earlier than the date of the last sale for purposes of sections 167 and 168, and §§ 1.46-3(d) and 1.167(a)-11(e)(1).


(v) *Technical termination of a partnership.* For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4), in the case of a technical termination of a partnership under section 708(b)(1)(B) occurring in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, qualified property placed in service by the terminated partnership during the taxable year of termination is treated as originally placed in service by the new partnership on the date the qualified property is contributed by the terminated partnership to the new partnership.


(vi) *Section 168(i)(7) transactions.* For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4), if qualified property is transferred in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7) in the same taxable year that the qualified property is placed in service by the transferor, the transferred property is treated as originally placed in service on the date the transferor placed in service the qualified property. In the case of multiple transfers of qualified property in multiple transactions described in section 168(i)(7) in the same taxable year, the placed-in-service date of the transferred property is deemed to be the date on which the first transferor placed in service the qualified property.


(5) *Acquisition of property*—(i) *In general.* This paragraph (b)(5) provides rules for the acquisition requirements in section 13201(h) of the Act. These rules apply to all property, including self-constructed property or property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C).


(ii) *Acquisition date*—(A) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(vi) of this section, depreciable property will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(5) if the property is acquired by the taxpayer after September 27, 2017, or is acquired by the taxpayer pursuant to a written binding contract entered into by the taxpayer after September 27, 2017. Property that is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written binding contract that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or production of the property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or for its production of income is not acquired pursuant to a written binding contract but is considered to be self-constructed property under this paragraph (b)(5). For determination of acquisition date, see paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B) of this section for property acquired pursuant to a written binding contract, paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section for self-constructed property, and paragraph (b)(5)(v) of this section for property not acquired pursuant to a written binding contract.


(B) *Determination of acquisition date for property acquired pursuant to a written binding contract.* Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(5)(vi) and (vii) of this section, the acquisition date of property that the taxpayer acquired pursuant to a written binding contract is the later of—


(*1*) The date on which the contract was entered into;


(*2*) The date on which the contract is enforceable under State law;


(*3*) If the contract has one or more cancellation periods, the date on which all cancellation periods end. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B)(*3*), a cancellation period is the number of days stated in the contract for any party to cancel the contract without penalty; or


(*4*) If the contract has one or more contingency clauses, the date on which all conditions subject to such clauses are satisfied. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B)(*4*), a contingency clause is one that provides for a condition (or conditions) or action (or actions) that is within the control of any party or a predecessor.


(iii) *Definition of binding contract*—(A) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(G) of this section, a contract is binding only if it is enforceable under State law against the taxpayer or a predecessor, and does not limit damages to a specified amount (for example, by use of a liquidated damages provision). For this purpose, any contractual provision that limits damages to an amount equal to at least 5 percent of the total contract price will not be treated as limiting damages to a specified amount. If a contract has multiple provisions that limit damages, only the provision with the highest damages is taken into account in determining whether the contract limits damages. Also, in determining whether a contract limits damages, the fact that there may be little or no damages because the contract price does not significantly differ from fair market value will not be taken into account. For example, if a taxpayer entered into an irrevocable written contract to purchase an asset for $100 and the contract did not contain a provision for liquidated damages, the contract is considered binding notwithstanding the fact that the asset had a fair market value of $99 and under local law the seller would only recover the difference in the event the purchaser failed to perform. If the contract provided for a full refund of the purchase price in lieu of any damages allowable by law in the event of breach or cancellation, the contract is not considered binding.


(B) *Conditions.* Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(G) of this section, a contract is binding even if subject to a condition, as long as the condition is not within the control of either party or a predecessor. A contract will continue to be binding if the parties make insubstantial changes in its terms and conditions or if any term is to be determined by a standard beyond the control of either party. A contract that imposes significant obligations on the taxpayer or a predecessor will be treated as binding notwithstanding the fact that certain terms remain to be negotiated by the parties to the contract.


(C) *Options.* An option to either acquire or sell property is not a binding contract.


(D) *Letter of intent.* A letter of intent for an acquisition is not a binding contract.


(E) *Supply agreements.* A binding contract does not include a supply or similar agreement if the amount and design specifications of the property to be purchased have not been specified. The contract will not be a binding contract for the property to be purchased until both the amount and the design specifications are specified. For example, if the provisions of a supply or similar agreement state the design specifications of the property to be purchased, a purchase order under the agreement for a specific number of assets is treated as a binding contract.


(F) *Components.* A binding contract to acquire one or more components of a larger property will not be treated as a binding contract to acquire the larger property. If a binding contract to acquire the component does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (b)(5), the component does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(G) *Acquisition of a trade or business or an entity.* A contract to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of a trade or business or to acquire an entity (for example, a corporation, a partnership, or a limited liability company) is binding if it is enforceable under State law against the parties to the contract. The presence of a condition outside the control of the parties, including, for example, regulatory agency approval, will not prevent the contract from being a binding contract. Further, the fact that insubstantial terms remain to be negotiated by the parties to the contract, or that customary conditions remain to be satisfied, does not prevent the contract from being a binding contract. This paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(G) also applies to a contract for the sale of the stock of a corporation that is treated as an asset sale as a result of an election under section 338 or under section 336(e) made for a disposition described in § 1.336-2(b)(1).


(iv) *Self-constructed property*—(A) *In general.* If a taxpayer manufactures, constructs, or produces property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or for its production of income, the acquisition rules in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section are treated as met for the property if the taxpayer begins manufacturing, constructing, or producing the property after September 27, 2017. Property that is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or production of the property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or for its production of income is considered to be manufactured, constructed, or produced by the taxpayer. If a taxpayer enters into a written binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, before September 28, 2017, with another person to manufacture, construct, or produce property and the manufacture, construction, or production of this property begins after September 27, 2017, the acquisition rules in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section are met.


(B) *When does manufacture, construction, or production begin*—(*1*) *In general.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(A) of this section, manufacture, construction, or production of property begins when physical work of a significant nature begins. Physical work does not include preliminary activities such as planning or designing, securing financing, exploring, or researching. The determination of when physical work of a significant nature begins depends on the facts and circumstances. For example, if a retail motor fuels outlet is to be constructed on-site, construction begins when physical work of a significant nature commences at the site; that is, when work begins on the excavation for footings, pouring the pads for the outlet, or the driving of foundation pilings into the ground. Preliminary work, such as clearing a site, test drilling to determine soil condition, or excavation to change the contour of the land (as distinguished from excavation for footings) does not constitute the beginning of construction. However, if a retail motor fuels outlet is to be assembled on-site from modular units manufactured off-site and delivered to the site where the outlet will be used, manufacturing begins when physical work of a significant nature commences at the off-site location.


(*2*) *Safe harbor.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B)(*1*) of this section, a taxpayer may choose to determine when physical work of a significant nature begins in accordance with this paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B)(*2*). Physical work of a significant nature will be considered to begin at the time the taxpayer incurs (in the case of an accrual basis taxpayer) or pays (in the case of a cash basis taxpayer) more than 10 percent of the total cost of the property, excluding the cost of any land and preliminary activities such as planning or designing, securing financing, exploring, or researching. When property is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person, this safe harbor test must be satisfied by the taxpayer. For example, if a retail motor fuels outlet or other facility is to be constructed for an accrual basis taxpayer by another person for the total cost of $200,000, excluding the cost of any land and preliminary activities such as planning or designing, securing financing, exploring, or researching, construction is deemed to begin for purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B)(*2*) when the taxpayer has incurred more than 10 percent (more than $20,000) of the total cost of the property. A taxpayer chooses to apply this paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B)(*2*) by filing a Federal income tax return for the placed-in-service year of the property that determines when physical work of a significant nature begins consistent with this paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B)(*2*).


(C) *Components of self-constructed property*—(*1*) *Acquired components.* If a binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, to acquire a component does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, the component does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section. A binding contract described in the preceding sentence to acquire one or more components of a larger self-constructed property will not preclude the larger self-constructed property from satisfying the acquisition rules in paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(A) of this section. Accordingly, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the larger self-constructed property that is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met, must not include the unadjusted depreciable basis of any component that does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. If the manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property begins before September 28, 2017, the larger self-constructed property and any acquired components related to the larger self-constructed property do not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. If a binding contract to acquire the component is entered into after September 27, 2017, but the manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property does not begin before January 1, 2027, the component qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met, but the larger self-constructed property does not.


(*2*) *Self-constructed components.* If the manufacture, construction, or production of a component does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (b)(5)(iv), the component does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section. However, if the manufacture, construction, or production of a component does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (b)(5)(iv), but the manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (b)(5)(iv), the larger self-constructed property qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met, even though the component does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section. Accordingly, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the larger self-constructed property that is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met, must not include the unadjusted depreciable basis of any component that does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section. If the manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property began before September 28, 2017, the larger self-constructed property and any self-constructed components related to the larger self-constructed property do not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. If the manufacture, construction, or production of a component begins after September 27, 2017, but the manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property does not begin before January 1, 2027, the component qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met, but the larger self-constructed property does not.


(v) *Determination of acquisition date for property not acquired pursuant to a written binding contract.* Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(5)(iv), (vi), and (vii) of this section, the acquisition date of property that the taxpayer acquires pursuant to a contract that does not meet the definition of a written binding contract in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, is the date on which the taxpayer paid, in the case of a cash basis taxpayer, or incurred, in the case of an accrual basis taxpayer, more than 10 percent of the total cost of the property, excluding the cost of any land and preliminary activities such as planning and designing, securing financing, exploring, or researching. The preceding sentence also applies to property that is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written contract that does not meet the definition of a binding contract in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, and that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or production of the property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or for its production of income. This paragraph (b)(5)(v) does not apply to an acquisition described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(G) of this section. 


(vi) *Qualified film, television, or live theatrical production*—(A) *Qualified film or television production.* For purposes of section 13201(h)(1)(A) of the Act, a qualified film or television production is treated as acquired on the date principal photography commences.


(B) *Qualified live theatrical production.* For purposes of section 13201(h)(1)(A) of the Act, a qualified live theatrical production is treated as acquired on the date when all of the necessary elements for producing the live theatrical production are secured. These elements may include a script, financing, actors, set, scenic and costume designs, advertising agents, music, and lighting.


(vii) *Specified plant.* If the taxpayer has properly made an election to apply section 168(k)(5) for a specified plant, the requirements of this paragraph (b)(5) are satisfied if the specified plant is planted after September 27, 2017, or is grafted after September 27, 2017, to a plant that has already been planted, by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's farming business, as defined in section 263A(e)(4).


(viii) *Examples.* The application of this paragraph (b)(5) is illustrated by the following examples. Unless the facts specifically indicate otherwise, assume that the parties are not related within the meaning of section 179(d)(2)(A) or (B) and § 1.179-4(c), paragraph (c) of this section does not apply, and the parties do not have predecessors:


(A) *Example 1.* On September 1, 2017, *BB,* a corporation, entered into a written agreement with *CC,* a manufacturer, to purchase 20 new lamps for $100 each within the next two years. Although the agreement specifies the number of lamps to be purchased, the agreement does not specify the design of the lamps to be purchased. Accordingly, the agreement is not a binding contract pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(E) of this section.


(B) *Example 2.* The facts are the same as in *Example 1* of paragraph (b)(5)(viii)(A) of this section. On December 1, 2017, *BB* placed a purchase order with *CC* to purchase 20 new model XPC5 lamps for $100 each for a total amount of $2,000. Because the agreement specifies the number of lamps to be purchased and the purchase order specifies the design of the lamps to be purchased, the purchase order placed by *BB* with *CC* on December 1, 2017, is a binding contract pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(E) of this section. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements are met, the cost of the 20 lamps qualifies for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction.


(C) *Example 3.* The facts are the same as in *Example 1* of paragraph (b)(5)(viii)(A) of this section, except that the written agreement between *BB* and *CC* is to purchase 100 model XPC5 lamps for $100 each within the next two years. Because this agreement specifies the amount and design of the lamps to be purchased, the agreement is a binding contract pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(E) of this section. However, because the agreement was entered into before September 28, 2017, no lamp acquired by *BB* under this contract qualifies for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction.


(D) *Example 4.* On September 1, 2017, *DD* began constructing a retail motor fuels outlet for its own use. On November 1, 2018, *DD* ceases construction of the retail motor fuels outlet prior to its completion. Between September 1, 2017, and November 1, 2018, *DD* incurred $3,000,000 of expenditures for the construction of the retail motor fuels outlet. On May 1, 2019, *DD* resumed construction of the retail motor fuels outlet and completed its construction on August 31, 2019. Between May 1, 2019, and August 31, 2019, *DD* incurred another $1,600,000 of expenditures to complete the construction of the retail motor fuels outlet and, on September 1, 2019, *DD* placed the retail motor fuels outlet in service. None of *DD'*s total expenditures of $4,600,000 qualify for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction because, pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(A) of this section, *DD* began constructing the retail motor fuels outlet before September 28, 2017.


(E) *Example 5.* The facts are the same as in *Example 4* of paragraph (b)(5)(viii)(D) of this section except that *DD* began constructing the retail motor fuels outlet for its own use on October 1, 2017, and *DD* incurred the $3,000,000 between October 1, 2017, and November 1, 2018. *DD'*s total expenditures of $4,600,000 qualify for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction because, pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(A) of this section, *DD* began constructing the retail motor fuels outlet after September 27, 2017, and *DD* placed the retail motor fuels outlet in service on September 1, 2019. Accordingly, assuming all other requirements are met, the additional first year depreciation deduction for the retail motor fuels outlet will be $4,600,000, computed as $4,600,000 multiplied by 100 percent.


(F) *Example 6.* On August 15, 2017, *EE,* an accrual basis taxpayer, entered into a written binding contract with *FF* to manufacture an aircraft described in section 168(k)(2)(C) for use in *EE'*s trade or business. *FF* begins to manufacture the aircraft on October 1, 2017. The completed aircraft is delivered to *EE* on February 15, 2018, at which time *EE* incurred the total cost of the aircraft. *EE* places the aircraft in service on March 1, 2018. Pursuant to paragraphs (b)(5)(ii)(A) and (b)(5)(iv)(A) of this section, the aircraft is considered to be manufactured by *EE.* Because *EE* began manufacturing the aircraft after September 27, 2017, the aircraft qualifies for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, assuming all other requirements are met.


(G) *Example 7.* On June 1, 2017, *HH* entered into a written binding contract with GG to acquire a new component part of property that is being constructed by *HH* for its own use in its trade or business. *HH* commenced construction of the property in November 2017, and placed the property in service in November 2018. Because *HH* entered into a written binding contract to acquire a component part prior to September 28, 2017, pursuant to paragraphs (b)(5)(ii) and (b)(5)(iv)(C)(*1*) of this section, the component part does not qualify for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction. However, pursuant to paragraphs (b)(5)(iv)(A) and (b)(5)(iv)(C)(*1*) of this section, the property constructed by *HH* will qualify for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, because construction of the property began after September 27, 2017, assuming all other requirements are met. Accordingly, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the property that is eligible for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction must not include the unadjusted depreciable basis of the component part.


(H) *Example 8.* The facts are the same as in *Example 7* of paragraph (b)(5)(viii)(G) of this section except that *HH* entered into the written binding contract with GG to acquire the new component part on September 30, 2017, and *HH* commenced construction of the property on August 1, 2017. Pursuant to paragraphs (b)(5)(iv)(A) and (C) of this section, neither the property constructed by *HH* nor the component part will qualify for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, because *HH* began construction of the property prior to September 28, 2017.


(I) *Example 9.* On September 1, 2017, *II* acquired and placed in service equipment. On January 15, 2018, *II* sells the equipment to *JJ* and leases the property back from *JJ* in a sale-leaseback transaction. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, *II'*s cost of the equipment does not qualify for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction because *II* acquired the equipment prior to September 28, 2017. However, *JJ* acquired used equipment from an unrelated party after September 27, 2017, and, assuming all other requirements are met, *JJ'*s cost of the used equipment qualifies for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction for *JJ.*

(J) *Example 10.* On July 1, 2017, *KK* began constructing property for its own use in its trade or business. *KK* placed this property in service on September 15, 2017. On January 15, 2018, *KK* sells the property to *LL* and leases the property back from *LL* in a sale-leaseback transaction. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section, *KK'*s cost of the property does not qualify for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction because *KK* began construction of the property prior to September 28, 2017. However, *LL* acquired used property from an unrelated party after September 27, 2017, and, assuming all other requirements are met, *LL'*s cost of the used property qualifies for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction for *LL.*

(K) *Example 11. MM,* a calendar year taxpayer, is engaged in a trade or business described in section 163(j)(7)(A)(iv). In December 2018, *MM* began constructing a new electric generation power plant for its own use. *MM* placed in service this new power plant, including all component parts, in 2020. Even though *MM* began constructing the power plant after September 27, 2017, none of *MM'*s total expenditures of the power plant qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section because, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(F) of this section, the power plant is property that is primarily used in a trade or business described in section 163(j)(7)(A)(iv) and the power plant was placed in service in *MM'*s taxable year beginning after 2017.



 

(c) *Election for components of larger self-constructed property for which the manufacture, construction, or production begins before September 28, 2017*—(1) *In general.* A taxpayer may elect to treat any acquired or self-constructed component, as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, of the larger self-constructed property, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, as being eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all requirements of section 168(k) and this section are met. The taxpayer may make this election for one or more such components.


(2) *Eligible larger self-constructed property*—(i) *In general.* Solely for purposes of this paragraph (c), a larger self-constructed property is property that is manufactured, constructed, or produced by the taxpayer for its own use in its trade or business or production of income. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (c), property that is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, or under a written contract that does not meet the definition of a binding contract in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or production of the property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or production of income is considered to be manufactured, constructed, or produced by the taxpayer. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, such larger self-constructed property must be property—


(A) That is described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A), (B), (C), or (D) of this section. Solely for purposes of the preceding sentence, the requirement that property has to be acquired after September 27, 2017, is disregarded;


(B) That meets the requirements under paragraph (b) of this section, determined without regard to the acquisition date requirement in paragraph (b)(5) of this section; and


(C) For which the taxpayer begins the manufacture, construction, or production before September 28, 2017.


(ii) *Residential rental property or nonresidential real property.* If the taxpayer constructs, manufactures, or produces residential rental property or nonresidential real property, as defined in section 168(e)(2), or an improvement to such property, for use in its trade or business or production of income, all property that is constructed, manufactured, or produced as part of such residential rental property, nonresidential real property, or improvement, as applicable, and that is described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section is the larger self-constructed property for purposes of applying the rules in this paragraph (c).


(iii) *Beginning of manufacturing, construction, or production.* Solely for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section, the determination of when manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property begins is made in accordance with the rules in paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B) of this section if the larger self-constructed property is manufactured, constructed, or produced by the taxpayer for its own use in its trade or business or production of income, or is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or production of the property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or production of income. If the larger self-constructed property is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written contract that does not meet the definition of a binding contract in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or production of the property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or production of income, the determination of when manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property begins is made in accordance with the rules in paragraph (b)(5)(v) of this section. If the taxpayer enters into a written binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, before September 28, 2017, with another person to manufacture, construct, or produce the larger self-constructed property and the manufacture, construction, or production of this property begins after September 27, 2017, as determined under paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B) of this section, this paragraph (c) does not apply. If the taxpayer enters into a written contract that does not meet the definition of a binding contract in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section before September 28, 2017, with another person to manufacture, construct, or produce the larger self-constructed property and the manufacture, construction, or production of this property begins after September 27, 2017, as determined under paragraph (b)(5)(v) of this section, this paragraph (c) does not apply.


(iv) *Exception.* This paragraph (c) does not apply to any larger self-constructed property that is included in a class of property for which the taxpayer made an election under section 168(k)(7) (formerly section 168(k)(2)(D)(iii)) not to deduct the additional first year depreciation deduction.


(3) *Eligible components*—(i) *In general.* Solely for purposes of this paragraph (c), a component of the larger self-constructed property, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, must be qualified property under section 168(k)(2) and paragraph (b) of this section. Solely for purposes of the preceding sentence, a component will satisfy the acquisition date requirement in paragraph (b)(5) of this section if it satisfies the requirements in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section, as applicable.


(ii) *Acquired components.* If a component of the larger self-constructed property is acquired pursuant to a written binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, the component must be acquired by the taxpayer after September 27, 2017, as determined under the rules in paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B) of this section. If a component of the larger self-constructed property is acquired pursuant to a written contract that does not meet the definition of a binding contract in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, the component must be acquired by the taxpayer after September 27, 2017, as determined under the rules in paragraph (b)(5)(v) of this section.


(iii) *Self-constructed components.* The manufacture, construction, or production of a component of a larger self-constructed property must begin after September 27, 2017. The determination of when manufacture, construction, or production of the component begins is made in accordance with the rules in—


(A) Paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B) of this section if the component is manufactured, constructed, or produced by the taxpayer for its own use in its trade or business or for its production of income, or is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or production of the component for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or for its production of income; or


(B) Paragraph (b)(5)(v) of this section if the component is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written contract that does not meet the definition of a binding contract in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or production of the component for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or for its production of income.


(4) *Special rules*—(i) *Installation costs.* If the taxpayer pays, in the case of a cash basis taxpayer, or incurs, in the case of an accrual basis taxpayer, costs, including labor costs, to install a component of the larger self-constructed property, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, such costs are eligible for the additional first year depreciation under this section, assuming all requirements are met, only if the component being installed meets the requirements in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.


(ii) *Property described in section 168(k)(2)(B).* The rules in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section apply for determining the unadjusted depreciable basis, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3), of larger self-constructed property described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and in section 168(k)(2)(B).


(5) *Computation of additional first year depreciation deduction*—(i) *Election is made.* Before determining the allowable additional first year depreciation deduction for the larger self-constructed property, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, for which the taxpayer makes the election specified in this paragraph (c) for one or more components of such property, the taxpayer must determine the portion of the unadjusted depreciable basis, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3), of the larger self-constructed property, including all components, attributable to the component that meets the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4)(i) of this section (component basis). The additional first year depreciation deduction for the component basis is determined by multiplying such component basis by the applicable percentage for the placed-in-service year of the larger self-constructed property. The additional first year depreciation deduction, if any, for the remaining unadjusted depreciable basis of the larger self-constructed property, as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, is determined under section 168(k), as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act, and section 168(k)(8). For purposes of this paragraph (c), the remaining unadjusted depreciable basis of the larger self-constructed property is equal to the unadjusted depreciable basis, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3), of the larger self-constructed property, including all components, reduced by the sum of the component basis of the components for which the taxpayer makes the election specified in this paragraph (c).


(ii) *Election is not made.* If the taxpayer does not make the election specified in this paragraph (c), the additional first year depreciation deduction, if any, for the larger self-constructed property, including all components, is determined under section 168(k), as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act, and section 168(k)(8).


(6) *Time and manner for making election*—(i) *Time for making election.* The election specified in this paragraph (c) must be made by the due date, including extensions, of the Federal tax return for the taxable year in which the taxpayer placed in service the larger self-constructed property.


(ii) *Manner of making election.* The election specified in this paragraph (c) must be made by attaching a statement to such return indicating that the taxpayer is making the election provided in this paragraph (c) and whether the taxpayer is making the election for all or some of the components described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The election is made separately by each person owning qualified property (for example, for each member of a consolidated group by the agent for the group (within the meaning of § 1.1502-77(a) and (c)), by the partnership (including a lower-tier partnership), or by the S corporation).


(7) *Revocation of election*—(i) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, the election specified in this paragraph (c), once made, may be revoked only by filing a request for a private letter ruling and obtaining the Commissioner of Internal Revenue's written consent to revoke the election. The Commissioner may grant a request to revoke the election if the taxpayer acted reasonably and in good faith, and the revocation will not prejudice the interests of the Government. See generally § 301.9100-3 of this chapter. The election specified in this paragraph (c) may not be revoked through a request under section 446(e) to change the taxpayer's method of accounting.


(ii) *Automatic 6-month extension.* If a taxpayer made the election specified in this paragraph (c), an automatic extension of 6 months from the due date of the taxpayer's Federal tax return, excluding extensions, for the placed-in-service year of the larger self-constructed property is granted to revoke that election, provided the taxpayer timely filed the taxpayer's Federal tax return for that placed-in-service year and, within this 6-month extension period, the taxpayer, and all taxpayers whose tax liability would be affected by the election, file an amended Federal tax return for the placed-in-service year in a manner that is consistent with the revocation of the election.


(8) *Additional procedural guidance.* The IRS may publish procedural guidance in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(*b*) of this chapter) that provides alternative procedures for complying with paragraph (c)(6) or (c)(7)(i) of this section.


(9) *Examples.* The application of this paragraph (c) is illustrated by the following examples. Unless the facts specifically indicate otherwise, assume that the larger self-constructed property is described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the components that are acquired or self-constructed after September 27, 2017, are described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the taxpayer is an accrual basis taxpayer, and none of the costs paid or incurred after September 27, 2017, are for the installation of components that do not meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.


(i) *Example 1.* (A) *BC,* a calendar year taxpayer, is engaged in a trade or business described in section 163(j)(7)(A)(iv) and §§ 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i) and 1.163(j)-10(c)(3)(iii)(C)(*3*). In December 2015, *BC* decided to construct an electric generation power plant for its own use. This plant is property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act. However, the turbine for the plant had to be manufactured by another person for *BC.* In January 2016, *BC* entered into a written binding contract with *CD* to acquire the turbine. *BC* received the completed turbine in August 2017 at which time *BC* incurred the cost of the turbine. The cost of the turbine is 11 percent of the total cost of the electric generation power plant to be constructed by *BC. BC* began constructing the electric generation power plant in October 2017 and placed in service this new power plant, including all component parts, in 2020.


(B) The larger self-constructed property is the electric generation power plant to be constructed by *BC.* For determining if the construction of this power plant begins before September 28, 2017, paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B) of this section provides that manufacture, construction, or production of property begins when physical work of a significant nature begins. *BC* uses the safe harbor test in paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B)(*2*) of this section to determine when physical work of a significant nature begins for the electric generation power plant. Because the turbine that was manufactured by *CD* for *BC* is more than 10 percent of the total cost of the electric generation power plant, physical work of a significant nature for this plant began before September 28, 2017.


(C) The power plant is described in section 168(k)(9)(A) and paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(F) of this section and, therefore, is not larger self-constructed property eligible for the election pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section. Accordingly, none of *BC'*s expenditures for components of the power plant that are acquired or self-constructed after September 27, 2017, are eligible for the election specified in this paragraph (c). Assuming all requirements are met under section 168(k)(2) as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the power plant, including all components, attributable to its construction before January 1, 2020, is eligible for the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction pursuant to section 168(k)(8).


(ii) *Example 2.* (A) In August 2017, *BD,* a calendar-year taxpayer, entered into a written binding contract with *CE* for *CE* to manufacture a locomotive for *BD* for use in its trade or business. Before September 28, 2017, *BD* acquired or self-constructed components of the locomotive. These components cost $500,000, which is more than 10 percent of the total cost of the locomotive, and *BD* incurred such costs before September 28, 2017. After September 27, 2017, *BD* acquired or self-constructed components of the locomotive and these components cost $4,000,000. In February 2019, *CE* delivered the locomotive to *BD* and *BD* placed in service the locomotive. The total cost of the locomotive is $4,500,000. The locomotive is property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act. On its timely filed Federal income tax return for 2019, *BD* made the election specified in this paragraph (c).


(B) The larger self-constructed property is the locomotive being manufactured by *CE* for *BD.* For determining if the manufacturing of this locomotive begins before September 28, 2017, paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B) of this section provides that manufacture, construction, or production of property begins when physical work of a significant nature begins. *BD* uses the safe harbor test in paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B)(*2*) of this section to determine when physical work of a significant nature begins for the locomotive. Because *BD* had incurred more than 10 percent of the total cost of the locomotive before September 28, 2017, physical work of a significant nature for this locomotive began before September 28, 2017.


(C) Because *BD* made the election specified in this paragraph (c), the cost of $4,000,000 for the locomotive's components acquired or self-constructed after September 27, 2017, qualifies for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met. The remaining cost of the locomotive is $500,000 and such amount qualifies for the 40-percent additional first year depreciation deduction pursuant to section 168(k)(8), assuming all other requirements in section 168(k) as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act are met.


(iii) *Example 3.* (A) In February 2016, *BF,* a calendar-year taxpayer, entered into a written binding contract with *CG* for *CG* to manufacture a vessel for *BF* for use in its trade or business. Before September 28, 2017, *BF* acquired or self-constructed components for the vessel. These components cost $30,000,000, which is more than 10 percent of the total cost of the vessel, and *BF* incurred such costs before September 28, 2017. After September 27, 2017, *BF* acquired or self-constructed components for the vessel and these components cost $15,000,000. In February 2021, *CG* delivered the vessel to *BF* and *BF* placed in service the vessel. The vessel is property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act. The total cost of the vessel is $45,000,000. On its timely filed Federal income tax return for 2021, *BF* made the election specified in this paragraph (c).


(B) The larger self-constructed property is the vessel being manufactured by *CG* for *BF.* For determining if the manufacturing of this vessel begins before September 28, 2017, paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B) of this section provides that manufacture, construction, or production of property begins when physical work of a significant nature begins. *BF* uses the safe harbor test in paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(B)(*2*) of this section to determine when physical work of a significant nature begins for the vessel. Because *BF* had incurred more than 10 percent of the total cost of the vessel before September 28, 2017, physical work of a significant nature for this vessel began before September 28, 2017.


(C) Because *BF* made the election specified in this paragraph (c), the cost of $15,000,000 for the vessel's components acquired or self-constructed after September 27, 2017, qualifies for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met. Pursuant to section 168(k)(8) and because *BF* placed in service the vessel after 2020, none of the remaining cost of the vessel is eligible for any additional first year depreciation deduction under section 168(k) and this section nor under section 168(k) as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act.


(iv) *Example 4.* (A) In March 2017, *BG,* a calendar year taxpayer, entered into a written contract with *CH* for *CH* to construct a building for *BG* to use in its retail business. This written contract does not meet the definition of a binding contract in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section. In September 2019, the construction of the building was completed and placed in service by *BG.* The total cost is $10,000,000. Of this amount, $3,000,000 is the total cost for all section 1245 properties constructed as part of the building, and $7,000,000 is for the building. Under section 168(e), section 1245 properties in the total amount of $2,400,000 are 5-year property and in the total amount of $600,000 are 7-year property. The building is nonresidential real property under section 168(e). Before September 28, 2017, *BG* acquired or self-constructed certain components and the total cost of these components is $500,000 for the section 1245 properties and $3,000,000 for the building. *BG* incurred these costs before September 28, 2017. After September 27, 2017, *BG* acquired or self-constructed the remaining components of the section 1245 properties and these components cost $2,500,000. *BG* incurred these costs of $2,500,000 after September 27, 2017. On its timely filed Federal income tax return for 2019, *BG* made the election specified in this paragraph (c).


(B) All section 1245 properties are constructed as part of the construction of the building and are described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section. The building is not described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A), (B), (C), or (D) of this section. As a result, under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the larger self-constructed property is all section 1245 properties with a total cost of $3,000,000. For determining if the construction of these section 1245 properties begins before September 28, 2017, paragraph (b)(5)(v) of this section provides that manufacture, construction, or production of property begins when the taxpayer incurs more than 10 percent of the total cost of the property. Because *BG* incurred more than 10 percent of the total cost of the section 1245 properties before September 28, 2017, construction of the section 1245 properties began before September 28, 2017.


(C) Because *BG* made the election specified in this paragraph (c), the cost of $2,500,000 for the section 1245 components acquired or self-constructed by *BG* after September 27, 2017, qualifies for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met. The remaining cost of the section 1245 components is $500,000 and such amount qualifies for the 30-percent additional first year depreciation deduction pursuant to section 168(k)(8), assuming all other requirements in section 168(k), as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act, are met. Because the building is not qualified property under section 168(k), as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act, none of the cost of $7,000,000 for the building is eligible for any additional first year depreciation deduction under section 168(k) and this section or under section 168(k), as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Act.


(d) *Property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C)*—(1) *In general.* Property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C) will meet the acquisition requirements of section 168(k)(2)(B)(i)(III) or (k)(2)(C)(i) if the property is acquired by the taxpayer before January 1, 2027, or acquired by the taxpayer pursuant to a written binding contract that is entered into before January 1, 2027. Property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C), including its components, also must meet the acquisition requirement in section 13201(h)(1)(A) of the Act (for further guidance, see paragraph (b)(5) of this section).


(2) *Definition of binding contract.* For purposes of this paragraph (d), the rules in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section for a binding contract apply.


(3) *Self-constructed property*—(i) *In general.* If a taxpayer manufactures, constructs, or produces property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or for its production of income, the acquisition rules in paragraph (d)(1) of this section are treated as met for the property if the taxpayer begins manufacturing, constructing, or producing the property before January 1, 2027. Property that is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or production of the property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or for its production of income is considered to be manufactured, constructed, or produced by the taxpayer. If a taxpayer enters into a written binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, before January 1, 2027, with another person to manufacture, construct, or produce property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C) and the manufacture, construction, or production of this property begins after December 31, 2026, the acquisition rule in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is met.


(ii) *When does manufacture, construction, or production begin*—(A) *In general.* For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3), manufacture, construction, or production of property begins when physical work of a significant nature begins. Physical work does not include preliminary activities such as planning or designing, securing financing, exploring, or researching. The determination of when physical work of a significant nature begins depends on the facts and circumstances. For example, if a retail motor fuels outlet is to be constructed on-site, construction begins when physical work of a significant nature commences at the site; that is, when work begins on the excavation for footings, pouring the pads for the outlet, or the driving of foundation pilings into the ground. Preliminary work, such as clearing a site, test drilling to determine soil condition, or excavation to change the contour of the land (as distinguished from excavation for footings) does not constitute the beginning of construction. However, if a retail motor fuels outlet is to be assembled on-site from modular units manufactured off-site and delivered to the site where the outlet will be used, manufacturing begins when physical work of a significant nature commences at the off-site location.


(B) *Safe harbor.* For purposes of paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, a taxpayer may choose to determine when physical work of a significant nature begins in accordance with this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B). Physical work of a significant nature will be considered to begin at the time the taxpayer incurs (in the case of an accrual basis taxpayer) or pays (in the case of a cash basis taxpayer) more than 10 percent of the total cost of the property, excluding the cost of any land and preliminary activities such as planning or designing, securing financing, exploring, or researching. When property is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person, this safe harbor test must be satisfied by the taxpayer. For example, if a retail motor fuels outlet is to be constructed for an accrual basis taxpayer by another person for the total cost of $200,000, excluding the cost of any land and preliminary activities such as planning or designing, securing financing, exploring, or researching, construction is deemed to begin for purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) when the taxpayer has incurred more than 10 percent (more than $20,000) of the total cost of the property. A taxpayer chooses to apply this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) by filing a Federal income tax return for the placed-in-service year of the property that determines when physical work of a significant nature begins consistent with this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B).


(iii) *Components of self-constructed property*—(A) *Acquired components.* If a binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, to acquire a component does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the component does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section. A binding contract described in the preceding sentence to acquire one or more components of a larger self-constructed property will not preclude the larger self-constructed property from satisfying the acquisition rules in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. Accordingly, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the larger self-constructed property that is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met, must not include the unadjusted depreciable basis of any component that does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section. If a binding contract to acquire the component is entered into before January 1, 2027, but the manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property does not begin before January 1, 2027, the component qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met, but the larger self-constructed property does not.


(B) *Self-constructed components.* If the manufacture, construction, or production of a component by the taxpayer does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the component does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section. However, if the manufacture, construction, or production of a component does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, but the manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property satisfies the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the larger self-constructed property qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met, even though the component does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section. Accordingly, the unadjusted depreciable basis of the larger self-constructed property that is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met, must not include the unadjusted depreciable basis of any component that does not qualify for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section. If the manufacture, construction, or production of a component begins before January 1, 2027, but the manufacture, construction, or production of the larger self-constructed property does not begin before January 1, 2027, the component qualifies for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met, but the larger self-constructed property does not.


(iv) *Determination of acquisition date for property not acquired pursuant to a written binding contract.* For purposes of the acquisition rules in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the following property is acquired by the taxpayer before January 1, 2027, if the taxpayer paid, in the case of a cash basis taxpayer, or incurred, in the case of an accrual basis taxpayer, more than 10 percent of the total cost of the property before January 1, 2027, excluding the cost of any land and preliminary activities such as planning and designing, securing financing, exploring, or researching:


(A) Property that the taxpayer acquires pursuant to a contract that does not meet the definition of a written binding contract in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section; or


(B) Property that is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written contract that does not meet the definition of a binding contract in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, and that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or production of the property for use by the taxpayer in its trade or business or production of income.


(4) *Examples.* The application of this paragraph (d) is illustrated by the following examples:


(A) *Example 1.* (*1*) On June 1, 2016, *NN* decided to construct property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) for its own use. However, one of the component parts of the property had to be manufactured by another person for *NN.* On August 15, 2016, *NN* entered into a written binding contract with *OO* to acquire this component part of the property for $100,000. *OO* began manufacturing the component part on November 1, 2016, and delivered the completed component part to *NN* on September 1, 2017, at which time *NN* incurred $100,000 for the cost of the component. The cost of this component part is 9 percent of the total cost of the property to be constructed by *NN. NN* did not incur any other cost of the property to be constructed before *NN* began construction. *NN* began constructing the property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) on October 15, 2017, and placed in service this property, including all component parts, on November 1, 2020. *NN* uses the safe harbor test in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section to determine when physical work of a significant nature begins for the property described in section 168(k)(2)(B).


(*2*) Because the component part of $100,000 that was manufactured by *OO* for *NN* is not more than 10 percent of the total cost of the property described in section 168(k)(2)(B), physical work of a significant nature for the property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) did not begin before September 28, 2017.


(*3*) Pursuant to paragraphs (b)(5)(iv)(C)(*2*) and (d)(1) of this section, the self-constructed component part of $100,000 manufactured by *OO* for *NN* is not eligible for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction because the manufacturing of such component part began before September 28, 2017. However, pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the cost of the property described in section 168(k)(2)(B), excluding the cost of the component part of $100,000 manufactured by *OO* for *NN,* is eligible for the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, assuming all other requirements are met, because construction of the property began after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2027, and the property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) was placed in service by *NN* during 2020.


(B) *Example 2.* (*1*) On June 1, 2026, *PP* decided to construct property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) for its own use. However, one of the component parts of the property had to be manufactured by another person for *PP.* On August 15, 2026, *PP* entered into a written binding contract with *XP* to acquire this component part of the property for $100,000. *XP* began manufacturing the component part on September 1, 2026, and delivered the completed component part to *PP* on February 1, 2027, at which time *PP* incurred $100,000 for the cost of the component. The cost of this component part is 9 percent of the total cost of the property to be constructed by *PP. PP* did not incur any other cost of the property to be constructed before *PP* began construction. *PP* began constructing the property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) on January 15, 2027, and placed this property, including all component parts, in service on November 1, 2027.


(*2*) Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, the self-constructed component part of $100,000 manufactured by *XP* for *PP* is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section, assuming all other requirements are met, because the manufacturing of the component part began before January 1, 2027, and the property described in section 168(k)(2)(B), the larger self-constructed property, was placed in service by *PP* before January 1, 2028. However, pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the cost of the property described in section 168(k)(2)(B), excluding the cost of the self-constructed component part of $100,000 manufactured by *XP* for *PP,* is not eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section because construction of the property began after December 31, 2026.


(C) *Example 3.* On December 1, 2026, *QQ* entered into a written binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, with *RR* to manufacture an aircraft described in section 168(k)(2)(C) for use in *QQ'*s trade or business. *RR* begins to manufacture the aircraft on February 1, 2027. *QQ* places the aircraft in service on August 1, 2027. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the aircraft meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section because the aircraft was acquired by *QQ* pursuant to a written binding contract entered into before January 1, 2027. Further, the aircraft was placed in service by *QQ* before January 1, 2028. Thus, assuming all other requirements are met, *QQ'*s cost of the aircraft is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(e) *Computation of depreciation deduction for qualified property*—(1) *Additional first year depreciation deduction*—(i) *Allowable taxable year.* The additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable—


(A) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(B) or (g) of this section, in the taxable year in which the qualified property is placed in service by the taxpayer for use in its trade or business or for the production of income; or


(B) In the taxable year in which the specified plant is planted, or grafted to a plant that has already been planted, by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's farming business, as defined in section 263A(e)(4), if the taxpayer properly made the election to apply section 168(k)(5) (for further guidance, see paragraph (f) of this section).


(ii) *Computation.* Except as provided in paragraph (g)(5) of this section, the allowable additional first year depreciation deduction for qualified property is determined by multiplying the unadjusted depreciable basis, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3), of the qualified property by the applicable percentage. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the additional first year depreciation deduction is not affected by a taxable year of less than 12 months. See paragraph (g)(1) of this section for qualified property placed in service or planted or grafted, as applicable, and disposed of during the same taxable year. See paragraph (g)(5) of this section for qualified property acquired in a like-kind exchange or as a result of an involuntary conversion.


(iii) *Property described in section 168(k)(2)(B).* For purposes of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, the unadjusted depreciable basis, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3), of qualified property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) is limited to the property's unadjusted depreciable basis attributable to the property's manufacture, construction, or production before January 1, 2027. The amounts of unadjusted depreciable basis attributable to the property's manufacture, construction, or production before January 1, 2027, are referred to as “progress expenditures.” Rules similar to the rules in section 4.02(1)(b) of Notice 2007-36 (2007-17 I.R.B. 1000) (see §  601.601(d)(2)(ii)(*b*) of this chapter) apply for determining progress expenditures, regardless of whether the property is manufactured, constructed, or produced for the taxpayer by another person under a written binding contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, or under a written contract that does not meet the definition of a binding contract in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section. The IRS may publish procedural guidance in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(*b*) of this chapter) that provides alternative procedures for complying with this paragraph (e)(1)(iii).


(iv) *Alternative minimum tax*—(A) *In general.* The additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for alternative minimum tax purposes—


(*1*) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(iv)(A)(*2*) of this section, in the taxable year in which the qualified property is placed in service by the taxpayer; or


(*2*) In the taxable year in which a specified plant is planted by the taxpayer, or grafted by the taxpayer to a plant that was previously planted, if the taxpayer properly made the election to apply section 168(k)(5) (for further guidance, see paragraph (f) of this section).


(B) *Special rules.* In general, the additional first year depreciation deduction for alternative minimum tax purposes is based on the unadjusted depreciable basis of the property for alternative minimum tax purposes. However, see paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(E) of this section for qualified property acquired in a like-kind exchange or as a result of an involuntary conversion.


(2) *Otherwise allowable depreciation deduction*—(i) *In general.* Before determining the amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for the qualified property for the placed-in-service year and any subsequent taxable year, the taxpayer must determine the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of the qualified property. This remaining adjusted depreciable basis is equal to the unadjusted depreciable basis, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3), of the qualified property reduced by the amount of the additional first year depreciation allowed or allowable, whichever is greater. The remaining adjusted depreciable basis of the qualified property is then depreciated using the applicable depreciation provisions under the Internal Revenue Code for the qualified property. The remaining adjusted depreciable basis of the qualified property that is MACRS property is also the basis to which the annual depreciation rates in the optional depreciation tables apply (for further guidance, see section 8 of Rev. Proc. 87-57 (1987-2 C.B. 687) and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(*b*) of this chapter). The depreciation deduction allowable for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of the qualified property is affected by a taxable year of less than 12 months.


(ii) *Alternative minimum tax.* For alternative minimum tax purposes, the depreciation deduction allowable for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of the qualified property is based on the remaining adjusted depreciable basis for alternative minimum tax purposes. The remaining adjusted depreciable basis of the qualified property for alternative minimum tax purposes is depreciated using the same depreciation method, recovery period (or useful life in the case of computer software), and convention that apply to the qualified property for regular tax purposes.


(3) *Examples.* This paragraph (e) is illustrated by the following examples:


(i) *Example 1.* On March 1, 2023, *SS,* a calendar-year taxpayer, purchased and placed in service qualified property that costs $1 million and is 5-year property under section 168(e). *SS* depreciates its 5-year property placed in service in 2023 using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. For 2023, *SS* is allowed an 80-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $800,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $1 million multiplied by 0.80). Next, *SS* must reduce the unadjusted depreciable basis of $1 million by the additional first year depreciation deduction of $800,000 to determine the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $200,000. Then, *SS'* depreciation deduction allowable in 2023 for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 is $40,000 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.20 for recovery year 1).


(ii) *Example 2.* On June 1, 2023, *TT,* a calendar-year taxpayer, purchased and placed in service qualified property that costs $1,500,000. The property qualifies for the expensing election under section 179 and is 5-year property under section 168(e). *TT* did not purchase any other section 179 property in 2023. *TT* makes the election under section 179 for the property and depreciates its 5-year property placed in service in 2023 using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. Assume the maximum section 179 deduction for 2023 is $1,000,000. For 2023, *TT* is first allowed a $1,000,000 deduction under section 179. Next, *TT* must reduce the cost of $1,500,000 by the section 179 deduction of $1,000,000 to determine the unadjusted depreciable basis of $500,000. Then, for 2023, *TT* is allowed an 80-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $400,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $500,000 multiplied by 0.80). Next, *TT* must reduce the unadjusted depreciable basis of $500,000 by the additional first year depreciation deduction of $400,000 to determine the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $100,000. Then, *TT'*s depreciation deduction allowable in 2023 for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $100,000 is $20,000 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $100,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.20 for recovery year 1).


(f) *Elections under section 168(k)*—(1) *Election not to deduct additional first year depreciation*—(i) *In general.* A taxpayer may make an election not to deduct the additional first year depreciation for any class of property that is qualified property placed in service during the taxable year. If this election is made, the election applies to all qualified property that is in the same class of property and placed in service in the same taxable year, and no additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for the property placed in service during the taxable year in the class of property, except as provided in § 1.743-1(j)(4)(i)(B)(*1*).


(ii) *Definition of class of property.* For purposes of this paragraph (f)(1), the term *class of property* means:


(A) Except for the property described in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii)(B) and (D), and (f)(2) of this section, each class of property described in section 168(e) (for example, 5-year property);


(B) Water utility property as defined in section 168(e)(5) and depreciated under section 168;


(C) Computer software as defined in, and depreciated under, section 167(f)(1) and § 1.167(a)-14(b);


(D) Qualified improvement property as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(5)(i)(C) and (a)(5)(ii) (acquired by the taxpayer after September 27, 2017, and placed in service by the taxpayer after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2018), and depreciated under section 168;


(E) Each separate production, as defined in § 1.181-3(b), of a qualified film or television production;


(F) Each separate production, as defined in section 181(e)(2), of a qualified live theatrical production; or


(G) Each partner's basis adjustment in partnership assets under section 743(b) for each class of property described in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii)(A) through (F), and (f)(2) of this section (for further guidance, see § 1.743-1(j)(4)(i)(B)(*1*)).


(iii) *Time and manner for making election*—(A) *Time for making election.* Except as provided in paragraph (f)(6) of this section, any election specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section must be made by the due date, including extensions, of the Federal tax return for the taxable year in which the qualified property is placed in service by the taxpayer.


(B) *Manner of making election.* Except as provided in paragraph (f)(6) of this section, any election specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section must be made in the manner prescribed on Form 4562, “Depreciation and Amortization,” and its instructions. The election is made separately by each person owning qualified property (for example, for each member of a consolidated group by the common parent of the group, by the partnership (including a lower-tier partnership; also including basis adjustments in the partnership assets under section 743(b)), or by the S corporation). If Form 4562 is revised or renumbered, any reference in this section to that form shall be treated as a reference to the revised or renumbered form.


(iv) *Failure to make election.* If a taxpayer does not make the election specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section within the time and in the manner prescribed in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, the amount of depreciation allowable for that property under section 167 or 168, as applicable, must be determined for the placed-in-service year and for all subsequent taxable years by taking into account the additional first year depreciation deduction. Thus, any election specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section shall not be made by the taxpayer in any other manner (for example, the election cannot be made through a request under section 446(e) to change the taxpayer's method of accounting).


(2) *Election to apply section 168(k)(5)**for specified plants*—(i) *In general.* A taxpayer may make an election to apply section 168(k)(5) to one or more specified plants that are planted, or grafted to a plant that has already been planted, by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's farming business, as defined in section 263A(e)(4). If this election is made for a specified plant, such plant is not treated as qualified property under section 168(k) and this section in its placed-in-service year.


(ii) *Time and manner for making election*—(A) *Time for making election.* Except as provided in paragraph (f)(6) of this section, any election specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section must be made by the due date, including extensions, of the Federal tax return for the taxable year in which the taxpayer planted or grafted the specified plant to which the election applies.


(B) *Manner of making election.* Except as provided in paragraph (f)(6) of this section, any election specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section must be made in the manner prescribed on Form 4562, “Depreciation and Amortization,” and its instructions. The election is made separately by each person owning specified plants (for example, for each member of a consolidated group by the common parent of the group, by the partnership (including a lower-tier partnership), or by the S corporation). If Form 4562 is revised or renumbered, any reference in this section to that form shall be treated as a reference to the revised or renumbered form.


(iii) *Failure to make election.* If a taxpayer does not make the election specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section for a specified plant within the time and in the manner prescribed in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, the specified plant is treated as qualified property under section 168(k), assuming all requirements are met, in the taxable year in which such plant is placed in service by the taxpayer. Thus, any election specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section shall not be made by the taxpayer in any other manner (for example, the election cannot be made through a request under section 446(e) to change the taxpayer's method of accounting).


(3) *Election for qualified property placed in service during the 2017 taxable year*—(i) *In general.* A taxpayer may make an election to deduct 50 percent, instead of 100 percent, additional first year depreciation for all qualified property acquired after September 27, 2017, by the taxpayer and placed in service by the taxpayer during its taxable year that includes September 28, 2017. If a taxpayer makes an election to apply section 168(k)(5) for its taxable year that includes September 28, 2017, the taxpayer also may make an election to deduct 50 percent, instead of 100 percent, additional first year depreciation for all specified plants that are planted, or grafted to a plant that has already been planted, after September 27, 2017, by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's farming business during such taxable year.


(ii) *Time and manner for making election*—(A) *Time for making election.* Except as provided in paragraph (f)(6) of this section, any election specified in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section must be made by the due date, including extensions, of the Federal tax return for the taxpayer's taxable year that includes September 28, 2017.


(B) *Manner of making election.* Except as provided in paragraph (f)(6) of this section, any election specified in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section must be made in the manner prescribed on the 2017 Form 4562, “Depreciation and Amortization,” and its instructions. The election is made separately by each person owning qualified property (for example, for each member of a consolidated group by the common parent of the group, by the partnership (including a lower-tier partnership), or by the S corporation).


(iii) *Failure to make election.* If a taxpayer does not make the election specified in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section within the time and in the manner prescribed in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section, the amount of depreciation allowable for qualified property under section 167 or 168, as applicable, acquired and placed in service, or planted or grafted, as applicable, by the taxpayer after September 27, 2017, must be determined for the taxable year that includes September 28, 2017, and for all subsequent taxable years by taking into account the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction, unless the taxpayer makes the election specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section within the time and in the manner prescribed in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section for the class of property in which the qualified property is included. Thus, any election specified in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section shall not be made by the taxpayer in any other manner (for example, the election cannot be made through a request under section 446(e) to change the taxpayer's method of accounting).


(4) *Alternative minimum tax.* If a taxpayer makes an election specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section for a class of property or in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for a specified plant, the depreciation adjustments under section 56 and the regulations in this part under section 56 do not apply to the property or specified plant, as applicable, to which that election applies for purposes of computing the taxpayer's alternative minimum taxable income. If a taxpayer makes an election specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section for all qualified property, see paragraphs (e)(1)(iv) and (e)(2)(ii) of this section.


(5) *Revocation of election*-(i) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(5)(ii) and (f)(6) of this section, an election specified in this paragraph (f), once made, may be revoked only by filing a request for a private letter ruling and obtaining the Commissioner of Internal Revenue's written consent to revoke the election. The Commissioner may grant a request to revoke the election if the taxpayer acted reasonably and in good faith, and the revocation will not prejudice the interests of the Government. See generally § 301.9100-3 of this chapter. An election specified in this paragraph (f) may not be revoked through a request under section 446(e) to change the taxpayer's method of accounting.


(ii) *Automatic 6-month extension.* If a taxpayer made an election specified in this paragraph (f), an automatic extension of 6 months from the due date of the taxpayer's Federal tax return, excluding extensions, for the placed-in-service year or the taxable year in which the specified plant is planted or grafted, as applicable, is granted to revoke that election, provided the taxpayer timely filed the taxpayer's Federal tax return for the placed-in-service year or the taxable year in which the specified plant is planted or grafted, as applicable, and, within this 6-month extension period, the taxpayer, and all taxpayers whose tax liability would be affected by the election, file an amended Federal tax return for the placed-in-service year or the taxable year in which the specified plant is planted or grafted, as applicable, in a manner that is consistent with the revocation of the election.


(6) *Special rules for 2016 and 2017 returns.* For an election specified in this paragraph (f) for qualified property placed in service, or for a specified plant that is planted, or grafted to a plant that has already been planted, by the taxpayer during its taxable year that included September 28, 2017, the taxpayer should refer to Rev. Proc. 2019-33 (2019-34 I.R.B. 662) (see 

§ 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(*b*) of this chapter) for the time and manner of making the election on the 2016 or 2017 Federal tax return.


(7) *Additional procedural guidance.* The IRS may publish procedural guidance in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(*b*) of this chapter) that provides alternative procedures for complying with paragraph (f)(1)(iii), (f)(1)(iv), (f)(2)(ii), (f)(2)(iii), (f)(3)(ii), (f)(3)(iii), or (f)(5)(i) of this section.


(g) *Special rules*—(1) *Property placed in service and disposed of in the same taxable year*—(i) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraphs (g)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section and by the application of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B)(*4*) of this section, the additional first year depreciation deduction is not allowed for qualified property placed in service or planted or grafted, as applicable, and disposed of during the same taxable year. If a partnership interest is acquired and disposed of during the same taxable year, the additional first year depreciation deduction is not allowed for any section 743(b) adjustment arising from the initial acquisition. Also, if qualified property is placed in service and disposed of during the same taxable year and then reacquired and again placed in service in a subsequent taxable year, the additional first year depreciation deduction is not allowable for the property in the subsequent taxable year, except as otherwise provided by the application of paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section.


(ii) *Technical termination of a partnership.* In the case of a technical termination of a partnership under section 708(b)(1)(B) in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, the additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for any qualified property placed in service or planted or grafted, as applicable, by the terminated partnership during the taxable year of termination and contributed by the terminated partnership to the new partnership. The allowable additional first year depreciation deduction for the qualified property shall not be claimed by the terminated partnership but instead shall be claimed by the new partnership for the new partnership's taxable year in which the qualified property was contributed by the terminated partnership to the new partnership. However, if qualified property is both placed in service or planted or grafted, as applicable, and contributed to a new partnership in a transaction described in section 708(b)(1)(B) by the terminated partnership during the taxable year of termination, and if such property is disposed of by the new partnership in the same taxable year the new partnership received such property from the terminated partnership, then no additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable to either partnership.


(iii) *Section 168(i)(7) transactions.* If any qualified property is transferred in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7) in the same taxable year that the qualified property is placed in service or planted or grafted, as applicable, by the transferor, the additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for the qualified property. If a partnership interest is purchased and transferred in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7) in the same taxable year, the additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for any section 743(b) adjustment that arises from the initial acquisition with respect to qualified property held by the partnership, provided the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(D) of this section and all other requirements of section 168(k) and this section are satisfied. The allowable additional first year depreciation deduction for the qualified property for the transferor's taxable year in which the property is placed in service or planted or grafted, as applicable, is allocated between the transferor and the transferee on a monthly basis. The allowable additional first year depreciation deduction for a section 743(b) adjustment with respect to qualified property held by the partnership is allocated between the transferor and the transferee on a monthly basis notwithstanding that under § 1.743-1(f) a transferee's section 743(b) adjustment is determined without regard to a transferors section 743(b) adjustment. These allocations shall be made in accordance with the rules in § 1.168(d)-1(b)(7)(ii) for allocating the depreciation deduction between the transferor and the transferee. However, solely for purposes of this section, if the qualified property is transferred in a section 721(a) transaction to a partnership that has as a partner a person, other than the transferor, who previously had a depreciable interest in the qualified property, in the same taxable year that the qualified property is acquired or planted or grafted, as applicable, by the transferor, the qualified property is deemed to be placed in service or planted or grafted, as applicable, by the transferor during that taxable year, and the allowable additional first year depreciation deduction is allocated entirely to the transferor and not to the partnership. Additionally, if qualified property is both placed in service or planted or grafted, as applicable, and transferred in a transaction described in section 168(i)(7) by the transferor during the same taxable year, and if such property is disposed of by the transferee, other than by a transaction described in section 168(i)(7), during the same taxable year the transferee received such property from the transferor, then no additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable to either party.


(iv) *Examples.* The application of this paragraph (g)(1) is illustrated by the following examples:


(A) *Example 1. UU* and *VV* are equal partners in *Partnership JL,* a general partnership. *Partnership JL* is a calendar-year taxpayer. On October 1, 2017, *Partnership JL* purchased and placed in service qualified property at a cost of $30,000. On November 1, 2017, *UU* sells its entire 50 percent interest to *WW* in a transfer that terminates the partnership under section 708(b)(1)(B). As a result, terminated *Partnership JL* is deemed to have contributed the qualified property to new *Partnership JL.* Pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, new *Partnership JL,* not terminated *Partnership JL,* is eligible to claim the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the qualified property for the taxable year 2017, assuming all other requirements are met.


(B) *Example 2.* On January 5, 2018, *XX* purchased and placed in service qualified property for a total amount of $9,000. On August 20, 2018, *XX* transferred this qualified property to *Partnership BC* in a transaction described in section 721(a). No other partner of *Partnership BC* has ever had a depreciable interest in the qualified property. *XX* and *Partnership BC* are calendar-year taxpayers. Because the transaction between *XX* and *Partnership BC* is a transaction described in section 168(i)(7), pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section, the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the qualified property is allocated between *XX* and *Partnership BC* in accordance with the rules in § 1.168(d)-1(b)(7)(ii) for allocating the depreciation deduction between the transferor and the transferee. Accordingly, the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction allowable of $9,000 for the qualified property for 2018 is allocated between *XX* and *Partnership BC* based on the number of months that *XX* and *Partnership BC* held the qualified property in service during 2018. Thus, because the qualified property was held in service by *XX* for 7 of 12 months, which includes the month in which *XX* placed the qualified property in service but does not include the month in which the qualified property was transferred, *XX* is allocated $5,250 (
7/12 × $9,000 additional first year depreciation deduction). *Partnership BC* is allocated $3,750, the remaining 
5/12 of the $9,000 additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the qualified property.


(2) *Redetermination of basis.* If the unadjusted depreciable basis, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3), of qualified property is redetermined (for example, due to contingent purchase price or discharge of indebtedness) before January 1, 2027, or in the case of property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C), is redetermined before January 1, 2028, the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the qualified property is redetermined as follows:


(i) *Increase in basis.* For the taxable year in which an increase in basis of qualified property occurs, the taxpayer shall claim an additional first year depreciation deduction for qualified property by multiplying the amount of the increase in basis for this property by the applicable percentage for the taxable year in which the underlying property was placed in service by the taxpayer. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2)(i), the additional first year depreciation deduction applies to the increase in basis only if the underlying property is qualified property. To determine the amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for the increase in basis of qualified property, the amount of the increase in basis of the qualified property must be reduced by the additional first year depreciation deduction allowed or allowable, whichever is greater, for the increase in basis and the remaining increase in basis of—


(A) Qualified property, except for computer software described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, a qualified film or television production described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E) of this section, or a qualified live theatrical production described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(F) of this section, is depreciated over the recovery period of the qualified property remaining as of the beginning of the taxable year in which the increase in basis occurs, and using the same depreciation method and convention applicable to the qualified property that applies for the taxable year in which the increase in basis occurs; and


(B) Computer software, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, that is qualified property is depreciated ratably over the remainder of the 36-month period, the useful life under section 167(f)(1), as of the beginning of the first day of the month in which the increase in basis occurs.


(ii) *Decrease in basis.* For the taxable year in which a decrease in basis of qualified property occurs, the taxpayer shall reduce the total amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for all of the taxpayer's depreciable property by the excess additional first year depreciation deduction previously claimed for the qualified property. If, for such taxable year, the excess additional first year depreciation deduction exceeds the total amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for all of the taxpayer's depreciable property, the taxpayer shall take into account a negative depreciation deduction in computing taxable income. The excess additional first year depreciation deduction for qualified property is determined by multiplying the amount of the decrease in basis for this property by the applicable percentage for the taxable year in which the underlying property was placed in service by the taxpayer. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2)(ii), the additional first year depreciation deduction applies to the decrease in basis only if the underlying property is qualified property. Also, if the taxpayer establishes by adequate records or other sufficient evidence that the taxpayer claimed less than the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the qualified property before the decrease in basis, or if the taxpayer claimed more than the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the qualified property before the decrease in basis, the excess additional first year depreciation deduction is determined by multiplying the amount of the decrease in basis by the additional first year depreciation deduction percentage actually claimed by the taxpayer for the qualified property before the decrease in basis. To determine the amount to reduce the total amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for all of the taxpayer's depreciable property for the excess depreciation previously claimed, other than the additional first year depreciation deduction, resulting from the decrease in basis of the qualified property, the amount of the decrease in basis of the qualified property must be adjusted by the excess additional first year depreciation deduction that reduced the total amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction, as determined under this paragraph (g)(2)(ii), and the remaining decrease in basis of—


(A) Qualified property, except for computer software described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, a qualified film or television production described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E) of this section, or a qualified live theatrical production described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(F) of this section, reduces the amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction over the recovery period of the qualified property remaining as of the beginning of the taxable year in which the decrease in basis occurs, and using the same depreciation method and convention of the qualified property that applies in the taxable year in which the decrease in basis occurs. If, for any taxable year, the reduction to the amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction, as determined under this paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A), exceeds the total amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for all of the taxpayer's depreciable property, the taxpayer shall take into account a negative depreciation deduction in computing taxable income; and


(B) Computer software, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, that is qualified property reduces the amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction over the remainder of the 36-month period, the useful life under section 167(f)(1), as of the beginning of the first day of the month in which the decrease in basis occurs. If, for any taxable year, the reduction to the amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction, as determined under this paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B), exceeds the total amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for all of the taxpayer's depreciable property, the taxpayer shall take into account a negative depreciation deduction in computing taxable income.


(iii) *Definitions.* Except as otherwise expressly provided by the Internal Revenue Code (for example, section 1017(a)), the regulations under the Internal Revenue Code, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin for purposes of this paragraph (g)(2)—


(A) An increase in basis occurs in the taxable year an amount is taken into account under section 461; and


(B) A decrease in basis occurs in the taxable year an amount would be taken into account under section 451.


(iv) *Examples.* The application of this paragraph (g)(2) is illustrated by the following examples:


(A) *Example 1.* (*1*) On May 15, 2023, *YY,* a cash-basis taxpayer, purchased and placed in service qualified property that is 5-year property at a cost of $200,000. In addition to the $200,000, *YY* agrees to pay the seller 25 percent of the gross profits from the operation of the property in 2023. On May 15, 2024, *YY* paid to the seller an additional $10,000. *YY* depreciates the 5-year property placed in service in 2023 using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention.


(*2*) For 2023, *YY* is allowed an 80-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $160,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 multiplied by 0.80). In addition, *YY'*s depreciation deduction for 2023 for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $40,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 reduced by the additional first year depreciation deduction of $160,000) is $8,000 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $40,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.20 for recovery year 1).


(*3*) For 2024, *YY'*s depreciation deduction for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $40,000 is $12,800 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $40,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.32 for recovery year 2). In addition, pursuant to paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, *YY* is allowed an additional first year depreciation deduction for 2024 for the $10,000 increase in basis of the qualified property. Consequently, *YY* is allowed an additional first year depreciation deduction of $8,000 (the increase in basis of $10,000 multiplied by 0.80, the applicable percentage for 2023). Also, *YY* is allowed a depreciation deduction for 2024 attributable to the remaining increase in basis of $2,000 (the increase in basis of $10,000 reduced by the additional first year depreciation deduction of $8,000). The depreciation deduction allowable for 2024 attributable to the remaining increase in basis of $2,000 is $889 (the remaining increase in basis of $2,000 multiplied by 0.4444, which is equal to 1/remaining recovery period of 4.5 years at January 1, 2024, multiplied by 2). Accordingly, for 2024, *YY'*s total depreciation deduction allowable for the qualified property is $21,689 ($12,800 plus $8,000 plus $889).


(B) *Example 2.* (*1*) On May 15, 2023, *ZZ,* a calendar-year taxpayer, purchased and placed in service qualified property that is 5-year property at a cost of $400,000. To purchase the property, *ZZ* borrowed $250,000 from Bank1. On May 15, 2024, Bank1 forgives $50,000 of the indebtedness. *ZZ* makes the election provided in section 108(b)(5) to apply any portion of the reduction under section 1017 to the basis of the depreciable property of the taxpayer. *ZZ* depreciates the 5-year property placed in service in 2023 using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention.


(*2*) For 2023, *ZZ* is allowed an 80-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $320,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $400,000 multiplied by 0.80). In addition, *ZZ'*s depreciation deduction allowable for 2023 for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $80,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $400,000 reduced by the additional first year depreciation deduction of $320,000) is $16,000 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $80,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.20 for recovery year 1).


(*3*) For 2024, *ZZ'*s deduction for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $80,000 is $25,600 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $80,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate 0.32 for recovery year 2). Although Bank1 forgave the indebtedness in 2024, the basis of the property is reduced on January 1, 2025, pursuant to sections 108(b)(5) and 1017(a) under which basis is reduced at the beginning of the taxable year following the taxable year in which the discharge of indebtedness occurs.


(*4*) For 2025, *ZZ'*s deduction for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $80,000 is $15,360 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $80,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate 0.192 for recovery year 3). However, pursuant to paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, *ZZ* must reduce the amount otherwise allowable as a depreciation deduction for 2025 by the excess depreciation previously claimed for the $50,000 decrease in basis of the qualified property. Consequently, *ZZ* must reduce the amount of depreciation otherwise allowable for 2025 by the excess additional first year depreciation of $40,000 (the decrease in basis of $50,000 multiplied by 0.80, the applicable percentage for 2023). Also, *ZZ* must reduce the amount of depreciation otherwise allowable for 2025 by the excess depreciation attributable to the remaining decrease in basis of $10,000 (the decrease in basis of $50,000 reduced by the excess additional first year depreciation of $40,000). The reduction in the amount of depreciation otherwise allowable for 2025 for the remaining decrease in basis of $10,000 is $5,714 (the remaining decrease in basis of $10,000 multiplied by 0.5714, which is equal to (1/remaining recovery period of 3.5 years at January 1, 2025, multiplied by 2). Accordingly, assuming the qualified property is the only depreciable property owned by *ZZ,* for 2025, *ZZ* has a negative depreciation deduction for the qualified property of $30,354 ($15,360 minus $40,000 minus $5,714).


(3) *Sections 1245 and 1250 depreciation recapture.* For purposes of section 1245 and §§ 1.1245-1 through -6, the additional first year depreciation deduction is an amount allowed or allowable for depreciation. Further, for purposes of section 1250(b) and § 1.1250-2, the additional first year depreciation deduction is not a straight line method.


(4) *Coordination with section 169.* The additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable in the placed-in-service year of a certified pollution control facility, as defined in § 1.169-2(a), that is qualified property even if the taxpayer makes the election to amortize the certified pollution control facility under section 169 and §§ 1.169-1 through -4 in the certified pollution control facility's placed-in-service year.


(5) *Like-kind exchanges and involuntary conversions*—(i) *Scope.* The rules of this paragraph (g)(5) apply to replacement MACRS property or replacement computer software that is qualified property at the time of replacement provided the time of replacement is after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2027; or, in the case of replacement MACRS property or replacement computer software that is qualified property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C), the time of replacement is after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2028.


(ii) *Definitions.* For purposes of this paragraph (g)(5), the following definitions apply:


(A) *Replacement MACRS property* has the same meaning as that term is defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(1).


(B) *Relinquished MACRS property* has the same meaning as that term is defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(2).


(C) *Replacement computer software* is computer software, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, in the hands of the acquiring taxpayer that is acquired for other computer software in a like-kind exchange or in an involuntary conversion.


(D) *Relinquished computer software* is computer software that is transferred by the taxpayer in a like-kind exchange or in an involuntary conversion.


(E) *Time of disposition* has the same meaning as that term is defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(3) for relinquished MACRS property. For relinquished computer software, *time of disposition* is when the disposition of the relinquished computer software takes place under the convention determined under § 1.167(a)-14(b).


(F) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(5)(iv) of this section, the *time of replacement* has the same meaning as that term is defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(4) for replacement MACRS property. For replacement computer software, the *time of replacement* is, except as provided in paragraph (g)(5)(iv) of this section, the later of—


(*1*) When the replacement computer software is placed in service under the convention determined under § 1.167(a)-14(b); or


(*2*) The time of disposition of the relinquished property.


(G) *Exchanged basis* has the same meaning as that term is defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(7) for MACRS property, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(2). For computer software, the *exchanged basis* is determined after the amortization deductions for the year of disposition are determined under § 1.167(a)-14(b) and is the lesser of—


(*1*) The basis in the replacement computer software, as determined under section 1031(d) and § 1.1031(d)-1, 1.1031(d)-2, 1.1031(j)-1, or 1.1031(k)-1; or section 1033(b) and § 1.1033(b)-1; or


(*2*) The adjusted depreciable basis of the relinquished computer software.


(H) *Excess basis* has the same meaning as that term is defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(8) for replacement MACRS property. For replacement computer software, the *excess basis* is any excess of the basis in the replacement computer software, as determined under section 1031(d) and § 1.1031(d)-1, 1.1031(d)-2, 1.1031(j)-1, or 1.1031(k)-1; or section 1033(b) and § 1.1033(b)-1, over the exchanged basis as determined under paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(G) of this section.


(I) *Remaining exchanged basis* is the exchanged basis as determined under paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(G) of this section reduced by—


(*1*) The percentage of such basis attributable to the taxpayer's use of property for the taxable year other than in the taxpayer's trade or business or for the production of income; and


(*2*) Any adjustments to basis provided by other provisions of the Code and the regulations under the Code (including section 1016(a)(2) and (3)) for periods prior to the disposition of the relinquished property.


(J) *Remaining excess basis* is the excess basis as determined under paragraph (g)(5)(ii)(H) of this section reduced by—


(*1*) The percentage of such basis attributable to the taxpayer's use of property for the taxable year other than in the taxpayer's trade or business or for the production of income;


(*2*) Any portion of the basis the taxpayer properly elects to treat as an expense under section 179 or 179C; and


(*3*) Any adjustments to basis provided by other provisions of the Code and the regulations under the Code.


(K) *Year of disposition* has the same meaning as that term is defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(5).


(L) *Year of replacement* has the same meaning as that term is defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(6).


(M) *Like-kind exchange* has the same meaning as that term is defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(11).


(N) *Involuntary conversion* has the same meaning as that term is defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(12).


(iii) *Computation*—(A) *In general.* If the replacement MACRS property or the replacement computer software, as applicable, meets the original use requirement in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and all other requirements of section 168(k) and this section, the remaining exchanged basis for the year of replacement and the remaining excess basis, if any, for the year of replacement for the replacement MACRS property or the replacement computer software, as applicable, are eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section. If the replacement MACRS property or the replacement computer software, as applicable, meets the used property acquisition requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and all other requirements of section 168(k) and this section, only the remaining excess basis for the year of replacement for the replacement MACRS property or the replacement computer software, as applicable, is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section. See paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A)(*3*) of this section. The additional first year depreciation deduction applies to the remaining exchanged basis and any remaining excess basis, as applicable, of the replacement MACRS property or the replacement computer software, as applicable, if the time of replacement is after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2027; or, in the case of replacement MACRS property or replacement computer software, as applicable, described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C), the time of replacement is after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2028. The additional first year depreciation deduction is computed separately for the remaining exchanged basis and any remaining excess basis, as applicable.


(B) *Year of disposition and year of replacement.* The additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for the replacement MACRS property or replacement computer software in the year of replacement. However, the additional first year depreciation deduction is not allowable for the relinquished MACRS property or the relinquished computer software, as applicable, if the relinquished MACRS property or the relinquished computer software, as applicable, is placed in service and disposed of in a like-kind exchange or in an involuntary conversion in the same taxable year.


(C) *Property described in section 168(k)(2)(B).* For purposes of paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, the total of the remaining exchanged basis and the remaining excess basis, if any, of the replacement MACRS property that is qualified property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) and meets the original use requirement in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section is limited to the total of the property's remaining exchanged basis and remaining excess basis, if any, attributable to the property's manufacture, construction, or production after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2027. For purposes of paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, the remaining excess basis, if any, of the replacement MACRS property that is qualified property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) and meets the used property acquisition requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section is limited to the property's remaining excess basis, if any, attributable to the property's manufacture, construction, or production after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2027.


(D) *Effect of § 1.168(i)-6(i)(1) election.* If a taxpayer properly makes the election under § 1.168(i)-6(i)(1) not to apply § 1.168(i)-6 for any MACRS property, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(2), involved in a like-kind exchange or involuntary conversion, then:


(*1*) If the replacement MACRS property meets the original use requirement in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and all other requirements of section 168(k) and this section, the total of the exchanged basis, as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(7), and the excess basis, as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(8), if any, in the replacement MACRS property is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section; or


(*2*) If the replacement MACRS property meets the used property acquisition requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and all other requirements of section 168(k) and this section, only the excess basis, as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(8), if any, in the replacement MACRS property is eligible for the additional first year depreciation deduction under this section.


(E) *Alternative minimum tax.* The additional first year depreciation deduction is allowed for alternative minimum tax purposes for the year of replacement of replacement MACRS property or replacement computer software, as applicable, that is qualified property. If the replacement MACRS property or the replacement computer software, as applicable, meets the original use requirement in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and all other requirements of section 168(k) and this section, the additional first year depreciation deduction for alternative minimum tax purposes is based on the remaining exchanged basis and the remaining excess basis, if any, of the replacement MACRS property or the replacement computer software, as applicable, for alternative minimum tax purposes. If the replacement MACRS property or the replacement computer software, as applicable, meets the used property acquisition requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and all other requirements of section 168(k) and this section, the additional first year depreciation deduction for alternative minimum tax purposes is based on the remaining excess basis, if any, of the replacement MACRS property or the replacement computer software, as applicable, for alternative minimum tax purposes.


(iv) *Replacement MACRS property or replacement computer software that is acquired and placed in service before disposition of relinquished MACRS property or relinquished computer software.* If, in an involuntary conversion, a taxpayer acquires and places in service the replacement MACRS property or the replacement computer software, as applicable, before the time of disposition of the involuntarily converted MACRS property or the involuntarily converted computer software, as applicable; and the time of disposition of the involuntarily converted MACRS property or the involuntarily converted computer software, as applicable, is after December 31, 2026, or, in the case of property described in service 168(k)(2)(B) or (C), after December 31, 2027, then—


(A) The time of replacement for purposes of this paragraph (g)(5) is when the replacement MACRS property or replacement computer software, as applicable, is placed in service by the taxpayer, provided the threat or imminence of requisition or condemnation of the involuntarily converted MACRS property or involuntarily converted computer software, as applicable, existed before January 1, 2027, or, in the case of property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) or (C), existed before January 1, 2028; and


(B) The taxpayer depreciates the replacement MACRS property or replacement computer software, as applicable, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. However, at the time of disposition of the involuntarily converted MACRS property, the taxpayer determines the exchanged basis, as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(7), and the excess basis, as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(8), of the replacement MACRS property and begins to depreciate the depreciable exchanged basis, as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(9), of the replacement MACRS property in accordance with § 1.168(i)-6(c). The depreciable excess basis, as defined in § 1.168(i)-6(b)(10), of the replacement MACRS property continues to be depreciated by the taxpayer in accordance with the first sentence of this paragraph (g)(5)(iv)(B). Further, in the year of disposition of the involuntarily converted MACRS property, the taxpayer must include in taxable income the excess of the depreciation deductions allowable, including the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable, on the unadjusted depreciable basis of the replacement MACRS property over the additional first year depreciation deduction that would have been allowable to the taxpayer on the remaining exchanged basis of the replacement MACRS property at the time of replacement, as defined in paragraph (g)(5)(iv)(A) of this section, plus the depreciation deductions that would have been allowable, including the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable, to the taxpayer on the depreciable excess basis of the replacement MACRS property from the date the replacement MACRS property was placed in service by the taxpayer, taking into account the applicable convention, to the time of disposition of the involuntarily converted MACRS property. Similar rules apply to replacement computer software.


(v) *Examples.* The application of this paragraph (g)(5) is illustrated by the following examples:


(A) *Example 1.* (*1*) In April 2016, *CSK,* a calendar-year corporation, acquired for $200,000 and placed in service Canopy V1, a gas station canopy. Canopy V1 is qualified property under section 168(k)(2), as in effect on the day before amendment by the Act, and is 5-year property under section 168(e). *CSK* depreciated Canopy V1 under the general depreciation system of section 168(a) by using the 200-percent declining balance method of depreciation, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. *CSK* elected to use the optional depreciation tables to compute the depreciation allowance for Canopy V1. In November 2017, Canopy V1 was destroyed in a fire and was no longer usable in *CSK'*s business. In December 2017, in an involuntary conversion, *CSK* acquired and placed in service Canopy W1 with all of the $160,000 of insurance proceeds *CSK* received due to the loss of Canopy V1. Canopy W1 is qualified property under section 168(k)(2) and this section, and is 5-year property under section 168(e). Canopy W1 also meets the original use requirement in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. *CSK* did not make the election under § 1.168(i)-6(i)(1).


(*2*) For 2016, *CSK* is allowed a 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $100,000 for Canopy V1 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 multiplied by 0.50), and a regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $20,000 for Canopy V1 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $100,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.20 for recovery year 1).


(*3*) For 2017, *CSK* is allowed a regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $16,000 for Canopy V1 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $100,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.32 for recovery year 2 × 
1/2 year).


(*4*) Pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for Canopy W1 for 2017 equals $64,000 (100 percent of Canopy W1's remaining exchanged basis at the time of replacement of $64,000 (Canopy V1's remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $100,000 minus 2016 regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $20,000 minus 2017 regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $16,000)).


(B) *Example 2.* (*1*) The facts are the same as in *Example 1* of paragraph (g)(5)(v)(A)(*1*) of this section, except *CSK* elected not to deduct the additional first year depreciation for 5-year property placed in service in 2016. *CSK* deducted the additional first year depreciation for 5-year property placed in service in 2017.


(*2*) For 2016, *CSK* is allowed a regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $40,000 for Canopy V1 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.20 for recovery year 1).


(*3*) For 2017, *CSK* is allowed a regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $32,000 for Canopy V1 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.32 for recovery year 2 × 
1/2 year).


(*4*) Pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for Canopy W1 for 2017 equals $128,000 (100 percent of Canopy W1's remaining exchanged basis at the time of replacement of $128,000 (Canopy V1's unadjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 minus 2016 regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $40,000 minus 2017 regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $32,000)).


(C) *Example 3.* The facts are the same as in *Example 1* of paragraph (g)(5)(v)(A)(*1*) of this section, except Canopy W1 meets the used property acquisition requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Because the remaining excess basis of Canopy W1 is zero, *CSK* is not allowed any additional first year depreciation for Canopy W1 pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section.


(D) *Example 4.* (*1*) In December 2016, *AB,* a calendar-year corporation, acquired for $10,000 and placed in service Computer X2. Computer X2 is qualified property under section 168(k)(2), as in effect on the day before amendment by the Act, and is 5-year property under section 168(e). *AB* depreciated Computer X2 under the general depreciation system of section 168(a) by using the 200-percent declining balance method of depreciation, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. *AB* elected to use the optional depreciation tables to compute the depreciation allowance for Computer X2. In November 2017, *AB* acquired Computer Y2 by exchanging Computer X2 and $1,000 cash in a like-kind exchange. Computer Y2 is qualified property under section 168(k)(2) and this section, and is 5-year property under section 168(e). Computer Y2 also meets the original use requirement in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. *AB* did not make the election under § 1.168(i)-6(i)(1).


(*2*) For 2016, *AB* is allowed a 50-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $5,000 for Computer X2 (unadjusted basis of $10,000 multiplied by 0.50), and a regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $1,000 for Computer X2 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $5,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.20 for recovery year 1).


(*3*) For 2017, *AB* is allowed a regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $800 for Computer X2 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $5,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.32 for recovery year 2 × 
1/2 year).


(*4*) Pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction for Computer Y2 for 2017 is allowable for the remaining exchanged basis at the time of replacement of $3,200 (Computer X2's unadjusted depreciable basis of $10,000 minus additional first year depreciation deduction allowable of $5,000 minus the 2016 regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $1,000 minus the 2017 regular MACRS depreciation deduction of $800) and for the remaining excess basis at the time of replacement of $1,000 (cash paid for Computer Y2). Thus, the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for Computer Y2 totals $4,200 for 2017.


(E) *Example 5.* (*1*) In July 2017, *BC,* a calendar-year corporation, acquired for $20,000 and placed in service Equipment X3. Equipment X3 is qualified property under section 168(k)(2), as in effect on the day before amendment by the Act, and is 5-year property under section 168(e). *BC* depreciated Equipment X3 under the general depreciation system of section 168(a) by using the 200-percent declining balance method of depreciation, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. *BC* elected to use the optional depreciation tables to compute the depreciation allowance for Equipment X3. In December 2017, *BC* acquired Equipment Y3 by exchanging Equipment X3 and $5,000 cash in a like-kind exchange. Equipment Y3 is qualified property under section 168(k)(2) and this section, and is 5-year property under section 168(e). Equipment Y3 also meets the used property acquisition requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. *BC* did not make the election under § 1.168(i)-6(i)(1).


(*2*) Pursuant to § 1.168(k)-1(f)(5)(iii)(B), no additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for Equipment X3 and, pursuant to § 1.168(d)-1(b)(3)(ii), no regular depreciation deduction is allowable for Equipment X3, for 2017.


(*3*) Pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, no additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for Equipment Y3's remaining exchanged basis at the time of replacement of $20,000 (Equipment X3's unadjusted depreciable basis of $20,000). However, pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for Equipment Y3's remaining excess basis at the time of replacement of $5,000 (cash paid for Equipment Y3). Thus, the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for Equipment Y3 is $5,000 for 2017.


(F) *Example 6.* (*1*) The facts are the same as in *Example 5* of paragraph (g)(5)(v)(E)(*1*) of this section, except *BC* properly makes the election under § 1.168(i)-6(i)(1) not to apply § 1.168(i)-6 to Equipment X3 and Equipment Y3.


(*2*) Pursuant to § 1.168(k)-1(f)(5)(iii)(B), no additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for Equipment X3 and, pursuant to § 1.168(d)-1(b)(3)(ii), no regular depreciation deduction is allowable for Equipment X3, for 2017.


(*3*) Pursuant to § 1.168(i)-6(i)(1), *BC* is treated as placing Equipment Y3 in service in December 2017 with a basis of $25,000 (the total of the exchanged basis of $20,000 and the excess basis of $5,000). However, pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(iii)(D)(*2*) of this section, the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable only for Equipment Y3's excess basis at the time of replacement of $5,000 (cash paid for Equipment Y3). Thus, the 100-percent additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for Equipment Y3 is $5,000 for 2017.


(6) *Change in use*—(i) *Change in use of MACRS property.* The determination of whether the use of MACRS property, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(2), changes is made in accordance with section 168(i)(5) and § 1.168(i)-4.


(ii) *Conversion to personal use.* If qualified property is converted from business or income-producing use to personal use in the same taxable year in which the property is placed in service by a taxpayer, the additional first year depreciation deduction is not allowable for the property.


(iii) *Conversion to business or income-producing use*—(A) *During the same taxable year.* If, during the same taxable year, property is acquired by a taxpayer for personal use and is converted by the taxpayer from personal use to business or income-producing use, the additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for the property in the taxable year the property is converted to business or income-producing use, assuming all of the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section are met. See paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section relating to the original use rules for a conversion of property to business or income-producing use. See § 1.168(i)-4(b)(1) for determining the depreciable basis of the property at the time of conversion to business or income-producing use.


(B) *Subsequent to the acquisition year.* If property is acquired by a taxpayer for personal use and, during a subsequent taxable year, is converted by the taxpayer from personal use to business or income-producing use, the additional first year depreciation deduction is allowable for the property in the taxable year the property is converted to business or income-producing use, assuming all of the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section are met. For purposes of paragraphs (b)(4) and (5) of this section, the property must be acquired by the taxpayer for personal use after September 27, 2017, and converted by the taxpayer from personal use to business or income-producing use by January 1, 2027. See paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section relating to the original use rules for a conversion of property to business or income-producing use. See § 1.168(i)-4(b)(1) for determining the depreciable basis of the property at the time of conversion to business or income-producing use.


(iv) *Depreciable property changes use subsequent to the placed-in-service year.* (A) If the use of qualified property changes in the hands of the same taxpayer subsequent to the taxable year the qualified property is placed in service and, as a result of the change in use, the property is no longer qualified property, the additional first year depreciation deduction allowable for the qualified property is not redetermined.


(B) If depreciable property is not qualified property in the taxable year the property is placed in service by the taxpayer, the additional first year depreciation deduction is not allowable for the property even if a change in the use of the property subsequent to the taxable year the property is placed in service results in the property being qualified property in the taxable year of the change in use.


(v) *Examples.* The application of this paragraph (g)(6) is illustrated by the following examples:


(A) *Example 1.* (*1*) On January 1, 2019, *FFF,* a calendar year corporation, purchased and placed in service several new computers at a total cost of $100,000. *FFF* used these computers within the United States for 3 months in 2019 and then moved and used the computers outside the United States for the remainder of 2019. On January 1, 2020, *FFF* permanently returns the computers to the United States for use in its business.


(*2*) For 2019, the computers are considered as used predominantly outside the United States in 2019 pursuant to § 1.48-1(g)(1)(i). As a result, the computers are required to be depreciated under the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g). Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the computers are not qualified property in 2019, the placed-in-service year. Thus, pursuant to paragraph (g)(6)(iv)(B) of this section, no additional first year depreciation deduction is allowed for these computers, regardless of the fact that the computers are permanently returned to the United States in 2020.


(B) *Example 2.* (*1*) On February 8, 2023, *GGG,* a calendar year corporation, purchased and placed in service new equipment at a cost of $1,000,000 for use in its California plant. The equipment is 5-year property under section 168(e) and is qualified property under section 168(k). *GGG* depreciates its 5-year property placed in service in 2023 using the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200-percent declining balance method, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. On June 4, 2024, due to changes in *GGG'*s business circumstances, *GGG* permanently moves the equipment to its plant in Mexico.


(*2*) For 2023, *GGG* is allowed an 80-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $800,000 (the adjusted depreciable basis of $1,000,000 multiplied by 0.80). In addition, *GGG'*s depreciation deduction allowable in 2023 for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $1,000,000 reduced by the additional first year depreciation deduction of $800,000) is $40,000 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 multiplied by the annual depreciation rate of 0.20 for recovery year 1).


(*3*) For 2024, the equipment is considered as used predominantly outside the United States pursuant to § 1.48-1(g)(1)(i). As a result of this change in use, the adjusted depreciable basis of $160,000 for the equipment is required to be depreciated under the alternative depreciation system of section 168(g) beginning in 2024. However, the additional first year depreciation deduction of $800,000 allowed for the equipment in 2023 is not redetermined.


(7) *Earnings and profits.* The additional first year depreciation deduction is not allowable for purposes of computing earnings and profits.


(8) *Limitation of amount of depreciation for certain passenger automobiles.* For a passenger automobile as defined in section 280F(d)(5), the limitation under section 280F(a)(1)(A)(i) is increased by $8,000 for qualified property acquired and placed in service by a taxpayer after September 27, 2017.


(9) *Coordination with section 47*—(i) *In general.* If qualified rehabilitation expenditures, as defined in section 47(c)(2) and § 1.48-12(c), incurred by a taxpayer with respect to a qualified rehabilitated building, as defined in section 47(c)(1) and § 1.48-12(b), are qualified property, the taxpayer may claim the rehabilitation credit provided by section 47(a), provided the requirements of section 47 are met—


(A) With respect to the portion of the basis of the qualified rehabilitated building that is attributable to the qualified rehabilitation expenditures if the taxpayer makes the applicable election under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section not to deduct any additional first year depreciation for the class of property that includes the qualified rehabilitation expenditures; or


(B) With respect to the portion of the remaining rehabilitated basis of the qualified rehabilitated building that is attributable to the qualified rehabilitation expenditures if the taxpayer claims the additional first year depreciation deduction on the unadjusted depreciable basis, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3) but before the reduction in basis for the amount of the rehabilitation credit, of the qualified rehabilitation expenditures; and the taxpayer depreciates the remaining adjusted depreciable basis, as defined in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, of such expenditures using straight line cost recovery in accordance with section 47(c)(2)(B)(i) and § 1.48-12(c)(7)(i). For purposes of this paragraph (g)(9)(i)(B), the remaining rehabilitated basis is equal to the unadjusted depreciable basis, as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3) but before the reduction in basis for the amount of the rehabilitation credit, of the qualified rehabilitation expenditures that are qualified property reduced by the additional first year depreciation allowed or allowable, whichever is greater.


(ii) *Example.* The application of this paragraph (g)(9) is illustrated by the following example:


(A) Between February 8, 2023, and June 4, 2023, *JM,* a calendar-year taxpayer, incurred qualified rehabilitation expenditures of $200,000 with respect to a qualified rehabilitated building that is nonresidential real property under section 168(e). These qualified rehabilitation expenditures are qualified property and qualify for the 20-percent rehabilitation credit under section 47(a)(1). *JM'*s basis in the qualified rehabilitated building is zero before incurring the qualified rehabilitation expenditures and *JM* placed the qualified rehabilitated building in service in July 2023. *JM* depreciates its nonresidential real property placed in service in 2023 under the general depreciation system of section 168(a) by using the straight line method of depreciation, a 39-year recovery period, and the mid-month convention. *JM* elected to use the optional depreciation tables to compute the depreciation allowance for its depreciable property placed in service in 2023. Further, for 2023, *JM* did not make any election under paragraph (f) of this section.


(B) Because *JM* did not make any election under paragraph (f) of this section, *JM* is allowed an 80-percent additional first year depreciation deduction of $160,000 for the qualified rehabilitation expenditures for 2023 (the unadjusted depreciable basis of $200,000 (before reduction in basis for the rehabilitation credit) multiplied by 0.80). *JM* also is allowed to claim a rehabilitation credit of $8,000 for the remaining rehabilitated basis of $40,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis (before reduction in basis for the rehabilitation credit) of $200,000 less the additional first year depreciation deduction of $160,000, multiplied by 0.20 to calculate the rehabilitation credit). For 2023, the ratable share of the rehabilitation credit of $8,000 is $1,600. Further, *JM'*s depreciation deduction for 2023 for the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $32,000 (the unadjusted depreciable basis (before reduction in basis for the rehabilitation credit) of $200,000 less the additional first year depreciation deduction of $160,000 less the rehabilitation credit of $8,000) is $376.64 (the remaining adjusted depreciable basis of $32,000 multiplied by the depreciation rate of 0.01177 for recovery year 1, placed in service in month 7).


(10) *Coordination with section 514(a)(3).* The additional first year depreciation deduction is not allowable for purposes of section 514(a)(3).


(11) *Mid-quarter convention.* In determining whether the mid-quarter convention applies for a taxable year under section 168(d)(3) and § 1.168(d)-1, the depreciable basis, as defined in § 1.168(d)-1(b)(4), for the taxable year the qualified property is placed in service by the taxpayer is not reduced by the allowed or allowable additional first year depreciation deduction for that taxable year. See § 1.168(d)-1(b)(4).


(h) *Applicability dates*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section, this section applies to—


(i) Depreciable property acquired after September 27, 2017, by the taxpayer and placed in service by the taxpayer during or after the taxpayer's taxable year that begins on or after January 1, 2021;


(ii) A specified plant for which the taxpayer properly made an election to apply section 168(k)(5) and that is planted, or grafted to a plant that was previously planted, by the taxpayer during or after the taxpayer's taxable year that begins on or after January 1, 2021; and


(iii) Components acquired or self-constructed after September 27, 2017, of larger self-constructed property described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and placed in service by the taxpayer during or after the taxpayer's taxable year that begins on or after January 1, 2021.
