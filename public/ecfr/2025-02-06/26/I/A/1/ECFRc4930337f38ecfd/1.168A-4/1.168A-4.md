# § 1.168A-4   Definitions.

As used in the regulations under section 168, the term—


(a) “Certifying authority” means the certifying authority designated by the President by Executive order.


(b) “Emergency facility” means any facility, land, building, machinery, or equipment, or any part thereof, the acquisition of which occurred after December 31, 1949, or the construction, reconstruction, erection, or installation of which was completed after such date, and with respect to which a certificate under section 168(e) has been made. In the case of an application for a certificate under section 168(e) which is filed after March 23, 1951, only the part of any such facility which is constructed, reconstructed, erected, or installed by any person not earlier than six months prior to the filing of such application, and which is certified in accordance with section 168(e), shall be deemed to be an emergency facility, notwithstanding that the other part of such facility was constructed, reconstructed, erected, or installed earlier than six months prior to the filing of such application. However, if the facility is one described in section 168(e)(2)(C) and the application was filed after September 1, 1958, and on or before December 2, 1958, the preceding sentence shall not apply. The term “emergency facility,” as so defined, may include, among other things, improvements of land, such as the construction of roads, bridges, and airstrips, and the dredging of channels.


(c) “Emergency period” means the period beginning on January 1, 1950, and ending on the date on which the President proclaims that the utilization of a substantial portion of the certified emergency facilities is no longer required in the interest of national defense.
