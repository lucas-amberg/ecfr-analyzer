# ยง 1.168A-6   Depreciation of portion of emergency facility not subject to amortization.

(a) The rule that an amortization deduction with respect to an emergency facility is in lieu of any deduction for depreciation which would otherwise be allowable under section 167 is subject to the exception provided in section 168(f). Under this exception, if the property constituting such facility is depreciable property under section 167 and the regulations thereunder and if the adjusted basis of such facility as computed under section 1011 for purposes other than the amortization deductions is in excess of the adjusted basis computed for the purpose of the amortization deductions, then the excess shall be charged off over the useful life of the facility and recovered through depreciation deductions. Thus, if the construction of an emergency facility is begun on or before December 31, 1949, and completed after such date, no amortization deductions are allowable with respect to the amount attributable to such construction on or before such date (see ยง 1.168A-5). However, if the property constituting such facility is depreciable property under section 167 and the regulations thereunder, then the depreciation deduction provided by such section and regulations is allowable with respect to the amount attributable to such construction on or before December 31, 1949.


(b) Similarly, if only a portion of the construction, reconstruction, erection, installation, or acquisition after December 31, 1949, of an emergency facility has been certified by the certifying authority, and if such facility is depreciable property under section 167 and the regulations thereunder, then the depreciation deduction provided by such section and regulations is allowable with respect to the portion which has not been so certified.


(c) For illustration of the treatment of a depreciable portion of an emergency facility, see example (2) in paragraph (a)(6) of ยง 1.168A-5.
