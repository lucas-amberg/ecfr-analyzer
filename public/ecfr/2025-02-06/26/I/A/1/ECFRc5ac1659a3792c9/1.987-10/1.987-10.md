Paragraph (l) of this section provides examples illustrating the rules of this section.


(2) *Terms defined under prior § 1.987-12.* For purposes of this section, the terms *deferral QBU, deferral QBU owner,**successor QBU, outbound loss QBU,**outbound section 987 loss,* and *qualified successor* have the meaning provided in prior § 1.987-12.


(b) *Scope*—(1) *Owner of a section 987 QBU.* Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, any person that is an owner of a section 987 QBU on the applicable transition date and any person that is the owner of a terminating QBU on the termination date must apply the rules of this section with respect to the section 987 QBU.


(2) *Deferral QBU owner and owner of outbound loss QBU.* Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, a deferral QBU owner or the owner of an outbound loss QBU must apply the rules of this section with respect to the deferral QBU or outbound loss QBU if the deferral event or outbound loss event occurred before the applicable transition date. This paragraph (b)(2) does not apply to the owner of a terminating QBU.


(c) *Transition date*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the transition date for a section 987 QBU, deferral QBU, or outbound loss QBU is the first day of the first taxable year described in § 1.987-15(a)(1), (b), or (c) to which this section applies.


(2) *Terminating QBU*—(i) *In general.* With respect to a terminating QBU, the transition date is the day after the termination date. Until the transition date described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the owner of the terminating QBU must apply the section 987 regulations with respect to the terminating QBU, and any section 987 gain or loss attributable thereto, without regard to any section 987 elections (other than the election described in § 1.987-6(b)(2)(i)(C)).


(ii) *Ordering rule.* In the case of a terminating QBU, the transition rules of this section are applied immediately before the termination, and the consequences of the termination are determined under the section 987 regulations after applying this section.


(d) *Application of the section 987 regulations after the transition date—(1) Owner functional currency net value on the last day of the preceding taxable year.* Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, for purposes of applying § 1.987-4 in the taxable year beginning on the transition date, the owner functional currency net value of a section 987 QBU on the last day of the preceding taxable year under § 1.987-4(d)(1)(i)(B) is determined by translating the assets and liabilities that are attributable to the section 987 QBU on the day before the transition date into the owner's functional currency at the transition exchange rate described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.


(2) *Determination of historic rate.* If a current rate election is not in effect for the taxable year beginning on the transition date, the historic rate for historic items that are attributable to a section 987 QBU on the day before the transition date (other than non-LIFO inventory subject to the simplified inventory method under § 1.987-3(c)(2)(iv)(A)) is the transition exchange rate described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.


(3) *Transition exchange rate*—(i) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, the transition exchange rate is the spot rate applicable to the day before the transition date.


(ii) *Earnings only method.* If an earnings only method described in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section was applied with respect to a section 987 QBU before the transition date, and a current rate election is not in effect in the taxable year beginning on the transition date, the transition exchange rate for each historic item (other than inventory subject to the simplified inventory method under § 1.987-3(c)(2)(iv)(A)) is the pretransition translation rate described in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(C) of this section. This paragraph (d)(3)(ii) does not apply with respect to a terminating QBU.


(e) *Pretransition gain or loss*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, pretransition gain or loss is determined and recognized under this paragraph (e).


(2) *Amount of pretransition gain or loss for an owner that applied an eligible pretransition method*—(i) *Owner of a section 987 QBU.* If an owner of a section 987 QBU described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section applied an eligible pretransition method with respect to the section 987 QBU, the amount of pretransition gain or loss with respect to the section 987 QBU is equal to the sum of the deemed termination amount described in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section and the owner functional currency net value adjustment described in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section. *See* paragraphs (l)(1) through (3) of this section (*Examples 1* through *3*) for an illustration of this rule.


(A) *Deemed termination amount.* The deemed termination amount is the amount of section 987 gain or loss that would have been recognized by the owner under the eligible pretransition method if the section 987 QBU terminated and transferred all of its assets and liabilities to the owner on the day before the transition date and §§ 1.987-12 and 1.987-13 and prior § 1.987-12 did not apply.


(B) *Owner functional currency net value adjustment.* The owner functional currency net value adjustment may be either positive or negative and is equal to the amount described in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B)(*1*) of this section reduced by the amount described in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B)(*2*) of this section.


(*1*) The basis of the assets, reduced by the amount of liabilities, that are attributable to the section 987 QBU on the day before the transition date, translated into the owner's functional currency at the transition exchange rate.


(*2*) The basis of the assets, reduced by the amount of liabilities, that are attributable to the section 987 QBU on the day before the transition date, translated into the owner's functional currency at the pretransition translation rate.


(C) *Pretransition translation rate.* The pretransition translation rate is the rate that would be used under the eligible pretransition method to determine the basis of an asset or the amount of a liability in the hands of the owner of a section 987 QBU if the section 987 QBU transferred all of its assets and liabilities to the owner on the day before the transition date.


(ii) *Deferral QBU owner.* If a deferral QBU owner described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section applied an eligible pretransition method with respect to the deferral QBU, the amount of pretransition gain or loss with respect to the deferral QBU is equal to the deferred section 987 gain or loss (determined under prior § 1.987-12) that was not recognized before the transition date with respect to the deferral QBU.


(iii) *Owner of an outbound loss QBU.* If the owner of an outbound loss QBU described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section applied an eligible pretransition method with respect to the outbound loss QBU, the pretransition loss with respect to the outbound loss QBU is equal to the outbound section 987 loss that was not added to the basis of stock or recognized under prior § 1.987-12 before the transition date with respect to the outbound loss QBU.


(3) *Amount of pretransition gain or loss for an owner that did not apply an eligible pretransition method*—(i) *In general.* If the owner of a section 987 QBU described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section did not apply an eligible pretransition method with respect to the section 987 QBU, the amount of pretransition gain or loss with respect to the section 987 QBU is determined under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. *See* paragraph (l)(4) of this section (*Example 4*) for an illustration of this rule.


(ii) *Computation of pretransition gain or loss.* With respect to a section 987 QBU described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, pretransition gain or loss is equal to the amount described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section reduced by the amount described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.


(A) The sum of the owner's annual unrecognized section 987 gain or loss determined under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section with respect to the section 987 QBU for all taxable years ending before the transition date and beginning after September 7, 2006, in which it was the owner of the section 987 QBU.


(B) The total net amount of section 987 gain or loss recognized by the owner with respect to the section 987 QBU in all taxable years ending before the transition date and beginning after September 7, 2006.


(iii) *Annual unrecognized section 987 gain or loss.* An owner of a section 987 QBU described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section determines annual unrecognized section 987 gain or loss with respect to a section 987 QBU under the rules of § 1.987-4(d), applied as though a current rate election was in effect for all relevant taxable years, and subject to the following modifications—


(A) Only § 1.987-4(d)(1) and (10) (steps 1 and 10) are applied; and


(B) Section 1.987-4(d)(10) is applied by replacing “paragraphs (d)(1) through (9) of this section” with “paragraph (d)(1) of this section.”


(iv) *Deferral QBU owner.* If a deferral QBU owner described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section did not apply an eligible pretransition method with respect to the deferral QBU, the pretransition gain or loss with respect to the deferral QBU is equal to the amount that would be determined under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section with respect to the deferral QBU if the transition date was the day of the deferral event, reduced by the amount of deferred section 987 gain or loss (determined under prior § 1.987-12) recognized before the actual transition date.


(v) *Owner of an outbound loss QBU.* If the owner of an outbound loss QBU described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section did not apply an eligible pretransition method with respect to the outbound loss QBU, the pretransition loss with respect to the outbound loss QBU is equal to the amount that would be determined under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section with respect to the outbound loss QBU if the transition date was the day of the outbound loss event, reduced by any outbound section 987 loss recognized or added to the basis of stock under prior § 1.987-12 before the actual transition date.


(4) *Eligible pretransition method.* An eligible pretransition method means a method of applying section 987 before the transition date that is described in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section. An owner is treated as applying an eligible pretransition method with respect to a section 987 QBU only if it applied an eligible pretransition method with respect to the QBU on a return filed before November 9, 2023.


(i) *Earnings and capital method.* An earnings and capital method is an eligible pretransition method if it is applied in a reasonable manner. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4)(i), an earnings and capital method means a method of applying section 987 that requires section 987 gain or loss to be determined and recognized with respect to both the earnings of the section 987 QBU and capital contributed to the section 987 QBU (for example, the method prescribed in the 1991 proposed regulations under section 987). *See* paragraph (l)(1) of this section (*Example 1*) for an illustration of this rule.


(ii) *Other reasonable methods.* Any reasonable method of applying section 987 is an eligible pretransition method if it produces the same total amount of income over the life of the owner of a section 987 QBU as the method described in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section (taking into account the aggregate of section 987 gain or loss, section 987 taxable income or loss, and income or loss recognized by the owner of the section 987 QBU with respect to property transferred between the section 987 QBU and the owner or any QBU of the owner). *See* paragraph (l)(2) of this section (*Example 2*) for an illustration of this rule.


(iii) *Other earnings only methods.* An earnings only method that does not meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section is an eligible pretransition method, provided that—


(A) The earnings only method was first applied by the owner on a return filed before November 9, 2023;


(B) The earnings only method was applied consistently to all section 987 QBUs of the owner since the first taxable year in which the owner applied an eligible pretransition method; and


(C) The owner of the section 987 QBU otherwise applied section 987 in a reasonable manner. *See* paragraph (l)(3) of this section (*Example 3*) for an illustration of this rule.


(iv) *Error in the application of a section 987 method.* If an owner generally applied section 987 with respect to a section 987 QBU before the transition date under a method described in paragraph (e)(4)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section but made errors in the application of the method or failed to apply the method to every taxable year since the QBU's inception, the owner is considered to have applied an eligible pretransition method with respect to the QBU. However, pretransition gain or loss must be determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section as though the eligible pretransition method was applied without error since the section 987 QBU's inception. *See* paragraph (l)(5) of this section (*Example 5*) for an illustration of this rule.


(v) *Certain consistent practices not treated as errors*—(A) *In general.* If an owner generally applied section 987 with respect to a section 987 QBU before the transition date under a method described in paragraph (e)(4)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section and used a consistent practice described in paragraph (e)(4)(v)(B) of this section for purposes of applying that method, the owner is considered to have applied an eligible pretransition method with respect to the QBU. In addition, the consistent practice is not treated as an error under paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section. Therefore, the owner must take the consistent practice into account in determining pretransition gain or loss under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. *See* paragraph (l)(6) of this section (*Example 6*) for an illustration of this rule.


(B) *Practices not treated as errors*—(*1*) *Reasonable conventions.* The use of a reasonable convention (for example, the use of a yearly average exchange rate rather than the applicable spot rate to translate frequently recurring transfers) is a practice described in this paragraph (e)(4)(v)(B).


(*2*) *Disregarded transactions.* If, in determining the amount of a remittance that requires the recognition of gain or loss under section 987(3), an owner of a QBU consistently disregarded certain transfers to or from the QBU (other than transfers from the QBU to the owner that would be treated as distributions if the QBU were treated as a separate corporation), the owner is considered to have applied a practice described in this paragraph (e)(4)(v)(B) with respect to the QBU, provided that the owner otherwise accounts for the disregarded transfers in a reasonable manner (for example, under the method described in the 1991 proposed regulations, by taking the disregarded transfers into account in computing equity and basis pools so as to properly reflect the owner's net equity in the QBU and its functional currency basis in the QBU).


(vi) *Deferral of section 987 gain or loss until termination is not reasonable.* For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4), a method under which the owner of a section 987 QBU defers the recognition of section 987 gain or loss until the section 987 QBU is terminated, sold, or liquidated is not a reasonable method.


(vii) *Anti-abuse rule.* If an owner changes its pretransition method of applying section 987 with a principal purpose of reducing its pretransition gain or increasing its pretransition loss, the Commissioner may redetermine pretransition gain or loss based on the owner's original method of applying section 987 or by treating the owner as not applying an eligible pretransition method.


(5) *Recognition of pretransition gain or loss*—(i) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section, pretransition gain is recognized under paragraph (e)(5)(i)(A) of this section and pretransition loss is recognized under paragraph (e)(5)(i)(B) of this section.


(A) *Pretransition gain.* Pretransition gain with respect to a section 987 QBU is treated as net accumulated unrecognized section 987 gain (within the meaning of § 1.987-4(c)). Pretransition gain with respect to a deferral QBU is treated as deferred section 987 gain and is attributed to one or more successor deferral QBUs under the principles of § 1.987-12(b)(2) and (c)(2).


(B) *Pretransition loss*—(*1*) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (e)(5)(i)(B)(*2*) of this section, pretransition loss with respect to a section 987 QBU, a deferral QBU, or an outbound loss QBU is treated as suspended section 987 loss with respect to the section 987 QBU, the deferral QBU, or the outbound loss QBU. In the case of a deferral QBU or outbound loss QBU, suspended section 987 loss is attributed to one or more successor suspended loss QBUs under the principles of § 1.987-13(b)(1) and (c)(1).


(*2*) *Current rate election.* If a current rate election is in effect (and an annual recognition election is not in effect) in the taxable year beginning on the transition date, pretransition loss with respect to a section 987 QBU (other than a terminating QBU) is treated as net accumulated unrecognized section 987 loss (within the meaning of § 1.987-4(c)), and pretransition loss with respect to a deferral QBU is treated as deferred section 987 loss and is attributed to one or more successor deferral QBUs under the principles of § 1.987-12(b)(2) and (c)(2).


(ii) *Election to recognize pretransition section 987 gain or loss ratably over the transition period*—(A) *In general.* A taxpayer may elect to recognize pretransition gain or loss ratably over the transition period. If an election is made to recognize pretransition gain or loss ratably over the transition period, then paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section does not apply, and each owner to which the election applies recognizes one tenth of its pretransition gain or loss with respect to each section 987 QBU, original deferral QBU, and outbound loss QBU in each taxable year for ten taxable years beginning with the taxable year that begins on the transition date described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. *See* § 1.987-1(g) for rules relating to section 987 elections (including consistency rules).


(B) *Special rules for certain transactions*—(*1*) *Scope.* This paragraph (e)(5)(ii)(B) applies if a corporation (*acquiring corporation*) acquires the assets of an owner that is subject to an election under paragraph (e)(5)(ii)(A) of this section in a transaction described in section 381(a), and either the owner is a foreign corporation and the acquiring corporation is a domestic corporation or the owner is a domestic corporation and the acquiring corporation is a foreign corporation. This paragraph (e)(5)(ii)(B) also applies to any transaction entered into with a principal purpose of avoiding the recognition of pretransition gain under paragraph (e)(5)(ii)(A) of this section.


(*2*) *Recognition of pretransition gain or loss.* In the case of a transaction described in paragraph (e)(5)(ii)(B)(*1*) of this section, pretransition gain or loss that has not been recognized under paragraph (e)(5)(ii)(A) of this section ceases to be subject to the election to be recognized ratably over the transition period. Any unrecognized pretransition gain is recognized immediately before the transaction, and any unrecognized pretransition loss becomes suspended section 987 loss immediately before the transaction. As a result, the suspended section 987 loss may be recognized to the extent of section 987 gain recognized in the same recognition grouping pursuant to § 1.987-11(e). *See also* § 1.987-13(g) (providing that any remaining suspended section 987 loss does not carry over to the acquiring corporation upon an inbound transaction to which section 381(a) applies).


(C) *Terminating QBU.* This paragraph (e)(5)(ii)(C) applies with respect to a terminating QBU if, in the taxable year beginning on the transition date described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the owner of the terminating QBU elects to recognize pretransition gain or loss ratably over the transition period. Any deferred section 987 gain or loss or suspended section 987 loss with respect to the terminating QBU that was not recognized before the transition date described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is treated as pretransition gain or loss for purposes of this paragraph (e)(5)(ii) (and ceases to be treated as deferred section 987 gain or loss or suspended section 987 loss). The pretransition gain or loss is recognized ratably over ten taxable years beginning with the taxable year that begins on the transition date described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.


(6) *Predecessor of an owner*—(i) *In general.* For purposes of this paragraph (e), references to an owner of a section 987 QBU, a deferral QBU owner, and the owner of an outbound loss QBU include a predecessor described in paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section.


(ii) *Predecessor.* If a corporation (*acquiring corporation*) becomes the owner of a section 987 QBU in a transaction described in section 381(a) in which the section 987 QBU does not terminate, the corporation that was the owner of the section 987 QBU immediately before the transaction is a predecessor of the acquiring corporation. If a corporation (*acquiring corporation*) becomes a qualified successor of a deferral QBU owner or the owner of an outbound loss QBU (each, a *transferor corporation*), the transferor corporation is a predecessor of the acquiring corporation. A predecessor of a corporation includes the predecessor of a predecessor of the corporation.


(7) *Small business election*—(i) *Scope.* This paragraph (e)(7) applies if the owner of a QBU meets the threshold described in paragraph (e)(7)(ii) of this section and the QBU meets the threshold described in paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of this section. This paragraph (e)(7) does not apply with respect to a terminating QBU.


(ii) *Owner threshold.* An owner of a QBU meets the requirements of this paragraph (e)(7)(ii) if the owner would qualify for the small business exemption provided in section 163(j)(3) for the taxable year beginning on the transition date described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.


(iii) *QBU threshold.* A QBU meets the requirements of this paragraph (e)(7)(iii) if the assets attributable to the QBU have an adjusted basis (translated at the spot rate applicable to the last day of each taxable year) of $10 million or less at the end of each of the three taxable years of the owner ending before the transition date described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section (or, if the QBU was not in existence for three taxable years, each taxable year ending before the transition date in which the QBU existed). For this purpose, all QBUs owned by members of the same controlled group that have the same country of residence (as defined in section 988(a)(3)(B)) are treated as a single QBU. Solely for purposes of applying this paragraph (e)(7)(iii) in the case of a deferral QBU or outbound loss QBU described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the termination date is treated as the transition date.


(iv) *Small business election.* If the owner of a QBU meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(7)(ii) of this section, the owner may elect to treat all QBUs that meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of this section as having no pretransition gain or loss.


(f) *QBUs to which the fresh start transition method was applied*—(1) *In general.* Paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section do not apply with respect to any section 987 QBU, deferral QBU, or outbound loss QBU with respect to which the taxpayer applied the rules of prior § 1.987-10 (or applied § 1.987-10 of the 2006 proposed regulations in a reasonable manner) on a return filed before November 9, 2023 or pursuant to paragraph (f)(3) of this section.


(2) *Application of the section 987 regulations after the transition date*—(i) *Owner functional currency net value on the last day of the preceding taxable year.* For purposes of applying § 1.987-4 with respect to a section 987 QBU described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section for the taxable year beginning on the transition date, the owner functional currency net value of the section 987 QBU on the last day of the preceding taxable year under § 1.987-4(d)(1)(i)(B) is the amount that was determined for the preceding taxable year under prior § 1.987-4(d)(1)(A) or § 1.987-4(d)(1)(A) of the 2006 proposed section 987 regulations, as applicable.


(ii) *Determination of historic rate.* For purposes of applying the section 987 regulations with respect to historic items (other than inventory subject to the simplified inventory method under § 1.987-3(c)(2)(iv)(A)) that are attributable to the section 987 QBU on the day before the transition date, a taxpayer must use the same historic rates as were used under the taxpayer's application of the 2016 and 2019 section 987 regulations or the 2006 proposed section 987 regulations, as applicable, in place of the historic rates that otherwise would be determined under § 1.987-1(c)(3).


(iii) *Unrecognized section 987 gain or loss*—(A) *Net accumulated unrecognized section 987 gain or loss of a section 987 QBU.* In taxable years beginning on or after the transition date, for purposes of calculating the net accumulated unrecognized section 987 gain or loss of a section 987 QBU described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section under § 1.987-4(c)—


(*1*) Amounts determined under prior § 1.987-4(d) or under § 1.987-4(d) or § 1.987-10 of the 2006 proposed section 987 regulations, as applicable, are included in amounts determined under § 1.987-4(d) for all prior taxable years; and


(*2*) Amounts taken into account under prior § 1.987-5(a) or under § 1.987-5(a) of the 2006 proposed section 987 regulations, as applicable, are included in amounts recognized under § 1.987-5(a) for all prior taxable years. For this purpose, amounts taken into account under prior § 1.987-5(a) or under § 1.987-5(a) of the 2006 proposed section 987 regulations, as applicable, are determined without regard to prior § 1.987-12 or prior § 1.987-12T.


(B) *Deferred section 987 gain or loss attributable to a successor deferral QBU.* In the taxable year beginning on the transition date, the outstanding deferred section 987 gain or loss (as determined under prior § 1.987-12) of a deferral QBU described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section becomes deferred section 987 gain or loss (within the meaning of § 1.987-12). The deferred section 987 gain or loss is attributed to one or more successor deferral QBUs under the principles of § 1.987-12(b)(2) and (c)(2).


(C) *Outbound section 987 loss attributable to a successor suspended loss QBU.* In the taxable year beginning on the transition date, outbound section 987 loss of an outbound loss QBU described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section that has not been recognized or added to the basis of stock under prior § 1.987-12 becomes suspended section 987 loss. The suspended section 987 loss is attributed to one or more successor suspended loss QBUs under the principles of § 1.987-13(b)(1) and (c)(1).


(3) *Taxpayers that are required to transition using the fresh start transition method.* If a taxpayer is subject to a consent agreement under which it is required to apply the fresh start transition method with respect to a section 987 QBU, then the taxpayer must apply the transition rules of prior § 1.987-10 to that section 987 QBU for the taxable year beginning on the transition date and immediately before the taxpayer applies this section. In applying this section, the taxpayer is treated as having applied prior § 1.987-10 to the section 987 QBU.


(g) [Reserved]


(h) *Determination of source and character*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, the source and character of pretransition gain or loss is determined under the rules of § 1.987-6. *See* § 1.987-6(b)(1) (timing of source and character determination).


(2) *Deferral QBU or outbound loss QBU.* Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(1) of this section and § 1.987-6, the source and character of pretransition gain or loss with respect to a deferral QBU or an outbound loss QBU described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is the same as the source and character of the outstanding deferred section 987 gain or loss (determined under prior § 1.987-12) of the deferral QBU or the outbound section 987 loss of the outbound loss QBU (determined under prior § 1.987-12(e)).


(i) [Reserved]


(j) *Adjustments to avoid double counting or omissions.* If a difference between the treatment of any item under the section 987 regulations and the treatment of the item under the taxpayer's prior section 987 method would result in income, gain, deduction, or loss (including section 988 gain or loss) being taken into account more than once or not being taken into account, then pretransition gain or loss, as determined under paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, is adjusted to account for the difference. In case of a QBU described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, appropriate adjustments must be made under the principles of paragraph (e)(5) of this section. In the case of a terminating QBU, the determination as to whether an adjustment is required under this paragraph (j) is made after taking into account section 988 gain or loss recognized in connection with the termination.


(k) *Reporting*—(1) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (k), a statement titled “Section 987 Transition Information” must be attached to an owner's timely filed (including extensions) return for the taxable year beginning on the transition date providing the following information for each QBU described in paragraph (k)(2) of this section:


(i) A description of each QBU, the QBU's principal place of business, and a description of the prior method used by the taxpayer to determine its section 987 gain or loss, deferred section 987 gain or loss, or outbound section 987 loss with respect to the QBU, including an explanation as to whether such method was an eligible pretransition method.


(ii) The pretransition gain or loss with respect to each QBU and the computations used to determine pretransition gain or loss.


(iii) Whether the authorized person has elected to recognize pretransition gain or loss ratably over the transition period pursuant to paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section.


(iv) Whether the authorized person has made a small business election under paragraph (e)(7) of this section and the computations used to determine eligibility for the election.


(v) With respect to each QBU for which any adjustment is made under paragraph (j) of this section, a description of each adjustment and the basis for computing the adjustment.


(vi) A list of the QBUs described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, or a statement that no QBUs are described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.


(2) *QBUs for which reporting is required*—(i) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section, the information described in paragraph (k)(1) of this section must be provided with respect to—


(A) Each section 987 QBU described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;


(B) Each deferral QBU described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and each of its successor deferral QBUs; and


(C) Each outbound loss QBU described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and each of its successor suspended loss QBUs.


(ii) *QBUs to which the fresh start transition method was applied.* A taxpayer is not required to provide the information described in paragraphs (k)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section with respect to a QBU described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.


(3) *Attachments not required where information is reported on a form.* This paragraph (k) does not apply to the extent provided on a form or instructions published by the Commissioner.


(4) *No change in method of accounting.* The application of this section is not treated as a change in method of accounting for purposes of sections 446 and 481.


(l) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this section. For purposes of the examples, DC is a domestic corporation with the U.S. dollar as its functional currency and Branch is a section 987 QBU with the euro as its functional currency. DC has a taxable year ending December 31, and the transition date is January 1, year 4. For purposes of the examples, except as otherwise indicated, assume that no section 987 elections are in effect.


(1) *Example 1: Earnings and capital method*—(i) *Facts*—(A) *Formation of Branch and Branch's operations.* DC formed Branch on November 30, year 1, with a contribution of €150. In year 1, Branch purchased a parcel of unimproved land for €100. In year 2, Branch earned €25. In year 3, Branch again earned €25. On June 30, year 3, Branch distributed €100 cash to DC, and DC immediately exchanged the €100 for $135.


(B) *Exchange rates.* The relevant exchange rates are shown below.


(C) *Pretransition method.* DC used the method prescribed in the 1991 proposed regulations under section 987 with respect to Branch before the transition date. Under this method, DC maintains an equity pool in euros (Branch's functional currency) and a basis pool in U.S. dollars (DC's functional currency). When Branch makes a remittance (whether out of earnings or capital), DC recognizes section 987 gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of the remittance (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of the remittance) and the portion of the basis pool attributable to the remittance. DC's basis in assets distributed from Branch is equal to Branch's basis in the assets, translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of the remittance. Branch's earnings are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate for the taxable year. DC otherwise applies section 987 in a reasonable manner.


(D) *Application of the pretransition method before the transition date.* For purposes of determining section 987 gain or loss recognized as a result of the June 30, year 3, remittance, DC was required to determine the amount in Branch's equity and basis pools. Branch's equity pool was equal to €200, and its basis pool was equal to $210, as shown in the table below. Because the remittance was equal to 50% of the equity pool (€100), 50% of the basis pool, or $105, was attributable to the remittance. The amount of the remittance was $135 (€100 translated at the spot rate on June 30, year 3, of €1 = $1.35). Therefore, in year 3, DC recognized section 987 gain of $30, equal to the difference between the amount of the remittance ($135) and the portion of the basis pool attributable to the remittance ($105). As a result of the remittance, the equity pool was reduced by the amount distributed (€100), and the basis pool was reduced by the portion of the basis pool attributable to the remittance ($105). Therefore, after the remittance, the equity pool was equal to €100, and the basis pool was equal to $105. In the hands of DC, the euros distributed had a basis of $135 (equal to the €100 distribution translated at the spot rate on June 30, year 3, of €1 = $1.35). DC did not recognize section 988 gain or loss when it exchanged the euros for $135.


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *DC's method is an eligible pretransition method.* Before the transition date, DC followed the method prescribed in the 1991 proposed regulations under section 987 with respect to Branch. This method is an eligible pretransition method under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section. Therefore, DC determines its pretransition gain or loss with respect to Branch under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.


(B) *Pretransition gain or loss.* Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, DC's pretransition gain or loss with respect to Branch is equal to the sum of the deemed termination amount described in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section and the owner functional currency net value adjustment described in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section. As explained in paragraphs (l)(1)(ii)(B)(*1*) and (*2*) of this section (*Example 1*), DC's deemed termination amount is $35 and its owner functional currency net value adjustment is zero. Therefore, DC has $35 of pretransition gain with respect to Branch. Under paragraph (e)(5)(i)(A) of this section, the pretransition gain is treated as Branch's net accumulated unrecognized section 987 gain. However, if DC elects to recognize its pretransition gain ratably over the transition period under paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section, the pretransition gain is not treated as net accumulated unrecognized section 987 gain. Instead, DC recognizes $3.50 (one tenth of its pretransition gain) for each of the ten taxable years from year 4 through year 13.


(*1*) *Deemed termination amount.* Under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the deemed termination amount is the amount of section 987 gain or loss that would have been recognized by DC under the eligible pretransition method if Branch terminated and transferred all its assets and liabilities to DC (the land with a basis of €100) on December 31, year 3. Under DC's eligible pretransition method, DC would have recognized section 987 gain of $35, determined by subtracting the remaining basis pool of $105 from the amount of the remittance of $140 (€100 translated at the spot rate on December 31, year 3, of €1 = $1.40). Therefore, the deemed termination amount is $35.


(*2*) *Owner functional currency net value adjustment.* On December 31, year 3, Branch had no liabilities and only one asset: land with a basis of €100. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the owner functional currency net value adjustment is equal to the basis of the land, translated into U.S. dollars at the transition exchange rate, reduced by the basis of the land, translated into U.S. dollars at the pretransition translation rate. Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the transition exchange rate is the spot rate applicable to December 31, year 3. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(C) of this section, the pretransition translation rate is the rate that would be used under DC's eligible pretransition method to determine the basis of the land in the hands of DC if Branch transferred the land to DC on December 31, year 3. Under DC's eligible pretransition method, if Branch transferred the land to DC, DC's basis in the land would be equal to Branch's basis (€100) translated at the spot rate on the date of the remittance. Therefore, the pretransition translation rate on December 31, year 3, is equal to the spot rate on December 31, year 3. Consequently, the owner functional currency net value adjustment is zero.


(C) *Determination of unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in year 4.* For purposes of determining unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in year 4 under § 1.987-4(d), the owner functional currency net value of Branch on the last day of year 3 is determined by translating the €100 basis of the land at the transition exchange rate, which is the spot rate on December 31, year 3 (€1 = $1.40). Therefore, the owner functional currency net value of Branch on the last day of year 3 is $140.


(2) *Example 2: Earnings only method described in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section*—(i) *Facts*—(A) *In general.* The facts and exchange rates are the same as in paragraph (l)(1) of this section (*Example 1*), except that DC uses an earnings only method with respect to Branch before the transition date, as described in paragraph (l)(2)(i)(B) of this section. In addition, a current rate election is in effect for Year 4.


(B) *Pretransition method.* Under the earnings only method, DC maintains an equity pool in euros (Branch's functional currency) and a basis pool in U.S. dollars (DC's functional currency) with respect to Branch's earnings. DC also maintains separate equity and basis pools with respect to Branch's capital. Distributions are treated as being made first out of earnings and then out of capital. When Branch makes a remittance out of earnings, DC recognizes section 987 gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of the remittance (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of the remittance) and the portion of the earnings basis pool attributable to the remittance. No section 987 gain or loss is recognized on a distribution out of capital. DC's basis in assets distributed out of Branch's earnings is equal to Branch's basis in the assets translated at the spot rate on the date of the remittance. DC's basis in assets distributed out of Branch's capital is equal to the portion of the capital basis pool attributable to the distribution. Branch's earnings are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate for the taxable year. DC otherwise applies section 987 in a reasonable manner.


(C) *Application of the pretransition method before the transition date.* On June 30, year 3, Branch distributed €100 cash to DC. Of this amount, €50 represented a remittance out of earnings, and €50 represented a distribution out of capital.


(*1*) *Remittance out of earnings.* For purposes of determining section 987 gain or loss recognized on the remittance, Branch's earnings equity pool was equal to €50, and its earnings basis pool was equal to $60, as shown in the table below. Because Branch remitted 100% of the earnings equity pool (€50), the entire earnings basis pool, or $60, was attributable to the remittance. The value of the remittance was $67.50 (€50 translated at the spot rate on June 30, year 3, of €1 = $1.35). Therefore, in year 3, DC recognized section 987 gain of $7.50, equal to the difference between the value of the remittance ($67.50) and the portion of the basis pool attributable to the remittance ($60). As a result of the remittance, the earnings equity pool and the earnings basis pool were each reduced to zero. In the hands of DC, the €50 distributed out of earnings had a basis of $67.50 (€50 translated at the spot rate on June 30, year 3, of €1 = $1.35).


(*2*) *Distribution out of capital.* The basis of the €50 distributed out of capital was equal to the portion of the capital basis pool attributable to the distribution. For this purpose, the capital equity pool was equal to €150, and the capital basis pool was equal to $150, as shown in the table below. Because Branch distributed 33% of the capital equity pool, or €50, 33% of the capital basis pool, or $50, was attributable to the distribution. In the hands of DC, the €50 distributed out of capital had a basis of $50. As a result of the capital distribution, the capital equity pool was reduced to €100 and the capital basis pool was reduced to $100.


(*3*) *Section 988 gain recognized.* On June 30, year 3, DC exchanged €100 with an aggregate basis of $117.50 (equal to the sum of the $67.50 basis of the remittance out of earnings and the $50 basis of the distribution out of capital) for $135. Therefore, DC recognized $17.50 of gain under section 988.


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *DC's method is an eligible pretransition method.* Before the transition date, DC followed a reasonable method of applying section 987 that would result in the same total amount of income over the life of DC ($125) as an earnings and capital method, as explained in paragraphs (l)(2)(ii)(A)(*1*) and (*2*) of this section (*Example 2*). Therefore, this method is an eligible pretransition method under paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section. Consequently, DC determines its pretransition gain or loss with respect to Branch under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.


(*1*) *DC's total amount of income under its pretransition method.* Under DC's pretransition method, DC recognized $7.50 of section 987 gain and $17.50 of section 988 gain in year 3. In addition, on December 31, year 3, DC had $40 of embedded gain in its capital equity and basis pools (equal to the difference between its capital equity pool of €100, translated at the spot rate on December 31, year 3, of €1 = $1.40, and its capital basis pool of $100) which will be taken into account in the future (when Branch distributes property out of capital and the property is sold). DC also recognized $60 of earnings with respect to Branch ($28.75 in year 2 and $31.25 in year 3). Thus, DC's total income (recognized and unrecognized) with respect to Branch is $125.


(*2*) *DC's total amount of income under an earnings and capital method.* If DC had instead applied an earnings and capital method, as described in paragraph (l)(1)(i)(C) of this section (*Example 1*), DC would have recognized section 987 gain of $30 in year 3 and would not have recognized section 988 gain in year 3, as explained in paragraph (l)(1)(i)(D) of this section. On December 31, year 3, DC would have unrecognized section 987 gain in its equity and basis pools of $35 (*see* paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(B)(*1*) of this section (*Example 1*)). DC would also have recognized $60 of earnings with respect to Branch ($28.75 in year 2 and $31.25 in year 3). Thus, DC's total income (recognized and unrecognized) with respect to Branch is $125.


(B) *Pretransition gain or loss.* Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, DC's pretransition gain or loss with respect to Branch is equal to sum of the deemed termination amount described in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section and the owner functional currency net value adjustment described in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section. As explained in paragraphs (l)(2)(ii)(B)(*1*) and (*2*) of this section (*Example 2*), the deemed termination amount is zero and the owner functional currency net value adjustment is $40. Therefore, DC has $40 of pretransition gain with respect to Branch. Under paragraph (e)(5)(i)(A) of this section, the pretransition gain is treated as Branch's net accumulated unrecognized section 987 gain. However, if DC elects to recognize its pretransition gain ratably over the transition period under paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section, the pretransition gain is not treated as net accumulated unrecognized section 987 gain. Instead, DC recognizes $4 (one tenth of its pretransition gain) for each of the ten taxable years from year 4 through year 13.


(*1*) *Deemed termination amount.* Under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the deemed termination amount is the amount of section 987 gain or loss that would have been recognized by DC under the eligible pretransition method if Branch terminated and transferred all of its assets and liabilities to DC on December 31, year 3. Under DC's eligible pretransition method, if Branch had transferred all of its assets and liabilities to DC, this would have been treated as a distribution out of capital. Under its eligible pretransition method, DC would not have recognized section 987 gain or loss on a distribution out of capital. Therefore, the deemed termination amount is zero.


(*2*) *Owner functional currency net value adjustment.* On December 31, year 3, Branch had no liabilities and only one asset: land with a basis of €100. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the owner functional currency net value adjustment is equal to the basis of Branch's land, translated into U.S. dollars at the transition exchange rate, reduced by the basis of Branch's land, translated into U.S. dollars at the pretransition translation rate on December 31, year 3. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(C) of this section, the pretransition translation rate is the rate that would be used under the eligible pretransition method to determine the basis of the land in the hands of DC if Branch transferred the land to DC. Under DC's eligible pretransition method, DC's basis in assets distributed from Branch is equal to the portion of the capital basis pool attributable to the distribution. If Branch transferred the land with a basis of €100 to DC on December 31, year 3, its remaining capital basis pool of $100 would be attributable to the distribution, and the land would have a basis of $100 in the hands of DC. Because the land had a basis of €100 in the hands of Branch, and would have a basis of $100 in the hands of DC if it were distributed on December 31, year 3, the pretransition translation rate is €1 = $1. Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, because a current rate election is in effect for year 4, the transition exchange rate is the spot rate applicable to December 31, year 3. The €100 basis of Branch's land, translated at the spot rate on December 31, year 3 of €1 = $1.40 is equal to $140. The €100 basis of Branch's land, translated at the pretransition translation rate on December 31, year 3 of €1 = $1 is equal to $100. Therefore, the owner functional currency net value adjustment is equal to $40 ($140−$100).


(C) *Determination of unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in year 4.* For purposes of determining unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in year 4 under § 1.987-4(d), the owner functional currency net value of Branch on the last day of year 3 is determined by translating the €100 basis of the land at the transition exchange rate, which is the spot rate on December 31, year 3 (€1 = $1.40). Therefore, the owner functional currency net value of Branch on the last day of year 3 is $140.


(iii) *Alternative facts*—(A) *No current rate election.* Assume the facts are the same as described in paragraph (l)(2)(i) of this section (*Example 2*), except that a current rate election is not in effect for year 4.


(B) *Analysis.* As explained in paragraph (l)(2)(ii)(A) of this section (*Example 2*), DC determines its pretransition gain or loss with respect to Branch under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Because a current rate election is not in effect, the transition exchange rate is determined under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section.


(*1*) *Transition exchange rate.* DC applied an earnings only method described in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section before the transition date. Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, because a current rate election is not in effect for year 4, the transition exchange rate for Branch's land is equal to the pretransition translation rate. As explained in paragraph (l)(2)(ii)(B)(*2*) of this section (*Example 2*), the pretransition translation rate is €1 = $1.


(*2*) *Pretransition gain or loss.* Because the transition exchange rate for the land (Branch's sole asset) is equal to the pretransition translation rate, the owner functional currency net value adjustment is zero. As explained in paragraph (l)(2)(ii)(B)(*1*) of this section (*Example 2*), the deemed termination amount is also zero. Therefore, DC has no pretransition gain or loss with respect to Branch.


(*3*) *Determination of unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in year 4.* For purposes of determining unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in year 4 under § 1.987-4(d), the owner functional currency net value of Branch on the last day of year 3 is determined by translating the €100 basis of the land at the transition exchange rate, which is the pretransition translation rate of €1 = $1. Therefore, the owner functional currency net value of Branch on the last day of year 3 is $100.


(3) *Example 3: Earnings only method described in paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section*—(i) *Facts*—(A) *In general.* The facts and exchange rates are the same as in paragraph (l)(1) of this section (*Example 1*), except that DC used an earnings only method with respect to Branch before the transition date, as described in paragraph (l)(3)(i)(B) of this section.


(B) *Pretransition method.* Under the earnings only method, DC maintains an equity pool in euros (Branch's functional currency) and a basis pool in U.S. dollars (DC's functional currency) with respect to Branch's earnings. However, DC does not maintain separate equity and basis pools with respect to Branch's capital. Distributions are treated as being made first out of earnings and then out of capital. When Branch makes a remittance out of earnings, DC recognizes section 987 gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of the remittance (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of the remittance) and the portion of the earnings basis pool attributable to the remittance. No section 987 gain or loss is recognized on a distribution out of capital. Under DC's pretransition method, DC's basis in assets distributed by Branch (whether out of earnings or capital) is equal to Branch's basis in the assets translated at the spot rate on the date of the distribution. Branch's earnings are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate for the taxable year. DC first applied its earnings only method on a return filed before November 9, 2023. In addition, DC applied its earnings only method consistently to all of its section 987 QBUs and otherwise applied section 987 in a reasonable manner.


(C) *Application of the pretransition method before the transition date.* On June 30, year 3, Branch distributed €100 cash to DC. Of this amount, €50 represented a remittance out of earnings, and €50 represented a distribution out of capital.


(*1*) *Remittance out of earnings.* For purposes of determining section 987 gain or loss recognized on the remittance, Branch's earnings equity pool was equal to €50, and its earnings basis pool was equal to $60, as shown in the table below. Because Branch remitted 100% of the earnings equity pool (€50), the entire earnings basis pool, or $60, was attributable to the remittance. The value of the remittance was $67.50 (€50 translated at the spot rate on June 30, year 3, of €1 = $1.35). Therefore, in year 3, DC recognized section 987 gain of $7.50, equal to the difference between the value of the remittance ($67.50) and the portion of the basis pool attributable to the remittance ($60). As a result of the remittance, the earnings equity pool and the earnings basis pool were each reduced to zero.


(*2*) *Basis of euros distributed.* In the hands of DC, the €100 distributed had a basis of $135 (€100 translated at the spot rate on June 30, year 3, of €1 = $1.35). DC did not recognize gain or loss under section 988 when it exchanged the €100 for $135.


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *DC's method is an eligible pretransition method.* Unlike in paragraph (l)(2) of this section (*Example 2*), DC's earnings only method would not result in the same total amount of income over the life of DC as an earnings and capital method described in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section because DC does not maintain capital basis and equity pools and DC translates the basis of all property distributed from Branch at the spot rate on the distribution date. However, this method is an eligible pretransition method under paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section because DC first applied its earnings only method on a return filed before November 9, 2023, DC applied its earnings only method consistently to all of its section 987 QBUs, and DC otherwise applied section 987 in a reasonable manner. Consequently, DC determines its pretransition gain or loss with respect to Branch under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.


(B) *Pretransition gain or loss.* Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, DC's pretransition gain or loss with respect to Branch is equal to the sum of the deemed termination amount described in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section and the owner functional currency net value adjustment described in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section. As explained in paragraphs (l)(3)(ii)(B)(*1*) and (*2*) of this section (*Example 3*), the deemed termination amount is zero and the owner functional currency net value adjustment is zero. Therefore, DC has no pretransition gain or loss with respect to Branch.


(*1*) *Deemed termination amount.* Under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the deemed termination amount is the amount of section 987 gain or loss that would have been recognized by DC under the eligible pretransition method if Branch terminated and transferred all of its assets and liabilities to DC on December 31, year 3. Under DC's eligible pretransition method, if Branch had transferred all of its assets and liabilities to DC, it would have been treated as a distribution out of capital. Under its eligible pretransition method, DC would not have recognized section 987 gain or loss on a distribution out of capital. Therefore, the deemed termination amount is zero.


(*2*) *Owner functional currency net value adjustment.* On December 31, year 3, Branch has no liabilities and only one asset: land with a basis of €100. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the owner functional currency net value adjustment is equal to the basis of the land, translated into U.S. dollars at the transition exchange rate, reduced by the basis of the land, translated into U.S. dollars at the pretransition translation rate. Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, the transition exchange rate is the spot rate applicable to December 31, year 3. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(C) of this section, the pretransition translation rate is the rate that would be used under DC's eligible pretransition method to determine the basis of the land in the hands of DC if Branch transferred the land to DC on December 31, year 3. Under DC's eligible pretransition method, if Branch transferred the land to DC, DC's basis in the land would be equal to Branch's basis (€100) translated at the spot rate on the date of the distribution. Therefore, the pretransition translation rate on December 31, year 3, is equal to the spot rate on December 31, year 3. Consequently, the owner functional currency net value adjustment is zero.


(C) *Determination of unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in year 4.* For purposes of determining unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in year 4 under § 1.987-4(d), the owner functional currency net value of Branch on the last day of year 3 is determined by translating the €100 basis of the land at the spot rate on December 31, year 3 (€1 = $1.40). Therefore, the owner functional currency net value of Branch on the last day of year 3 is $140.


(4) *Example 4: Owner did not apply section 987(3)*—(i) *Facts.* The facts and exchange rates are the same as in paragraph (l)(1) of this section (*Example 1*), except that DC did not apply section 987(3) with respect to Branch and did not recognize section 987 gain or loss with respect to Branch before the transition date.


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *DC's method is not an eligible pretransition method.* Because DC did not apply section 987(3) with respect to Branch before the transition date, DC did not apply an eligible pretransition method under paragraph (e)(4) of this section. Therefore, DC determines pretransition gain or loss under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.


(B) *Pretransition gain or loss.* Under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, DC's pretransition gain or loss with respect to Branch is equal to the annual unrecognized section 987 gain or loss with respect to Branch for all taxable years ending before the transition date in which DC was the owner of Branch (that is, years 1 through 3), reduced by section 987 gain or loss recognized by DC before the transition date. As explained in paragraphs (l)(4)(ii)(C) through (E) of this section (*Example 4*), DC's annual unrecognized section 987 gain for year 1 is $7.50, DC's annual unrecognized section 987 gain for year 2 is $16.25, and DC's annual unrecognized section 987 gain for year 3 is $23.75. DC did not recognize any section 987 gain or loss with respect to Branch before the transition date. Therefore, DC has $47.50 of pretransition gain with respect to Branch. Under paragraph (e)(5)(i)(A) of this section, the pretransition gain is treated as Branch's net accumulated unrecognized section 987 gain. However, if DC elects to recognize its pretransition gain ratably over the transition period under paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section, the pretransition gain is not treated as net accumulated unrecognized section 987 gain. Instead, DC recognizes $4.75 (one tenth of its pretransition gain) for each of the ten taxable years from year 4 through year 13.


(C) *Annual unrecognized section 987 gain or loss for year 1.* Under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, annual unrecognized section 987 gain or loss with respect to a section 987 QBU is determined under the rules of § 1.987-4(d), applied as though a current rate election was in effect for all relevant taxable years (such that all items are treated as marked items), but modified so that only §§ 1.987-4(d)(1) (change in owner functional currency net value) and 1.987-4(d)(10) (adjustment for residual increase or decrease to net assets) are applied. As explained in paragraphs (l)(4)(ii)(C)(*1*) and (*2*) of this section (*Example 4*), in year 1, the change in owner functional currency net value under § 1.987-4(d)(1) is an increase of $165, and there is a negative adjustment of $157.50 under § 1.987-4(d)(10). Therefore, DC's annual unrecognized section 987 gain for year 1 is $7.50.


(*1*) *Change in owner functional currency net value for year 1.* On December 31, year 1, Branch held land with a basis of €100 and €50 cash. Therefore, on the last day of year 1, Branch's owner functional currency net value is $165 (150 euros translated at the spot rate on December 31, year 1, of €1 = $1.10). Because Branch was formed in year 1, its owner functional currency net value on the last day of the preceding taxable year is zero. *See* § 1.987-4(d)(1)(iii). Therefore, the change in owner functional currency net value is an increase of $165.


(*2*) *Residual increase to net assets for year 1.* Under § 1.987-4(d)(10), unrecognized section 987 gain or loss for a taxable year is decreased by any residual increase to net assets (and increased by any residual decrease to net assets), translated into the owner's functional currency at the yearly average exchange rate for the taxable year. For this purpose, the residual increase (or decrease) to net assets is equal to the change in net value of the section 987 QBU, determined in the section 987 QBU's functional currency (that is, the QBU net value). *See* § 1.987-4(d)(10)(ii)(B) and (e)(2)(ii). On December 31, year 1, Branch held land with a basis of €100 euros and €50 cash. Therefore, on the last day of year 1, Branch has a QBU net value of €150. Because Branch was formed in year 1, its QBU net value on the last day of the preceding taxable year is zero. *See* § 1.987-4(d)(1)(iii). Therefore, the residual increase to net assets is €150. This results in a negative adjustment to annual unrecognized section 987 gain or loss of $157.50 for year 1 (equal to €150 translated at the yearly average exchange rate for year 1 of €1 = $1.05).


(D) *Annual unrecognized section 987 gain or loss for year 2.* As explained in paragraphs (l)(4)(ii)(D)(*1*) and (*2*) of this section (*Example 4*), in year 2, the change in owner functional currency net value under § 1.987-4(d)(1) is an increase of $45, and there is a negative adjustment of $28.75 under § 1.987-4(d)(10). Therefore, DC's annual unrecognized section 987 gain for year 2 is $16.25.


(*1*) *Change in owner functional currency net value for year 2.* On December 31, year 2, Branch held land with a basis of €100 and €75 cash. Therefore, on the last day of year 2, Branch's owner functional currency net value is $210 (175 euros translated at the spot rate on December 31, year 2, of €1 = $1.20). As explained in paragraph (l)(4)(ii)(C)(*1*) of this section (*Example 4*), Branch's owner functional currency net value on the last day of year 1 was $165. Therefore, the change in owner functional currency net value is an increase of $45.


(*2*) *Residual increase to net assets for year 2.* On December 31, year 2, Branch held land with a basis of €100 and €75 cash. Therefore, on the last day of year 2, Branch has a QBU net value of €175. As explained in paragraph (l)(4)(ii)(C)(*2*) of this section (*Example 4*), Branch had a QBU net value of €150 on December 31, year 1. Therefore, the residual increase to net assets is €25. This results in a negative adjustment to annual unrecognized section 987 gain or loss of $28.75 for year 2 (equal to a reduction of €25, translated at the yearly average exchange rate for year 2 of €1 = $1.15).


(E) *Annual unrecognized section 987 gain or loss for year 3.* As explained in paragraphs (l)(4)(ii)(E)(*1*) and (*2*) of this section (*Example 4*), in year 3, the change in owner functional currency net value under § 1.987-4(d)(1) is a decrease of $70, and there is a positive adjustment of $93.75 under § 1.987-4(d)(10). Therefore, DC's annual unrecognized section 987 gain for year 3 is $23.75.


(*1*) *Change in owner functional currency net value for year 3.* On December 31, year 3, Branch held land with a basis of €100. Therefore, on the last day of year 3, Branch's owner functional currency net value is $140 (100 euros translated at the spot rate on December 31, year 3, of €1 = $1.40). As explained in paragraph (l)(4)(ii)(D)(*1*) of this section (*Example 4*), Branch's owner functional currency net value on the last day of year 2 was $210. Therefore, the change in owner functional currency net value is a decrease of $70.


(*2*) *Residual decrease to net assets for year 3.* On December 31, year 3, Branch held land with a basis of €100. Therefore, on the last day of year 3, Branch has a QBU net value of €100. As explained in paragraph (l)(4)(ii)(D)(*2*) of this section (*Example 4*), Branch had a QBU net value of €175 on December 31, year 2. Therefore, the residual decrease to net assets is €75. This results in a positive adjustment to annual unrecognized section 987 gain or loss of $93.75 for year 3 (equal to €75, translated at the yearly average exchange rate for year 3 of €1 = $1.25).


(F) *Determination of unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in year 4.* For purposes of determining unrecognized section 987 gain or loss in year 4 under § 1.987-4(d), the owner functional currency net value of Branch on the last day of year 3 is determined by translating the €100 basis of the land at the spot rate on December 31, year 3 (€1 = $1.40). Therefore, the owner functional currency net value of Branch on the last day of year 3 is $140.


(5) *Example 5: Error in application of method*—(i) *Facts.* The facts are the same as described in paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section (*Example 1*), except that DC inadvertently miscalculated the amount of the June 30, year 3, remittance as being €90 rather than €100. This reduced the amount of section 987 gain recognized by DC in year 3.


(ii) *Analysis.* DC committed an error in its application of the earnings and capital method to Branch. Under paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(A) of this section, DC is nonetheless treated as having applied an eligible pretransition method. However, under paragraph (e)(4)(iv)(B) of this section, DC must determine its pretransition gain or loss as though the error had not been made. Therefore, DC computes its pretransition gain or loss as described in paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(B) of this section (*Example 1*). DC has $35 of pretransition gain with respect to Branch.


(6) *Example 6: Consistent practice not treated as an error*—(i) *Facts.* Before the transition date, DC used the earnings and capital method described in the 1991 proposed regulations under section 987 with respect to Branch, as described in paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section (*Example 1*). In years 1, 2, and 3, Branch made recurring purchases of inventory from Owner, which Branch sold to unrelated customers. In connection with the purchase transactions, Branch transferred cash to Owner, and Owner transferred inventory to Branch. Owner did not take these transfers into account in determining the amount of any remittance and, accordingly, did not recognize section 987 gain or loss with respect to these transfers. However, Owner consistently adjusted Branch's equity and basis pools in a reasonable manner to reflect all transfers between Owner and Branch; for this purpose, the amount of each transfer made in connection with the purchase transactions was translated using the average rate for the relevant taxable year. Owner also adjusted Branch's equity and basis pools to account for Branch's income from the sale of inventory.


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *DC's method is an eligible pretransition method.* Before the transition date, DC followed the earnings and capital method described in the 1991 proposed regulations under section 987 with respect to Branch. This method is an eligible pretransition method under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section. Therefore, DC determines its pretransition gain or loss with respect to Branch under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.


(B) *Effect of consistent practice.* Before the transition date, Owner engaged in a consistent practice under which Owner did not account for inventory purchase transactions in determining the amount of a remittance requiring the recognition of gain or loss under section 987(3). However, Owner consistently accounted for the disregarded transfers in a reasonable manner for purposes of computing its equity and basis pools. Under paragraph (e)(4)(v) of this section, this consistent practice is not treated as an error in the application of a pretransition method and does not preclude Owner's method from being treated as an eligible pretransition method. Therefore, Owner must take this consistent practice into account in determining pretransition gain or loss under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. In particular, Owner must use the equity and basis pools computed under its consistent practice (rather than the equity and basis pools it would have computed if it had historically taken the disregarded transfers into account in determining the amount of remittances) to determine the deemed termination amount under paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section.
