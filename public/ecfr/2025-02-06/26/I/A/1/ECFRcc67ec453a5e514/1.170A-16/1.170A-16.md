(b) *Substantiation of charitable contributions of $250 or more but not more than $500.* No deduction is allowed under section 170(a) for a noncash charitable contribution of $250 or more but not more than $500 unless the donor substantiates the contribution with a contemporaneous written acknowledgment, as described in section 170(f)(8) and § 1.170A-13(f).




(c) *Substantiation of charitable contributions of more than $500 but not more than $5,000*—(1) *In general.* No deduction is allowed under section 170(a) for a noncash charitable contribution of more than $500 but not more than $5,000 unless the donor substantiates the contribution with a contemporaneous written acknowledgment, as described in section 170(f)(8) and § 1.170A-13(f), and meets the applicable requirements of this section.


(2) *Individuals, partnerships, and certain corporations also required to file Form 8283 (Section A).* No deduction is allowed under section 170(a) for a noncash charitable contribution of more than $500 but not more than $5,000 by an individual, partnership, S corporation, or C corporation that is a personal service corporation or closely held corporation unless the donor completes Form 8283 (Section A), “Noncash Charitable Contributions,” as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, or a successor form, and files it with the return on which the deduction is claimed.

(E) The manner of acquisition (for example, by purchase, gift, bequest, inheritance, or exchange), and the approximate date of acquisition of the property by the donor (except that in the case of a contribution of publicly traded securities as defined in § 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi), a representation that the donor held the securities for more than one year is sufficient) or, if the property was created, produced, or manufactured by or for the donor, the approximate date the property was substantially completed;


(F) The cost or other basis, adjusted as provided by section 1016, of the property (except that the cost or basis is not required for contributions of publicly traded securities (as defined in § 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi)) that would have resulted in long-term capital gain if sold on the contribution date, unless the donor has elected to limit the deduction to basis under section 170(b)(1)(C)(iii)); and

Alternatively, taxpayers may attach a statement to the Form 8283 explaining why a number cannot be inserted. Nothing in this paragraph (c)(3)(v) precludes a taxpayer from both inserting the number in the appropriate box on Form 8283 (Section A) and including an attached statement explaining any additional information regarding the number. Taxpayers may not respond to a request for information on Form 8283 (Section A) with nonresponsive language; for example, by indicating that the requested information is *available upon request* or will be *provided upon request.* The inclusion of such nonresponsive language in response to a request for information on Form 8283 (Section A) may be treated by the IRS as being an incomplete filing of Form 8283; and




(vi) Any other information required by Form 8283 (Section A) or the instructions to Form 8283 (Section A).


(4) *Additional requirement for certain vehicle contributions.* In the case of a contribution of a qualified vehicle described in section 170(f)(12)(E) for which an acknowledgment by the donee organization is required under section 170(f)(12)(D), the donor must attach a copy of the acknowledgment to the Form 8283 (Section A) for the return on which the deduction is claimed.

(i) Publicly traded securities as defined in § 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi);


(ii) Property described in section 170(e)(1)(B)(iii) (certain intellectual property);


(iii) A qualified vehicle described in section 170(f)(12)(A)(ii) for which an acknowledgment under section 170(f)(12)(B)(iii) is provided; and

(B) A description in sufficient detail under the circumstances, taking into account the value of the property, for a person who is not generally familiar with the type of property to ascertain that the described property is the contributed property.


(C) In the case of real property or tangible personal property, the condition of the property;


(v) The manner of acquisition (for example, by purchase, gift, bequest, inheritance, or exchange), and the approximate date of acquisition of the property by the donor, or, if the property was created, produced, or manufactured by or for the donor, the approximate date the property was substantially completed;

(A) For contributions described in section 170(h)(7)(E) and § 1.170A-14(n)(4) (for contributions to preserve certified historic structures), regardless of whether they are also described in section 170(h)(7)(C) and § 1.170A-14(n)(2) (for contributions made outside of the three-year holding period) and/or section 170(h)(7)(D) and § 1.170A-14(n)(3) (for contributions made by certain family partnerships or S corporations); and


(B) For all contributions not described in section 170(h)(7)(E) and § 1.170A-14(n)(4), provided they are not described in section 170(h)(7)(C) and § 1.170A-14(n)(2) (for contributions made outside of the three-year holding period) and/or section 170(h)(7)(D) and § 1.170A-14(n)(3) (for contributions made by certain family partnerships or S corporations);




(ix) If a number can be inserted into any box on Form 8283 (Section B), the number inserted in the box on Form 8283 (Section B). Alternatively, taxpayers may attach a statement to the Form 8283 explaining why a number cannot be inserted. Nothing in this paragraph (d)(3)(ix) precludes a taxpayer from both inserting the number in the appropriate box on Form 8283 (Section B) and including an attached statement explaining any additional information regarding the number. Taxpayers may not respond to a request for information on Form 8283 (Section B) with nonresponsive language; for example, by indicating that the requested information is *available upon request* or will be *provided upon request.* The inclusion of such nonresponsive language in response to a request for information on Form 8283 (Section B) may be treated by the IRS as being an incomplete filing of Form 8283; and






(x) Any other information required by Form 8283 (Section B) or the instructions to Form 8283 (Section B).


(4) *Appraiser declaration.* The appraiser declaration referred to in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section must include the following statement: “I understand that my appraisal will be used in connection with a return or claim for refund.

I affirm that I have not been at any time in the three-year period ending on the date of the appraisal barred from presenting evidence or testimony before the Department of the Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 330(c).”


(5) *Donee signature*—(i) *Person authorized to sign.* The person who signs Form 8283 (Section B) for the donee must be either an official authorized to sign the tax or information returns of the donee, or a person specifically authorized to sign Forms 8283 (Section B) by that official. In the case of a donee that is a governmental unit, the person who signs Form 8283 (Section B) for the donee must be an official of the governmental unit.


(ii) *Effect of donee signature.* The signature of the donee on Form 8283 (Section B) does not represent concurrence in the appraised value of the contributed property. Rather, it represents acknowledgment of receipt of the property described in Form 8283 (Section B) on the date specified in Form 8283 (Section B) and that the donee understands the information reporting requirements imposed by section 6050L and § 1.6050L-1.


(iii) *Certain information not required on Form 8283 (Section B) before donee signs.* Before Form 8283 (Section B) is signed by the donee, Form 8283 (Section B) must be completed (as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section), except that it is not required to contain the following:

(6) *Additional substantiation rules may apply.* For additional substantiation rules, see paragraph (f) of this section.


(7) *More than one appraiser.* More than one appraiser may appraise the donated property. If more than one appraiser appraises the property, the donor does not have to use each appraiser's appraisal for purposes of substantiating the charitable contribution deduction under this paragraph (d). If the donor uses the appraisal of more than one appraiser, or if two or more appraisers contribute to a single appraisal, each appraiser shall comply with the requirements of this paragraph (d) and the requirements in § 1.170A-17, including signing the qualified appraisal and appraisal summary.


(e) *Substantiation of noncash charitable contributions of more than $500,000*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, no deduction is allowed under section 170(a) for a noncash charitable contribution of more than $500,000 unless the donor—


(i) Substantiates the contribution with a contemporaneous written acknowledgment, as described in section 170(f)(8) and § 1.170A-13(f);


(ii) Obtains a qualified appraisal, as defined in § 1.170A-17(a)(1), prepared by a qualified appraiser, as defined in § 1.170A-17(b)(1);


(iii) Completes, as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, Form 8283 (Section B) and files it with the return on which the deduction is claimed; and


(iv) Attaches the qualified appraisal of the property to the return on which the deduction is claimed.


(2) *Exception for certain noncash contributions.* For contributions of property described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a qualified appraisal is not required, and a completed Form 8283 (Section A), containing the information required in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section.


(3) *Additional substantiation rules may apply.* For additional substantiation rules, see paragraph (f) of this section.


(f) *Additional substantiation rules*—(1) *Form 8283 (Section B) furnished by donor to donee.* A donor who presents a Form 8283 (Section B) to a donee for signature must furnish to the donee a copy of the Form 8283 (Section B).


(2) *Number of Forms 8283 (Section A or Section B)*—(i) *In general.* For each item of contributed property for which a Form 8283 (Section A or Section B) is required under paragraphs (c), (d), or (e) of this section, a donor must attach a separate Form 8283 (Section A or Section B) to the return on which the deduction for the item is claimed.


(ii) *Exception for similar items.* The donor may attach a single Form 8283 (Section A or Section B) for all similar items of property, as defined in § 1.170A-13(c)(7)(iii), contributed to the same donee during the donor's taxable year, if the donor includes on Form 8283 (Section A or Section B) the information required by paragraph (c)(3) or (d)(3) of this section for each item of property.


(3) *Substantiation requirements for carryovers of noncash contribution deductions.* The rules in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section (regarding substantiation that must be submitted with a return) also apply to the return for any carryover year under section 170(d).




(4) *Partners and S corporation shareholders*—(i) *Form 8283 (Section A or Section B) must be provided to partners and S corporation shareholders.* If the donor is a partnership or an S corporation, the donor must provide a copy of its completed Form 8283 (Section A or Section B) to every partner or shareholder who receives an allocation of a charitable contribution under section 170 for the property described in Form 8283 (Section A or Section B). Similarly, a recipient partner that is a partnership or S corporation must provide a copy of the donor's completed Form 8283 (Section A or Section B) to each of its partners or shareholders who receives an allocation of the charitable contribution, and so on through any additional tiers.


(ii) *Partners and S corporation shareholders must attach Forms 8283 (Section A or Section B) to return.* A partner of a partnership or shareholder of an S corporation who receives an allocation of a charitable contribution under section 170 for property to which paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section applies must attach to the return on which the contribution is claimed a copy of each Form 8283 that must be provided to them under paragraph (f)(4)(i) or (iii) of this section.


(iii) *Partners and S corporation shareholders must file separate Forms 8283 and provide copies to any partners*—(A) *In general.* Subject to paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) of this section, every partner of a partnership (including a partner that is itself a partnership or S corporation) or shareholder of an S corporation that receives an allocation of a charitable contribution under section 170 for which paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section applies must complete a separate Form 8283 with any information required by Form 8283 and the instructions to Form 8283. In the case of a partner that is itself a partnership or S corporation, that partnership or S corporation must provide a copy of its completed separate Form 8283 to every partner or shareholder who receives an allocation of the charitable contribution, and so on through any additional tiers. The partner or shareholder must attach its separate Form 8283 to the return on which the contribution is claimed, in addition to the copy of each Form 8283 that the partner or shareholder is required to attach pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section.


(B) *Conservation contributions.* The terms defined in § 1.170A-14(j)(3) apply for purposes of this paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B). In the case of a qualified conservation contribution that is made by a partnership or S corporation, an ultimate member's separate Form 8283 must include their own relevant basis. An upper-tier partnership's or upper-tier S corporation's separate Form 8283 must include the sum of each of its ultimate member's relevant basis (as computed in accordance with § 1.170A-14(j) through (m)). This paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) does not apply to contributions described in section 170(h)(7)(C) and § 1.170A-14(n)(2) (for contributions made outside of the three-year holding period) or section 170(h)(7)(D) and § 1.170A-14(n)(3) (for contributions made by certain family partnerships or S corporations), provided that they are not also described in section 170(h)(7)(E) and § 1.170A-14(n)(4) (for contributions to preserve certified historic structures), in which case this paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) does apply.






(5) *Determination of deduction amount for purposes of substantiation rules*—(i) *In general.* In determining whether the amount of a donor's deduction exceeds the amounts set forth in section 170(f)(11)(B) (noncash contributions exceeding $500), 170(f)(11)(C) (noncash contributions exceeding $5,000), or 170(f)(11)(D) (noncash contributions exceeding $500,000), the rules of paragraphs (f)(5)(ii) and (iii) of this section apply.


(ii) *Similar items of property must be aggregated.* Under section 170(f)(11)(F), the donor must aggregate the amount claimed as a deduction for all similar items of property, as defined in § 1.170A-13(c)(7)(iii), contributed during the taxable year. For rules regarding the number of qualified appraisals and Forms 8283 (Section A or Section B) required if similar items of property are contributed, see § 1.170A-13(c)(3)(iv)(A) and (4)(iv)(B).


(iii) *For contributions of certain inventory and scientific property, excess of amount claimed over cost of goods sold taken into account*—(A) *In general.* In determining the amount of a donor's contribution of property to which section 170(e)(3) (relating to contributions of inventory and other property) or (e)(4) (relating to contributions of scientific property used for research) applies, the donor must take into account only the excess of the amount claimed as a deduction over the amount that would have been treated as the cost of goods sold if the donor had sold the contributed property to the donee.


(B) *Example.* The following example illustrates the rule of this paragraph (f)(5)(iii):


(6) *Conservation contributions by pass-through entities preserving certified historic structures*—(i) *In general.* The terms defined in § 1.170A-14(j)(3) apply for purposes of this paragraph (f)(6). For any contribution described in paragraph (f)(6)(ii) of this section, pursuant to section 170(f)(19), no deduction is allowed under section 170 or any other provision of the Code under which deductions are allowable to pass-through entities with respect to such contribution unless the contributing partnership, the contributing S corporation, the upper-tier partnership, or the upper-tier S corporation, respectively—


(A) Includes on its return for the taxable year in which the contribution is made a statement that it made such a contribution or received such allocated portion, as described in paragraph (f)(6)(iii) of this section; and


(B) Provides such information about the contribution as the Secretary of the Treasury or her delegate may require in guidance, forms, or instructions.


(ii) *Contributions to which this paragraph (f)(6) applies.* This paragraph (f)(6) applies to any qualified conservation contribution (as defined in section 170(h)(1) and § 1.170A-14):


(A) The conservation purpose of which is preservation of a building that is a certified historic structure (as defined in section 170(h)(4)(C));


(B) That is either:


(*1*) Made by a contributing partnership (as defined in § 1.170A-14(j)(3)(iii)) or contributing S corporation (as defined in § 1.170A-14(j)(3)(iv)); or




(*2*) Is an allocated portion (as defined in § 1.170A-14(j)(3)(i)) of an upper-tier partnership (as defined in § 1.170A-14(j)(3)(xi)) or upper-tier S corporation (as defined in § 1.170A-14(j)(3)(xii)); and


(C) The amount of such contribution (as defined in § 1.170A-14(j)(3)(ii)) or such allocated portion (as defined in § 1.170A-14(j)(3)(i)) exceeds 2.5 times the sum of each ultimate member's relevant basis (as defined in § 1.170A-14(j) through (m)).


(iii) *Required information.* A partner6ship or S corporation satisfies the requirements of section 170(f)(19)(A) and paragraph (f)(6)(i) of this section by filing a completed Form 8283, including information about relevant basis, in accordance with section 170, the regulations under section 170, and the instructions to Form 8283.
