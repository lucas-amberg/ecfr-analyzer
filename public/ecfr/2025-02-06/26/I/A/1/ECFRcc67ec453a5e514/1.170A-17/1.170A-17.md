(4) *Timely appraisal report.* A qualified appraisal must be signed and dated by the qualified appraiser no earlier than 60 days before the date of the contribution and no later than—


(i) The due date, including extensions, of the return on which the deduction for the contribution is first claimed;

For an appraisal report dated on or after the date of the contribution, the valuation effective date must be the date of the contribution.


(6) *Exclusion for donor knowledge of falsity.* An appraisal is not a qualified appraisal for a particular contribution, even if the requirements of this paragraph (a) are met, if the donor either failed to disclose or misrepresented facts, and a reasonable person would expect that this failure or misrepresentation would cause the appraiser to misstate the value of the contributed property.


(7) *Number of appraisals required.* A donor must obtain a separate qualified appraisal for each item of property for which an appraisal is required under section 170(f)(11)(C) and (D) and paragraph (d) or (e) of § 1.170A-16 and that is not included in a group of similar items of property, as defined in § 1.170A-13(c)(7)(iii).

(9) *Prohibited appraisal fees.* The fee for a qualified appraisal cannot be based to any extent on the appraised value of the property. For example, a fee for an appraisal will be treated as based on the appraised value of the property if any part of the fee depends on the amount of the appraised value that is allowed by the Internal Revenue Service after an examination.


(10) *Retention of qualified appraisal.* The donor must retain the qualified appraisal for so long as it may be relevant in the administration of any internal revenue law.


(11) *Effect of appraisal disregarded pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 330(c).* If an appraiser has been prohibited from practicing before the Internal Revenue Service by the Secretary under 31 U.S.C. 330(c) at any time during the three-year period ending on the date the appraisal is signed by the appraiser, any appraisal prepared by the appraiser will be disregarded as to value, but could constitute a qualified appraisal if the requirements of this section are otherwise satisfied, and the donor had no knowledge that the signature, date, or declaration was false when the appraisal and Form 8283 (Section B) were signed by the appraiser.
