# § 1.171-4   Election to amortize bond premium on taxable bonds.

(a) *Time and manner of making the election*—(1) *In general.* A holder makes the election to amortize bond premium by offsetting interest income with bond premium in the holder's timely filed federal income tax return for the first taxable year to which the holder desires the election to apply. The holder should attach to the return a statement that the holder is making the election under this section.


(2) *Coordination with OID election.* If a holder makes an election under § 1.1272-3 for a bond with bond premium, the holder is deemed to have made the election under this section.


(b) *Scope of election.* The election under this section applies to all taxable bonds held during or after the taxable year for which the election is made.


(c) *Election to amortize made in a subsequent taxable year*—(1) *In general.* If a holder elects to amortize bond premium and holds a taxable bond acquired before the taxable year for which the election is made, the holder may not amortize amounts that would have been amortized in prior taxable years had an election been in effect for those prior years.


(2) *Example.* The following example illustrates the rule of this paragraph (c):


(d) *Revocation of election.* The election under this section may not be revoked unless approved by the Commissioner. Because a revocation of the election is a change in accounting method, a taxpayer must follow the rules under § 1.446-1(e)(3)(i) to request the Commissioner's consent to revoke the election. A revocation of the election applies to all taxable bonds held during or after the taxable year for which the revocation is effective. The holder may not amortize any remaining bond premium on bonds held at the beginning of the taxable year for which the revocation is effective. Therefore, no adjustment under section 481 is allowed upon the revocation of the election because no items of income or deduction are omitted or duplicated.
