# § 1.172-2   Net operating loss in case of a corporation.

(a) *Modification of deductions.* A net operating loss is sustained by a corporation in any taxable year if and to the extent that, for such year, there is an excess of deductions allowed by chapter 1 of the Code over gross income computed thereunder. In determining the excess of deductions over gross income for such purpose—


(1) *Items not deductible.* No deduction shall be allowed under—


(i) Section 172 for the net operating loss deduction, and


(ii) Section 922 in respect of Western Hemisphere trade corporations;


(2) *Dividends received.* The 85-percent limitation provided by section 246(b) shall not apply to the deductions otherwise allowed under—


(i) Section 243(a) in respect of dividends received from domestic corporations. 


(ii) Section 244 in respect of dividends received on preferred stock of public utilities, and


(iii) Section 245 in respect of dividends received from foreign corporations; and


(3) *Dividends paid.* The deduction granted by section 247 in respect of dividends paid on the preferred stock of public utilities shall be computed without regard to subsection (a)(1)(B) of Section 247.


(b) *Example.* The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (a):


(c) *Qualified real estate investment trusts.* For taxable years ending after October 4, 1976, the net operating loss of a qualified real estate investment trust (as defined in § 1.172-10(b)) is computed by taking into account the adjustments described in section 857(b)(2) (other than the deduction for dividends paid, as defined in section 561), as well as the modifications required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Thus, for example, the special deductions for dividends received, etc., provided in part VIII of subchapter B (other than section 248), as well as the net operating loss deduction under section 172, are not allowed in computing the net operating loss of a qualified real estate investment trust.
