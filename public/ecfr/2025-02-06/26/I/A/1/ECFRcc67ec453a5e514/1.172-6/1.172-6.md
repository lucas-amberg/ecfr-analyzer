# ยง 1.172-6   Illustration of net operating loss carrybacks and carryovers.

The application of ยง 1.172-4 may be illustrated by the following example: 


(a) *Facts.* The books of the taxpayer, whose return is made on the basis of the calendar year, reveal the following facts:


(b) *Loss sustained in 1956.* The portions of the $75,000 net operating loss for 1956 which shall be used as carrybacks to 1954 and 1955 and as carryovers to 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, and 1961 are computed as follows: 


(1) *Carryback to 1954.* The carryback to this year is $75,000, that is, the amount of the net operating loss. 


(2) *Carryback to 1955.* The carryback to this year is $60,000, computed as follows:


(3) *Carryover to 1957.* The carryover to this year is $30,000, computed as follows:


(4) *Carryover to 1958.* The carryover to this year is $10,000, computed as follows:


(5) *Carryover to 1959.* The carryover to this year is $10,000, computed as follows:


(6) *Carryover to 1960.* The carryover to this year is $0, computed as follows:


(7) *Carryover to 1961.* The carryover to this year is $0, computed as follows:


(c) *Loss sustained in 1958.* The portions of the $150,000 net operating loss for 1958 which shall be used as carrybacks to 1955, 1956, and 1957 and as carryovers to 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, and 1963 are computed as follows: 


(1) *Carryback to 1955.* The carryback to this year is $150,000, that is, the amount of the net operating loss. 


(2) *Carryback to 1956.* The carryback to this year is $150,000, computed as follows:


(3) *Carryback to 1957.* The carryback to this year is $150,000, computed as follows:


(4) *Carryover to 1959.* The carryover to this year is $150,000, computed as follows:


(5) *Carryover to 1960.* The carryover to this year is $130,000, computed as follows:


(6) *Carryover to 1961.* The carryover to this year is $95,000, computed as follows:


(7) *Carryover to 1962.* The carryover to this year is $20,000, computed as follows:


(8) *Carryover to 1963.* The carryover to this year is $3,000, computed as follows:


(d) *Determination of net operating loss deduction for each year.* The carryovers and carrybacks computed under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are used as a basis for the computation of the net operating loss deduction in the following manner:
