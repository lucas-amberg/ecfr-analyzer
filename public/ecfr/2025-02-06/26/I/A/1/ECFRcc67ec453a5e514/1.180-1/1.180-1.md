# § 1.180-1   Expenditures by farmers for fertilizer, etc.

(a) *In general.* A taxpayer engaged in the business of farming may elect, for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1959, to treat as deductible expenses those expenditures otherwise chargeable to capital account which are paid or incurred by him during the taxable year for the purchase or acquisition of fertilizer, lime, ground limestone, marl, or other materials to enrich, neutralize, or condition land used in farming, and those expenditures otherwise chargeable to capital account paid or incurred for the application of such items and materials to such land. No election is required to be made for those expenditures which are not capital in nature. Section 180, § 1.180-2, and this section are not applicable to those expenses which are deductible under section 162 and the regulations thereunder or which are subject to the method described in section 175 and the regulations thereunder. 


(b) *Land used in farming.* For purposes of section 180(a) and of paragraph (a) of this section, the term *land used in farming* means land used (before or simultaneously with the expenditures described in such section and such paragraph) by the taxpayer or his tenant for the production of crops, fruits, or other agricultural products or for the sustenance of livestock. See section 180(b). Expenditures for the initial preparation of land never previously used for farming purposes by the taxpayer or his tenant (although chargeable to capital account) are not subject to the election. The principles stated in §§ 1.175-3 and 1.175-4 are equally applicable under this section in determining whether the taxpayer is engaged in the business of farming and whether the land is used in farming.
