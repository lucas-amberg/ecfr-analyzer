# § 1.181-2   Election to deduct production costs.

(a) *Election*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, an owner may make an election under section 181 to deduct production costs of a production only if that owner has not deducted in a previous taxable year any production costs for that production under any provision of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) other than section 181.


(2) *Exception.* An owner may make an election under section 181 despite prior deductions under any other provision of the Code for amortization of the costs of acquiring or developing screenplays, scripts, story outlines, motion picture production rights to books and plays, and other similar properties for purposes of potential future development or production of a production, if such costs were paid or incurred before the first taxable year for which an election may be made under § 1.181-2(b) and are included in aggregate production costs.


(b) *Time of making election*—(1) *In general.* The election to deduct production costs for a production under section 181 must be made by the due date (including any extension) for filing the owner's Federal income tax return for the first taxable year in which:


(i) Any aggregate production costs have been paid or incurred;


(ii) The owner reasonably expects (based on all of the facts and circumstances) that the production will be set for production and will, upon completion, be a qualified film or television production; and


(iii) For any pre-amendment production, the owner reasonably expects (based on all of the facts and circumstances) that the aggregate production costs paid or incurred for the pre-amendment production will, at no time, exceed the applicable aggregate production costs limit set forth under § 1.181-1(b)(1)(i) or (b)(2).


(2) *Special rule.* If paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not satisfied until a taxable year subsequent to the taxable year in which any aggregate production costs were first paid or incurred, the owner must make the election for the taxable year in which paragraph (b)(1) of this section is first satisfied, and any production costs paid or incurred prior to the taxable year in which the owner makes the election and not deducted in a prior taxable year are treated as production costs (except costs described in § 1.181-2(a)(2)) that are deductible under § 1.181-1(a)(1)(i) for the taxable year paragraph (b)(1) of this section is first satisfied and the election is made.


(3) *Six-month extension.* See § 301.9100-2 for a six-month extension of time to make the election in certain circumstances.


(c) *Manner of making election*—(1) *In general.* An owner must make the election under section 181 separately for each production. For a production owned by an entity, the election must be made by the entity. For example, if the production is owned by a partnership or S corporation, the partnership or S corporation must make the election.


(2) *Information required*—(i) *Initial election.* For each production to which the election applies, the owner must attach a statement to the owner's Federal income tax return for the taxable year of the election stating that the owner is making an election under section 181 and providing—

(B) The date aggregate production costs were first paid or incurred for the production;

(E) The amount of compensation (as defined in § 1.181-3(c)) paid or incurred for the production during the taxable year (including costs described in § 1.181-2(b)(2));


(F) If the owner expects that the aggregate production costs of the production will be significantly paid or incurred in (or, if applicable, if a significant portion of the total number of days of first-unit principal photography will occur in) one or more of the areas specified in § 1.181-1(b)(2)(i), the identity of the area or areas, the amount of aggregate production costs paid or incurred (or the number of days of first-unit principal photography engaged in) for the applicable activities described in § 1.181-1(b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), or (b)(2)(iv), as applicable, that took place within such areas (including costs described in §§ 1.181-1(a)(3)(v) and 1.181-2(b)(2)), and the aggregate production costs paid or incurred (or the total number of days of first-unit principal photography engaged in) for such activities (whether or not they took place in such areas), for the taxable year (including costs described in §§ 1.181-1(a)(3)(v) and 1.181-2(b)(2));

(ii) *Subsequent taxable years.* If the owner pays or incurs additional production costs in any taxable year subsequent to the taxable year for which production costs are first deducted under section 181, the owner must attach a statement to its Federal income tax return for that subsequent taxable year providing—

(3) *Deductions by more than one person.* If more than one person will claim deductions under section 181 with respect to the production for the taxable year, each person claiming the deduction (but not the members of an entity who are issued a Schedule K-1 by the entity with respect to their interest in the production) must provide a list of the names and taxpayer identification numbers of all such persons, the dollar amount that each such person will deduct under section 181, and the information required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section for all such persons. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, whether or not multiple persons form a partnership with respect to the production will be determined in accordance with § 301.7701-3 of this chapter.
