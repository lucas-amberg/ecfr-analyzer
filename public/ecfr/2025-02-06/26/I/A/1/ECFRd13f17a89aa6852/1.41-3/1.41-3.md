# § 1.41-3   Base amount for taxable years beginning on or after January 3, 2001.

(a) *New taxpayers.* If, with respect to any credit year, the taxpayer has not been in existence for any previous taxable year, the average annual gross receipts of the taxpayer for the four taxable years preceding the credit year shall be zero. If, with respect to any credit year, the taxpayer has been in existence for at least one previous taxable year, but has not been in existence for four taxable years preceding the taxable year, then the average annual gross receipts of the taxpayer for the four taxable years preceding the credit year shall be the average annual gross receipts for the number of taxable years preceding the credit year for which the taxpayer has been in existence. 


(b) *Special rules for short taxable years*—(1) *Short credit year.* If a credit year is a short taxable year, then the base amount determined under section 41(c)(1) (but not section 41(c)(2)) shall be modified by multiplying that amount by the number of months in the short taxable year and dividing the result by 12. 


(2) *Short taxable year preceding credit year.* If one or more of the four taxable years preceding the credit year is a short taxable year, then the gross receipts for such year are deemed to be equal to the gross receipts actually derived in that year multiplied by 12 and divided by the number of months in that year. 


(3) *Short taxable year in determining fixed-base percentage.* No adjustment shall be made on account of a short taxable year to the computation of a taxpayer's fixed-base percentage. 


(c) *Definition of gross receipts*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of section 41, gross receipts means the total amount, as determined under the taxpayer's method of accounting, derived by the taxpayer from all its activities and from all sources (e.g., revenues derived from the sale of inventory before reduction for cost of goods sold). 


(2) *Amounts excluded.* For purposes of this paragraph (c), gross receipts do not include amounts representing— 


(i) Returns or allowances; 


(ii) Receipts from the sale or exchange of capital assets, as defined in section 1221; 


(iii) Repayments of loans or similar instruments (e.g., a repayment of the principal amount of a loan held by a commercial lender); 


(iv) Receipts from a sale or exchange not in the ordinary course of business, such as the sale of an entire trade or business or the sale of property used in a trade or business as defined under section 1221(2); 


(v) Amounts received with respect to sales tax or other similar state and local taxes if, under the applicable state or local law, the tax is legally imposed on the purchaser of the good or service, and the taxpayer merely collects and remits the tax to the taxing authority; and


(vi) Amounts received by a taxpayer in a taxable year that precedes the first taxable year in which the taxpayer derives more than $25,000 in gross receipts other than investment income. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(vi), investment income is interest or distributions with respect to stock (other than the stock of a 20-percent owned corporation as defined in section 243(c)(2). 


(3) *Foreign corporations.* For purposes of section 41, in the case of a foreign corporation, gross receipts include only gross receipts that are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or other possessions of the United States. See section 864(c) and applicable regulations thereunder for the definition of effectively connected income. 


(d) *Consistency requirement*—(1) *In general.* In computing the credit for increasing research activities for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1989, qualified research expenses and gross receipts taken into account in computing a taxpayer's fixed-base percentage and a taxpayer's base amount must be determined on a basis consistent with the definition of qualified research expenses and gross receipts for the credit year, without regard to the law in effect for the taxable years taken into account in computing the fixed-base percentage or the base amount. This consistency requirement applies even if the period for filing a claim for credit or refund has expired for any taxable year taken into account in computing the fixed-base percentage or the base amount. 


(2) *Illustrations.* The following examples illustrate the application of the consistency rule of paragraph (d)(1) of this section: 


(e) *Effective date.* The rules in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section are applicable for taxable years beginning on or after the date final regulations are published in the _Federal Register._
