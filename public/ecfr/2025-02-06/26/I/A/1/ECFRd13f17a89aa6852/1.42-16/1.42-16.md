# § 1.42-16   Eligible basis reduced by federal grants.

(a) *In general.* If, during any taxable year of the compliance period (described in section 42(i)(1)), a grant is made with respect to any building or the operation thereof and any portion of the grant is funded with federal funds (whether or not includible in gross income), the eligible basis of the building for the taxable year and all succeeding taxable years is reduced by the portion of the grant that is so funded.


(b) *Grants do not include certain rental assistance payments.* A federal rental assistance payment made to a building owner on behalf or in respect of a tenant is not a grant made with respect to a building or its operation if the payment is made pursuant to—


(1) Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f)


(2) A qualifying program of rental assistance administered under section 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g); or


(3) A program or method of rental assistance as the Secretary may designate by publication in the _Federal Register_ or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).


(c) *Qualifying rental assistance program.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, payments are made pursuant to a qualifying rental assistance program administered under section 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 to the extent that the payments—


(1) Are made to a building owner pursuant to a contract with a public housing authority with respect to units the owner has agreed to maintain as public housing units (PH-units) in the building;


(2) Are made with respect to units occupied by public housing tenants, provided that, for this purpose, units may be considered occupied during periods of short term vacancy (not to exceed 60 days); and


(3) Do not exceed the difference between the rents received from a building's PH-unit tenants and a pro rata portion of the building's actual operating costs that are reasonably allocable to the PH-units (based on square footage, number of bedrooms, or similar objective criteria), and provided that, for this purpose, operating costs do not include any development costs of a building (including developer's fees) or the principal or interest of any debt incurred with respect to any part of the building.
