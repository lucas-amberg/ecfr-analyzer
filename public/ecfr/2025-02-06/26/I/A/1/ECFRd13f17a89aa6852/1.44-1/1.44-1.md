# § 1.44-1   Allowance of credit for purchase of new principal residence after March 12, 1975, and before January 1, 1977.

(a) *General rule.* Section 44 provides a credit against the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 in the case of an individual who purchases a new principal residence (as defined in paragraph (a) of § 1.44-5) which is property to which section 44 applies (as provided in § 1.44-2). Subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the credit is in an amount equal to 5 percent of the purchase price (as defined in paragraph (b) of § 1.44-5). 


(b) *Limitations*—(1) *Maximum credit.* The credit allowed under section 44 and this section may not exceed $2,000. 


(2) *Limitation to one residence.* Such credit shall be allowed with respect to only one residence of the taxpayer; the combined purchase prices of more than one new principal residence cannot be aggregated to increase the credit allowed. 


(3) *Married individuals.* In the case of a husband and wife who file a joint return under section 6013, the maximum credit allowed on the joint return is $2,000. In the case of married individuals filing separate returns the maximum credit allowable to each spouse is $1,000. Where a husband and wife do not make equal contributions with respect to the purchase price of the new principal residence, allocation of the credit is to be made in proportion to their respective ownership interests in such residence. For this purpose, tenants by the entirety or joint tenants with right of survivorship are treated as equal owners. 


(4) *Certain other taxpayers.* Where a new principal residence is purchased by two or more taxpayers (other than a husband and wife), the amount of the credit allowed will be allocated among the taxpayers in proportion to their respective ownership interests in such residence, with the limitation that the sum of the credits allowed to all such taxpayers shall not exceed $2,000. For this purpose, joint tenants with right of survivorship are treated as equal owners. For an example of the operation of this provision see *Example (2)* of § 1.44-5(b)(2)(ii). 


(5) *Application with other credits.* The credit allowed by this section shall not exceed the amount of the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code for the taxable year, reduced by the sum of the credits allowable under— 


(i) Section 33 (relating to taxes of foreign countries and possessions of the United States), 


(ii) Section 37 (relating to retirement income), 


(iii) Section 38 (relating to investment in certain depreciable property), 


(iv) Section 40 (relating to expenses of work incentive program), 


(v) Section 41 (relating to contributions to candidates for public office), and 


(vi) Section 42 (relating to personal exemptions).
