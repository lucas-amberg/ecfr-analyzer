(a) *Overview.* This section provides rules and definitions under section 864(c)(8). Paragraph (b) of this section provides the general rule treating gain or loss recognized by a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation from the sale or exchange of a partnership interest as effectively connected gain or effectively connected loss. Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for determining the limitations on the amount of effectively connected gain or effectively connected loss under section 864(c)(8) and paragraph (b) of this section. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules regarding coordination with section 897. Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules regarding certain tiered partnerships. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules regarding U.S. income tax treaties. Paragraph (g) of this section provides definitions. Paragraph (h) of this section provides a rule regarding certain contributions of property to a partnership. Paragraph (i) of this section contains examples illustrating the rules set forth in this section. Paragraph (j) of this section provides the applicability date.


(b) *Gain or loss treated as effectively connected gain or loss*—(1) *In general.* Notwithstanding any other provision of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code, if a foreign transferor owns, directly or indirectly, an interest in a partnership that is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, outside capital gain, outside capital loss, outside ordinary gain, or outside ordinary loss (each as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) recognized by the foreign transferor on the transfer of all (or any portion) of the interest is treated as effectively connected gain or effectively connected loss, subject to the limitations described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, this section does not apply to prevent any portion of the gain or loss that is otherwise treated as effectively connected gain or effectively connected loss under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code other than section 864(c)(8) from being so treated.


(2) *Determination of outside gain and loss*—(i) *In general.* The amount of gain or loss recognized by the foreign transferor in connection with the transfer of its partnership interest is determined under all relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder. See, *e.g.,* §§ 1.741-1(a) and 1.751-1(a)(2). For purposes of this section, the amount of gain or loss that is treated as capital gain or capital loss under sections 741 and 751 is referred to as *outside capital gain* or *outside capital loss,* respectively. The amount of gain or loss that is treated as ordinary gain or ordinary loss under sections 741 and 751 is referred to as *outside ordinary gain* or *outside ordinary loss,* respectively.


(ii) *Nonrecognition provisions.* A foreign transferor's gain or loss recognized in connection with the transfer of its partnership interest does not include gain or loss to the extent that the gain or loss is not recognized by reason of one or more nonrecognition provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.


(3) *Limitations.* For purposes of applying this section, this paragraph (b)(3) limits the amount of gain or loss recognized by a foreign transferor that may be treated as effectively connected gain or effectively connected loss.


(i) *Capital gain limitation.* Outside capital gain recognized by a foreign transferor is treated as effectively connected gain to the extent it does not exceed aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain determined under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.


(ii) *Capital loss limitation.* Outside capital loss recognized by a foreign transferor is treated as effectively connected loss to the extent it does not exceed aggregate deemed sale EC capital loss determined under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.


(iii) *Ordinary gain limitation.* Outside ordinary gain recognized by a foreign transferor is treated as effectively connected gain to the extent it does not exceed aggregate deemed sale EC ordinary gain determined under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.


(iv) *Ordinary loss limitation.* Outside ordinary loss recognized by a foreign transferor is treated as effectively connected loss to the extent it does not exceed aggregate deemed sale EC ordinary loss determined under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.


(c) *Amount treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.* This paragraph (c) describes the steps to be followed in computing the limitations described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.


(1) *Step 1: Determine deemed sale gain and loss.* Determine the amount of gain or loss that the partnership would recognize with respect to each of its assets (other than interests in partnerships described in paragraph (e) of this section) upon a deemed sale of all of the partnership's assets on the date of the transfer of the partnership interest described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section (deemed sale). For this purpose, a deemed sale is treated as a sale by the partnership to an unrelated person of each of its assets (tangible and intangible) in a fully taxable transaction for cash in an amount equal to the fair market value of each asset (taking into account section 7701(g)) immediately before the partner's transfer of the interest in the partnership. For rules concerning the deemed sale of certain partnership interests, see paragraph (e) of this section.


(2) *Step 2: Determine deemed sale EC gain and loss*—(i) *In general*—(A) *Effectively connected determination.* With respect to each asset deemed sold in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, determine the amount of gain or loss from the deemed sale that would be treated as effectively connected gain or effectively connected loss (including by reason of section 897). Gain described in this paragraph (c)(2) is referred to as *deemed sale EC gain,* and loss described in this paragraph (c)(2) is referred to as *deemed sale EC loss.* Section 864 and the regulations thereunder apply for purposes of determining whether deemed sale gain or loss would be treated as effectively connected gain or loss. See paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section for sourcing rules that apply for purposes of determining deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss.


(B) *10-year exception.* For purposes of applying paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section, gain or loss from the deemed sale of an asset (other than a United States real property interest within the meaning of section 897(c)) will not be treated as deemed sale EC gain or deemed sale EC loss if—


(*1*) No income or gain produced by the asset was taxable as income that was effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States by the partnership (or the foreign transferor, a predecessor of the foreign transferor, or a predecessor of the partnership) during the lesser of the ten-year period ending on the date of the transfer or the period for which the partnership (and, if applicable, the foreign transferor, a predecessor of the foreign transferor, and a predecessor of the partnership) held the asset; and


(*2*) The asset has not been used, or held for use, in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States by the partnership (or the foreign transferor, a predecessor of the foreign transferor, or a predecessor of the partnership) during that same period.


(ii) *Sourcing rules for determining deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss*—(A) *In general.* For purposes of applying section 865(e)(2)(A) in connection with the determination of deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss under this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A), except to the extent provided in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(B) through (E) of this section, the deemed sale of an asset will be treated as attributable to an office or other fixed place of business maintained by the partnership in the United States. However, if the partnership does not maintain an office or other fixed place of business in the United States (within the meaning of section 864(c)(5)(A) and § 1.864-7), neither the office attribution described in this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A), nor the rules of paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(B) through (E) of this section, will apply.


(B) *Look-back rule for sale of inventory property.* The deemed sale of inventory property (as defined in section 865(i)(1)) will not be treated as attributable to an office or other fixed place of business maintained by the partnership in the United States to the extent of *foreign source inventory gain or loss.* Foreign source inventory gain or loss is determined by multiplying the deemed sale gain or deemed sale loss attributable to inventory property by the foreign source inventory ratio. The foreign source inventory ratio cannot exceed one. If the amount in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(*1*) of this section is not positive, the foreign source inventory ratio is zero. If the amount in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(*1*) of this section is positive, but the amount in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(*2*) of this section is not positive, the foreign source inventory ratio is one. The foreign source inventory ratio is—


(*1*) The gross income of the partnership from sources without the United States (as determined under sections 865(b) and 865(e)(2)) that was attributable to inventory property sold during the lesser of—


(*i*) The period comprised of the partnership's three taxable years immediately preceding the date of the deemed sale, or


(*ii*) The period beginning on the date the partnership (or any of its predecessors) was formed and ending on the last day of the partnership's taxable year immediately preceding the date of the deemed sale; over


(*2*) The total gross income of the partnership that was attributable to inventory property sold during that same period.


(C) *Look-back rule for intangibles.* The deemed sale of an intangible (as defined in section 865(d)(2), including going concern value) will not be treated as attributable to an office or other fixed place of business maintained by the partnership in the United States to the extent of *foreign source intangible gain or loss.* Foreign source intangible gain or loss is determined by multiplying the deemed sale gain or deemed sale loss from an intangible, without regard to any gain described in section 865(d)(4)(A), by the foreign source intangible ratio. The foreign source intangible ratio cannot exceed one. If the amount in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*1*) of this section is not positive, the foreign source intangible ratio is zero. If the amount in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*1*) of this section is positive, but the amount in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*2*) of this section is not positive, the foreign source inventory ratio is one. The foreign source intangible ratio is—


(*1*) The gross ordinary income (other than from dispositions of depreciable or amortizable property) of the partnership from sources without the United States that was not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, during the lesser of—


(*i*) The period comprised of the partnership's three taxable years immediately preceding the date of the deemed sale, or


(*ii*) The period beginning on the date the partnership (or any of its predecessors) is formed and ending on the last day of the partnership's taxable year immediately preceding the year in which the deemed sale occurs; over


(*2*) The total gross ordinary income (other than from dispositions of depreciable or amortizable property) of the partnership during that period.


(D) *Depreciable personal property*—(*1*) *Depreciation recapture.* The deemed sale of depreciable personal property (as defined in section 865(c)(4)(A)), including from the sale of an amortizable intangible (as defined in section 865(d)(2)), will not be treated as attributable to an office or other fixed place of business maintained by the partnership in the United States to the extent the deemed sale gain would be treated as from sources outside the United States after applying section 865(c)(1) at the time of the deemed sale.


(*2*) *Gain in excess of depreciation or loss with respect to depreciable personal property.* For purposes of this section, if the deemed sale of depreciable personal property (other than an amortizable intangible) results in deemed sale gain in excess of the property's depreciation adjustments (as defined in section 865(c)(4)(B)), or results in deemed sale loss, attribution to an office or other fixed place of business maintained by the partnership in the United States with respect to the excess deemed sale gain, or deemed sale loss, will be determined based on where the property is located: If the property is located outside the United States, the excess deemed sale gain, or the deemed sale loss, will not be treated as attributable to an office or other fixed place of business maintained by the partnership in the United States; if the property is located within the United States, the excess deemed sale gain, or the deemed sale loss, will be treated as attributable to an office or other fixed place of business maintained by the partnership in the United States.


(E) *Material change in circumstances rule.* If a material change in circumstances occurred that causes the applicable rule provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section to provide a sourcing result that is materially different from the sourcing result that would occur if the applicable period described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(*1*) or (c)(2)(ii)(C)(*1*) of this section began on the date on which the material change in circumstance occurred and ended on the last day of the partnership's taxable year immediately preceding the year in which the deemed sale occurs (the *modified look-back period*), the applicable rule provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section may be applied by reference to the modified look-back period. The difference between the sourcing results is determined by comparing the foreign source inventory ratio (as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) or the foreign source intangible ratio (as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section), as applicable, with the foreign source inventory ratio or foreign source intangible ratio, as applicable, if that ratio were determined by reference to the modified look-back period. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E), the sourcing results will not be materially different unless the percentage point difference between the ratios described in the preceding sentence is at least 30 percentage points.


(iii) *Examples.* This paragraph (c)(2)(iii) provides examples that illustrate the rules of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Except as otherwise provided, the following facts apply for purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii). FP is a foreign corporation and a partner in PRS, a partnership that is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States (the U.S. Business) and a business in Country A (the Country A Business). Both businesses purchase inventory property and sell the purchased inventory property to unrelated customers; this is the only income-generating activity carried on by the businesses. PRS maintains an office or fixed place of business within the U.S. (within the meaning of section 864(c)(5)(A) and § 1.864-7) and, for its U.S. business, PRS sells its inventory property through its U.S. office. For the Country A business, PRS sells its inventory property through its Country A office for consumption in Country A; PRS's Country A office materially participates in each sale. The gain or loss from the inventory sold through PRS's Country A office is treated as from sources without the United States and is not effectively connected with PRS's U.S. Business. In year 4, FP sells its entire interest in PRS, thereby triggering the deemed sale described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. In the deemed sale, PRS recognizes $10x of gain on the sale of its inventory property (the only asset PRS holds other than goodwill and going concern value). The 10-year exception provided in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section does not apply.


(A) *Example 1: Determining foreign source inventory gain*—(*1*) *Facts.* Based on PRS's sales records for the three taxable years immediately preceding the date of the deemed sale, PRS's gross income from sources without the United States that is attributable to sales of inventory property is $12x and PRS's total gross income attributable to sales of inventory property during that period is $30x.


(*2*) *Analysis.* To determine foreign source inventory gain or loss described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the $10x deemed sale gain attributable to inventory property is multiplied by PRS's foreign source inventory ratio. PRS's foreign source inventory ratio is PRS's gross income from sources without the United States that are attributable to sales of inventory property within PRS's three taxable years preceding the date of the deemed sale, over PRS's total gross income attributable to sales of inventory property during the same period. Thus, based on PRS's sales records from the three taxable years preceding the date of the deemed sale, the foreign source inventory gain for PRS's inventory is $4x (the $10x deemed sale gain attributable to inventory multiplied by the foreign source inventory ratio of $12x over $30x).


(B) *Example 2: Determining deemed sale EC gain attributable to inventory property under the material change in circumstances rule*—(*1*) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A)(*1*) of this section (the facts of *Example 1* in this paragraph (c)(2)(iii)), except that at the beginning of year 3 (PRS's taxable year immediately preceding the date of the deemed sale), PRS started a new business in Country B (the Country B Business) to take advantage of favorable market prospects for its products in Country B. For the Country B Business, PRS sells its inventory property through its Country B office for consumption in Country B; PRS's Country B office materially participates in each such sale. The gain or loss from the inventory sold through PRS's Country B office is foreign source gain or loss. Also, at the beginning of year 3, PRS substantially reduced its U.S. Business as a result of market factors. As a result of these changes in year 3, 95% of PRS's inventory property is sold in its Country A Business and Country B Business (collectively, the Foreign Businesses) beginning on the date in which these changes occurred; accordingly, 5% of PRS' inventory property is sold in its U.S. Business after these changes. Based on PRS's sales records for the three taxable years preceding the date of the deemed sale, PRS's gross income from sources without the United States that are attributable to sales of inventory property is $15x and PRS's total gross income attributable to sales of inventory property during that period is $30x; for year 3, PRS's gross income from sources without the United States that are attributable to sales of inventory property is $9.5x, and PRS's total gross income attributable to sales of inventory property in Year 3 is $10x.


(*2*) *Analysis.* The material change in circumstances rule described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section applies if due to a material change in circumstances, the sourcing rule provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section provides a sourcing result that is materially different from the sourcing result that would occur if that sourcing rule was applied by reference to the modified look-back period; that is, the period beginning on the date in which a material chance in circumstances occurred and ending on the last day of the PRS's taxable year immediately preceding the date of the deemed sale. For this purpose, the reduction in PRS's U.S. business in year 3, coupled with the creation of the Country B Business in the same year, qualifies as a material change in circumstances. Thus, the modified look-back period consists of year 3; that is, the period starting at the beginning of year 3, the date in which the material change in circumstances occurred, and ending of the last day of year 3, the last day of PRS's taxable year immediately preceding the date of the deemed sale. Based on PRS's sales records for the three taxable years preceding the deemed sale, the foreign source inventory ratio, expressed as a percentage, is 50% ($15x attributable to PRS's gross income from sources without the United States with respect to sales of its inventory property, over $30x attributable to PRS's total gross income with respect to sales of its inventory property). Due to the material change in circumstances, however, 95% of PRS's inventory property is sold in its Foreign Businesses. ($9.5x attributable to PRS's gross income from sources without the United States with respect to sales of its inventory property, over $10x attributable to PRS's total gross income with respect to sales of its inventory property.) Accordingly, if PRS applied the sourcing rule provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section by reference to the modified look-back period, 95% ($9.5x/$10x), or $9.5x, of the gain would be attributable to sales for PRS's Foreign Businesses (gain from sources without the United States), and only 5% ($.5x/$10x), or $0.5x, of the gain would be attributable to sales for PRS's U.S. Business (gain from United States sources). The excess of the foreign source inventory ratio determined by reference to the modified look-back period (expressed as a percentage), over the foreign source inventory ratio (also expressed as a percentage) is 45%; that is 95% (as determined under the modified look-back period) minus 50% (as determined under the foreign source inventory ratio). Accordingly, the sourcing results are materially different because the 45 percentage point difference is greater than the 30 percentage point threshold provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section. Thus, the material change in circumstances rule of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E) of this section applies and the foreign source inventory gain determined under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, determined by reference to the modified look-back period, is $9.5x; that is, the deemed sale gain attributable to inventory property ($10x), multiplied by the foreign source inventory ratio determined by reference to the modified look-back period ($9.5x/$10x).


(3) *Step 3: Determine the foreign transferor's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain or deemed sale EC loss*—(i) *In general.* A foreign transferor's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain or deemed sale EC loss with respect to each asset is the amount of the deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section that would have been allocated to the foreign transferor by the partnership under all applicable Internal Revenue Code sections (including section 704) upon the deemed sale described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, taking into account allocations of tax items applying the principles of section 704(c), including any remedial allocations (see § 1.704-3(d)), and any section 743(b) basis adjustments (see § 1.743-1(j)(3)). For this purpose, a foreign transferor's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain or deemed sale EC loss does not include any amount that is excluded from the foreign transferor's gross income or otherwise exempt from U.S. Federal income tax by reason of an applicable provision of the Internal Revenue Code (including, for example, by reason of section 864(b)(2), 872(b), or 883). Similarly, a foreign transferor's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain or deemed sale EC loss does not include any amount to which an exception under section 897 applies, such as section 897(k) or section 897(l), if that amount is not otherwise treated as effectively connected under a provision of the Code. For rules regarding the determination of a foreign transferor's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss under an applicable U.S. income tax treaty, see paragraph (f) of this section.


(ii) *Aggregate deemed sale EC items*—(A) *Ordinary gain or loss.* A foreign transferor's *aggregate deemed sale EC ordinary gain* (if the net aggregate of the foreign transferor's distributive share of the deemed sale EC ordinary gain and loss is a gain) or *aggregate deemed sale EC ordinary loss* (if the net aggregate of the foreign transferor's distributive share of the deemed sale EC ordinary gain and loss is a loss) is determined by taking into account—


(*1*) The portion of the foreign transferor's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss that is attributable to the deemed sale of the partnership's assets that are section 751(a) property; and


(*2*) Deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss from the deemed sale of assets that are section 751(a) property that would be allocated to the foreign transferor with respect to interests in partnerships that are engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section upon the deemed asset sales described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.


(B) *Capital gain or loss.* A foreign transferor's *aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain* (if the net aggregate of the foreign transferor's distributive share of the deemed sale EC capital gain and loss is a gain) or *aggregate deemed sale EC capital loss* (if the net aggregate of the foreign transferor's distributive share of the deemed sale EC capital gain and loss is a loss) is determined by taking into account—


(*1*) The portion of the foreign transferor's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss that is attributable to the deemed sale of assets that are not section 751(a) property; and


(*2*) Deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss from the sale of assets that are not section 751(a) property and that would be allocated to the foreign transferor with respect to all interests in partnerships that are engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section upon the deemed asset sales described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.


(iii) *Partial transfers.* If a foreign transferor transfers less than all of its interest in a partnership, then for purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the foreign transferor's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss is determined by reference to the amount of deemed sale EC gain or deemed sale EC loss determined under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section that is attributable to the portion of the foreign transferor's partnership interest that was transferred.


(d) *Coordination with section 897.* If a foreign transferor transfers an interest in a partnership in a transfer that is subject to section 864(c)(8) and the partnership owns one or more United States real property interests (as defined in section 897(c)), then the foreign transferor determines its effectively connected gain and effectively connected loss under this section, and not pursuant to section 897(g). Accordingly, with respect to a transfer that is subject to section 864(c)(8), section 864(c)(8)(C) does not reduce the amount of gain or loss treated as effectively connected gain or loss under this section. For rules regarding a transfer not subject to section 864(c)(8) of an interest in a partnership that owns one or more United States real property interests, see section 897(g) and the regulations thereunder. If a foreign transferor transfers an interest in a partnership in the manner described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the transfer is treated as not subject to section 864(c)(8) to the extent of the gain or loss that is not recognized; instead, if the partnership owns one or more United States real property interests at the time of transfer, the rules of section 897(g) and the regulations thereunder apply to the unrecognized gain or loss.


(e) *Tiered partnerships*—(1) *Transfers of upper-tier partnerships.* Assets sold in a deemed sale described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section do not include interests in partnerships that are engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States or interests in partnerships that hold, directly or indirectly, partnerships that are engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. Rather, if a foreign transferor transfers an interest in a partnership (upper-tier partnership) that owns, directly or indirectly, an interest in one or more partnerships that are engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, then—


(i) Beginning with the lowest-tier partnership that is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States in a chain of partnerships and going up the chain, each partnership that is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States is treated as selling its assets in a deemed sale in accordance with the principles of paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and


(ii) Each partnership must determine its deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss in accordance with the principles of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and determine the distributive share of deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss for each partner that is either a partnership (in which the foreign transferor is a direct or indirect partner) or a foreign transferor, in accordance with the principles of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.


(2) *Transfers by upper-tier partnerships.* If a foreign transferor is a direct or indirect partner in an upper-tier partnership and the upper-tier partnership transfers an interest in a partnership that is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States (including a partnership held indirectly through one or more partnerships), then the principles of this section (including paragraph (e)(1) of this section) apply with respect to the gain or loss on the transfer that is allocated to the foreign transferor by the upper-tier partnership.


(3) *Coordination with section 897.* For purposes of this paragraph (e), a lower-tier partnership that holds one or more United States real property interests is treated as engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.


(f) *Treaty coordination.* This paragraph (f) describes how paragraph (c)(3) of this section applies in the case of a transfer of an interest in a partnership by a foreign transferor that is eligible for benefits under an applicable U.S. income tax treaty. As a general matter, a foreign transferor must satisfy the requirements of the limitation on benefits article, if any, in the treaty between the jurisdiction in which the transferor is resident and the United States to be eligible for treaty benefits. In the case of a foreign transferor that is entitled to treaty benefits, in determining the foreign transferor's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss, gain or loss derived by the foreign transferor attributable to assets deemed sold that would be exempt from tax under an applicable U.S. income tax treaty if disposed of by the partnership are not taken into account under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. In general, gain or loss on the alienation of a partnership interest will be treated as effectively connected gain or loss under section 864(c)(8) to the extent that the gain or loss is either attributable to assets forming part of a U.S. permanent establishment or fixed place of business, or taxable under a provision governing the disposition of United States real property interests. Gain or loss from the alienation of a partnership interest will be considered gain or loss attributable to the alienation of assets forming part of a permanent establishment or fixed place of business in the United States to the extent the assets deemed sold under section 864(c)(8) form a part of the U.S. permanent establishment or fixed place of business of the partnership. If, however, after applying treaty benefits in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the only gains or losses that would be taken into account are gains or losses attributable to United States real property interests, the foreign transferor determines its effectively connected gain and effectively connected loss pursuant to section 897 and not under this section.


(g) *Definitions.* The following definitions apply for purposes of this section.


(1) *Effectively connected gain.* The term *effectively connected gain* means gain that is treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.


(2) *Effectively connected loss.* The term *effectively connected loss* means loss treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.


(3) *Foreign transferor.* The term *foreign transferor* means a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation.


(4) *Section 751(a) property.* The term *section 751(a) property* means unrealized receivables described in section 751(c) and inventory items described in section 751(d).


(5) *Transfer.* The term *transfer* means a sale, exchange, or other disposition, and includes a distribution from a partnership to a partner to the extent that gain or loss is recognized on the distribution, as well as a transfer treated as a sale or exchange under section 707(a)(2)(B).


(h) *Anti-stuffing rule.* If a foreign transferor (or a person that is related to a foreign transferor within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)) transfers property (including another partnership interest) to a partnership in a transaction with a principal purpose of reducing the amount of gain treated as effectively connected gain, or increasing the amount of loss treated as effectively connected loss, under section 864(c)(8) or section 897, the transfer is disregarded for purposes of section 864(c)(8) or section 897, as appropriate.


(i) *Examples.* This paragraph (i) provides examples that illustrate the rules of this section. Except as otherwise provided, the following facts are presumed for purposes of this paragraph (i). FP is a foreign corporation. USP is a domestic corporation. PRS is a partnership that was formed on January 1, 2018, when FP and USP each contributed $100x in cash. PRS has made no distributions and received no contributions other than those described in the preceding sentence. FP's adjusted basis in its interest in PRS is $100x. X is a foreign corporation that is unrelated to FP, USP, or PRS. Upon the formation of PRS, FP and USP entered into an agreement providing that all income, gain, loss, and deduction of PRS will be allocated equally between FP and USP. PRS is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States (the U.S. Business) and an unrelated business in Country A (the Country A Business). In a deemed sale described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, gain or loss on assets of the U.S. Business would be treated as effectively connected gain or effectively connected loss, and gain or loss on assets of the Country A Business would not be so treated (including by reason of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section). PRS has no liabilities.


(1) *Example 1. Deemed sale limitation*—(i) *Facts.* On January 1, 2019, FP sells its entire interest in PRS to X for $105x. FP does not qualify for the benefits of an income tax treaty between the United States and another country. Immediately before the sale, PRS's balance sheet appears as follows:


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Outside gain or loss.* FP is a foreign transferor (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3) of this section) and transfers (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(5) of this section) its interest in PRS to X. For purposes of this example, for simplicity, PRS is assumed to hold no section 751(a) property and depreciation recapture is assumed to be zero. FP recognizes a $5x capital gain under section 741, which is an outside capital gain within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, FP's $5x capital gain is treated as effectively connected gain to the extent that it does not exceed the limitation described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, which is FP's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain.


(B) *Deemed sale.* FP's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain is determined according to the three-step process set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. First, the amount of gain or loss that PRS would recognize with respect to each of its assets upon a deemed sale described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is a $4x gain with respect to the U.S. Business section 1231 asset and a $6x gain with respect to the Country A Business capital asset. Second, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, PRS's deemed sale EC gain is $4x. Third, under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, FP's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain is $2x (that is, the aggregate of its distributive share of deemed sale EC gain attributable to the deemed sale of assets that are not section 751(a) property, which is 50% of $4x).


(C) *Limitation.* Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the $5x outside capital gain recognized by FP is treated as effectively connected gain to the extent that it does not exceed FP's $2x aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain. Accordingly, FP recognizes $2x of capital gain that is treated as effectively connected gain.


(2) *Example 2. Outside gain limitation*—(i) *Facts.* On January 1, 2019, FP sells its entire interest in PRS to X for $110x. FP does not qualify for the benefits of an income tax treaty between the United States and another country. Immediately before the sale, PRS's balance sheet appears as follows:


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Outside gain or loss.* FP is a foreign transferor (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3) of this section) and transfers (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(5) of this section) its interest in PRS to X. For purposes of this example, for simplicity, PRS is assumed to hold no section 751(a) property and depreciation recapture is assumed to be zero. FP recognizes a $10x capital gain under section 741, which is an outside capital gain within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, FP's $10x capital gain is treated as effectively connected gain to the extent that it does not exceed the limitation described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, which is FP's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain.


(B) *Deemed sale.* FP's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain is determined according to the three-step process set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. First, the amount of gain or loss that PRS would recognize with respect to each of its assets upon a deemed sale described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is a $50x gain with respect to the U.S. Business section 1231 asset and a $30x loss with respect to the Country A Business capital asset. Second, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, PRS's deemed sale EC gain is $50x. Third, under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, FP's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain is $25x (that is, the aggregate of its distributive share of deemed sale EC gain attributable to the deemed sale of assets that are not section 751(a) property, which is 50% of $50x).


(C) *Limitation.* Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the $10x outside capital gain recognized by FP is treated as effectively connected gain to the extent that it does not exceed FP's $25x aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain. Accordingly, FP recognizes $10x of capital gain that is treated as effectively connected gain.


(3) *Example 3. Interaction with section 751(a)*—(i) *Facts.* On January 1, 2019, FP sells its entire interest in PRS to X for $95x. FP does not qualify for the benefits of an income tax treaty between the United States and another country. Through both its U.S. Business and its Country A Business, PRS holds inventory items and receivables that are section 751 property (as defined in § 1.751-1(a)). Immediately before the sale, PRS's balance sheet appears as follows:


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Outside gain or loss.* FP is a foreign transferor (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3) of this section) and transfers (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(5) of this section) its interest in PRS to X. Under sections 741 and 751, FP recognizes a $10x ordinary loss and a $5x capital gain. See § 1.751-1(a). Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, FP has outside ordinary loss equal to $10x and outside capital gain equal to $5x. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, FP's outside ordinary loss and outside capital gain are treated as effectively connected loss and effectively connected gain to the extent that each does not exceed the applicable limitation described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. In the case of FP's outside ordinary loss, the applicable limitation is FP's aggregate deemed sale EC ordinary loss. In the case of FP's outside capital gain, the applicable limitation is FP's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain.


(B) *Deemed sale.* FP's aggregate deemed sale EC ordinary loss and aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain are determined according to the three-step process set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.


(*1*) *Step 1.* The amount of gain or loss that PRS would recognize with respect to each of its assets upon a deemed sale described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is as follows:


(*2*) *Step 2.* Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, PRS's deemed sale EC gain and deemed sale EC loss must be determined with respect to each asset. The amounts determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section are as follows:


(*3*) *Step 3.* Under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, FP's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain is $15x (that is, the aggregate of its distributive share of deemed sale EC gain that is attributable to the deemed sale of assets that are not section 751(a) property, which is 50% of $30x) and FP's aggregate deemed sale EC ordinary loss is $0 (that is, the aggregate of its distributive share of deemed sale EC loss that is attributable to the deemed sale of assets that are section 751(a) property).


(C) *Limitation*—(i) *Capital gain.* Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the $5x outside capital gain recognized by FP is treated as effectively connected gain to the extent that it does not exceed FP's $15x aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain. Accordingly, the amount of FP's capital gain that is treated as effectively connected gain is $5x.


(ii) *Ordinary loss.* Under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, the $10x outside ordinary loss recognized by FP is treated as effectively connected loss to the extent that it does not exceed FP's $0 aggregate deemed sale EC ordinary loss. Accordingly, the amount of FP's ordinary loss that is treated as effectively connected loss is $0.


(4) *Example 4. Coordination with income tax treaties*—(i) *Facts*—(A) *Sale of interest.* On January 1, 2019, FP sells its entire interest in PRS to X for $105x. Immediately before the sale, PRS's balance sheet appears as follows:


(B) *Treaty benefits.* FP is a qualified resident of Country A under a U.S. income tax treaty between the United States and Country A that is similar or identical in all material respects to the 2006 U.S. Model Income Tax Convention (the Treaty). PRS is treated as fiscally transparent for purposes of Country A tax law. PRS does not carry on its U.S. Business through a U.S. permanent establishment (PE).


(ii) *Analysis*—(A) *Outside gain or loss.* FP is a foreign transferor (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(3) of this section) and transfers (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(5) of this section) its interest in PRS to X. For purposes of this example, for simplicity, PRS is assumed to hold no section 751(a) property and depreciation recapture is assumed to be zero. FP recognizes a $5x capital gain under section 741, which is an outside capital gain within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, FP's $5x capital gain is treated as effectively connected gain to the extent that it does not exceed the limitation described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, which is FP's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain.


(B) *Deemed sale.* FP's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain is determined according to the three-step process set forth in paragraph (c) of this section by taking into account the treaty coordination rule under paragraph (f) of this section.


(*1*) *Step 1.* The amount of gain or loss that PRS would recognize with respect to each of its assets upon a deemed sale described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is as follows:


(*2*) *Step 2.* Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, PRS's deemed sale EC gain is as follows:


(*3*) *Step 3.* FP is eligible for benefits under the Treaty and derives the gain on the deemed sale of U.S. Business section 1231 asset. Under paragraph (c)(3)(i) and paragraph (f) of this section, because gain from the disposition of the U.S. Business section 1231 asset does not form part of a U.S. PE, the gain is exempt from U.S. tax under the Treaty, and is not taken into account in determining FP's distributive share of deemed sale EC gain under paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and paragraph (f) of this section. Therefore, FP's aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain is $0x under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.


(C) *Limitation.* Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the $5x outside capital gain recognized by FP is not treated as effectively connected gain since all of it would exceed FP's $0x aggregate deemed sale EC capital gain.


(j) *Applicability date.* This section applies to transfers occurring on or after December 26, 2018, and to amounts received on or after December 26, 2018, pursuant to an installment sale (as defined in section 453(b)) occurring on or after November 27, 2017.
